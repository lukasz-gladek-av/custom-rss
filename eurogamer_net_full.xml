            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-2026">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a> is only a matter of months from release, and it now seems an unannounced character may play a key role in the upcoming sequel thanks to a slight slip up by one UK cinema chain.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-description-appears-to-spoil-a-major-unannounced-character">IGN</a>, luxury cinema chain Everyman recently released a description for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, which read thus:</p>
<p>"After defeating Bowser and saving Brooklyn, Mario faces Wario and Bowser Jr.'s evil alliance. Now, alongside his friends and Yoshi, he must stop their plans for world domination."</p>
<p>Yep, that's Wario's name you read there, Nintendo's zig-zag moustachioed and purple dungareed wearing Mario-like caricature of a man, who is instantly recognisable by his bellicose cackle.</p>
<p>Since IGN spotted the cinema listing pointing to Wario's inclusion in the forthcoming film, <a href="https://www.everymancinema.com/film-listing/327878-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/#coming-soon">Everyman</a> has now changed its wording, and there is no mention of Nintendo's antihero. But, who could play Wario if he does indeed show up in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movies-us-release-date-has-been-brought-forward">which is set to debut this April</a>? I guess time will tell…</p>

<p>Along with Mario, Luigi and - perhaps - Wario, the upcoming animated sequel will also see Bowser Junior and Rosalina joining the chaos. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">Rosalina is being voiced by long-time Nintendo fan</a>, Brie Larson.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we were treated to a new trailer, which was introduced by Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>. This trailer saw Mario and Luigi pull up to investigate a "troubled pipe", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-unveils-new-characters-that-do-not-disappoint">while also offering us our first look at Yoshi and Birdo</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/evo-is-getting-five-more-regional-events-and-a-new-world-championship-heres-whats-good-whats-bad-and-what-matters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Evo - the largest fighting game tournament series - <a href="https://evo.gg/news/thenextevolution">announced future plans</a> to expand across the world with five new regional tournaments, a new World Championship, and plans to support local communities in the proximity of these new events.</p>
<p>These five new events will be hosted in China, Brazil, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. The announcement blog post states: "Evo will be building new, sustainable events that highlight our diverse regional communities around the globe. We are making it our mission to ensure fighting game events are available for generations of players."</p>
<p>The new World Championship has an interesting quirk. Not only do we not know its location or how exactly it will function within the Evo ecosystem, it will require players to: "showcase their mastery of multiple fighting games."</p>
<p>Then there's wider local community support, which Evo states will be one of its many focuses moving forward. "Evo will be working together with the community, on the ground level, to elevate it and help it grow," the company wrote in its announcement blog.</p><p>News of this expansion came after RTS, which was recently acquired by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/evo-insists-its-traditions-values-and-identity-will-remain-unchanged-as-saudi-acquisition-completes">took ownership of Nodwin Gaming's share of the Evo brand</a>. Evo, which already encompasses a main event in Las Vegas, Japan, and recently France, will be undergoing intense proliferation starting in 2027. According to its new full-owners, the Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC): "Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged.".</p>
<p>There's a lot to break down here. Evo, while primarily a tournament attracting thousands of fighting game faithfuls to compete across a variety of games, has for years buttoned its coat tight over many different roles for the genre. It is also a convention, where fighting game influencers and creators can meet their fans and sell tailored goods to an impassioned audience. It has also become a stage for new reveals, where developers and publishers reveal new releases and update to the core audience. From an esports perspective, Evo events have been enveloped into the World Tours; core infrastructure, foundational to publisher-owned finales.</p>
<p>We'll start with the good, as there is doubtless plenty here. For one, more events at a time where money and opportunities are tight across not only the competitive gaming space, nor the video game industry, but the world entire is a good thing. More events means more work for those who work in the space. These events being spread across the globe also provide for regions that have been, frankly, underserved. South America via Brazil and Mexico, Africa via Morocco, and Saudi Arabia for the MENA region. Brazil and China make sense from a business perspective, as countries with growing gaming populations. Mexico specifically has deep roots in Western fighting game history, China is a growing force in the space, and even Saudi Arabia (while obviously included for reasons touched on later) is no stranger to competition in this genre with individuals like Abdullatif "Latif" Alhmili.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Suddenly the future of fighting game events is looking awfully crowded. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Evo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This new World Championship is strange, though taking a glass half-full perspective could tie its multi-game format to older arcade culture, where players would dabble across multiple games. This, due to better network quality in fighting games and general industry trends has fallen by the wayside somewhat in recent years, with players sticking to their favourite titles rather than cross-polinating.</p><p>And of course, a pledge to support local communities is an important note, amidst concerns that a sweeping expansion of new Evos may smother community-run events in these regions. With the recent Evo France, many members of that countries' community were celebrated and employed.</p>
<p>Best case scenario, this means more events for more people around the world, and further enrichment of the Evo brand. With that established let's move onto the bad.</p>
<p>Evo's new owners, the QIC, is fully owned by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, and as such is directly tied to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/saudi-arabia">Saudi Arabia has been criticised heavily by Human Rights organisations</a>, and the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/20/man-who-bought-world/rights-abuses-linked-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund">Public Investment Fund itself is tied to such abuses</a>. What the QIC  owns, the country owns, and as such Evo is now fully - inarguably - tied to this country in its attempts to sportswash its reputation. If Evo and esports in general was a highly lucrative venture that raked in profits, one could argue this has been done purely on financial merit. The problem is, it isn't. Most fighting game majors run at a loss, with Evo making thin margins based on sponsors and advertisement. As such, there's an ethical dilemma people must contend with.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Through this lens Evo's spread is not one of typical corporate growth nor gradual sustainable outreach, but an extensive of influence. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-saudi-arabian-takeover-of-fighting-games-biggest-tournament-means-players-and-the-wider-community-have-a-choice-to-make-between-its-culture-and-a-payout">The inclusion of an Evo in Saudi Arabia should be a surprise to very few</a> up-to-date on Evo's history since its acquisition. It has been discussed in Evo media rooms, on the tournament floor, and in the secluded smoking areas at these events for years. I would know, I've been there myself.
</p><p>There's also the question of diluting the brand. Evo (Vegas) has been, and currently still is, the Superbowl of fighting game events. It is the place to be, filling the largest convention centre in America. Evo Japan, a smaller event, has managed to minimally impact this prestige. Evo France, too, may have managed to do the same though, given its recency, its impact is hard to measure. Three events, it seems, is not too much to throw Evo off balance.</p>
<p>But <em>nine?</em> Nine Evo events, plus a World Championship? Even those who care little about Evo's place on some pedestal can surely not disregard that a leap to nine Evo events does make what is currently a big annual occasion plus a few extras into part of the furniture. Another two months, another Evo. Also, the idea of having another "World Championship". Excuse me if I didn't get the memo, but I was under the impression that Evo Vegas <em>was</em> the World Championship?</p>
<p>I'm also concerned about the impact these events will have on their local communities. While the pledge to support locals is great, one must only look at Evo France to see the ramifications of more Evo events at a time when wallets are light among attendees. France's Ultimate Fighting Arena suffered due to its proximity in the calendar to Evo France, and the UK's VsFighting too saw attendees torn on whether to spend their money to attend a grassroots event, or hop on a plane to Europe instead. If there are all these Evo events happening in 2027, make no mistake, will squeeze community-grown events out of the calendar for good. While I have no doubt this reality will tear at the hearts of those at Evo entrenched in the community, I doubt this is of any concern to its new owners.</p>
<p>I would ask fighting game enthusiasts this: if Brazil gains a new Evo starting from 2027, but loses Battle Coliseum (a grassroots major hosted in Sao Paulo), would it actually gain something meaningful? Or would what's actually important fall by the wayside?</p><p>What you should take away from this news is simple. Evolution is, well, evolving as part of Saudi Arabia's growing involvement in the video game industry. It's doing so at speed, perhaps too forcefully, but the board is essentially theirs now to do with whatever they wish. Done with consideration for the community-driven events around it, something the Evo team surely cares about, there's absolutely a possibility that the average enthusiast will benefit greatly. But done hamfistedly, without care, and the repercussions could very well be a deforestation of sorts, a felling of community hubs to make room for geopolitical interests.</p>

            <p>Seamus Blackley, one of the co-creators of the original Xbox, has interpreted Microsoft's recent Xbox leadership shuffle as a sign the business is being "sunsetted". The appointment of Asha Sharma, he thinks, is "as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night".</p>
<p>Blackley, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">speaking to GamesBeat</a>, said what we're witnessing is Microsoft reorganising everything around Copilot - around gen-AI. "Satya Nadella [Microsoft CEO] has made an incredible number of bets and invested an incredible amount of money and credibility in the transform model AI future," Blackley said. "Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren't the core AI business, is being sunsetted. They don't say that, but that's what's happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/article-45824">Blackley left Microsoft in 2002</a>, so he hasn't worked at the company for a long time, but he's sceptical about Microsoft appointing someone with no apparent love of gaming to lead the Gaming division, and questions the ulterior motives of promoting someone from the company's AI division. "Imagine asking somebody if it made sense to put a major motion picture studio into the hands of somebody who didn't like movies, or a major record label into the hands of somebody who'd never seen a live show," he said. "Why would you do that?</p>
<p>"The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI," he added. "That's what you're seeing here. Whether or not you agree with it, whether you agree with AI having the potential to do that, whether AI will be successful, is a separate matter. But that's what we're seeing. That is in no way surprising. It would have been shocking if they had somebody in there in a meaningful role who was passionate about games, passionate about the creator-driven business of games, because it would be in direct conflict with everything else Microsoft is doing."</p>
<blockquote><em>"The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI"</em></blockquote>
<p>Blackley believes Microsoft boss Satya Nadella sees everything as a gen-AI problem now, which is why he's put a former gen-AI person in charge of Xbox. He says Sharma will be trained on gaming, a bit like a large language model, until she can "bring gen-AI into a position to revolutionise games".</p>
<p>"I think younger me would be screaming about this and saying, 'What the hell? Why would you put somebody in charge of a record label who didn't like records?' Looking at it now from my perspective, I probably still feel that way. I do still feel that way, as I've been saying.</p><p>"But at the same time, I understand exactly why it is," Blackley added. "I know that, again, Satya is holding a hammer and everything is a nail. There's a nail with an Xbox logo on it. He's applying the AI person to it. He has to show shareholders and the press and the world that he is all-in on this investment. He has to show them that he believes generative AI is going to fix games and make it profitable. He has to make this move. It doesn't matter what you think about it. I don't think he had any choice."</p>
<p>Whether or not Sharma will convince game-playing people depends on whether she can muster a passion for games, Blackley believes, because one thing he's seen consistently is people coming from outside of gaming and underestimating how difficult making games will be. If she can't muster that genuine enthusiasm then his advice would be to "find a way to leave this job soon". "You shouldn't do it because it's harder than you think," he said.</p>
<p>Asha Sharma was appointed CEO of Microsoft Gaming during a chaotic weekend, during which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> retired from Microsoft after 38 years and Xbox president Sarah Bond suddenly also departed. Scrutiny remains around Sharma's appointment, but a contrary insider take is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">Microsoft is actually pressing reset on Xbox with a genuine desire to turn the division's fortunes around</a>, though it's an argument that will take some convincing to swallow.</p>

            <p>We've known for a while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> is in proper production, with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-1-lead-story-designer-talks-final-cg-cutscene">CD Projekt Red</a> hoping to have it ready to go sooner rather than later. Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">a launch in 2026 has been ruled out</a>. Now, we've potentially learned about an exciting new addition to its roster of devs.</p>
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/clair-obscur-cinematic-animator-joins-the-witcher-4-studio-cd-projekt-red/">VGC</a> has revealed cinematic animator Lucie Hennet, who worked at Sandfall Interactive "from May 2023 to the end of 2024," has now joined the Polish studio as an on-site cinematic animator. Needless to say, having some of the talent that made 2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> possibly make the jump to one of the most anticipated RPGs around is exciting.</p>
<p>At least that's what we're assuming, as we know CDPR's Polish team is hard at work on the fourth Witcher game while the company's North American studios are developing the online multiplayer Witcher spinoff and the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. You can see part of Hennet's behind-the-scenes work on Expedition 33 via <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/4Nevy1">her ArtStation page</a>.</p>
<p>While we wait for a proper in-game look at The Witcher 4 and a tentative release window, there's more movement happening around the IP beyond Project Sirius (the multiplayer spinoff). Fool's Theory has reportedly <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/the-witcher-1-remake-delayed-to-2028/">paused development</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">full-blown remake of The Witcher 1</a> in order to support CDPR with the new instalment, but it's still happening at some point in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, we've also been hearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">rumblings of a new Witcher 3 DLC coming this year</a> and being handled by the same studio, so chances are we may return to the Continent soon.</p>

            <p>2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was a big enough stumble to push Xbox-owned Activision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">reconsider its approach to yearly CoD entries</a> moving forward. Mind you, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/january-2026-us-consumer-spending-on-video-games-was-up">the game is still topping charts</a>, but after a poor critical reception and lukewarm player sentiment, things are being re-examined. Could a standalone, fully-fledged Zombies entry spice things up? Maybe, but it appears that's not on the table... yet.</p>
<p>At least that's what a rare comment posted through <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty">Call of Duty's official X/Twitter account</a> is suggesting (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-aint-it-activision-issues-rare-denial-of-standalone-call-of-duty-zombies-report">IGN</a>):</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The rumor factory working overtime. This ain't it.</p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Social media accounts are typically run by community managers and dedicated social teams, but needless to say, replies to rumours about new entries <em>should</em> have to go through a few approvals first even if they're in jest. That's what makes the quick comment significant. Traditionally, the teams would just ignore and move on when being hit with these claims.</p>
<p>If we're to believe the denial, however, it's not entirely clear what the comment is referring to. The original rumour, kickstarted by alleged insider <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope">TheGhostOfHope</a> and <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/standalone-cod-zombies-game-reportedly-planned-for-next-gen-consoles-3322963/">shared by Dexerto</a>, was actually saying two things: First, that a standalone Zombies title was in dev. Secondly, it claimed there were plans to release it alongside a mainline entry just in time for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year">Microsoft's next Xbox launch</a>, which could even skip 2027 according to recent reports. Perhaps that's the play here: Shutting down the whole conversation without really specifying what they're referring to.</p><p>In any case, I'm of the opinion a standalone Call of Duty Zombies game (perhaps released with a lower price tag on it) would make <em>a ton </em>of sense. It's not uncommon to see longtime fans say they're annoyed by the franchise's current state only to pick up the latest entry to get that Zombies fix only. And in many cases, it's safe to say diehards would happily grab two separate Call of Duty releases that offered different-enough experiences.</p>
<p>For now, however, we're stuck in the loop of wondering about the series' future following a subpar entry that's performing really well regardless. Is Modern Warfare 4 next in line? It's what everyone is assuming, especially after lead developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> openly said "<a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/249223/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-infinity-ward-shuts-down-rumours-about-the-game-being-a-copy-of-mw2">see you in 2026</a>" back in December.</p>

            <p>Following a calmer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">two-week event</a> and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-details-actions-against-exploits-and-glitches-abusers">assault on exploiters</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' next huge content update, Shrouded Sky, is here. A hurricane is engulfing the Rust Belt, and all-new Arc enemies are joining the hunt for human survivors. Good luck out there.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 23rd February, Embark Studios released the introduction to the Shrouded Sky update with an official post and an ominous trailer you can watch below. The short story is the game's generally chill setting (if we don't count the killer robots and treacherous raiders) is being hit with nasty weather, at least for a bit. Today, 24th February, the update has gone live.</p> <figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Shrouded Sky Update | ARC Raiders" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xPaKRV76Tlc?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPaKRV76Tlc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The new Hurricane map condition affects visibility and movement, but new loot caches are being unearthed by the rains and winds, so of course the most daring raiders will be going topside in search of valuables. To make matters worse, two new Arc enemies will roam the Rust Belt moving forward: Fireflies are floating, flame-emitting terrors, and then you'll have to deal with the spherical Comets, which lock on to unsuspecting raiders before exploding. You can imagine why these two are especially scary when visibility is so bad.</p>
<p>The good news is a new free raider deck is available: the Surgeon. The new cosmetic drop comes alongside the ability to (finally) put facial hair on your toon, a feature that somehow wasn't there at launch. A stubble will be available from the get-go to all players, but the full beard is part of the Surgeon deck. Via the store, the stubble beard and thick moustache are available too. I dislike having to grind for proper facial hair, but some folks have it worse IRL, so I won't complain too much.</p>

<p>Other additions include updates to the Dam Battlegrounds map, a new expedition window, new cosmetic bundles, and the Weather Monitoring System project, which has, as usual, its own set of rewards. Also, you'll probably want to check out the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/es/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">full patch notes</a> to keep track of the latest balance pass, fixes, and tweaks before you go on a rant online about your guns feeling like pea shooters.</p>

            <p>A new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>'s head of parental advocacy Dr. Elizabeth Milovidov has touched on the subject of children's safety on the platform, as well how easy it is for children to be exposed to unregulated content. This, according to Milovidov, is a "challenge".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/roblox-kids-safety-head-of-parental-advocacy-interview.html?utm_medium=s1&amp;utm_campaign=vulture&amp;utm_source=bluesky">Speaking to Vulture</a>, Milovidov addressed previous reports of children being exposed to content or people that they shouldn't have access to, and stated that they've heard mixed reports from parents on the dangers of Roblox.</p>
<p>"That's kind of the interesting spot right now is that no matter how good my intentions are, sometimes it's hard to beat back against something negative that goes viral," Milovidov said. "A lot of the reports that have come out have been based on things that happened a few years ago, or where moderation teams caught it but, unfortunately, someone took a screenshot; it went out on Instagram and it's game over for us."</p>
<p>When Vulture asked if Milovidov was saying the problem wasn't real, she responded: "I would say that, in general, Roblox is a platform online. The internet is the internet, right? We have to realize that once we give a child any sort of Wi-Fi access, the world is an open place, right? I remember doing digital parenting sessions and telling parents, 'Look, I'm wearing my Apple Watch. Can you believe I can be bullied on my Apple Watch?' You can be bullied in Google Documents. It's not about banning these things. It's about balance and boundaries. Now that we've introduced them, they've seen the water; we can't just say, 'You're never going to go there.'</p><p>When asked if parents and Roblox and the parents of Roblox players had equal responsibility in protecting these children, Milovidov responded with: "Oh, 1,000 percent. Would I say equal? Oh, Nicole, I think you're going to get me in trouble. I would say the company has even more responsibility. But yes, parents are right in there. I think all the tech companies have a responsibility to ensure that they are doing their utmost to make sure the platform is safe. Do I think Roblox is doing that? Yes, I do. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. Do I think there's more to be done? Yes, I do."</p>
<p>Vulture also raised the issue of ease of access, specifically with how easy it was for children to make new accounts and access unregulated, potentially problematic content. To this, Milovidov said: "We're trying to balance the privacy concerns of users and families with trying to wall things down a little bit more. It's a challenge. When I was writing the parent's guide for Instagram, I was also telling parents about finsta -- fake Instagram accounts. I mean, these things exist in almost every setting. The idea, again, is to talk with your children and say, 'Listen, this is our family. These are our expectations on this. This is why I don't want you to do this.'</p>
<p>"I know parents are busy, and I don't want to put the onus on them, which is why I'm trying to make it as simple as possible. Let your child guide you. Ask them what they're doing on Roblox. Ask them, 'Has anything ever happened that made them feel a little icky?'"</p>
<p>In a 2022 UK report - the <a href="https://assets.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wpuploads/2022/09/cc-digital-childhoods-a-survey-of-children-and-parents.pdf">UK's Digital childhoods: a survey of children and parents report</a> -  the Children's commissioner for England found among other things that "50 percent of children who saw harmful content reported it, older children and girls are less likely to report harmful content. 40 percent of children who didn't report harmful content told us they didn't report because they felt there was no point in doing so, while only 15 percent felt that the content didn't need to be reported."</p><p>Roblox is currently being sued by a variety of entities on the grounds of children's safety. Only last week, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/los-angeles-county-sues-roblox-rcna259891">Los Angeles county sued Roblox</a>, alleging it made it easy for adults to target children. <a href="https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/roblox-sex-abuse-lawsuit.html">Many families are also suing Roblox over similar grounds</a>, these include <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/roblox-class-action-lawsuit-sent-to-arbitration-in-kids-data-privacy-case/">class action lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/local/georgia-attorney-general-investigates-roblox-over-child-exploitation-concerns">a grooming lawsuit in Georgia</a>, and <a href="https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/2025/09/03/accused-assault-dickinson-county-girl-brings-lawsuit-towards-roblox/">one from Dickinson Country, Michigan</a> in which its alleged that an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted on the platform.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The surprising appointment of Microsoft's CoreAI president Asha Sharma as head of Microsoft Gaming at the weekend - in conjunction with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer retiring and former Xbox president Sarah Bond suddenly departing</a> - may actually be a genuine attempt by the company to turn Xbox's fortunes around. This slightly different read on the events of the past few days comes from The Verge, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">a report compiled by long-time Microsoft reporter Tom Warren</a> who spoke to "multiple" sources it sounds like were inside the company itself.</p>
<p>The Verge heard that Spencer's retirement had been a long time coming and was largely expected by staff. But Bond's more surprising departure - for she had been the obvious replacement-in-waiting for Spencer - came about as the result of her big 'Xbox Anywhere' push not working out. Her idea was to move Xbox away from a single console and spread the brand across multiple devices including mobile. This divided focus led to continued drops in hardware revenue, and core parts of the vision - such as a promised Xbox mobile gaming store - still haven't appeared long after they were supposed to.</p>
<p>Internally this Xbox Anywhere plan apparently "offended many Xbox employees", The Verge reported, and Bond herself is described as "tough to work with". She's praised by employees for striking deals with companies - apparently she was "crucial" in completing the $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal - but she was also allegedly ruthless if you didn't stick to her vision. "You were out," The Verge wrote. "Most of the current and former Xbox employees I've spoken to in recent days are relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft."</p>
<p>It's against that backdrop Asha Sharma was brought in, someone who seems ill-fitted to the role of CEO of Microsoft Gaming because she doesn't have gaming experience, either professionally or personally, and because of her worrying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">background in AI - a background she's already had to answer for</a>. But there might actually be a legitimate push here to reboot and refresh the Xbox division.</p><p>If Microsoft were only interested in making Xbox a game publisher going forwards, why not promote Xbox game overseer Matt Booty? And why would Sharma promise a "return of Xbox" and say things like "I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox" if looking only for empty platitudes while Xbox was sunsetted? Those are the kind of claims that will embarrass a person should they be proven insincere. "I get the impression from sources that Microsoft wants a turnaround and is worried about losing Xbox," The Verge wrote, "as it's one of its only remaining successful consumer brands."</p>
<p>Those who know Sharma reportedly say she's "enthusiastic" and "willing to learn" and "very capable of getting teams to execute on a clear vision", and that she's had good success with user acquisition at previous companies - something Xbox could sorely do with. Is this the start of a comeback fight for the Xbox console - a return to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-was-afraid-sony-was-going-to-own-the-living-room-the-big-xbox-360-interview">the "challenger brand" mindset Peter Moore instilled so aggressively for Xbox 360</a>? And if it is, what happens to that Xbox Anywhere vision?</p>
<p>Questions abound. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has been the vision holder for Xbox for a long time. He became president of Xbox in 2014 and then CEO of Microsoft Gaming in 2022, and helped drastically revitalise Xbox's image after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-one-developers-have-their-say-on-specs-self-publishing-and-tvtvtv">the disastrous Xbox One reveal</a> and launch. He was the face and figurehead of Xbox, even with Sarah Bond as president, and he instigated things like Xbox Game Pass, which Sharma will have to deal with now.</p>
<p>But there is an opportunity for Sharma to re-establish Xbox when launching new hardware, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">Microsoft has said it's working on</a>, although we have no idea when it intends to release it. There are, however, strong economical challenges faced by hardware manufacturers today, notably those caused by a rush to gen-AI, which is pushing component prices sky high, as well as unpredictable tariffs and a general rise in living costs. As we've been told before, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">the role of the console is changing</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Excitement around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s launch next week seems to finally be a thing, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">this weekend's "server slam" aims to convince extraction shooter enjoyers</a> on the fence. Ahead of it, Bungie has outlined a frankly impressive effort regarding networking and security features that will be implemented from the get-go.</p>
<p>On 23rd February, the Sony-owned developer <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">shared a meaty blog post</a> that dives deep into what players can expect from the game's many layers of security and key network features. Needless to say, all of them are crucial to ensuring a smooth and fair online experience, but it's often that shooters targeting a competitive crowd don't launch in a robust-enough state.</p>
<p>First, Bungie has made Marathon's dedicated servers "fully authoritative on key combat and looting actions," meaning any "correction" of suspicious behaviour won't impact other players and their experience. It's combined with "client-side prediction and rewind" to ensure actions feel immediate. Moreover, it's promised that servers "carefully track each bullet to its target even with high packet loss." Consistent hit registration at launch in an online shooter? Imagine that.</p>
<p>When it comes to wall hacks and other cheats that might reveal the position of key items and players, a Fog of War system limits the regions of a map that individual player clients have knowledge of. "It also helps keep your position hidden from other players' clients." This isn't enough to guarantee full protection from hacks alone, but it's part of the game's arsenal to combat cheaters. On top of that, the security stack was rebuilt "from the ground up" for this game, and that will work alongside the familiar BattlEye solution.</p><p>There's also the matter of one's Internet connection going down mid-run. Each online game handles such events differently. In the case of Marathon, "you can reconnect and continue playing the run" like in other match-based shooters. "If connection recovery fails due to an issue with Bungie's server or network infrastructure, we will attempt to return the starting gear to all impacted players."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps the biggest shocker comes near the end of the list of features, where Bungie states "anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever." Yeah, no second chances. So, make sure you're not running anything suspicious while playing it.</p>
<p>In any case, the veteran online shooter developer, admits that "product security is never fully solved" and says it'll continue to invest in systems and infrastructure for as long as the game stays alive.</p>
<p>As an extra, we now also have confirmation Xbox players will automatically get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">exclusive gun charms</a> when the game releases on 5th March:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Marathon players on Xbox Series X|S will automatically receive the exclusive Emerald Clutch Weapon Charm and Emerald Catch Weapon Charm when Marathon releases on March 5. <a href="https://t.co/lOpdNfle71">pic.twitter.com/lOpdNfle71</a></p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2026099758838816820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

            <p>There are nearly as many people playing Valve's unreleased and invite-only game Deadlock on Steam as there  are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">people playing the resurgent Overwatch</a>. Deadlock was actually the sixth most played game on Steam in January in the US, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcdhiexi62r">according to stat-tracking company Circana</a>. It's an indication, if such an indication was needed, that Valve's next multiplayer game is shaping up to be something big.</p>
<p>Deadlock is a team-based hero shooter, hence the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> comparison, but it's also a MOBA. It's a mash of Valve's other games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, really. You pick a kind of 1930s gangster-inspired fantasy hero, then you set about earning cash while killing computer-controlled characters in 'lanes' so you can buy upgrades and power yourself up, and overwhelm the opposing team of players.</p>
<p>Deadlock was softly launched a while ago, in the autumn of 2024, and being Valve's next game, naturally had a lot of interest. But player numbers dropped off until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-major-update-new-characters-patrons">in January this year, a large Old Gods, New Blood update was released</a>. This brought six new characters to the game along with a new faster game mode, and overhauled a large part of the overall experience.</p>
<p>The effect of the update was dramatic, propelling concurrent player numbers from a highpoint of around 30,000 at the start of the year, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a>, to a peak of 125,000 concurrents 24 hours ago. Overwatch, by comparison, has a current peak Steam playerbase of 134,000.</p>

<p>Deadlock's numbers are all the more remarkable because you can't freely access the game. You need someone currently playing to invite you which, granted, is fairly easily done - plenty of streamers and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NyPdE6mL9s">Deadlock-specialising creators are handing codes out</a> - but it isn't open access. It's also not being advertised or pushed by Valve in any way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">The Deadlock Steam page</a> doesn't have much information on it at all. Yet, people are flocking to it.</p><p>In many ways, it's not surprising. Valve's pedigree is unquestionable, with Team Fortress 2 arguably creating the hero shooter - a formula Blizzard borrowed and honed for Overwatch - and Dota 2 being one of the most popular MOBAs (and games full stop) in the world today. Dota 2's current peak concurrent player base is 830,000, which is staggering. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">the second most played game on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Deadlock currently has no release date, nor is there any word when it will be available openly to test and play.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/">GOG</a> remains the one digital distribution platform that seemingly cares about proper video game preservation. This isn't free PR or a generous read of what it's been stating since it was born; facts and numerous endeavours to save old games from being lost to time are enough to be certain the folks at the top aren't messing around.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">CD Projekt co-founder Michał Kiciński acquired the entirety of the platform</a>, effectively taking it away from the famous game maker's partial control. Since then, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">mission statement</a> has only become louder: People want to <em>truly </em>own their games even when they're in digital format, and the works of the past, no matter their popularity, need to survive in their original forms too. GOG has even declared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-faces-difficult-questions-about-generative-ai-use">it won't shy away from taking advantage of recent AI advancements</a> in conjunction with "human judgment" if they can be safely used to "advance" its crusade.</p>
<p>Now, following New Blood CEO Dave Oshry's praise for the platform <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19699-new-blood-interactive-dave-oshry-2026-interview-dungeons-of-dusk-rpg-steam-epic-games-store-switch-2">during an interview for RPG Site</a>, GOG's X/Twitter account has once again posted a loud call to action:</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>

<p>"Game preservation only works if people care" is a true statement which no one should be able to argue against. No matter how much we collectively say we care about saving the old games from oblivion and true digital ownership, few things (if any) will change if we continue to grab remasters and remakes while ignoring original releases made readily available, or if we refuse to grab PC games which aren't on Steam.</p><p>Even Oshry admitted that, as much as he loves GOG and what it does, Valve's platform is a more pleasant one than GOG Galaxy, so there's room for improvement which can hopefully boost GOG's overall popularity: "I mean, GOG is great. I love their preservation efforts and everything they're trying to do, but they need enough people to give a shit, or, how long are they even going to be around?"</p>
<p>GOG's official account acknowledged both the praise and criticism, but (smartly) used this opportunity to ask people to "buy DRM-free, vote on the Dreamlist, join <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/patrons">GOG Patrons</a>" and continue to support "the games that shaped us." In recent years, the company has ramped up its efforts to give players more ways to directly engage with what goes on the platform and suggest new additions.</p>
<p>The Patrons initiative is particularly interesting, as it allows the most passionate video game preservation fanatics to directly support GOG's own restoration efforts, which target tune-ups and updates that make old releases (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-1-2-getting-enhanced-pc-re-releases-courtesy-of-gog">like the two original Dino Crisis</a>) work out of the box on modern systems with improved rendering options, controls, cloud saves, and whatnot. At the time of writing, it's 5 euros per month and also grants a number of perks like an exclusive Discord community, voting on preservation priorities, and exclusive BTS content.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> - best known for this work on the Nier and Drakengard series - will be writing a new Evangelion series. This series was announced as part of the 30th Evangelion anniversary celebration over the weekend.</p>
<p>This revelation was spotted on <a href="https://www.evangelion.jp/news/260223-1/">the official Evangelion website</a>, in which a small credits page for the upcoming series was posted. In addition to Taro, the show will be directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and Toru Yatabe, while the music will be composed by longtime Bandai Namco composer Keiichi Okabe.</p>
<p>What this series will be about is currently a mystery, but it comes in the wake of Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time which among other things acted as a firm conclusion to protagonist Shinji Ikari's story. So whether he'll return, or we'll see a drastically different spin on Evangelion, is the big question.</p>
<p>As for Taro's inclusion, his own work is no stranger to Evangelion inspiration and influence. Only a year ago, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-taro-yoko-hyung-tae-kim?utm_source=twitter">he credited Neon Genesis Evangelion as one of the main inspirations for Nier Automata</a>, a game that exploded in popularity following its 2017 release. Nier Automata has also had some big news recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-future-developments-teased-as-it-passes-10m-worldwide-sales">with new developments in the series teased following a recent 10m sales milestone stream</a>.</p><p>So is it a good thing that we're getting more Evangelion? Well, if you like the series then obviously more entries in a series you love is great news. You could, however, argue that Shinji's finale in the latest movie where he steps away from the world of Evangelion was also quite a heavy-handed message to the audience too, urging them to move on from Eva. To have that message, then a new series, may conflict with what was a meaningful conclusion. Here's hoping they don't bring Shinji back, basically.</p>
<p>But let us know what you think? What would you like to see from a new Eva series? Do you even want one?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is almost here, but that hasn't stopped evildoers from dropping lots of spoilers all over the Internet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-issues-resident-evil-requiem-plea-as-leaks-become-a-flood">prompting Capcom to acknowledge the situation</a> ahead of the final weekend before the game's launch. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> director (and famous games industry bad boy) Hideki Kamiya had stronger words for the leakers.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X">his X/Twitter account</a>, the creative commented on the ongoing drama and launched a personal attack against the folks who are ruining other fans' fun before the game hits both the shelves and digital storefronts. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/resident-evil-requiem-leakers-deserve-to-die-ten-thousand-deaths-former-series-director-hideki-kamiya-says-i-pray-they-are-cursed-to-never-play-the-game-again/">GamesRadar+ translated the post</a>, but you can find the original one below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">確かバイオ2の時も終盤の展開を写真週刊誌にスッパ抜かれたよなー…<br>テメエ個人の利己的な満足のために、楽しみにしてるユーザーの気持ちも、力を尽くして制作したクリエイターの気持ちも踏み躙る、全ての人の幸せを破壊する唾棄すべき行為で、万死に値するだろ…二度とゲームを遊べない呪いにかかれ… <a href="https://t.co/iKueo8axFC">https://t.co/iKueo8axFC</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>First, he pointed out RE2 actually went through something similar due to a magazine's poor handling of pre-release leaks: "Towards the end of development on Resident Evil 2, I'm sure there were some leaks that were exposed in a weekly magazine." Mind you, being aware of leaks (and even resharing them) isn't uncommon these days, but things were different back in the day. Still, <em>actual plot spoilers</em>, especially so close to a game's release, are in bad taste in my opinion.</p>
<p>Regardless, the RE Requiem leaks are coming from less official sources and aren't a matter of an outlet slipping up. Thus, cracking down on the leakers is far more difficult. Kamiya said there's almost nothing to gain from leaks that ultimately hurt those who worked hard on the games: "Trampling on the feelings of the people who are looking forward to the game, and the creatives who worked so hard to make it... Destroying everyone's joy, just for these assholes' self-gratification."</p><p>Towards the end of his port, the developer's meaner side reappeared: "Should you commit these contemptible acts, you deserve to die ten thousand deaths," he declared before going with a softer alternative that's just praying "they are cursed to never play the game again."</p>
<p>It must be noted Kamiya is a much friendlier individual in person, but he's well-known for his harsh attitude online, one which, if you ask me, is often justified based on who/what he often has to deal with.</p>

            <p>The vibes are rotten out there if you work anywhere near video games. 2026 is yet another year off to a terrible start when it comes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">project cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">studio closures that often don't make a lick of sense</a>. Despite all this, though, US consumer spending on video games has gone up year-on-year.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-video-game-spending-rose-3-in-january-driven-by-596m-from-subscription-services-us-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, we've gotten a quick look at Circana's latest data on console and PC content spending during January 2026. The year-on-year rise was of 3% (getting it to $4.3 billion by last month). "This growth was driven by a 23% increase in non-mobile subscription services, generating $596 million in revenue." We'd been hearing for a while that, even after price increases across the board, premium subscription services were driving a lot of growth these days, and the data continues to back those assessments up.</p>
<p>"Hardware spend reached $248 million, up 16% compared to January 2025" despite PS5 (down 17%), Xbox Series X/S (down 27%), and Nintendo Switch (down 79%) all seeing substantial year-on-year declines. It's all explained by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s strong launch period and hold despite a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">slower-than-desirable Christmas season</a>. PS5 continued to be leading in the US market, though.</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking (at least to disgruntled Call of Duty fans and outsiders) is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> has been topping the charts during the January 2026 period. Its initial launch was well below Microsoft and Xbox's high expectations, but we're talking about CoD here, and the IP continues to be <em>the</em> rival to beat in the FPS space. It was followed by NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and Minecraft. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6</a> dropped from No. 3 to No. 5" but continues to perform strongly after its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch">killer launch</a> back in October.</p><p>Other highlights include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> sneaking into the Top 10 (from way down at No. 255!) after the release of its fantastic Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S ports. Shocking few gamers, "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> just made it into the Top 20, rising from No.68 after the second season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunner-teases-ron-perlman-role-in-future-seasons">Prime Video's adaptation</a>." Chances are the modern RPG classic will get another boost after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">Switch 2 port</a> arrives tomorrow, 24th February.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's new gaming CEO Asha Sharma has responded to concerns surrounding her background in AI, as well as her lack of previous gaming-related roles.</p>
<p>Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following Friday's shock news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>
<p>When word came out that Sharma would be taking over as Xbox's head of gaming, many raised concerns about her background in AI (Sharma was previously Microsoft's president of CoreAI). However, Sharma has now seeked to calm these concerns, stating to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a> she has "no tolerance" for what she classifies as "bad" AI.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be," Sharma told the publication, stating that industry needs new "growth engines". That said, the new Xbox head added "great stories are created by humans", and not by machines.</p><p>As for her lack of professional roles within the gaming sector specifically, on the announcement of her new position Sharma made "three commitments" to the Xbox community: "Great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". She has since affirmed that she wants Xbox to tell stories that make people "feel something" when they play, complete with "deep emotional resonance" and a "distinct point of view". Sharma cited Campo Santo's 2016 first-person mystery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as a game that had this kind of impact on her.</p>
<p>Sharma admitted she had "a lot to learn" in her new role within the gaming industry, however she is committed to "being grounded in what the community is telling" Xbox. "I'm coming into gaming as a platform builder," she said, with her goal to "earn the right to be trusted by players and developers". She will do this by demonstrating "consistency" over time, Sharma added.</p>
<p>We can expect to hear more about what Xbox has in store next month, during the annual GDC conference, Sharma said, before teasing some bigger announcements to come during an Xbox Games Showcase this spring.</p>
<p>For more, over the weekend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-president-sarah-bond-bids-farewell-to-xbox-staff">Sarah Bond shared her farewell to Xbox staff</a>, where said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally".</p>

            <p>Grok, the generative AI chatbot on X (formerly Twitter), reportedly had an update delay because it wasn't a good enough expert on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. This came from its owner Elon Musk, who apparently was dissatisfied with his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8gz8g2qnlo">non-consentual nude creating</a>, formerly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g8r34nxeno">Hitler-praising</a>, tool.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">Business Insider</a>, which published a report into xAI following Musk's shift from head of the US Government's Department of Government Efficiency back to his prior role as CEO at various tech-based companies.</p>
<p>Business Insider wrote: "a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>,' according to people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>Sources also told Business Insider that Musk had requested Grok learning about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> - one of his favourite games - a priority. To achieve this, Musk brought together a group of staff into a "war room", as Business Insider claims he does whenever there's a problem he deems urgent. One of these war room groups was dedicated to getting the impressionable AI chatbot to play perhaps the most toxic game of all time.</p><p>What is the purpose of having an generative AI chatbot play a game for you, who knows? Years ago, before the generative AI boom, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172612-ai-trained-on-3500-years-of-games-finally-beats-humans-at-dota-2/">one program was able to beat Dota 2 players after training on 3,500 hours of gameplay</a>. So it's not like this idea is particularly novel either.</p>
<p>If you're in the UK, your parliament recently <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/65027/grok-ai-generation-and-dissemination-of-sexually-explicit-and-nonconsensual-images-of-women-and-children-on-x">discussed the dissemination of sexually explicit and non-consensual images due to Grok's recent behavior</a>. This may lead to expansions of the Online Safety Act, so that it covers the output of AI chat bots.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unmade-bioshock-movie-had-two-game-endings-says-director">BioShock movie</a> was revived... only be stuck in limbo again. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">Slow progress is being made on a script</a>, however, and like many suspected, it seems that director Francis Lawrence's busy agenda has been the main thing preventing it from happening.</p>
<p>Since Netflix's take on the cursed project <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-bioshock-movie-announcement/">was announced</a> in February 2022, Lawrence has been busy working on two different Hunger Games prequels, The Long Walk, and even the tentative sequels to I Am Legend and Constantine. Now, via <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">Collider</a>, producer Roy Lee has teased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> <em>could</em> be the filmmaker's next big project after he's done with The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping's post-production later this year.</p>
<p>"We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being The Long Walk and the other being The Hunger Games prequel, which comes out this December. We're just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he's going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it," Lee openly admitted during a chat with Collider's Steve Weintraub. Many cinephiles and video game fans figured this could be the case, especially with the I Am Legend and Constantine sequels being far from locked, but it's reassuring to get a proper update from BioShock's producer.</p>
<p>Netflix and rights-holder Take-Two might also be pushing hard to get the ball rolling on the long-in-the-works adaptation pronto, as the fourth game in the series might get a nice boost after former Gears of War and Diablo head <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">Rod Fergusson joined Cloud Chamber</a> last year to rework and fast-track its troubled development. Fergusson is no stranger to coming in hot to fix and finally release troublesome games, and it seems the powers that be are betting on the game being ready in the coming years, which is why the movie needs to get going soon: "I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game," Lee added.</p><p>After last year's creative shakeup at 2K and Cloud Chamber, we also learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive">a remake of the original BioShock was in development</a> and ultimately binned according to reports. That would've been the perfect thing to release alongside a live-action movie, but now all eyes are on the all-new fourth BioShock... even if we don't know anything about its nature yet.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last week gave us the announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-releasing-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-on-switch-consoles-but-youll-have-to-buy-them-as-they-are-skipping-nintendo-switch-online">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen coming to the Switch</a> systems. This would've been celebrated under normal circumstances, but Nintendo and The Pokémon Company chose to skip the Nintendo Switch Online service in favour of a paid re-release of the original games at £16.99 (or $20) each. A silver lining was mention of support for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-home">Pokémon Home</a> service, but now that's up in the air.</p>
<p>From the get-go, the official return of FireRed and LeafGreen to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary felt a bit barebones. With no new content or graphical upgrades to speak of or online play/trading (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">only local wireless</a>), the only thing that was half-justifying putting down the cash many would rather spend on an indie was the Home functionality, which allows players to freely transfer Pokémon between games, even those of different generations.</p>
<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/">pointed out by fans</a> shortly after the announcement, mentions of such a feature have been scrubbed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">eShop listings</a> for both versions of the game. Maybe that simply wasn't meant to be announced before <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/watch-the-new-pokemon-presents-this-pokemon-day-on-february-27-2026">this week's Pokémon Presents stream</a>, or maybe it's only planned to arrive post-launch and the powers that be aren't ready to fully commit yet in case development hiccups happen. As it stands, a potential Pokémon Home integration would be the only new feature being added to the FireRed and LeafGreen ports, so the information could've broken containment earlier than planned.</p>
<p>In any case, it's worth underlining that, at the time of writing, Pokémon Home isn't officially locked for this re-release of the GBA classics, which are priced at £16.99 each and only include a single language per purchase (pick yours carefully if you're biting the bullet). All this hasn't stopped FireRed and LeafGreen from climbing to the top of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html">eShop's charts</a> ahead of their launch on 27th February though.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2 will release in early access on 5th March, 2026.</p>
<p>The hugely-anticipated sequel to the brilliant roguelike deck-building game is set to feature "new cards, characters, events, enemies, environments, and more," with developer Mega Crit teasing, "will you attempt the climb alone... or enlist the aid of your fellow adventurers?"</p>
<p>That's right – while, like its predecessor, Slay the Spire 2 is listed as single-player on Steam, it looks like four-player online co-op will also be available from launch day.</p>

<p>According to the new teaser, players can also expect all-new relics, potions, abilities, and alternate acts – more on those below – when the game finally releases for PC via Steam next month. It's currently the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam, behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, Deadlock, Light no Fire, Resident Evil Requiem, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p><p>Developer Mega Crit had been aiming for an autumn 2025 release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slay-the-spire-2-has-been-delayed-but-it-wasnt-silksongs-fault-promise">but pushed it back to an unspecified Thursday in March 2026</a>, insisting at the time that "there's no single dramatic reason [for the delay]. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards".</p>
<p>I'm delighted to report that Slay the Spire 2 looks a lot like Slay the Spire 1  – which is a good thing – but upon closer inspection has some notable differences. As we summarised at the time, a lot of effort has gone into improving the visual presentation of the game, including 3D models in 2D environments, and a great deal more content stuffed in.</p>
<p>There are also alternate acts that allow you to choose different "a" and "b" variations of acts when you replay the game to help ease rerun repetition. Each alteration is said to have "radically" different environments, enemies, events, and bosses.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has shuttered another western studio: TiMi Montréal.</p>
<p>TiMi – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-assassins-creed-creative-director-now-at-tencent">which was headed up by former Assassin's Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail</a> after he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-creative-director-ashraf-ismail-fired-from-ubisoft">let go from Ubisoft</a> amid a flurry of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">high-profile departures</a> in 2020 – seemingly closed on Friday, 20th February.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> – which says sources had warned that a "shutdown was imminent" – a senior gameplay programmer wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">LinkedIn</a> that though the team "had been aware this was coming for some time, it doesn't make the reality any easier".</p>
<p>A senior designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430638121714659328?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7430638121714659328%2C7430644929057415169%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287430644929057415169%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7430638121714659328%29">added</a>: "This team was exceptional not just in talent, but also in camaraderie. It’s one of those experiences that sticks with you for a very long time, and I feel privileged to have been part of it".</p><p>The five-year-old studio had been committed to creating "AAA open-world multi-platform games" but was chiefly working on titles it had inherited from Jade Studio, TiMi's name before 2020, and mobile spin-offs, including Pokémon Unite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> (which is different from the mobile Warzone game that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-will-shut-down">shutting down in April</a>).</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/timistudiogroup/">LinkedIn</a> profile, TiMi Group in its entirety employs between 5000 and 10,000 people.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this story inadverently classed TiMi as a NetEase studio, not Tencent. We've now updated the story - apologies for any confusion.</em></p>

            <p>Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC) has now completed its acquisition of the Evolution Championship Series – Evo, as it's more commonly known – and insists that "Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged" under its new parent company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">Fighting game players were up in arms when news broke last year that RTS</a> – a gaming talent agency and owner of the Evo tournament series – would be acquired by the Saudi Arabian mega city project, Qiddiya.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer reported at the time the news broke, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">the response online from fighting game community members was largely one of disappointment</a>, as various fans of the genre came out to express sadness at the new owner – which is a subsidiary of Mohammed bin Salman's Public Investment Fund (PIF) – and emphasised the importance of supporting grassroots community-run events given Saudi Arabia has been criticised by Human Rights organisations for its prolific use of slavery, the death penalty, and more.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2026-business-update">statement</a> posted to Evo's website now the acquisition has completed, the organisation said it will "stage major international events" in Tokyo, Las Vegas, and Nice, France, later this year, "as it continues its role as a global platform for competitive excellence, cultural exchange, and community connection".</p><p>"Under RTS ownership, Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged, with a continued focus on serving players, fans, and publishers at every level of the industry," the statement said. "Key leadership will remain in place, ensuring long-term stability, including Stuart Saw in his role as Chief Executive Officer at RTS."</p>
<p>Qiddiya's chief strategy officer, Muhannad Aldawood, added: "Evo is a global gaming institution, built on community, competition, and creativity. Through RTS and Qiddiya City, we are committed to supporting Evo's long-term growth in a way that respects its heritage and strengthens its role within the global Fighting Game Community. This is about investing in the future of play, and safeguarding what makes Evo special."</p>
<p>Numerous fans are not convinced, however.</p>
<p>"Support your locals any way you can, folks. I was already on my way out of Evo because I don’t like how corporate the scene has become," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1r94pvj/comment/o69vznc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one commenter. "I don’t even want fighting games to be a scene anymore, just play and watch the games you like, give feedback that you care about, and growth will come organically." Another simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1r94pvj/comment/o69zec4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a>: "And this, everybody, is why supporting grassroots locals should still be the priority over pushing big tentpole tournaments."</p>
<p>A number of prolific players and content creators in the fighting game community, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1pq6xzu/sajam_boycotting_all_evo_events/">Sajam</a>, have pledged not to attend Evo this year.</p>

            <p>Nintendo is reportedly issuing refunds for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> upgrade.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as the new release is officially known, released earlier this week. Following similar Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-fans-its-happening-nintendo-a-drops-a-surprise-switch-2-upgrade-for-xenoblade-chronicles-x-with-60fps-and-more">for £4.19/$4.99 USD, players with the Switch 1 version can get 4K and "up to" 60fps support in TV mode</a>, plus 1080p and "up to" 60fps when playing in handheld mode. Theoretically, anyway.</p>

And while some are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1raqtnn/very_important_psa_about_the_switch_2_edition_how/">devising workarounds in an attempt to improve the game</a>, others have gone straight to Nintendo for a refund. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/nintendo_is_refunding_xenoblade_x_upgrade_patch/">And they're getting it.</a></p><p>"Image quality seems sharper, but after a while, the image starts to grow over my perception and just turns bad," explained redditor tamodolo. "Long range textures seem to have [been applied] a convolution filter on it. And the overall image seems to be just FHD being upscales and antialiased with strong filters. Not really a true high resolution game.</p>
<p>"I played the Wii U version in native 4k using Cemu and that version in 4K is incredible! I expected that Nintendo did that for the Switch 2 edition but this is less than any other free update they issued until now."</p>
<p>Tamodolo was so unhappy, in fact, that they wrote to Nintendo requesting a refund.</p>
<p>"I just asked mine saying that the image quality of the upgraded version is worse than the original game (which is true)," they wrote. "They said that they normally don't refund digital games but can do in this case after analysing the problem. (which they did in something like one and a half minute).</p>
<p>"What I wanted to comunicate to Nintendo by doing this: This isn't the Nintendo quality I expected and [received] until now so I'll not pay for something that deliver less quality than a free patch."</p>
<p>They then told other unhappy players to follow suit, and to contact Nintendo via the form on the eShop.</p>
<p>"I [encourage] you all doing this to pass the message to Nintendo that this level of quality for something that is paid isn't acceptable and they need to improve."</p>
<p>"If we continue to ask for refunds, they might actually work on fixing it," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/comment/o6j06u7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">responded</a> one commenter, while another confirmed they too had received a refund, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/comment/o6iwl6s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">writing</a>: "Did the same thing, talked to chat support for like five minutes, and got a refund. Told them pretty much the same thing, the upgrade makes the game look worse (I'm handheld only). No fighting, I just gave them the numbers they asked for and its on its way."</p><p>Eurogamer had good things to say about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">gave it four stars last year</a>, saying that while "not all its additions are for the better... this excavation of Monolith Soft's alien opus remains as fascinating and enthralling as it was a decade ago." Of course, that wasn't reviewed on the Switch 2.</p>

            <p>First it came for our intellectual property, then it came for our workers, and now it's after our Steam Decks!</p>
<p>Generative AI remains, it's fair to say, a hugely controversial technology; but quite aside from the substantial ethical and environmental concerns, AI - and the huge quantities of RAM needed to power it - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">now causing strife for the consumer electronics industry at large</a>. And inevitably, that includes gaming. Unity might be priming its game engine for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-boss-claims-engines-next-generative-ai-update-will-let-users-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-just-by-using-natural-language">whole new era of AI-generated slop</a>, but if things go on, might we eventually run out of things to play that slop <em>on</em>?</p>
<p>Steam Decks are in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">increasingly short supply</a>, Steam Machines are impacted, Sony is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">claimed to be mulling a PS6 delay</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">gaming hardware price hikes</a> are reportedly on the way. That's a lot of bad news, of course, but a PS6 delay? Well, that got us wondering - looming AI-driven disaster aside, would a delayed start to the next console generation really be such a bad thing? Yup, it's Big Question time again, where we gently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/the-big-question">tackle a topical talking point</a> from the week's gaming news before flinging it, grenade like, over to you.</p>

<p>There is, of course, an expectation when it comes to console generations. Traditional wisdom is they last, on average, five years or so before the arrival of something flashier, more exciting, and new. Console generations have felt a little more elastic in recent times, admittedly, especially with the advent of mid-gen models like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. But regardless of tradition, Eurogamer's Ian Higton notes there are very real, practical reasons why an imminent march into a proper new console generation (as ever, Nintendo continues to do its own thing) would be a terrible idea.</p><p>"Listen, I know that everyone gets properly excited when there's the prospect of a new console generation on the horizon," he says. "I've lived through a couple of these moments myself so I understand the buzz, I really do. But if the next generation of consoles brings a price tag that means I can't afford to eat for a couple of months if I buy one, well that kind of ruins the thrill. In fact, as the cost of living continues to increase, along with the cost of games and other forms of modern entertainment, I struggle to see how the majority of the upcoming gaming audience could even begin to consider forking out for PS6 or an Xbox Whatever-the-hell-stupid-name-they-call-it on launch day. Unless they decide to sell a kidney or something."</p>

<p>And quite aside from the cost, there's a sense among many that the current console generation has been a particularly weird one. It took a long, long time for Microsoft and Sony to shift from cross-generational support to fully focus on the new one, and that's left a lingering suspicion among players that the PS5 and Xbox Series X still have plenty of untapped potential. Is the best the current generation can do really just shinier graphics and shorter loading times? Are there really no new experiences waiting to emerge from all that purported power? And apart from the games we've yet to see, what about the games we already have? Almost 20,000 games were released on Steam last year, and even if only a fraction of those came to consoles, that's still a bloody big backlog to get through. Perhaps that in itself is justification for longer console cycles, to give everyone - publishers and developers with games to sell, customers who need time to actually play them - some breathing room.</p>
<p>There's a flip side to all this, of course. And while Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese also believes there are very good reasons not to rush into a new console generation just yet, he suggests there is still, perhaps, such a thing as too long. "We need ends so we can have beginnings again," he says. "We want a glimpse of what's next so we can spend months fantasising about the future, losing ourselves in daydreams of possibilities. It's a periscope moment for gaming where we are forced to suddenly look up and beyond, and lose ourselves in heady proclamations about what's to come."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Closest thing I could find to a "periscope moment", sorry. | <span>Image credit: <cite>FakeFish/Undertow Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But more than offering excitement, "new consoles court the attention of the wider world," Bertie continues. "They propel gaming onto the front pages again and force a reappraisal by mainstream media... How realistic games are now! How sophisticated! And their arrival creates space for newcomers, for newness, as new brands and games and game makers squeeze in and capitalise on people's newfound sense of curiosity, and make a name for themselves. This cyclical nature of consoles, it's a bit like the seasons, in that each one is important. But stretch one of those seasons out too long and we might lose the shape of the thing forever."</p><p>All good points, but might there be some interesting side-effects, should the tech giants' AI arms race continue messing with gaming's future, as many fear? "I do wonder," says Ian, "if the cost of all this new technology could instead kickstart a renaissance in retro gaming. And I'm not talking about the current retro scene, which is already enjoyed by collectors and older gamers as a form of nostalgic entertainment. I'm talking about younger video game fans who've been priced out of the modern day market getting into retro gaming as an alternative to being ripped off. A bit like how hipsters got into VHS tapes and vinyls a while back, but less posey."</p>
<p>"Despite the price that some old Nintendo carts go for," Ian continues, "getting into retro gaming doesn't have to break the bank and in some cases it could even be free! There must be plenty of teenagers out there whose parents have a PS2, or an OG Xbox plus a bunch of games just sitting there in an old Tesco bag in the loft waiting to be discovered. Or how about Xbox 360s? All those kids have to do is climb up and down a ladder then head to their local CEX with twenty quid in hand. With that (for now at least) they could walk out with some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-10-xbox-360-games-that-mattered-the-most">incredible games</a>. Singularity, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a>, Bioshock, the Halos, the old GTAs, the list goes on.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Who needs a new Uncharted when you've got this? | <span>Image credit: <cite>AtariAge</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"So, instead of shelling out mountains of money for a new console that, going by the underwhelming launch of the current console generation, probably won't give us that big of a leap graphically anyway (and will probably have a library that consists purely of shovelware AI shitslop at this rate)," suggests Ian, "why not go <em>back</em> a couple of console generations instead? If you're young, then I have some excellent news: there's so much out there to catch up on! And if you're old, why not go pick up something that passed you by the first time around? Maybe you were a 360 kid so never got to try the PS3's library of awesome games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>, Resistance or Gran Turismo? There's only one upcoming and overpriced generation of new consoles but there are the tens of console generations from the past, so don't let those potential price hikes get you down - just get into retro games instead. Your wallet will thank you and you'll have an absolute blast at the same time!"</p><p>So there you go! It's undeniable that new console generations are <em>exciting</em>, and it's clear, in more practical terms, they breathe new life into the market when interest in the old starts to wane. But at the same time, it's been a funny old generation, and with hardware prices threatening to skyrocket, maybe it <em>is</em> more sensible to squeeze as much as we can out of what we've already got before moving on - and maybe if we wean ourselves away from ever-more-shiny, that'll have knock-on effects elsewhere too. Or have you had enough? Is it time for a retreat into the world of bargain bin classics, blow-powered cartridge fixes, and perhaps even, for those willing to go still further back, POKE commands? That's the Big Question... are you happy to wait for the next generation or are you ready to GO-GO-GO? It's over to you!</p>

            <p>I miss boxing - not that I ever did it. It used to be a kind of combat-sport backbone running through the country. I remember sleeping at a friend's house when Frank Bruno was fighting Mike Tyson in 1989, and us kids were listening to the fight on a radio upstairs while our parents listened to it on a radio downstairs. Their cheers led ours. Boxing matches were big deals, they were moments where everyone seemed to turn around, but where are they now? Lying on the canvas alongside Jake Paul.</p>
<p>Boxing games echoed this. They used to be as predictable for games machines as football games and driving games and tennis games. The first one I properly remember is Super Punch-Out!!, on Super Nintendo, but there's another more obscure boxing game from around that time I remember strongly too: Foes of Ali, on 3DO - a console no one other than my friend down the road seemed to own.</p>
<p>We'd play Foes of Ali relentlessly. It featured all of the fighters Muhammad Ali had famous fights with: Foreman, Frazier, Liston. I can't remember the others. But I do remember I had a fondness for Joe Frazier, so I'd forever be trying to lure whoever I was fighting with onto my left so I could pulverize them with his trademark hook. I remember excitedly telling my dad about this one day and he looked at me in surprise. How did his tweenage son know about the strengths of Joe Frazier? Video games, Dad - they're educational.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>I didn't realise this was one of EA's first boxing titles, so it indirectly led to Fight Night. You learn something every day, huh?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrA5wgW_66k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>But the boxing game that really caught my chin was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fight-night-round-3">Fight Night Round 3</a> on Xbox 360. It arrived at a golden time for the Xbox 360, Microsoft's best console (Bertie!), barely three months after it was released. There's a case for it being a launch title, although Wikipedia tells me it was released on the original Xbox and PlayStation 2 as well, which I don't remember at all. They were the runts of the litter, though, because on Xbox 360, Fight Night Round 3 was effectively a different game. The settings were ramped up to graphical showcase level, boasting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fi-fightnight3-x360">"pore-level detail"</a>, and the UI was dramatically altered. But most significantly of all, on Xbox 360 it had a completely different control method.</p><p>This was one of Fight Night Round 3's major novelties, or intrigue points: you controlled your punches with the thumbsticks. One thumb handled one side's punching and blocking, and the other thumb handled the other. You determined what kind of punch you were throwing by performing a similar movement with the thumbstick. A jab required a short sharp shove, for example, whereas a hook required a semi-circular hooking motion. It was quite intuitive. And it was a startlingly new approach for the time.</p>
<p>Alongside the fancy graphics, the wacky control scheme made Fight Night Round 3 alluringly next-generational. This was the sort of game you'd whip out to show your friends when they came over for tea - that's a sentence I'll never write again - because it was forward-presenting and new. And perhaps partly because it was so bizarre to control that your friends would flounder while you flattened them. Button mashing wasn't possible here because there weren't button-based attacks to bash, though it was possible for a lucky result if a newcomer went berserk with the thumbsticks, which they usually did, and accidentally landed a few solid blows. I wonder how many thumbsticks suffered as a result of this game.</p>

<p>But depleting stamina usually negated this, and the game had long punching animations you'd be vulnerable after committing to, meaning you wouldn't want to swing recklessly. This all led to a real sense of learned skill in the game, and a closer relationship with what you were doing in it. Fight Night Round 3 pulled you closer than other boxing games did. The feeling of trapping someone in the corner and then unleashing a thumb-twirling barrage of hooks and uppercuts was thrillingly tactile and violent. Then you'd land your haymaker and get your cinematic knockout cam replay, and feel a huge rush of gaming satisfaction.</p><p>What really stuck me to Fight Night Round 3 was the Career Mode. This was basically an RPG. You'd customise - in impressive detail - the look and shape of your boxer, then you'd set about training them and fighting your way through lower divisions all the way to the floodlit top. It wasn't all about winning fights, though. There was background progression here whereby you'd hit the gym between fights to do mini-games like weightlifting, heavy bag work, or combo dummy work, to improve your stats. You'd be able to spar to practise your general boxing as well. Then you'd do things like select fight contracts to choose which boxer you'd go up against next, weighing up prize purses, their form, and varying match conditions. There was a lot to do.</p>

<p>I have very fond memories of turning my ridiculous-haired nobody into a ridiculous haired somebody, and watching all that hard work pay off in the shape of better muscles and flashier patterned shorts. I had a pretty good fight record as well, right up until I didn't. I'm fairly sure I got knocked down and then imploded at the distressing sight of a loss on my career record and stopped playing the game. Can I excuse that behaviour by saying I was much younger at the time?</p>
<p>Regardless, I miss it. I miss boxing. Every so often I look around for a game to scratch the itch with, but I never find anything. All I see is UFC. UFC on all of the advertising, UFC dominating combat video games. I respect it but it's never really appealed. It doesn't hold the same historical and hallowed allure for me that boxing does. It's too new, there are too many variables, too many things I don't understand. I want to be taken back to the days of Bruno fighting Tyson and that feeling of a whole nation backing their fighter. I want to be Joe Frazier landing the historic hook that took Ali down.</p>

            <p>Patrick Söderlund – founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> studio, Embark – has been appointed as executive chairman at Nexon to "accelerate global strategy, transform creative direction, and lead the next phase of growth" for its parent company.</p>
<p>Fresh from the success of Arc Raiders, Söderlund will now be working "closely with [Nexon] CEO Junghun Lee and the executive leadership team", setting the "strategic direction" that Lee will then implement.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear if this position comes in addition to Söderlund's already pretty meaty role leading Embark – which is owned by Nexon – or is in place of it, but it appears to be the former.</p>

<p>"Nexon has all the assets to unleash dramatic growth – incredibly talented people, iconic franchises, large and committed player communities, and best-in-class live service capabilities," Söderlund said via a press statement.</p>
<p>"This is an enormous opportunity, but one that will require deep focus and discipline. [Nexon CEO] Junghun and I are aligned on what needs to happen, and I'm ready to get to work."</p>
<p>It's a huge appointment for Nexon, which – although bobbing along just fine with its immensely popular mobile titles like MapleStory – has failed to get a bite of the live-service sector, and chiefly dabbled in casual and mobile gaming until subsidiary Mintrocket released the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> in 2023. It also published Embark Studios' inaugural title, The Finals, that same year, and the middling The First Descendant in 2024.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Arc Raiders continues to impress, nearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">almost 1m concurrent players </a>on PC alone and pushing onwards with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">events</a> and regular updates <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">planned out until April</a>.</p>

            <p>The developers of Mewgenics, the cat breeding indie hit from the creators of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End is Nigh, are "getting a little bit excited" about what's next for the hit roguelike.</p>
<p>Though the team had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">already confirmed that Mewgenics DLC was planned</a> (a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-console-release-for-steams-cat-breeding-roguelike-hit-mewgenics-is-currently-in-the-works">console version is also on the cards</a>), this is the first insight we've had about any additional content since the turn-based strategy game released earlier this month.</p>

<p>"Edmund and I have been discussing and mapping out what we want to do for DLC 1, and I gotta say I'm getting a little bit excited about it," Tyler Glaiel wrote on X/Twitter as the patch notes went live, detailing a raft of QoL changes, bug fixes, and more.</p>
<p>However, when a fan suggested that the duo should "really think about doing some UI touch up", Glaiel warned it wasn't that easy.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We're gonna be pretty careful about stuff like that because a lot of the requests are people not quite understanding the tradeoffs we had to make during dev regarding complexity.

<p>Last week, Mewgenics broke a rather impressive Steam record, welcoming 115,428 concurrent players on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-sets-huge-steam-concurrent-player-record-taking-a-crown-previously-worn-by-hades-2">meaning it now boasts the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you are one of the many already playing Mewgenics on Steam, be sure to check out our guides. Here is one on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-mewgenics-classes-tier-list-how-to-unlock">best Mewgenics classes tier list and how to unlock every class</a> to get you started. As for those aforementioned patch notes? Here you go:</p>
<blockquote><h2>MEWGENICS 1.0.20695</h2>
<ul>
<li>This patch is focused on major bug fixes and "easy" changes that are unlikely to cause secondary issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>QOL Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coin/Food/Item zoomers no longer prevent you from opening the backpack while they're animating</li>
<li>Added "Limit Framerate" to video settings.</li>
<li>"Tall" tiles now go semi-transparent when in tactical view</li>
<li>Fixed item sort order upon returning from an adventure (one of the last changes pre-release was adding sort buttons to the in-combat inventory screen and this broke how they sorted upon returning home)</li>
<li>If playing on steam deck, End Turn (Hotkey) is now bound to "Enter Key" by default instead of nothing. Should allow for some steam input config hacks for those who want to bind it to a back button easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Copy Cat / Learn From Me being able to copy things other than spells in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed Tina3's Mama Maggot and Familiar Korbee not having a portrait</li>
<li>Fixed a certain very late game boss fight's summons running away when the boss died. In this particular case they weren't supposed to run</li>
<li>Fixed a few cases where an ability or passive icon in the UI would not update after being overridden by a new one (ex when using a Forbidden spell while already having 2 disorders)</li>
<li>Fixed a minor odds issue related to how Stimulation affects a parent with a class passive but not a class active</li>
<li>Fixed level spawn order to spawn static objects before familiars (This should fix a few cases where a familiar occupies a space a static object wants to be, causing it to spawn in a different place and sometimes blocking cats or enemies in)</li>
<li>Fixed Eat Rock and Rock Crusher showing a tooltip for Petrify</li>
<li>New idle animation for pet rock and pet boulder and fixed death gib</li>
<li>Fixed the way Interchange interacts with Bonus Move and Bonus Attack</li>
<li>Fixed a case where quitting after losing your last cat to a sacrifice event would cause a crash upon re-loading the save file</li>
<li>Fixed a few flickering pieces in a cutscene</li>
<li>Fixed amoebas being able to drop larger rocks partially off-map</li>
<li>fixed a very late game enemy leaving an invisible corpse</li>
<li>fixed Unscarred+ and Uncapped HP causing infinitely growing HP</li>
<li>lowered the odds of seeing a variant version of one act 3 miniboss</li>
<li>Added "texture_atlas_size" to settings file to allow for some configuration hacks for under-min-spec machines. Default is 4096. Note that lowering this will also require lowering "texture_scale_big" as well so larger textures can fit into the atlas. This will remain settings-file-only, no intent to add this to the options menu</li>
<li>Misc localisation fixes</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <p>Balatro developer LocalThunk has marked the second anniversary of his hit indie roguelike with a heartfelt blog post that ended: "Yes, I'm still working on 1.1."</p>
<p>Balatro was set to receive a 1.1 update last year, but its solo developer, LocalThunk, pushed it back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-update-delayed-as-developer-preserves-hobbyist-approach-to-ensure-this-isnt-the-last-update-the-game-gets">in order to preserve his "hobbyist" approach to game development</a>. Since release, he has been crunching alone on a balance patch and releasing a mobile port, before taking some time out and then beginning 1.1 work.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/bad-grades">blog post entitled Bad Grades</a>, LocalThunk talks about dropping out of his engineering degree – "the idea of spending the rest of my life doing something I didn't care about was enough for me to throw in the towel" – and talked about approaching his academic advisor for help switching to a computer science degree instead (luckily for us).</p>

<p>"The choice was simple. It was hardly a choice at all, really. I loved programming. I wasn’t any good at it, nor was I aware of what may await me after graduation, but in the months since that Intro to Computer Science course I had created a few programs that convinced me this is the thing for me. I want to make things with code," he wrote.</p><p>"The transition into Computer Science was a bit rough, seeing as I’d already missed a couple of weeks of the semester with a full course load. I was not a good student, and to be honest I barely passed some of my required courses."</p>
<p>But this new skill enabled him to make things – a "perlin noise terrain generator", a grid-based heat dissipation simulation" – and a "more granular version of Risk, or a bite-sized version of a grand strategy game like Europa Universalis".</p>
<p>"I worked on that game for over two years. It never had a name, it was never completed, and apart from showing it to a few friends and family, nobody knew it even existed," he added. "But it was exactly what I wanted to make, and the feeling of absolute freedom I had while working on it is the reason why I kept game development as a hobby years later. That project was the template. I found the files for that project and played it for a couple [of] days recently; it was pretty fun."</p>
<p>LocalThunk said he "thinks about that version of myself a lot now", adding, "Even if I could warn myself, I'm not sure what I could have said to prepare for the insanity" of releasing Balatro.</p>
<p>"With all the success, baggage, attention, heartache, fear, stress, and joy that I’ve had since Balatro was created, at least that old version of myself is still there," he concluded. "Last night I stayed up until the early hours of the morning drawing pixel art, writing code, and listening to music in my quiet house. Notebook of ideas open next to me, cup of decaf in hand."</p>
<p>Then, right at the end as a postscript, he added: "Yes, I'm still working on 1.1."</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">shaky start with ratings boards</a>, Balatro has gone on to find phenomenal success. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-completing-balatro-has-developer-better-equipped-to-design-the-next-big-update">LocalThunk has 100 percent completed his own game</a>, which has "equipped" him to better design the next update.</p>

            <p>Former Xbox president Sarah Bond thanked former CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> and congratulated his successor, Asha Sharma, in a letter sent to all staff as news broke that she was leaving after eight years with the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox CEO Phil Spencer announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years yesterday</a> (21st February), amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role, and Xbox president Bond depart the company.</p>
<p>In a message shared via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj/">LinkedIn</a>, Bond said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally". She did not share what those next steps would be.</p>
<p>"I've had the privilege of spending time with [new CEO] Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand," Bond said.</p>
<p>"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I'm excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team."</p>
<p>Bond added: "I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we've helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world."</p>
<p>She closed on thanking Spencer for his "mentorship and friendship over the years", and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for "his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft".</p>
<p>In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction."</p>
<p>Spencer said: "Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team."</p>

            <p>Original Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has declared the Saints Row franchise is "dead".</p>
<p>Last November, Stockman revealed he wanted to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly received 2022 reboot – developed after he had left Volition – and claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-saints-row-designer-says-unloved-2022-reboot-missed-the-mark-but-the-big-news-is-embracer-wants-him-to-pitch-a-revival">publisher Embracer Group had reached out to hear more</a> about his ideas.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months, however, and Stockman is now less confident, responding to a fan on Discord that IP holder Embracer has "ghosted him" and "has zero ability to do anything with [the franchise]".</p>
<p>"[H]onestly, I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately," Stockman said in reply to a commenter who'd shared their dismay that the last canon game was released "a decade ago".</p> <div>

<p>"I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it," he added. "I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward, but they've ghosted me."</p>
<p>Stockman's comments come <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team">after the CEO of Saber Interactive had some pretty damning words to say about the reboot</a> and its developer, Volition, after it was shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme.</p>
<p>"They didn't know what they were building," Matt Karch said. "They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>I found the 2022 game to be a very mediocre affair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">when I reviewed it back in 2022</a>, calling it a reboot that "won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises".</p>

            <p>
Xbox CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role. Additionally, Xbox president Sarah Bond will depart the company.
</p>
<p>
"Last fall, I shared with [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life," Spencer - who joined Microsoft in 1988 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-named-new-boss-of-xbox">became the boss of Xbox in 2014</a> - wrote in an email to staff. "From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.
</p>
<p>
"Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team," Spencer continued. "She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right." Spencer added he'll remain in an advisory role "through the summer".
</p>
<p>
As part of his retirement announcement, Spencer also confirmed the departure of Xbox president Sarah Bond, who he said had "decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter." He called Bond's work "instrumental during a defining period for Xbox", wishing her "the very best in what comes next". Bond joined Xbox in 2017 and was named Xbox president in 2022. As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> head Matt Booty, he's received a new role amid Xbox's significant executive overhaul, and will now work closely with the newly appointed Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.
</p><p>
In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.
</p>
<p>
"I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players," Sharma continued. "The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward... We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways."
</p>
<p>
Sharma also made what she called "three commitments", referencing "great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". On games, she said Microsoft - which has made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">sweeping cuts across its gaming division in recent years,</a> including layoffs and team closures - will "empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas." She also promised to "take risks" and "enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most."
</p>
<p>
On the return of Xbox, Sharma said the company would "celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are... Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise." Sharma did not explicitly reference the "next-gen hardware" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">announced by then-president Sarah Bond last year</a> amid reports Microsoft was ending console development.
</p><p>
On the future, Sharma spoke of the "reinvention of play", pledging to "invent new business models and new ways to play" that will "meet the moment". This will include the building of "a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories". Additionally, she promised the team will "not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.
</p>
<p>
"The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through," Sharma concluded. "We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not. Thank you for welcoming me into this journey."
</p>
<p>
In a separate email to staff, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Sharma would bring "deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth." He also thanked Spencer for his "extraordinary leadership and partnership".

            <p>I was in the gift shop of a small art gallery the other day when I bought a postcard depicting a bunch of different keys. The postcard turned out to be a reproduction from the six-volume dictionary and encyclopedia Larousse du XXe siècle (me neither) and the keys come in a gorgeous range of shapes and sizes. The Roman key is broad and boot-shaped. The Merovingian looks like part of a crank.</p>
<p>I love a good key, obviously, and yet I wasn't thinking of that as I bought the postcard. I wasn't thinking of the many keys I've owned and lost over the years, or the acquaintance of mine who is a locksmith. I wasn't thinking of the junk shop I'd once visited on a Greek island where I spent a happy twenty minutes looking through a trunk filled with rusted keys whose locks had clearly long-since crumbled, or a friend who is a caretaker at a church and once showed me the huge long-stemmed key he uses to get in each evening. I didn't even think of church keys, the colloquial name for a flat-edged tool that is used to open human skulls - hopefully only during autopsies.</p>
<p>Instead, I thought of a single word: Zelda.</p>
<p>Oh man, Zelda and its keys. The boss keys, with their villainous, intimidating shapes. The little silver keys collected and portioned out in dungeons, each one a gamble. And that moment, a few weeks ago, when I spent much longer than I should in some shrine deep in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, watching a stone ball rolling around a concave semi-circle in the ground before it settled into the centre. This mesmerising thing was a key of sorts: once in the centre, the stone ball certainly triggered a nearby gate. But it was also just a wonderful thing in and of itself. The rolling ball, the lazy, beautiful, ideal physics that kept it in motion, the lovely grating chunk as it finally found its resting spot.</p><p>Zelda is keys, in a way: locks and doors and chests and the urge to find out what's inside things and behind things. But in a crucial way, as I watched that stone ball roll around, I realised that I had no key at all for the two most recent Zeldas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> and Tears of the Kingdom. I think I love these games. And just watching the ball made me realise they're clearly beautiful, and capable of conjuring wonder. But I don't understand them. They haven't fully come into focus for me or made sense of themselves to me. A brilliant friend once wrote that the Zelda games are clockwork fairy tales. Clockwork often needs a key. So are these recent Zeldas still clockwork, now that they've gone open-world? And where's the key I'm after?</p>

<p>I struggle to do what I'm told in games, but this never used to be the case with Zeldas. Back in the day, whether slipping between dimensions, pushing through the mineral veils of time, or simply messing around in a boat that came with a head, I did exactly what I was told. The land was in danger, so a hero in green had returned. Time to battle through dungeons, collect cherished items, and give Ganon a showing at the end of it all.</p>
<p>These games were discursive - god those little stones you had to collect and clip together in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-minish-cap">The Minish Cap</a>, that brass and wood camera from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">Wind Waker</a> - but their discursions, how to put this, always left me facing in the right direction afterwards. Hyrule field was dauntingly vast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>, or so it seemed, but I always found the dungeons in the right order and I always made it to the final credits. My favourite of these games, Link to the Past, is a single puzzle box from start to finish - I appreciate this is not an original thought - and I wandered through it, got lost, found my way again, despaired and tasted triumph and almost gave up, all without feeling, really, that I had wandered even for a second where I was not meant to go.</p><p>Then came Breath of the Wild. And I think I was lost from the start. I emerged into that bright green and blue world, right at the top of a hill, and I duly collected all my new powers, but did I ever really understand what they were for? Moving stuff around, messing with time, bringing ice blocks out of the earth! Reader, I am ashamed to say that it took me a week or two of playing before realising I was even meant to be applying these powers outside of the shrines, those collectathon fragments of old Zelda dungeons that were suddenly my only guide through this expansive, panoramically broad and emphatically hands-off world I was dumped into.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom was much the same, except by now I had seen about a billion TikToks that showed me that the game was really about using the skills I was given in ways that hopefully nobody else had thought of. I saw people using the time powers from Breath of the Wild to travel everywhere on trees they'd felled and then filled with pent-up kinetic energy. As for the building tools from Tears of the Kingdom, I saw someone who had made the DeLorean from Back to the Future, right down to the gull-wing doors, which opened and shut automatically. Anything was allowed here. Everything was allowed.</p>
<p>So that was it! Forget about Zelda and Ganon and the curse that had fallen across the land. Just enjoy the sandbox. Live for the lark of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that's not quite right either. Hyrule is a great toybox, but the more I screwed around with the bits and pieces the more I realised that the game has all these subtle ways of reminding a dutiful, slightly plodding person like me that there is a central quest. There are the people you meet, and their manias and tragedies. There are the derelict castles and flying dragons and the Blood Moon or whatever it's called, everything reminding you, just enough, that things are kind of serious here really.</p><p>More than that, there's a sadness laced into the landscape of Hyrule itself. One of my favourite painters is Eric Ravilious, master of watercolours, visual poet of the South Downs, and apparently one of the most cheerful people who ever lived. He knew war and he died mysteriously near the North Pole (I think) but he also ricocheted from one love affair to another and was known, I gather, for his habit of whistling to himself wherever he was and whatever he was doing, probably even when he was conducting those love affairs.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>His paintings? Well, they have me in total conflict. Pleasing rounded shapes and simple colours, but they also move me so much! Is that a tear in my eye? What a contradiction. Anyway, Hyrule in the two recent Zeldas feels like Ravilious to me, and that's not just because of the watercolour skies and cross-hatching of bright green grass. It's because it feels like a melancholic landscape drawn into being by someone who was disproportionately upbeat.</p>
<p>And this quiet collision of opposite moods is everywhere in the games. Once again (twice again?) that ancient evil has returned and the princess is missing. Yet some unseen <em>someone</em> with great influence over the land is clearly feeling pretty good about things. Winds are playfully abroad in the grasses. The night are often clear and cool and bright with opportunity. Trigger a battle and the game busts out the old Joanna. What is injury when it's accompanied by a jazzy cat walking splay-footedly across the keys? What's life and death when it's met with a <em>glissando</em>?</p><p>Yes. Quite. And to all of this, throw in scale. I'm going to abuse that word a little bit. It's not just that the land is vast and rolls away in every direction, that the mountains are tall and the valleys are deep. It's that there's so much here to do: those seeds to find, people to help, those guys with the signs, those towers to climb, all of those hundreds of shrines.</p>
<p>And your powers! Breath of the Wild again with its initial brace of tricks, and then Tears of the Kingdom with its ersatz modding tools: bodge together weapons, build anything you can think of, clip through the geometry. (It was only with Tears of the Kingdom's arrival, incidentally, that Breath of the Wild suddenly felt complete to me. Why? Because all of a sudden I could be in one game and feel that sweet sadness of conceiving a perfect solution to a puzzle, but a solution that would only work if I had the powers that I had in the other game and not this one.)</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And Hyrule as we know it is just the start of it. In Tears of the Kingdom it goes up, to those windblown archipelagos of skyminded rock with their rail carts and turning orbs and sad, winter trees.  The puzzles here are often completely brilliant, and the very feeling of wandering through the wild blue is magic too. It's a feeling, for me, of being off from school on a term-time weekday, exploring where I shouldn't and messing with things out of sight of grown-ups.</p><p>And it goes down, too. Slope downwards to thy depths, O Link! Down in the darkness, Zelda suddenly feels nothing like Zelda. Shadows and horror and sticky red gore everywhere. You have to light your way through the darkness, moving from one pool of vision to the next. I've suspected at times that in the Depths under Hyrule we see that game that the developers of Zelda have wished they could make for years, something chaotic, under-imagined and disturbing.</p>
<p>Is that true? I have no idea, but I do believe that the power of the Depths, and I love these places, is not what they contain but what they <em>might</em> contain. It's rubble and stone mushrooms for miles and then you hit a huge, sharp edged structure that feels, for all the world, like a DLR station visited at two in the morning on a Tuesday. There's the same sense of dormant purpose, of capturing a busy, useful place in a rare moment of absence. Games, it's said, are about possibility space. The Depths feel like a way of giving shape to the very <em>idea</em> of possibility space: what else is out there?</p>

<p>There's so much I haven't mentioned. We haven't visited the dungeons and their guardians or so much as saddled up a horse, or even that cool skeletal horse I found in the Depths the other day. But that's the point. Whenever I try to write about these recent Zeldas I feel like I should be trying for completeness. But it never seems to be possible. I know there is deep harmony here, in themes and systems and art and all that jazz, but I have my most fun when it feels like I'm playing against that, or tripping over myself, or getting lost and distracted and absolutely not trying to save the land or anybody in it.</p><p>And perhaps that's where I'm meant to end up. From my own experience, the defining quality of the open-world Zeldas is that you can write about them forever, but you can only capture them in parts. And for writing, I mean play, explore, think about, approach. The wholeness of these games, if such a thing even exists, always eludes me and I end up in distractions and discursions, all of them wonderful but all of them somehow disconnected from one another, connected and disconnected from the very idea of Zelda. In this world of hills and mountains and parapets, there is simply no vantage point, real or metaphysical, where absolutely everything can be glimpsed at once.</p>
<p>And I should add, this is not a criticism. In fact, it's the absolute opposite. As the physics system that sent my stone boulder in motion freed the shrines from having a right or wrong solution, the open world has freed the games from standing for one specific thing. Back to keys, I reckon? Everything is a potential key now. Everything is a potential lock. You just have to decide where you're going for and what you're looking for and what you value in your experience. It's overwhelming and ingenious and sweet and detailed and broad strokes and kind and terrifying. Zelda's no longer an adventure. It is adventure.</p>

            <h2>20th February</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing. This week, Victoria knows something her husband doesn't; Tom endures the perennial terror known as entertaining a child over half-term; Bertie realises he's missed something important again; and Will makes mech combat somehow sound rather fun.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something else to read, or a reminder of what you once wrote, there's a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">What We've Been Playing archive</a> to delve into.</p>

<p>Last Friday night, I made a bet with my husband that I could start and finish a game well before he was ready to watch the last few episodes of Better Call Saul. He smirked and said fine, but it couldn't be a mobile game like Wordle or something similar. "No problem," I replied, for I knew something he didn't - I knew about the secret <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-4">Far Cry 4</a> ending.</p><p>As my husband went upstairs to close down his work computer and get into his comfy non-work clothes, I booted up my Series X and settled in to watch Far Cry 4's opening cutscenes up until the point I found myself in front of a plate of monkey heads. Then, once the flamboyant and self-proclaimed King of Kyrat, Pagen Min, had made himself scarce, I prepared myself to do... absolutely nothing. Yes, I set down my controller and waited patiently.</p>
<p>After around 10 minutes (I didn't keep track of the exact time), Pagen Min returned to the dining table - which he had asked me to wait at - and proceeded to take me with him to place the ashes of Ajay Ghale's mother in a shrine within Far Cry 4's fictional Himalayan countryside. Some light button pressing later, to look around and set down/pick up items, I was ready to climb into Pagen Min's helicopter and watch the end credits roll.</p>
<p>20 minutes and I was done. A further five minutes later, my husband showed up. I was smug.</p>

<p>It's a school half-term holiday down this way, which means my son has been up late playing games. While he insists on playing EA Sports FC 26 on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, which I hate because of the sluggish frame rate in comparison to the other console versions, we have also played some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> which is brilliant.</p><p>Nintendo's Switch 2 kart racer feels so great to play, the world is so colourful and alive, and the variety in locations is superb. This game always had a tough task following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, a game that I and millions of others had played to death over years. There are few games I have ever become so familiar with, so change was also going to be tricky. Some eight-ish months since the Switch 2 launched, I'm starting to get some of that familiarity, and I'm able to enjoy the game more easily.</p>

<h2>Overwatch, PC</h2>
<p>It just occurred to me that you can't choose from all of the characters in Stadium. I've been playing for a week but somehow haven't noticed. Stadium is the newish game mode where you can customise your character between rounds by buying ability buffs, or ability tweaks. Example: you can change Mei's ice block ability into an ice boulder that rolls around and she can hurt people with, which is great, so you see that you can quite significantly change a character's behaviour over the course of a game. I wish there were more characters available here, especially the newer ones, but it's still exciting to alter characters I thought I knew so well. I'm re-energised, and it's only one small part of the reason why - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">I wrote much more excitedly about Overwatch's sort-of relaunch earlier this week</a>. I'm also looking for people to play with because it's more fun with friends. Hop on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eurogamer">the Eurogamer Discord</a> and say hey if you fancy it.</p>

<p>So it's me, Pontoon, Guano and Flapjack right? They're all newbies; the planet government has hired me to hold their hands while we level an "undefended" pirate base. They said that the bad guys were running bootleg holotapes out of it - I don't care, it was meant to be an easy paycheck. Just keep an eye on the other three and make sure their BattleMechs don't trip and fall off a cliff while they're shooting the place up.</p><p>Of course, the intel was wrong. By the time we'd got eyes on the base, sensors showed four heat signatures out there in the fog. I told them to get into the woods nearby quick-quick, and two of the stick jockeys managed to do it in time. Flapjack wasn't having it, though. He got so damn gung-ho he ran up to the base to take them all on.</p>
<p>He even got a few shots off against the tiny Locust that was out on patrol, but the light Mech was moving too fast to suffer anything more than a few scratches from his wild laser fire. Pontoon and Guano let it rip too, but from further back they couldn't hit it either.</p>
<p>The Locust wasn't the problem though. Flapjack's 45-ton Firestarter was twice its weight and three times as armoured. The problem was the three extra Mechs at the back of the base, brimming with long-range missiles, large lasers and extended-range particle projector cannons. Once Flapjack entered their line of fire, it was over - the first wave of missiles took his legs, and the next slammed mercilessly into the cockpit before he could punch out.</p>
<p>It's a damn shame. I tore up into the base in my 100-ton King Crab, soaking up the rest of the fire as best I could, and the rest of the green pilots made themselves useful in the background. Pontoon even took out a Panther with a lucky autocannon headshot to tip the battle in our favour. All three of us made it back in one piece. But I'm going to spend more on field repairs and ammo resupply than I'll have made on the job.</p>
<p>And that damn kid. I'll never see those oaty treats in the mess the same way again.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has not one, but two Far Cry games currently in development.</p>
<p>That's coming from Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot, who was interviewed by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> about various goings on at the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">such as its recent 'restructuring'</a> which will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">including the already launched subsidiary with Tencent known as Vantage Studios</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Here, the publication asked Guillemot if this new company model will see development on its biggest franchises such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed speed up, to which the exec replied:</p>
<p>"We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios. Under the Assassin's Creed brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year.</p>
<p>"On Far Cry, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development."</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Ubisoft had two new Far Cry releases on the way, but this is now official confirmation that this indeed the case. As for those previous reports, it has been said that one release - codenamed Project Blackbird - will be the next mainline Far Cry entry. This chap will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-will-reportedly-see-players-attempting-to-rescue-their-kidnapped-family-against-the-clock">allegedly feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family</a>, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.</p><p>The second game previously reported to be in the works is a standalone Far Cry multiplayer game, known as Project Maverick. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft">sources claimed Maverick would be an extraction-based shooter pitched as being based in "the Alaskan wilderness"</a>. At this time, it was said Maverick would allegedly include "mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more". The "and more" here could likely refer to lootable chests and extraction zones.</p>

<figcaption>The latest mainline Far Cry entry - Far Cry 6 - took players to the fictional Caribbean island of Yara. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Assassin's Creed, we already know about some of its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">such as Project Hexe</a> and of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">its Black Flag remake</a>. However, a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">Insider Gaming</a> has said that as part of Ubisoft's recent restructuring, two upcoming Assassin's Creed titles were cancelled, including one said to be called Assassin's Creed Singularity.</p>
<p>According to the publication's sources, Singularity was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration, and it would have been released across PC and mobile platforms. While I do have my - ahem - thoughts about what Ubisoft has done to its studios and games over the past few months, this is one game I don't feel especially sad to see gone.</p>
<figure>

<p>Elsewhere at the company, as well as these two Far Cry games, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-anthology-series-in-the-works-with-always-sunny-in-philadelphias-rob-mac">anthology series is also in the works with Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob Mac (née McElhenney) and Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley</a>. In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>
<p>As for Ubisoft more generally, earlier today it was announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">company was laying off 40 developers at the studio working on its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the game itself remains in production.</p>

            <p>We are just a matter of days away from the release of Resident Evil Requiem, but already leaks are running rampant, causing Capcom to ask its community to 'please, cut it out!'.</p>
<p>As our Connor reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-out-resident-evil-requiems-ending-is-being-spoiled-online-as-capcom-fights-to-clean-up-leaks">physical copies of Resident Evil Requiem were obtained ahead of schedule by some members of the public earlier this week</a>. And thanks to this, gameplay and story leaks started making the rounds on the likes of reddit. Sigh.</p>

<p>Capcom did its best to curtail the problem by removing unauthorised videos and whatnot, but it did feel a bit like that man sticking a bit of sellotape over a massive leaking vat of liquid. So, now, the studio is appealing to any potential leaker's better nature, with a firm but fair 'stop it'.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590/photo/1">social media post</a> shared this afternoon, Capcom wrote: "Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible."</p>
<p>It added its legal department "will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience". It then said very reasonably that we don't exactly have much longer to wait until we can all experience what horrors are in store first hand.</p>
<p>"We look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!" Capcom closed.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch across PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in one week's time, on 27th February.</p>
<p>Our Alex is one of the many here at Eurogamer very keen to play the latest series entry, but unlike the rest of us, he has been able to go hands-on with it already  (what, no I am not jealous <em>at all</em>…). "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Requiem preview earlier this year</a>.</p><p>"I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>

            <p>The latest set photos from Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider TV series give us our first look at Martin Bobb-Semple's Zip, as well as Sophie Turner as Lara Croft holding a rather mysterious looking piece of kit.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series below</strong> (to be clear, I have no idea what the plot is - for this show and just generally in life - but I don't want to accidentally show you too much too soon if you would rather keep an air of the unknown around the upcoming series).</p>

<p>The latest Tomb Raider set photos appear to take place in the same Surrey woods from earlier set photos, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-sophie-turners-lara-croft-and-her-dual-pistols-on-set-of-tomb-raider">saw Turner parachuting in during the day time</a>. These new images, however, appear to take place at night, with Lara now sporting that aforementioned new kit - a mysterious dagger.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15573351/amp/Sophie-Turner-knife-fight-scenes-motorbike-films-new-Tomb-Raider-series.html">Daily Mail</a>, Turner filmed "dramatic knife fight scenes" during the shoot, so I am now wondering if she went to the woods in search of this (potential) artifact. Though, Lara's gloves are <em>slightly </em>different, so maybe not… I guess we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>In addition to the dagger, Lara also appears to have a retractable pickaxe with her. This tool made an appearance in the animated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> on Netflix if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>As for Zip, Lara's resident tech expert is no longer relegated to being behind an ear piece or computer. As you can see in the images below, Bobb-Semple's Zip is in on the action, and can be seen picking Lara up on a motorcycle.</p><p>I have to admit, I am not sure he is wearing <em>exactly </em>what I would choose to wear if I had to go and scoop my friend up from the dark, rain-soaked woods at night while on a motorbike, but he does look pretty sharp.</p>
<p>Also, I would have liked to see Lara on the front of the bike rather than at the back, but even so, I am very pleased to see motorbikes will be a part of Amazon's Tomb Raider show. Overall, I am really feeling rather optimistic about this adaptation.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we had a wave of cast announcements for Amazon's Tomb Raider series. As well as Turner and Bobb-Semple, the show will also feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas and Bill Paterson as Winston</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a> earlier this year, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Waller-Bridge has said of Tomb Raider</a>. "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is.</p>
<p>"Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The message "Nier Automata will continue" was the stinger concluding today's celebratory showcase for the game, which covered the game's many cameo appearances, spin-offs, and its passing of 10m worldwide sales.</p>
<p>This video, posted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> YouTube channel, covered the game's history of releases and adaptations since its initial release in 2017. Having only recently passed 10m sales, it marks a steady increase from December 2024 when it passed 9m.</p>
<p>This announcement came alongside some new art <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394">posted to official Nier Automata social media platforms</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this final message mean, aside from the obvious indication that Nier Automata will carry on in some form. Well, there's been little word of a sequel to Nier Automata, despite its widespread acclaim and success. There was Nier: Reincarnation, a mobile sequel of sorts that launched in 2021 and was shut down and made unplayable in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">Tencent also cancelled another Nier mobile game in 2024</a>, which reportedly "struggled to find a monetisation to offset its high costs.".</p><p>You could kill all hope of a AAA direct sequel in your heart, and instead see the tease as an indication of more cameos in other games. These have proven exceptionally popular whenever they emerge: <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nier-automata-collaboration-pushes-goddess-of-victory-nikke-to-a-half-a-billion-in-revenue/">Goddess of Victory: Nikke saw a 215 percent increase in sales thanks to its Nier Automata collaboration</a>, leaping over $500m in revenue as a result.</p>
<p>One can certainly hope for the former. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> has been largely an absent presence from the world of <em>released</em> video games since the Nier Replicant remake in 2021, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">stating last year the projects he had been working on were cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for? If you've not played Nier Automata, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-review">Eurogamer's review to see what all the fuss is about.</a> In it, Jeffrey Matulef wrote: "Yoko Taro's eccentric action RPG gets a follow-up that's every bit as surprising as its predecessor with a little help from Platinum Games."</p>

            <p>Jake Solomon, a decorated game designer known for his work at Firaxis on games like XCOM and Marvel Midnight Suns, has announced that his studio Midsummer is going to close. In doing so, he also shared a pre-alpha look at the "Life Sims + The Truman Show" game the studio was making, called Burbank.</p>
<p>Solomon didn't elaborate on the reasons for closure in <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">the statement he released on X</a>. "We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both," he wrote. "Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into."</p>
<p>Burbank seems to be a game about making TV shows with a cast of characters you can pick up and drop into various customisable situations. It reminds me a lot of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionheads-secret-best-game-and-one-of-the-greatest-ever-abandonware-games-the-movies-turns-20-today">Lionhead's The Movies</a>.</p>
<p>The Burbank trailer shows somewhat action-figure-like people leading dramatic lives in a small-town location, which you watch as though you would a soap opera on TV. The trailer then reveals that you're the one directing it, choosing the characters who'll be the stars and then adding a support cast from bundles of support cast characters. Then you choose a broad outline for the episode, establish character motivations and behaviour, and go on to unlock new cast abilities as you play.</p><div>

<p>The alluring part seems to be that you're not totally in control, which means your actors and characters have minds of their own, so finding out what they'll do when placed in certain situations becomes a key part of the game. You set their parameters and then watch to see what you've created.</p>
<p>Jake Solomon explained: "It's like 'Life Sims + The Truman Show', but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</p>
<p>"We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special [...] This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us."</p>
<p>He later added: "Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That's what lets you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI."</p>
<p>That is the only other comment he made.</p>

<p>It's a surprising announcement and it's sad, and it's also slightly strange in that it doesn't unequivocally state that this game's journey is over. The language used seems to suggest Burbank could live on, but if the studio is about to close, how could that be? Jake Solomon has given no previous indication the studio was in trouble. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jake-solomon-0247a037_midsummer-is-officially-a-game-changer-activity-7395096938137690112-Zc8d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAUoxGIBcYD7dzkEFna_Jwj_cI4OhPmSEjo">His last post on LinkedIn</a>, made three months ago, had him saying he was "excited to share more about what we're building soon".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">We last spoke to Solomon in 2024</a>, a couple of years after Marvel's Midnight Suns had charmed us, and after Solomon had left Firaxis to create his own studio and spin-up this new game idea. In that interview, he said Midsummer had been backed by venture capitalists and received funding from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> maker Krafton. I'm assuming that money has now run out. Solomon also talked more about the thinking behind Burbank, and the 'create your own stories' idea.</p>
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns was released in 2022. It's a card-based, turn-based spin on creating your own Marvel superhero team - and Marvel superhero - and then saving the day. And very good it was too. "Great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse," wrote Christian Donlan in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Marvel's Midnight Suns review</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft is laying off 40 employees at its Toronto studio, which is currently working on the company's long-in-the-works Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with tech outlet <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft said this decision "was not taken lightly". It added it was not a reflection of the "talent, dedication, or contributions" of those impacted by the layoffs at the studio.</p>

<p>"Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance," Ubisoft said.</p>
<p>Despite these changes at Ubisoft Toronto, its Splinter Cell remake is still in development, the company confirmed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft first announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>As well as this remake, Ubisoft Toronto will also remain a "key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams", the company told MobileSyrup.</p>

<p>News of layoffs at the Toronto studio follows an announcement earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft was initiating a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>. This saw Ubisoft close two studios, cancel six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> -  and delay seven games.</p>

            <p>It feels weird to buy a peripheral in order to play games you don't own. I'm generally very positive about the Nintendo Classics offered through the Nintendo Switch Online membership (and the classic Mega Drive games). I know I'll lose access if I stop subscribing, but it feels like a reasonable fee to get these on top of other benefits. But, just like I have never bought DLC for a game I don't own, I find the idea of needing to buy a peripheral to play the newly added Virtual Boy games a little hard to swallow.</p>
<p>We've written about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">Virtual Boy before on Eurogamer</a>, thanks to Alex feeling rather keen to throw his money away one night, so I won't bog this article down with more on the console other than to say it's such a bizarre creation that it feels rather exciting to get to play it today via the Switch consoles. A kind of portable you can only really play while sitting at a desk that offers a red and black 3D gaming experience via its in-built display, it's not something I ever imagined playing in my own home, yet here we are - and that's neat.</p>

<p>The aforementioned peripheral, then, is needed to create the 3D screen view that the original console offered - there's no way to play these games without the peripheral, which I understand but at the same time wouldn't see the harm in Nintendo offering 2D versions for those with more of a casual interest. An excellent fully modelled Virtual Boy replica (sans controllers) can be bought for £67, and if you'd rather not spend that much you can opt for a cardboard device of an original design for £17. Would I pay £67 for some plastic that becomes completely useless the moment I no longer subscribe to Switch Online + Expansion Pack? I don't think I would.</p><p>Would I fairly happily hand over £80 for the peripheral and all the games? That's a sweeter deal, and one I feel the hardcore audience interested in this out-there slice of Nintendo history would much prefer. Ultimately, for a retro collection like this an option to own every game on a single Switch cart would be the best scenario, and no doubt some would be willing to stump up the extra cost that would incur. Given Nintendo is planning to release two Virtual Boy games that were never on the original hardware, there's a real collector's angle to this project that doesn't feel fully realised via the way it's being distributed at the moment.</p>

<figcaption>This is what the original hardware looks like, and the peripheral is a great copy just without the controller.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is a bizarre thing to say on a website that reviews video games (calm down those of you at the back in the comments), but the quality of the games on offer for the Virtual Boy doesn't really matter. This is as much a piece of history as it is a form of entertainment, so had every game here been a complete stinker I'd have still argued that they are worth experiencing - but gladly there are some that deserve to be played for more than curiosity's sake.</p><p>Virtual Boy Wario Land comes with the reputation of being the best game on the system, and based on the seven games available right now I can't disagree. It's a tight side-scrolling platformer with the classic Nintendo feel that makes good use of the depth offered by the 3D visuals. While I reckon it would work fine in 2D (honestly, most of these games would be absolutely playable), the effects, as basic as they are, still manage to add a surprising amount of visual flair. It's got a banging soundtrack, too, which for some reason I wasn't expecting.</p>
<p>Of the other six available games, I've spent most time with Galactic Pinball, but I'm not sure if this is because it's a great game or if I just find the stationary pinball table easier on my eyes. I say "most time" but I should note here that the 'console' encourages you to take breaks pretty often, and I recommend it. I played Red Alarm (a wireframe graphics 3D futuristic aircraft shooter that is decent if rather odd to experience in the year 2026) for about 30 minutes, and returning to the real world was akin to when Neo got unplugged in The Matrix, but he also had a crooked neck because he had been forced into a completely ridiculous body position.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's really only Wario and Pinball that I've had the drive to dive back into, knowing that I'd come out the other side a little worse for wear. As I said, this whole Virtual Boy project for Switch is worth it for the time capsule experience (even more so in the UK where the console didn't hit stores), and no matter my issues with the way it's been released it's still a lot cheaper than buying a second-hand system and the games. The games yet to release seem more appealing to me, including Mario Clash, Mario's Tennis, Jack Bros, and the never released F-Zero racer Zero Racers, but we've got to wait a little for those to land.</p><p>All in all, I'm glad Nintendo has brought the Virtual Boy to Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, but it's not without its problems. From technical and practical points of view, the machine is uncomfortable, I had some problems seeing the whole display which forced me to reduce the game view size (although other people who tested it haven't had such issues), and I'm not in love with how you slot the Switch into the hard plastic peripheral - nothing bad has happened yet, but it feels like scratches could happen pretty easily.</p>
<p>I think you know if the cost of the Virtual Boy experience on Switch is something you're happy to pay. I kind of love the whole thing despite itself, which isn't so much giving the system and its lineup and free pass, but an acknowledgement of Nintendo's willingness to try something different. And I still can't help but feel happy this exists at all.</p>

            <p>Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy, and this year is no exception. One thing that does make this February's Pokémon Presents a little different, though, is that this year marks 30 years since Red and Green made their debut.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has been confirmed to air next week, on Friday 27th February at 2pm UK time. For those Pikachu fans across the pond, that's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.</p>
<p>As to what we can expect, well earlier today the company announced that the remakes of those classic Pokémon Game Boy games from 1996 will arrive on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 27th February. FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version - as these remakes are known in their Game Boy Advance versions - will be available exclusively to buy and download on Pokémon Day, once the broadcast has come to a close.</p>
<p>You can check out a little teaser trailer for the Switch editions of Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version below. Or, if you are keen, you can pre-order these games <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-FireRed-Version-3031207.html">via the Nintendo eShop</a>, where <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">they retail for £16.99</a>. </p>

<p>There's also the chance we will see more from Pokémon Pokopia, which is due to be released next month, on 5th March. Pokopia is Pokémon's take on Animal Crossing, and our Alex is already rather taken with the upcoming release.</p><p>"Mechanics I love mashed up with characters and a world I also have a great affinity for," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">Eurogamer's Pokémon Pokopia preview</a>. " I haven't felt this way about a Pokémon game since Conquest, the 2012 strategy crossover with Nobunaga's Ambition."</p>
<p>We will also probably hear about some updates for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon Unite and Pokémon EX Masters. Perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-pokemon-theme-park-is-opening-next-february-and-pikachus-popping-up-in-an-electric-pokemon-ride">something to do with the Pokémon park in Japan</a>? Our Lottie, though, is hopeful we will hear something about Gen 10.</p>
<p>What do you hope to see next week?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, the challenging Team Ninja samurai action game, has passed one million copies sold in two weeks. According to the game's publisher Koei Tecmo, this makes it the fastest selling entry in the series' history.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/">In a post</a> made to celebrate the occasion, it was also revealed that the entire series has sold over 10m copies too. In a message to fans and supporters the developers stated they "are truly grateful to players around the world for their incredible support."</p>
<p>An accolades trailer was also released to coincide with the announcement, which features multiple review scores, quotes, and gameplay footage of Nioh 3. You can watch it yourself below.</p>

            <p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", Sony has decided to shut the studio down.</p>
<p>Last night, it was revealed that Bluepoint - the studio behind the widely praised Demon's Souls remake and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-nathan-drake-collection">Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection</a>, to name just two  - was being shut down by PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint">Bloomberg</a>, around 70 employees will be impacted by the studio's shock closure, which will come into force in March. A spokesperson told the publication the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The move comes five years after Bluepoint Games released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5. Since then, Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the beloved and exceptionally talented studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>.</p>
<p>A reported response to Bluepoint's closure by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes.1440826/">Sony exec Herman Hulst said</a>: "As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within PlayStation Studios. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> launched to critical and commercial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and MLB The Show continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we're operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p>
<p>"To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We've taken a close look at our business to ensure we're delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March."</p><p>Hulst said this decision "was not made lightly", before rubbing more salt on the wound by calling Bluepoint "an incredibly talented team" whose "technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community". Hulst closed by stating he knew this news would come as a blow, but he is "confident" in the "direction" PlayStation is heading.</p>
<p>"Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for FY26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead," he said. "Thank you for your hard work and continued support."</p>
<p>Personally, I find the closure of Bluepoint absolutely devastating, and a real loss for the gaming industry. Sony's decision to put a studio renowned for its acclaimed remakes on a live-service project raised many an eyebrow, not just mine, with more than just a handful of fans hoping the company would use Bluepoint Games to revive other classic games from within the PlayStation library, namely PS4's Bloodborne. Putting the studio on a live-service project felt like a waste of talent, and a clear misdirection for the team's strengths.</p>

<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects including Bluepoint's God of War game cancelled.</p>
<p>Most prominently in recent years, Sony closed Firewalk Studios after its failed launch of live-service shooter Concord in 2024. Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>. The game had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">in the works for eight years</a>, it had been said.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">ceased work on its live-service The Last of Us multiplayer back in 2023</a>, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was cancelled</a> in 2024. In March of that same year, footage of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">cancelled co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - appeared online.</p>

            <p>
God of War actor Christopher Judge, the rumbling voice behind beardy Kratos, has suggested more news on the series' future could arrive "late summer".
</p>
<p>
Judge shared the information during a signing session at Canada's Fan Expo, where his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RTJe0WGFuIM">words were captured</a> (it's unclear if was aware he was being recorded) by streamer Fuzhpuzy. In the video, Judge confirmed he won't be lending his vocal talents to Sony Santa Monica's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently announced God of War Greek trilogy remakes</a> - Kratos actor TC Carson will return for those, he claimed - but he did tease other news is coming.
</p>
<p>
According to Judge, who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kratos-is-now-played-by-stargate-sg-1s-christopher-judge">voiced Kratos since 2018's God of War</a>, fans will "be hearing about what we're doing probably late summer", suggesting Sony Santa Monica might be ready to unveil a follow-up to 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> later this year. That, though, is far from a certainty, and it's possible Judge is working  with the studio in another capacity.
</p>
<p>
As yet, the most substantial hint toward Sony Santa Monica's next project emerged last year, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier teased</a> the studio's "next big thing" - headed up by long-time God of War director and producer Cory Balrog - won't be a new IP, but "might feel like one".
</p><p>
"Maybe that's why people are confused," Schreier wrote in response to rumours surrounding the studio's next project. "Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum." He also noted "the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."
</p>
<p>
Could this be a radical reinvention of the God of War series or something else entirely? If Judge is correct, perhaps we'll learn more later this year. And what about Sony Santa Monica's "new IP", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">hinted at by a developer</a> last August? Mysteries upon mysteries! But until more is revealed, there's always Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently released spin-off Sons of Sparta</a> to sate your God of War needs. And don't forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">there's a TV show on the way</a> too.

            <p>If you're excited for Resident Evil: Requiem, you may want to stay clear of social media for a while, as leaks about the game's ending are popping up online.</p>
<p>Capcom is trying to curb the problem, taking down early spoilers for the survival horror release, but it's proving to be a struggle. On the Resident Evil Requiem Reddit, posts about the leak are being shared and discussed widely. This includes full story breakdowns, specific conversations around certain characters, and gameplay discussion. Steer clear!</p>
<p>This comes after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-early-copies-of-resident-evil-requiem-appear-in-the-wild-fans-warn-that-now-is-the-time-to-log-off-in-order-to-avoid-leaks">physical versions of the game were obtained early by some members of the public</a> earlier this week. The moment this happened, the clock started ticking towards a wave of unfettered story details spreading across the internet. Almost like some kind of virus. Umbrella would be proud.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, a continuation of the main-line story and Leon Kennedy's arc through the legendary horror franchise, sees him return to Racoon City to uncover some mystery still lurking in that ruined city. Grace, a new character to the series, also plays a key role as the game's second protagonist. All this was known about already from trailers and official releases. Take that and hide away from anything else!</p><p>If you want to get an idea of what the game is like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer previewed it earlier this year</a>. In it, Alex Donaldson wrote: "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in. I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch on the 27th February, to the PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <p>
If you're anything like me, the second Nintendo announced it'd be giving select Switch 1 titles a fancy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> makeover, you probably immediately starting compiling a wish list. The Xenoblade series was high on mine, but remained persistently unloved. Until now that is! Out of nowhere, Nintendo just released an upgrade for last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition - and better still, it's available now.
</p>
<p>
Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as the new release is officially known, follows similar Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Some have been free, some (namely the ones with a bunch of additional content) have had a heftier price tag, while some updates have arrived with a nominal fee.

<p>
Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition falls into the latter camp, and owners of the Switch 1 version can upgrade to the new Switch 2 Edition for £4.19/$4.99 USD. And what does that get you? According to Nintendo, 4K and "up to" 60fps support in TV mode, plus 1080p and "up to" 60fps when playing in handheld mode. It doesn't sound like anything else is included, so you might well wonder why Nintendo hasn't followed previous form and provided this zero-content update for free (probably, money?).
</p><p>
Regardless, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Xenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-3026104.html">available on the eShop right now</a>, both as an upgrade and a full game. However, a physical Switch 2 edition is set to launch on 16th April, if you prefer your games small, red, and solid.
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, Eurogamer had good things to say about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">gave it four stars last year</a>, saying that while "not all its additions are for the better... this excavation of Monolith Soft's alien opus remains as fascinating and enthralling as it was a decade ago." Now do Xenoblade Chronicles 2 next Nintendo, please.

            <section><p>Styx: Blades of Greed isn't quite as well cut out as a fine piece of quartz, but it's easily the best stealth game in years - and so utterly compelling you'll be desperate to get back to it when you have to do boring un-murdery things like, I dunno, going to the shops, or feeding the cat.</p></section>
<p>Boy am I glad to see Styx again. Not because I felt any great yearning to return to the murky, Temu-Warhammer dark fantasy setting of long-forgotten RPG Of Orcs and Men, you understand. But because Blades of Greed represents an ever dwindling chunk of ore from that once rich seam of B-tier games that are just bloody good at what they do. The zenith of the "shorter games with worse graphics" category that people on Bluesky claim to want (and rarely seem to actively seek out, alas).</p>

<p>But don't let the lack of a studio-shuttering budget colour your expectations: Styx 3 is marvellous on almost every front. Picking up literally minutes after the cliffhanger ending of his last outing, 2017's Shards of Darkness, this latest installment throws a dash of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> into the pot, with the eponymous goblin assembling a crew of fellow outlaws, fugitives, and misfits on board a floating ship of thieves. The goal? Collect shards of quartz, a mysterious magical ore that is a crucial energy source for the evil human empire and its Inquisition, a ruthless wizard gestapo intent on eradicating the non-human races and generally not being that nice to humans either.</p>
<p>Stealing shards of quartz from all over the continent disrupts human operations and keeps the stuff out of Inquisition hands, but most importantly, it's a convenient device for weaving RPG-lite character progression into the narrative. Styx is effectively a drug addict, always laser-focused on getting his next hit of quartz, as absorbing it grants him magical abilities. These quartz-derived abilities, along with your innate goblin talents and a set of Batman gadgets are managed via skill trees. It's similar to the way a motivating heroin addiction makes you really good at pinching car radios.</p>

<p>And it's a good core analogy for the entire thing: in a world-building sense, the Styx story is about a ravenous, ruinous empire addicted to conquest. In a meta sense, the game itself is astoundingly compelling: a Pringles can of objectives to methodically sneak, stab, and steal your way through that is more moreish than the Iberian peninsula.</p><p>It's a curious structure for a game with grand, open-world ambitions. Proudly touted as a true Metroidvania, Styx 3 is set across three vast and beautifully distinct murder playgrounds over which the all-important quartz shards are scattered. The Wall is your main stomping ground: a location previously depicted in Of Orcs and Men, which divides the continent between the realms of those races and is a sort of big, dirty hybrid of Hadrian's Wall, the old London Bridge, and the Burj Khalifa: a staggering, labyrinthine tangle of building regs violations, medieval bustle, and impossible verticality.</p>
<p>The second major location is Turquoise Dawn, a tangled alien jungle in which rests a fusion of Orcish tree city and wood-fashioned Imperial outpost: a feast for the eyes, and not at all similar to The Wall aesthetically or structurally, where you're much more likely to die from misadventure or bug attack. Lastly, the ruined tower of Akenash: the entire setting of the first Styx game, reimagined as a warped apocalypse zone full of magical abominations and roving bands of Dark Elves on the hunt for relics.</p>

</figure>
<p>Akenash is especially interesting if you remember 2014's Styx: Master of Shadows, which I reviewed way back when and revisited a few weeks back in anticipation of this release. It's a fine example of a particularly marvellous thing that only video game sequels can do: the chance to explore an old stomping ground in a new context, warped by time (or magical disaster). The Akenash in Blades of Greed is recognisably a post-disaster remix of the original levels, now presented from angles previously unavailable via a series of floating islands and Styx's array of unlockable traversal options that are metered out over the course of the game's story and provide the Metroidvania part of this delicious genre cocktail.Batman's grapple, Link's glider, Corvo's blink… a bit of everything is borrowed to give Styx an expanding set of tools for accessing ever grander parts of each map, unfolding beautifully like an origami chicken in a deft example of measured, finely tuned pacing.</p><p>A set number of quartz shards must be collected to advance from each act to the next. This takes something that would be a side-objective in, say, a recent Assassin's Creed game and puts it front and centre: this is not a game about icon janitoring, but a tightly focused to-do list with an extraordinary amount of freedom in how you go about it. Over the course of the game I've stumbled across numerous alternate ways to get past particular obstacles. Many areas can be skipped entirely if you care to explore off the beaten path and make regular use of your "amber vision" (a detective mode dependent on amber, a liquid macguffin from the first game that is also a type of drug; Styx is a massive junkie).</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>NACON/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are five story acts in total, separated by linear, setpiece stages designed to tutorialise whatever new traversal gimmick you've just unlocked while allowing the game to showcase unique, one-shot areas as postcards of the wider world. This is, mercifully, not a full-on open world pivot for the series but its instanced, linear approach to widening and narrowing the scope at key intervals keeps things interesting, as well as making the world just feel larger than a true open world ever really manages.</p>
<p>What isn't as successful are the cutscenes. Necessary for plot transport, sure, but often comically naff: partly for annoying technical reasons that have plagued the Unreal engine since the Xbox 360 days to varying degrees, but mostly because the voice acting is about 50 percent wretched. Most of the line delivery is functional but lacking any sort of charisma or flair, like the performer would have the exact same inflection reading the shipping forecast. A good deal of it is simply dreadful, as horridly miscast and clumsily delivered as the average school play. Add to this the Unreal-ness of it all, that engine's particular difficulty with camera cuts (why are you redrawing the entire scene from scratch every time we change angles? Why?!), audio cues that ping in entirely the wrong places, and various other minor annoyances.</p>



<p>Luckily, the cutscenes don't form a high percentage of the experience, this isn't Metal Gear after all. In pure gameplay terms, Blades of Greed absolutely sings. Its traversal is a rush to the senses, a game where you cover large distances with death-defying stunts and acrobatic feats like impossible ledge-grabs and riding vortex-like air currents half way to the skybox and back. And then, slinking around the small spaces, ducking under tables, scampering up walls, slithering through drains, grabbing any and all of the burgeoning opportunities on offer to position yourself for the kill, or the snatch. The array of magical abilities on Styx's cheat sheet certainly make things fun, often inspiring the intense dopamine hit that comes when a game convinces you that you've gotten one over on the baddies. The rush of having planned and executed the perfect crime: a loosened chandelier here, a distraction there, a mind-controlled armoured guard puppeteered into plunging to his doom, why not? It's only amber.</p><p>And yet some of the most thrilling time you'll have with Styx is when you <em>don't </em>have the amber to spare. When you can't just Derren Brown your way around a problem. When you can't vomit up a clone to go and pull the lever while you stay in the rafters. Resources are scarce enough that on plenty of occasions, you are simply unable to deploy gadgets or special talents and must solve the current puzzle of getting past some guards in a room by utilising the very basic tools that you had before you even booted the game up: hiding, observing, patience, and timing. Every scrape can be survived and every puzzle can be solved with just these fundamentals, and every blunder into open conflict will get you killed. This is what makes Styx 3 a true stealth game, a proper stealth game, as distinct from the franchise bloat that has, for example, made Assassin's Creed into a straight up action RPG where the virtues of silence and shadow are paid a lot of lip service but ultimately are entirely optional.</p>

<p>Not so here. For those of us who frankly prefer all this sneaking around to a straight fight, Blades of Greed is the real deal, and despite a shift in the general direction of a more open world-ish experience it has, whether via creative restraint or the absence of an infinite budget, resisted the urge to load up on empty calories. Like the titular goblin himself, Styx 3 is smart, and lean. But it has also cracked the formula: previous Styx games relied far too much on reusing locations, which often felt stifling, and killed the sense of progress. What Blades of Greed manages to do with its Metroidvania sensibilities is craft a set of locations that you absolutely don't mind revisiting. I'll go further than that: when the set pieces and story cutscenes are done, they are a joy to return to.</p>
<p>And what this leads to is the conclusion that, not only is this the best Styx game by a wide margin, it's also the best stealth game in years. Styx, you horrid, grotty little git, I didn't realise how much I needed you back. Please don't wait a decade next time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-are-losing-the-attention-war-to-gambling-porn-and-crypto-according-to-industry-report</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-are-losing-the-attention-war-to-gambling-porn-and-crypto-according-to-industry-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report by Epyllion, a gaming industry advisory company headed by venture capitalist and market guru Matthew Ball, has broken down the state of the video game industry, and has published data indicating the medium is losing the war for people's attention to other ventures, including gambling, crypto, and pornography.</p>
<p><a href="https://issuu.com/ballmatthew/docs/gaming2025_vee10?fr=xIAEoAT3_MzMz">The report</a>, a lengthy 164-page presentation which you can (and should) read yourself, dedicates a whole section called "Video Games are losing the attention war in the 'Major Market 8'" to the topic. It starts by comparing pre and post pandemic consumer spending from eight major video game markets - the USA, Japan, South Korea, UK, Germany, France, Canada, and Italy.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, these countries made up over 60 percent of total spending on video games. Post-pandemic, almost all of these regions have seen a drop in gaming population. In the US, 2.5-4 points worth of players stopped playing video games, the Canadian Trade Association found in its latest report that roughly one-in-six players prior to the pandemic have stopped playing.</p>
<p>These decreases in participation have resulted, the report posits, in a drop in spending. In the US, PC and console spend is down eight percent since 2020 / 2021, which comes to roughly $2.3bn. Mobile gaming's US annual growth in terms of spending has largely flattened since 2025, but it's still above 12 percent compared to 2020, and now beats out console spend.</p><p>Total spend across all "Major Market 8" regions on console and PC shrunk by $4.8bn, and mobile is down by $2.3bn, all while five of these eight markets are at all-time highs in terms of total spend. This money is instead going elsewhere, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> for example, which the report states makes up 67 percent of net growth.</p>
<p>So that's a lot of dire-sounding figures, but why is this happening? Where is all this attention and money going? Well, chapter four of the report links this drop to multiple other mediums garnering people's attention. These are social video, creator pornography, AI assistants, crypto and memecoins, prediction markets, online sports betting, and igaming &amp; icasinos.</p>
<p>In just the US consumption of Tiktok is up 39m hours a day compared to pre-COVID figures. In the 2025, American consumers spent roughly $5bn on Onlyfans. Crypto currency too has been siphoning attention and money from video games according to the report. While its first boom happened during the pandemic video game boom, its second rise in popularity among the public happened in 2025 while the video game industry stagnated.</p>
<p>During this 2025 period, AI apps that allowed for "role play, erotica, and art" have soared. The latest tracked statistic for installs for this software came to just under one billion worldwide.</p>
<p>Prediction markets, where users can bet on events that happen in the world, also had a recent boom in popularity. Users placed 1.5m bets a day during Q4 2025. Online Sports Betting is also taking potential users' money. In 2025, US net losses due to sports betting passed $17bn, a 35x increase from 2019 as these sorts of services become normalised, legalised, and integrated into sports in the USA. Despite bans in other countries, international net losses are around $53bn a year.</p><p>iGaming, which include online casinos, are yet another avenue from gambling which the report raises as an alternative path of gamer's money. iGaming is twice the size of the mobile casino game category in terms of growth, and 21 percent of <strong>all</strong> US video game spend. Worldwide, gamers lose $54bn a year in legal iGaming, which accounts for 45 percent of global gaming spending.</p>
<p>The report states: "Video Gaming's post-pandemic problem isn't that players choose to watch TikTok instead of buying a AAA game, or subscribe to Onlyfans instead of buying a PlayStation; it's that on a Friday evening, players are placing a growing share of their time and spend <em>elsewhere</em>."</p>

            <p>Floundering PvP shooter Highguard lives on, as developer Wildlight releases a new content update and assures worried fans that ominous signs like the game's website going offline are "low priority" problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">The new content update</a>, released overnight, adds an airship-featuring base to the game, a lockpick raid tool, and expands what's on sale in the Store. There's an owlbear-like mount there called a Moonbruin, and some Iron Vigil-themed outfits.</p>
<p>The patch arrives amidst growing concern that Highguard is about to shut down - an assumption that follows a bad start for the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">resulting in lay-offs at Wildlight</a>, and more recently, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the game's website suddenly going offline</a>. (It's still offline, by the way.)</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Q286nJoqI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>But Wildlight remains outwardly resolute despite these setbacks, insisting in the game's Discord overnight that the website issue is nothing sinister. "Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified," explained Wildlight staff member WL_Coronach (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2024081430674800915/photo/2">screenshotted by CharlieIntel</a>). "Low priority atm (reputational damage already done). Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve."</p>
<p>These comments follow a statement sent to Eurogamer earlier this month, regarding the layoffs, in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildguard said a "core group of developers" would remain to support Highguard</a>, and that the game wasn't about to close.</p>
<p>Highguard's had a hard time ever since closing The Game Awards in December. Despite the prominence of such an announcement and the proximity of a January release date, the game remained almost invisible until release, suggesting there were problems. Then when Highguard did finally arrive - a game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> pedigree - it failed to convince. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">"We were turned into a joke from minute one," former Highguard developers said</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Match of the Day football commentator Guy Mowbray has revealed he gave EA permission to create an AI voice clone of himself in order to assist with some of the more onerous aspects of recording commentary for EA Sports FC.
</p>
<p>
Mowbray shared the news as part of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c4g40828ngjo">BBC feature exploring how EA Sports FC's commentaries are made</a>, explaining that these days, recording or preparing for the game is a "part of my weekly routine", taking up "pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July."
</p>
<p>
"It takes so long because for every single facet of the game that you could think of, we have to cover every scenario," he revealed. "It is so in-depth because it has got to feel and sound real - the whole point of the game is its authenticity."
</p>
<p>
According to the report, one of the most repetitive elements of the recording process is reading out the name of every player in the game. Each name must be recorded several times, in different intonations, in order to fit within the wider commentary, and EA Sports FC features "more than 20,000 real male and female footballers". As such, EA now uses AI to replicate Mowbray's voice - with his permission - to "help" with this aspect of recording.
</p><p>
"AI has long been part of our development pipeline, from animation to gameplay systems," EA told the BBC in reference to its AI usage, "and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences. But when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement."
</p>

Generative AI does, of course, remain hugely controversial given the numerous ethical concerns associated with the technology. And it's proved particularly contentious in the realm of video game voice acting. Last year, US voice actors union SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/voice-actors-relieved-to-have-the-freedom-to-work-again-says-jennifer-hale-as-sag-aftra-strike-ends">ended a lengthy strike</a> after finally securing "safety guardrails" around AI - and one of the union's key requirements was that companies pay actors on an equivalent basis for digitally replicated voices.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has flattened hope for a major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> overhaul by stating that the long-awaited update in development "is not Starfield 2.0".</p>
<p>This, to recap, is the update the Starfield community has been speculating about for roughly a year, ever after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-starfield-bethesda-reassures-fans-it-has-exciting-things-planned-for-2025-as-wait-continues-for-news-on-whats-next">Bethesda assured players it had "a lot of exciting things planned"</a>. This was a comment made in the silence following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">the somewhat anticlimactic release of Starfield's major Shattered Space add-on</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">the Kinda Funny podcast</a> yesterday, Howard said: "Obviously we've been working on a lot of Starfield content [...] You've seen it and I can tell everyone we're going to be talking about it really soon. We're moving into a phase where we're ready to talk about Starfield and really show that in the right way and what's coming to the game. We've been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.</p>

"So for expectation-setting, it's the kind of thing where if you love Starfield, we think you're going to love this. It's updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but [in a] sort of meta [way] - using outer space and things in ways that we haven't.</p>
<blockquote><em>"If Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away [...] I don't think this is going to change that fundamentally"</em></blockquote>
<p>"But look, if Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away, or you bounced off it or found it boring in places, I don't think this is going to change that fundamentally."</p>
<p>Podcast host Greg Miller later asked Howard whether the update was imminent, to which Howard replied: "It's soonish. I don't want to spoil the day but it is coming soon." Miller also asked whether the update was a final update for the game, a sort of bow-tying closure, to which Howard said no. "No, we're doing more Starfield stuff coming up - we've been laying that out. It's something we see continuing for a while."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review">Starfield was released in 2023 to middling reviews</a>, leading to a general sense that it wasn't the post-Skyrim and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> homerun Bethesda had hoped to hit. But it still seems to have a healthy audience. In this interview, Howard referred to Starfield as a "Game Pass hours beast". "We have such a big audience on the game," he said.</p>

<p>Bethesda Game Studio's attention has more recently been on Fallout, following the launch of a second TV series that seemed to be received very well. I haven't finished it yet but Alex Donaldson was very positive, writing in an article that: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2 has made me excited for the future of the games - is there anything better a TV tie-in can do?</a>"</p>
<p>As far as game development goes, the majority of Bethesda Game Studios' 500-person workforce (Howard shared this number in the podcast) is concentrating on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">the sixth Elder Scrolls game</a>. (Note that BGS fairly openly uses external development partners - outsourcers - so the actual number of people working on its games is likely significantly higher). Howard referenced this new Elder Scrolls game in the podcast as well, explaining that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-majority-of-people-who-made-skyrim-are-still-here-bethesda-boss-on-why-the-elder-scrolls-6-will-be-more-like-skyrim-or-oblivion-than-starfield">The Elder Scrolls 6 marks a return to a more "classic" style of game for the studio</a> - think Skyrim or Oblivion - rather than the "creative detour" represented by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and Starfield.</p>

            <p>Do you have a sense of deja vu? Because dataminers believe they've discovered more evidence that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> could be coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> - a sentence we've already typed out here at Eurogamer in the year 2026.</p>
<p>That's right, we're back on familiar ground following the release of a massive update for Capcom's latest action-RPG this week, in which the Japanese publisher unleashed a flood of new content into the game to tide us all over until the next big DLC drop comes (which we're apparently going to hear more about in the summer). </p>
<p>As part of this big, final update, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/">sleuths digging through the game</a>'s newly-updated code think that they have unearthed more evidence that the game has a Switch 2 version in the works (hat tip, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-uncover-strongest-evidence-yet-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), in the form of a tutorial image depicting Switch 2 local multiplayer. The image was apparently hidden away in the files, and isn't supposed to be seen in any current front-end version of the game, but is nestled neatly in the update files. Uh-oh!
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>An images supposedly data-mined from the newest Monster Hunter Wilds patch. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This follows on from data strings found in the backend of Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4, in which a group of Chinese dataminers believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">they found references to a Switch 2 port</a>, including information about wireless multiplayer, graphical presets, and reportedly "300 detailed parameters across four platforms: PS5, PC, Xbox Series, and Switch 2".
</p><p>The latest Wilds update, though, removed these older text strings. The lord giveth, the lord taketh away, it seems. At least we know from these earlier leaks that a potential Switch 2 version of Wilds will contain "a shadow quality preset for the Switch 2's docked 'Graphics Mode' that is higher than the PC's 'Very Low' preset" and that, in docked mode, the "'Graphics Mode' outputs at 1080p". Given the performance issues Wilds has suffered on PC to date, that's pretty impressive. If it works.</p>
<p>Right now, there's no formal word from Capcom that the game could be making the jump to Switch 2, but Capcom has long been a supporter of Nintendo's platform: we're even getting Resident Evil Requiem at launch on the handheld, and that runs on the same engine as Monster Hunter Wilds, so... stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>It'll be nice for Monster Hunter Wilds to have <em>a bit of a win</em>: since it launched in February 2025, the game suffered <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">under-performing sales with a fall-off post-launch</a>, and even contributed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">a dip in Capcom's share price</a>. Here's hoping that, with a second bite of the apple, Monster Hunter Wilds can rehabilitate its image to some degree.</p>

            <p>Bungie is uploading four tracks from the Marathon official sound track to major music streaming platforms later today, in the build-up to the game's launch on the 5th March.</p>
<p>These tracks are Rhythm of Writhing Constellations, Focused Erasures and Sub-Routine Resets, We Stole a Moon, and Code Race [Extended]. Alongside this announcement, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2024295371095363688">a 20 second snippet of one of the songs was uploaded to X</a>.</p>
<p>The soundtrack, composed by Ryan Lott of Son Lux, has been sprinkled throughout pre-release trailers for the game. It's already garnered attention from fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-there-such-a-bustling-community-around-marathons-soundtrack-when-the-game-isnt-even-out-yet-one-producer-tells-us-why">who have begun making remixes of their own</a> in preparation for the full release.</p>
<p>Marathon,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too"> which is due to host a server slam public test in later February</a>, seems to be well-positioned for its launch. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">soared to the top of Steam's Top Sellers page</a> when pre-orders were made available, and it got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">a new trailer during this month's Sony State of Play</a>. Those picking it up on PlayStation will be able to unlock a selection of PlayStation charms, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">though similar cosmetics will be available on PC and Xbox</a>.</p><p>This, after a rough patch of stumbles for the game. Bungie had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">overhaul many aspects of the gameplay</a> following the mixed reception to a previous closed play test, and visually the game came under fire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-plagiarism-scandal-resolved-satisfaction-of-artist">after it was discovered plagiarised art assets were present</a> in an earlier version of the game.</p>
<p>Are you excited for the Marathon soundtrack?</p>

            <p>It feels like we've heard a lot about Bethesda's mysterious, upcoming RPG, The Elder Scrolls 6, lately. The publisher has been very tight-lipped about the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-todd-howard-and-team-have-settled-on-a-region-for-the-elder-scrolls-6">which we first started hearing about in 2018</a>, for the past eight years. We once got a title card, and that's about it. It was only recently we started learning more litle nuggets of information about the game after Bethesda's long silence on the project - whether it's how an old designer thought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-could-have-been-like-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back">it was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</a>, or how Bethesda boss man <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">Todd Howard wishes development "went a little faster"</a>, we've heard more in the past few months than the past few years combined.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disappoint us with this relatively break-neck dripfeed of information, Bethesda director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has given a surprisingly candid interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">KindaFunny</a>. The veteran Bethesda creative gives us a few interesting tidbits, noting that he wishes the team didn't reveal the game so early - not for the first time - and that after a meandering "creative detour" in the form of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, the team is looking back to its classic formula for The Elder Scrolls 6.</p>
<p>"We do have a certain style that we like and that our fans like that we want to get better and better at," Howard said in the interview. "I think in some ways Fallout 76 and Starfield are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a Skyrim or a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> or a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way. And as we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well."
</p>
<p>If you were dubious about the capabilities of the engine that powered Starfield living up to current-gen expectations, fret not: Howard also noted that Bethesda has been deep in research and development over the past few years, and the resulting Creation Engine 3 is a marked step up from the Creation Engine 2 that powered 2023's divisive space-faring RPG. The Creation Engine 3 will be the bast for "Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond." (Let's all agree nobody's to say "Fallout 5" yet.)
</p><p>Finally, if you need a bit of confidence in the team working on The Elder SCrolls 6, Howard teases "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here," alongside a wave of new talent in the studio, too. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">The game is still a long way off,</a> though, so don't get too excited about that just yet. Even if some fans think we're going to get some sort of teaser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">sooner, rather than later</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-one-of-the-best-survival-games-ever-just-got-a-free-switch-2-upgrade<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>Is there a more terrifying sound in video games than the roar of a Reaper Leviathan or the irritated gurgle of a Crashfish as it suddenly torpedoes toward you from shadows unseen? I mean, yes, probably - but that's not the point. Every time I slip the word "horror" into conversations about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, it's usually met with dismissals and frowns. And sure, developer Unknown Worlds' sublime underwater survival adventure isn't <em>technically</em> horror, but I can think of few games capable of instilling such an ominous sense of dread in me, such a suffocating fear of the watery unknown, as this one. And with Subnautica's free <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> update now here, what better time for reminiscences and to make myself unreasonably anxious all over again?</p>
<p>It is, of course, tricky to talk about Subnautica without acknowledging the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-ceo-allegedly-asked-ai-to-brainstorm-ways-to-avoid-paying-earnout-bonus-to-subnautica-2-devs">acrimonious legal battle</a> between Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership (including original Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland) and studio owner Krafton. But even that dark shadow doesn't take away from the fact that Subnautica remains, some eight years after its 1.0 release, one of the best survival games out there. This you'll already know if you've previously made acquaintance with its thalassophobia-inducing rhythms, but for the newcomers among us, some quick scene-setting; things beginning as you, Ryley Robinson - the sole surviving crew member of the starship Aurora - crash into the remote ocean planet of 4546B.</p>

<p>There are signs Subnautica is something a little bit special - that Unknown Worlds has ambitions beyond merely being another (wetter) entry in the overcrowded survival genre - right from the off. Your adventure starts with a wonderfully dramatic set-piece as your tiny escape pod, with you strapped in it, plummets toward 4546B; alarms blaring, fires erupting around you in first-person, and then darkness. And once you regain consciousness and pop open your battered pod's hatch, you get the full visual force of the planet itself - an endless shimmering ocean, stretching toward a horizon only broken by the belching, battered bulk of the half-submerged Aurora. Subnautica is great at doing story, but never in a way that never feels like it's encroaching on your agency. Yes, progress is guided, giving focus to your otherwise fairly open-ended survival adventure, but it's done subtly - Unknown Worlds always taking care to ensure its narrative is borne from a sense of your own exploration and discovery.</p>



<p>As for the survival, it's relatively familiar stuff on a basic level. You'll murder fish for sustenance with your thermoblade, replenish your oxygen once in a while, desalinate seawater to quench your thirst, and scavenge scrap in order to craft and slowly amass new equipment. And that's when things start to get properly interesting. Before long, you'll have a slick, functional underwater base - a place to prepare for expeditions and shelter away from the ocean's deadlier elements - as well as your first submersible, gradually opening 4546B up for further, deeper exploration. And once you escape the crystalline waters of the Safe Shallows, things get stranger, darker, and - I don't care what anyone says - absolutely bloody terrifying.</p><p>You'll explore kelp forests as huge saw-nosed things charge at you through the murk; investigate mysterious underground caverns and squeal at their pouncing, serpentine inhabitants; inch across vast expanses of darkness, punctuated by occasional splashes of bioluminescence and... worse. Subnautica's striking environmental design is wonderfully memorable, fully selling the illusion of a vast underwater world, and it only gets weirder, more oppressive the further you go. You'll meet lumbering pole-legged creatures on distant dunes, aggressive crab squids with eerily translucent forms in gloomier corners, and eventually (although you'll likely hear them long before you see them) come Subnautica's apex predators: the pincer-faced Leviathans - as massively intimidating as they sound.</p>

<p>And as Unknown Worlds slowly nudges you downward, deeper, the light of the surface ebbing completely away, well - I don't mind admitting that was the point, surrounded by the suffocating horror of yawning nothingness, I had to put the controller down for a while. Throughout all this wide-eyed exploratory wonder/terror, Unknown Worlds seeds new discoveries, new story moments and set-pieces, new surprises, all pushing you toward an end point in a way that feels natural and properly satisfying. It's a brilliantly designed, beautifully refined survival adventure (the voice acting and synth-heavy soundtrack are stellar too) and it's one I've been intrigued to revisit even as my Leviathan-ravaged nerves protest the idea.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-and-below-zero-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-announced">Subnautica's new Switch 2 update</a>. It's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/subnautica-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/">available right now as a free upgrade</a> for owners of the original Switch release, bringing promise of a boost to visuals, resolution, and performance. Subnautica has always run a bit erratically, even on a decent PC, so expectations were never particularly high when it came to the Switch 1 release; but the compromises of that version give way to something a little smoother and more striking on Switch 2 - even if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3MeZ2Ral2o">early reports suggest</a> it doesn't hit its 60fps target with any real consistency. But still, there's something enormously appealing about returning to Subnautica on a handheld - and not just (but mainly, I admit) because I feel like it'll be considerably less intimidating on a small screen. And when I'm done with that, Subnautica's standalone expansion Below Zero has been given a Switch 2 upgrade too, and I've not played that one at all. To 4546B or not to 4546B, then, that is the question - and I reckon I'm ready to dive back in.</p>

            <p>
An advert released to promote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has been banned after the UK's Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints that it "trivialised sexual violence" following an investigation.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in a <a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/activision-blizzard-uk-ltd-g25-1319083-activision-blizzard-uk-ltd.html">ruling shared on the regulator's website</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/call-of-duty-advert-banned-in-the-uk-for-trivialising-sexual-violence-">Game Developer</a>), the advert - which began airing on YouTube and Video on Demand channels last November - focused on an airport security check where two security officers were, according to dialogue, "Off playing the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 7." Standing in for the officers were two "replacers".
</p>
<p>
"A male member of the public was then shown to be passing through the metal detector," the ASA description continues. "A male security officer said, 'You've been randomly selected to be manhandled – face the wall!' and turned the man around. The female security officer was then shown to be licking her teeth while picking up a prescription container and shaking it, before showing it to the male officer who winked back at her.
</p>
<p>
"The male officer then told the man, 'I'm gonna need you to remove your clothes, everything but the shoes.' The woman then put on a pair of gloves and said, 'Time for the puppet show!' A post-credit scene showed the male officer putting a hand-held metal detector in the man's mouth and said, 'Bite down on this, she's going in dry.'" 
</p><p>
The ASA says it received a total of 11 complaints about the advert. Nine believed it "trivialised sexual violence" and "challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and offensive", while two believed the ad "encouraged or condoned drug use" and "challenged whether the ad was irresponsible".
</p>
<p>
During the ASA's investigation, Activision Blizzard UK told the regulator the advertisement had been reviewed by Clearcast (a non-governmental organisation which pre-approves British TV advertising) which gave it an "ex-kids" timing restriction, meaning it could not be broadcast during or around children's programming or content likely to appeal to under-16s.</p>
<p>Activision also argued the ad "depicted a deliberately implausible, parodic scenario that bore no resemblance to real airport security procedures" and that previous ASA rulings "recognised that ads containing obviously absurd or parodied scenarios reduced the likelihood of being interpreted literally or being viewed as behaviour to emulate."</p>
<p>Addressing complaints of "trivialised sexual violence", the publisher insisted the advert "did not sexualise the act of performing searches and contained no implication that the acts were sexual in nature." It similarly argued the ad did "not depict illegal drugs or misuse of prescription medication."
</p><p>
Despite Activision's assertions, however, the ASA noted that while the advert contained no explicit imagery and while "most viewers would understand the ad was intended to be humorous", the humour was "generated by the humiliation and implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration of the man, an act associated with sexual violence." It also felt that the officers' "confident and joking demeanour presented this [act] in a humorous manner."</p>
<p>"Because the ad alluded to non-consensual penetration, and framed it as an entertaining scenario," the regulator concluded, "we considered that the ad trivialised sexual violence and was therefore irresponsible and offensive." However, it did not uphold complaints regarding drug use, determining the advert was "unlikely to be understood as encouraging or condoning drug use" and was therefore "not irresponsible on that basis."
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the ASA ruled - as a result of the upheld complaints - that the Call of Duty advert "must not appear again in its current form". Activision Blizzard UK was also told to ensure its ads were "socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, for example by trivialising sexual violence". At present, the airport security spot is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH1csdj8oMk">viewable as a video on the official Call of Duty channel</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, the upcoming entry in Konami's legendary horror series, looks to be a console launch exclusive on the PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>This stems from <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/townfall/us/en/">the game's official website</a>, on which only three platforms are listed: Steam, the Epic Games Store, and PS5. There's no mention at all of the Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, or older consoles.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-proper-look-at-silent-hill-townfall">recently got a story trailer</a> revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony's State of Play</a>, showcasing the Scottish town of St. Amelia. Developed by Glasgow-based Screen Burn, it follows the tale of SImon Ordell as he navigates the mysterious town with his CRTV, a small electronic device he seems glued to for better or worse.</p>
<p>The game also got a further explanation courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw">a Silent Hill Transmission</a> hosted by Konami on the 12th February. This gave a further look on how the game will work, its mechanics and story, by the developers at Screen Burn.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">The game was first announced back in 2022</a>, and is one of multiple big SIlent Hill projects that have seen the light of day recently. Obviously there was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">was a great release from Bloober Team</a>, but also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">which also stole the hearts of many horror fans</a>.</p>

            <p>The long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">remake of the first Witcher game</a> is seemingly on the back-burner as CD Projekt Red has reportedly added support studio Fool's Theory to the massive development effort of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Moreover, there have been recurring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">rumours of an all-new Witcher 3 DLC</a> made by the same studio. Meanwhile, original lead story designer Artur Ganszyniec has been revisiting Geralt of Rivia's first big RPG adventure, giving longtime fans all-new insights into the game's making.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@artur-ganszyniec">Ganszyniec's YouTube channel</a> already houses his complete playthrough of the game with valuable commentary, so we highly recommend diehards to slowly chew through it if they have the time. That said, the story designer's most shocking revelation (hat tip to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/that-was-a-mistake-i-think-the-witcher-1s-lead-writer-says-the-story-team-didnt-know-about-its-twist-ending/">VGC</a>) came near the very end, during the 26th and final episode of the series, which you can watch below:</p> <figure>

<p>At the 1:30:22 mark, once the 'artwork cutscene' in line with the rest of the game's ends, he talks about what happened between the story team and the rest of the studio. Apparently, a final CG cutscene (which is part of the game as we all know it) was added without the team knowing it. "That's where we wanted the game to end, with an open question and open future... But while we were finishing the game, someone decided – the board decided or Michał Kiciński (co-founder of CDPR) decided – that we needed an animated outro for the game," Ganszyniec says.</p>
<p>The CG cutscene introduced the idea of Witchers that are hunting down kings, which led directly into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>. "The script for what we're seeing now, this animation, was created not really involving the story team. It was sort of... we weren't really paying attention," the lead story designer adds before elaborating on what the story team's original plans were. "That's why the second Witcher is very political and there's not really room for exploring who Geralt is, his family, his history and stuff like this." If you've played through the entire Geralt trilogy, the shift is obvious, but having more clarity on what went down behind the scenes definitely helps after all these years.</p><p>Regardless, even Ganszyniec concludes he's excited to see how the remake turns out. As for the different route The Witcher 2 took, it could be argued <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</a> went back to a more personal story with Geralt and his family at the centre of a high-stakes epic.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Replaced, the highly-anticipated cyberpunk platformer from Sad Cat Studios, has been delayed.</p>
<p>Replaced is the rather wonderful looking 2.5D "retro-futuristic" sci-fi platformer, which is set in an alternate 1980s America that has been scarred by a nuclear catastrophe. It plops players into the shoes of Reach, an AI who becomes unexpectedly trapped inside a human's body.</p>
<p>But while we were once expecting to get our hands on Replaced next month, the developer has decided to delay its release a notch. In a statement, Sad Cat said while Replaced is "technically finished", it feels a few more weeks to get the game fully "polished, stable, and true to the vision we've shared with you" would be beneficial. As such, Replaced will now launch across PC and Xbox Series X/S on 14th April.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highly-anticipated-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-gets-demo-and-you-can-play-it-this-week">there is a Replaced demo currently available to try out via Steam</a>. Sad Cat called the response to Replaced's demo thus far "the ultimate fuel" for the development team. "To be honest, putting it out there was nerve-wracking, but seeing your gameplay, reading your reviews, and hearing your excitement has been overwhelming in the best way possible," Sad Cat said in the statement announcing Replaced's delay.</p>
<p>"We are constantly reading your comments, and that feedback is helping us make the final tweaks that will make the full game shine."</p>
<p>Sad Cat closed by thanking its community for its "patience and support" in the years since Replaced was first unveiled. "Many of you have followed us on this journey every step of the way, and seeing your passion is what makes these final days and nights of development worth it," the studio said. "We are super close to the finish line and we can't wait for you to experience the final results of years of hard work."</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Replaced has had its release date moved. Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">studio was forced to delay Replaced due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. Then, in 2023, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2024">delayed into 2024</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/25d-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2025">delayed once more into 2025</a>.</p><p>I was recently lucky enough to go hands-on with Replaced. "I really think Replaced has the potential to be something special. I fully expect I will need tissues by the end of it, though, because I have theory about where things are going and well, yeah, emotions. And while emotions alone don't always count for much, it's the brutality and relevance of its dystopian setting that makes such a human heart matter," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/replaced-preview">Eurogamer's Replaced preview</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite what confused Call of Duty players who changed teams would have you believe, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is a notable modern military FPS that's doing <em>fine</em> a few months in, usual bumps in the road included. Now, Season 2 has finally arrived <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-until-february-but-more-content-for-season-1-and-events-are-on-the-way">following a delay</a>, and it's kickstarted new positive and negative discussions.</p>
<p>Even though more maps, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-getting-battlefield-4-map-golmud-railway">fan-favourites from past games</a>, are coming this season, the first phase of S2 is all about Contaminated, a sprawling new location that offers different type of engagements, from medium-range to combat in trenches to close-quarters chaos in closed environments. It's an especially good fit for the attack/defence structure of the classic mode Breakthrough, yet it also adds a new mechanic to the game that's giving some players a headache.</p>
<p>As teased in the explosive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQLakPdVhEc">gameplay trailer</a> released last week, chemical weapons are a key part of this season's narrative and gameplay. It means Contaminated features huge chemical chaos at certain points (as shown off in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJMlK1rHz0">extensive gameplay videos</a> from prominent figures in the FPS space), as the new map's exterior areas are engulfed in giant gas clouds that force every player to use masks, which make return after being a crucial element of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>.</p>
<p>The problem? Some players are having trouble equipping them (whether it's due to messy key binds or bugs) or straight-up dislike the mechanic. On the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/">Steam forums</a> for the game, it's common to find posts like "Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?" and "Gas I'm not a fan of. Died too many times putting mask on and off." Meanwhile, others praise the new map and the different rhythm it brings: "Say what you want, but this season/patch is a huge step in the right direction, so I don’t understand all the hate and negative reviews."</p>

<p>It's the usual back-and-forth, really, perhaps exacerbated by the fact Battlefield 6 admittedly leaned a bit too heavily on a CoD-like vibe to onboard more players at launch, which led to much of the player base fighting over whether the game should borrow more from its biggest (and currently defeated) competitor or stick to what made the series special. So far, it looks like EA and Battlefield Studios are doubling down on large-scale warfare that brings it back even closer to the series' roots, but it's not surprising to see it lose part of its launch-months weight as its future comes into focus.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/">On Reddit</a>, however, the vibes are more positive even if the usual bugs and performance woes that big updates introduce need to be dealt with. "My faith in BF6 has been restored," a veteran said before listing a number of changes that made the game feel better beyond new additions like the aforementioned map and extra weapons. Many joined the chorus, praising the new brand of chaos that Contaminated has brought: "I liked the map... bushes, trenches, bunker... I love it." Some are even more optimistic after just <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022008332488146971?s=20">Phase 1 of S2</a>: "Battlefield Feels Like War Again, And That Is A Very Good Sign," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1r760za/s2_battlefield_feels_like_war_again_and_that_is_a/">thread</a>'s title states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the more realistic players are just wondering how long it'll be before the volatile community turns on the devs again: "How long does it take to be back at only hate posts on Reddit?" Immediately, many users suggested it would be a matter of hours or even minutes. Never change, Battlefield veterans. Never change.</p>

            <p>Today, in News I Didn't Expect To Ever Write, I bring to you <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Souji Souai LOVE</a>, a free game by chemical and cosmetics giant Kao Corporation that stars idols, only the idols are cleaning products. As in... their heads are bottles of detergent and other products. Japan once again proves its marketing game is centuries ahead of the rest of the world's.</p>
<p>The shocking news came to our attention via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/finally-an-idolmaster-clone-game-where-the-idols-are-all-detergents-and-cleaning-agents/">Automaton</a>. The site details the game is a 20-minute visual novel-style sim that has players embody a "rookie producer" tasked with making sure the group Shining4's debut performance isn't a failure. In traditional VN fashion, you must get to know each team member better and help them with menial tasks, such as... cleaning toilets (using their heads, I guess).</p>
<p>"It's exactly like one of my wacky animes," you might be thinking, and yeah, you're totally right. Souji Souai LOVE doesn't feature <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-EFRFk4fA0">little girls transforming into cars after drinking gas</a>, but it's odd enough from the get-go, and its catchy central song goes the extra mile to sell us on Kao's pitch:</p> <figure>

<p>Needless to say, a decent amount of money, time, and talent went into this marketing stunt, and Japanese social media users are shocked the company even got singer and voice actor Yoshiki Nakajima (The Idolmaster: SideM) and J-pop artist Kent Ito, among others, to voice these characters. "The four idols are Kyukyutto (dish soap), Bath Magiclin (bathtub cleaner), Toilet Magiclin (toilet bowl cleaner), and Quickle Wiper Three-dimensional Wet Sheets (for cleaning floors), all based on real-life products," Automaton's report revealed.</p><p>The game can be played through <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Kao's official homepage</a> and works on PC and mobile. It may not be for everyone, but considering how much time the average Internet user spends every day doomscrolling on social media, this seems like a better use of a fraction of one's daily phone time.</p>

            <p>After showing off a selection of PlayStation-exclusive charms for in-game weapons, the Marathon social media account has indicated that similar charms will be coming to other platforms like PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>This post, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023835955149623660">made in response to a community question on the matter</a>, states:"We'll have weapons charms for Steam and Xbox players as well, which we'll share more about in the future!"</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023819735737967016">The charms shown off</a> for PlayStation players include little weapon cosmetics referencing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. So for PC and console, one wonders what sort of other games will get nods in the form of such attachments.</p>
<p>Things really seem to be ramping up for Marathon. Not only did it take up a big spot during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">the recent Sony State of Play</a>, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Server Slam test</a> happening between the 26th February until the 2nd March. Finally, players will be able to make their own mind up on whether the game is a hit or a miss.</p><p>The game has certainly ran into its fair share of hurdles during development. Initial feedback on previous tests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">weren't entirely positive</a>, with many criticising the PvE aspect of the game as well as missing features like proximity voice. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">a massive plagiarism scandal</a>, which required developers to comb through the game to remove elements of work belonging to artist Antireal.</p>
<p>The game's journey to launch is nearly at an end, with the game launching next month on the 5th March. Will you be checking it out? Let us know!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is almost here, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">we're confident it might be a hit</a>, especially after learning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-pokopia-has-minecraft-style-persistent-servers-director-confirms">Minecraft-like persistent servers</a> are part of the game. Now we're just hoping it delivers on all its promise when it launches on 5th March. Wanna get more hyped tho?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu's massive interview</a> with key creatives on the game had already given us plenty of interesting tidbits, and the latest (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-pokopia-boasts-largest-development-team-in-omega-force-history-with-dragon-quest-builder-2s-game-and-art-director-on-board/">Automaton</a>) confirms the project enlisted Omega Force (a Koei Tecmo studio) only after a group of developers saw and was instantly fascinated by Game Freak's original vision for Pokopia.</p>
<p>As reported before, it was game and map designer (now senior director) <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-pokopia-creator-says-the-idea-came-from-his-rookie-days-placing-grass-on-the-map-at-game-freak/">Shigeru Ohmori's work on Ruby and Sapphire</a> placing grass patches and vegetation that first inspired the idea for a simulator which encouraged player creativity and was all about creating a world for the Pokémon to live in. The concept wouldn't evolve until "more than 20 years" later, when Ohmori delivered a game prototype and promotional video that prompted Game Freak to take the pitch more seriously.</p>
<p>Producer Kanako Murata confirmed to Famitsu that Koei Tecmo was brought in after some of its key <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-quest-builders-2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> creatives saw Ohmori's materials, which "provided such a clear picture of the game's vision" that Omega Force felt they could contribute massively to it alongside Game Freak. The rest is history, and we're about to play the final result soon.</p><p>The new report also highlights the development team and Game Freak worked together "over the course of 3 to 4 months before commencing development in earnest," which apparently didn't take very long either; game director Takuto Edagawa and art director Marina Ayano (DQ Builders 2 veterans) stated "all involved parties" solved the core problems and more unique ideas before entering full development.</p>
<p>A time frame wasn't revealed, but it sounds like Pokémon Pokopia has ultimately been one of those projects where everything comes together nicely and the finish line was never too far away. Will it be the cozy life sim of many fans' dreams? I sure hope so.</p>

            <p>I feel for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. It's a bit like an athlete that goes to an Olympics and makes it to a final but doesn't place. It's a great achievement, a success by many people's standards, but history doesn't care.</p>
<p>And Avowed seemed to be a success when it came out a year ago. It had a bigger moment than I expected it to, than many people expected it to, because there were doubts about Obsidian's fantasy game before it arrived. But when it got here and people played it, we all seemed pleasantly surprised. I wrote almost exactly that in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">my Avowed review</a>: "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises," I said. Yet here we are a year on, as the PlayStation 5 version arrives, and we seem to be asking ourselves the same thing: is Avowed worth our time?</p>

<p>I get it. Last year was tough for a role-playing game because there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and it bewitched everyone and gobbled up all the awards. It vacuumed the air out of the room. And even if there wasn't Clair Obscur, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, another big hitter, and there was Oblivion: Remastered and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. There was a lot in or around that RPG space. Even Obsidian, developer of Avowed, released another RPG in The Outer Worlds 2 - there's nothing like tangentially competing with yourself. It meant that 2025 was so busy that when it came time to reflect upon it, Avowed was overlooked - it only just squeaked into our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">'best games of 2025'</a> list.</p><p>It's a shame because we know the game is good, and it's unfair that Avowed, despite success, seems destined for life as an underdog. Though in another way, it helps reframe Avowed in what I think is a more appealing way, because I believe it's a nice example of a modern double-A game - bigger than most, sure, but also with an intentionally limited scope compared to your mega-blockbusters. Avowed isn't quite at the top-end and nor is it anywhere near the bottom. If I'm being really unkind, I'd say it was dated to look at and stiff in animation. But it doesn't matter in a double-A game, because what a double-A game lacks in looks, it usually makes up for in character.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This isn't meant as an insult Avowed in any way. There are plenty of moments where the game is capable of wowing with beauty, particularly environmentally, as you explore its fantasy land that's been seemingly doused in psychedelic-laced Miracle Grow. Exuberantly coloured plants of colossal proportion fight for control of the light, overlapping each other while delightfully framing your view. It's a trippy kind of paradise, and it's a refreshing sight in a marketplace clogged by melancholic grimdark fantasy. And extend that thought a little bit and you get at the game's character itself.</p>
<p>This is a fantasy role-playing game that's admirably clear-headed about what it is. Avowed is escapism and adventure. It is romping and clambering around a paradisiacal island while thumping hordes of baddies and leaping off high ledges into small pools (shout-out to whichever developer hand placed these). The game isn't complicated. There's no convoluted social game to play, very little tactical mastery to employ, and little to slow you down or get in your way. It's a game about doing. There's no genre subversion, no po-faced complex meaning between the lines, no heavy emotional burden. Avowed is a game about the simple pleasures of play.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Xbox Game Studios / Obsidian Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That doesn't mean it's dumb - please don't get that impression. Avowed might not have the dating game that's in, say, Baldur's Gate 3, but that doesn't mean you can't grow close to companions, or that they don't have deep and meaningful storylines. Kai in particular, the fish-faced fellow from the promo images, has a really touching story to tell, and I thought Yatzli, the small furry lady, was hilarious. There's humour here, a lot of it. And while there's no heavy tactical side to the game, there is plenty of theorycrafting in how you mix and match weapons and abilities in freeform combat and customisation. And the realisation of combat, the physicality of it, is tremendous. There's heft and wallop, and when you start combining freezing magic with hammer blows, say, systems converge in wonderfully destructive ways.</p><p>Avowed is a game preoccupied with fun, I think, and with play, perhaps as a game should be. Even exploring the game's world, which is broken into a handful of regions, there's a sense you're exploring purposefully designed playgrounds which are intentionally populated with climbing frames and hidey holes masking subterranean worlds - or eccentric NPCs waiting to regale you with nonsensery. You can almost feel the designer's eyes on you wherever you go, and I enjoy that, I find it reassuring. Adventure seems to be everywhere.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This is a long way of saying don't overlook Avowed again - it deserves more than that, and yes it is absolutely worth your time. And a year has treated the game well. There are new abilities to play with, new races to play as, a new weapon type, a new game plus option, a photo mode, and myriad tweaks and fixes. It's the sort of stuff I'm sore about not being in the game when I played it - not that it will make a fundamental difference, but still, these are the grace notes and flourishes and expanded options I appreciate. In short, Avowed is better than it once was, and it was already better than I think most people give it credit for.</p>
<p>Look, February is a grim month where I live, cold and miserable and dreary, and that's exactly what Avowed is not. This is a much needed dose of gaming sunshine. It's only a shame there aren't more games like it.</p>

            <p>Crimson Desert will be fully voiced by humans, Pearl Abyss's marketing director has assured in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Speaking with John Paul McDaniel (ItmeJP) and his peers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">the Dropped Frames podcast</a>, marketing director Will Power responded to a question on whether all the voices in upcoming open world action RPG Crimson Desert will be voiced by human beings.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to criticize other games, but all of our voices are done by humans," Power stated. "I'm refraining from saying that 100% of the NPCs have human voices [...] because if that's not the case for even one NPC, I don't want the internet to accuse me of lying. But yes, all the main NPCs and those in side quests have actors' voices. The game features voice acting in different languages."</p>
<p>These languages, as of writing, are English, Korean and Chinese according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/">the game's Steam page</a>, however <a href="https://www.sisaweek.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=228580">previous reporting has claimed that other languages are in the works</a>.</p>
<p>This same interview featured Will Power emphasising that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crimson-desert-has-no-microtransactions-at-launch-says-pearl-abyss">Crimson Desert was a "premium experience"</a>, with no microtransactions whatsoever unlike its predecessor Black Desert Online. The game's been drumming up a lot of excitement as of late with its 19th March release date soon approaching.</p><p>It's a wild time to be alive when fully human-voice performances are something that stands out as a positive in an industry grappling with generative AI technology. However, given the positive reception to the lack of microtransactions and this, there's clear appetite for a polished game made with human hands.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> getting a native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version was one of those no-brainers we expected to see as soon as the console launched, yet it took more than a few months to arrive, and when it finally did, it was a mess. What happened there? It's a game from 2011, for Talos' sake.</p>
<p>If you hadn't been keeping track of the recent situation, the Switch 2 port of Skyrim <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHxhOQsSj6E">arrived in December out of nowhere</a> and promising sharper visuals and stronger performance than its Switch 1 counterpart. The first part was true; Skyrim's Anniversary Edition (the most recent version of the game that comes with plenty of Creation Club content) on Switch 2 was lots sharper and more detailed, landing next to the more recent refreshes of the game and even sporting sharper looks than on handheld PCs due to impressive <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/skyrim-on-switch-2-ps5-level-visuals-marred-by-input-lag">DLSS implementation</a>.</p>
<p>Sadly, the game didn't <em>feel </em>good to play. Note how I'm not saying the performance was bad. Input lag is an entirely different thing, and that was the problem. Veteran players instantly noted the massive issue, and <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/skyrim-suffers-from-kinect-level-input-lag-on-switch-2">Digital Foundry later confirmed everyone's suspicions</a> the game was suffering from terrible delay between pressing buttons and actions happening.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we also wanted a 60 FPS mode for a 2011 game that was already running amazingly well on the Steam Deck and other handheld PCs, but 30 FPS was fine (Skyrim is not a fast-paced game) in exchange for the sharpest portable version of the game we'd seen so far. But you know, put in the work to make it not feel like <em>shite</em> due to unresponsiveness.</p><p>Last month, a quick patch uncapped the framerate, which helped with the overall input lag but felt like a band-aid fix. Plus, resolution and graphical settings were barely altered, so the game never really hit 60 FPS and thus felt wobbly and unstable, especially when Docked, as Switch 2's VRR screen could mask some of its unevenness. <em>Not quite there.</em></p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s Switch 2 port around the corner (24th February), pressure was mounting. How could we be excited for that version of the game when the far simpler Skyrim wasn't running properly? Well, things have changed now, as <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">the just-released 1.2 patch</a> takes a hammer to input lag, stability issues, and overall control awkwardness. More importantly, Performance and Visuals (Quality) modes are now a thing that can be toggled at any time.</p>

</figure>
<p>On paper, the choices are simple: 30 FPS with sharper graphics or 60 FPS with softer visuals due to a lower internal resolution. After spending some time with the game after the patch myself, I can say they work exactly as intended, and even the 30 FPS mode delivers more responsive controls than what we had before. There are bigger differences beyond the resolution cut to hit the sweet 60 FPS line though (see above).</p><p>The most obvious cutback is the one done to object density and LOD details. Like in older versions of the game (or the PC one when you lowered settings), grass draw distance sees the biggest change. When targeting Performance, it'll pop-in a few tens of meters ahead of you, which reminds me of the original versions of the game. Distant details, including NPCs, also feel instantly blurrier, and shadows are chunkier. Moreover, textures are less defined in order to free up resources.</p>
<p>In practice, however, I think most players will agree the game still looks fine and better than its original iterations, and the 60 FPS target is consistently maintained in my experience so far. Whether you play Skyrim in third or first-person, all the aiming and imsim-like interactivity greatly benefits from higher framerates, and going with Performance here feels like the only path forward to me. The 30-FPS Visuals mode is solid now if you can get used to it though, and since these options can be swapped on the fly, I'd recommend it to get the best possible screenshots even if you're going with Performance during normal play.</p>
<p>Overall, Skyrim on Switch 2 finally feels like what we should've gotten back in December, and while there's room for extra improvements and fine-tuning (maybe a Balanced 40 FPS mode for handheld?) in future patches, Bethesda's modern RPG classic is a perfect fit for the system. Bring on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>!</p>

            <p>Right, hope you're ready to sit down and focus on one version of the game for a while, because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> just received patch 1.041 - the last patch until the DLC - and it's a pretty hefty one. Buckle up.</p>
<p>This patch, marking one year of the game since launch, makes some pretty big introductions, most notably finally bringing Arch-Tempered Arkveld into the fray, alongside 10-star Arc-Tempered monsters, and a special collaboration with Monster Hunter Stories 3 (which we know launches on 13th March). 
</p>
<p>
Strap in, the full patch notes are below, and they're pretty hefty. The patch weighs in at about 13GB on PlayStation, 16GB on Xbox, and 15GB on Steam.</p>
<h2>Major Additions and Changes</h2>
<h3>Monsters</h3>
<p>– Arch-tempered Arkveld has been added as a permanent Event Quest.
– New 10★ difficulty quests have been added as permanent event quests for the following monsters: Arch-tempered Rey Dau, Arch-tempered Uth Duna, Arch-tempered Nu Udra, and Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad.</p>
<h3>Player</h3>
<p>– New equipment and pendants have been added.</p>
<p>– Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Special Collaboration side mission "A Royal Request" has been added. This side mission will become available after reaching HR 9+.
</p><p>– New side mission "Love for a Hero" has been added. This side mission will become available after completing the extra mission "Ghosts Pay No Heed to Tomorrow" and then talking to Nadia and Mina.</p>
<h3>Bases and Facilities</h3>

<p>– Added a new feature that allows you to earn random ingredients at the Ingredient Center after reaching HR 9.
</p>
<p>– New Appraisal Items called "Timeworn Charms" have been added to quest rewards. (No changes have been made to the attributes of Talismans earned. Chances of receiving Talismans with high rarity are increased when using Timeworn Charms.)</p>
<p>– Increased the maximum number of Pop-Up Camps for the Windward Plains, the Scarlet Forest, and the Oilwell Basin. (This will be unlocked by talking to the Pop-up Camp Meowster or the Support Desk after completing the assignment "Germination".)</p>
<p>– Added an option to the Barrel Bowling results screen that allows you to retry immediately. An option has also been added that allows you to use 10 Barrel Bowling Vouchers and receive all rewards at once.</p>
<p>– Adjusted the parameters of the Blossom Barrel Bombs used in Barrel Bowling to behave differently from the Large Barrel Bombs used out in the field. In accordance with this adjustment, new placement patterns have also been added.</p>
<p>– Reduced the waiting time between throws in Barrel Bowling, so that players can throw the second barrel while the results of the first throw are still being displayed.</p>
<h3>System</h3>
<p>– Reduced CPU/GPU processing and made adjustments to lower the load on the game.</p>
<p>– Added internal Levels of Detail (LOD) for 3D models, adjusting them to display optimal quality based on the situation to reduce GPU load.</p>

<p>– Added effect caching to decrease CPU load when generating duplicate effects.</p>
<p>– Optimized rendering processes to reduce CPU/GPU load.</p>

</p>
<p>– The Monkey King
</p>

</p>
<p>– When quick-accessing "Quest Last Played" on the top screen at the Quest Counter, the default departure point will now be set to the last departure point used. (If the last departure point used is not available, the player will start from the base camp as usual.)
</p>
<p>– Adjusted the display for event quests to make it clearer that the player is offline on the screens for accepting or joining a quest.
</p>
<p>– Added a Refresh button to the search results list for SOS Flare Quests.
</p>
<p>– Added Thai as a text language. Text language can be changed in the title menu options.
</p>
<p>– Added Latin American Spanish as a voice language. Voice language can be changed in the title menu options.
</p>
<p>– Added a "Favorited Items Safeguard" feature to the Start Menu options. This will lock the confirm button for specific facilities so that the player cannot use items that are registered as favorites. (Note: This setting can be changed back to "Require Confirmation" on the same options screen.)
</p>
<p>– Added a shortcut button for checking the details before registering an equipment loadout for shared loadouts on the Invitation List screen.
</p>
<p>– Added a shortcut button for going back and forth between the "Upgrade from Box" screen and "Transcending" screen at the Smithy.
</p>
<p>– Adjusted the UI for when the player approaches a Hunting Assistant (Werner or Gemma) in the field, making it easier to distinguish between the positions of Werner or Gemma and their hunting tools.
</p>
<p>– All nine permanent event quests that were only playable online have been made available for offline play as well. (Please refer to the Event Quest schedule for more details.)
</p>
<p>– Heart of Judecca (Arch-tempered Jin Dahaad)
</p>
<p>– Specter of Their Sins (Gogmazios), etc.
</p>
<p>- All 29 event quests that yield equipment materials and that were only available for a limited time have been made permanent and playable offline. (Please refer to the event quest schedule for more details.)</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue causing unintended elemental effects to be displayed on Artian weapons.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<h2>System</h2>
<p>– During a Field Survey, if the player deals extensive damage to a large monster that isn't the current quest target, the health value conditions that would prevent that monster from becoming a target in a subsequent Field Survey have been relaxed.</p><p>– Fixed an issue where unnecessary chat logs (indicating monsters leaving the locale) could display during a Special Environment Quest in which the environment contains a monster of the same species as large monsters that are already designed to appear in that quest.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where the Cosmetic DLC Pass text was not displaying correctly under Add-ons in the Support Desk menu.</p>
<p>– Fixed an issue where the pattern thickness for the "Whitewing Caparison" decoration could not be adjusted in Seikret Customization.</p>
<p>– Added a fix to correct weapon performance when unintended bonus combinations are applied during reinforcement of Artian Weapons or Gogma Artian Weapons.</p>

<p>– Fixed an issue where some voice lines would not trigger properly.</p>
<p>– Fixed various text issues.</p>
<p>– Fixed other miscellaneous issues.</p>
<p>If you're wondering when the next update for Monster Hunter Wilds is coming, we heard that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-sets-summer-2026-reveal">we're getting a Sunbreak or Iceborne-sized, "large-scale" expansion later this year</a>, with the first news about what that expansion looks like coming in summer. Series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto told us that it'd be a big patch, but other than that, we're in the dark about what it will contain.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report has revealed that Wildlight Entertainment, the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">ill-fated first person shooter Highguard</a>, was funded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> studio group TiMi. The full scope of this funding, its connection if any to recent layoffs, and the reason for its secrecy remains unclear.</p>
<p>The story,<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment"> broken by Stephen Totilo's Game File</a>, emphasizes that Wildlight was and remains "technically independent" from Tencent / TiMi, and notes that Tencent has a public and vast presence in funding Western Game Development. For example, Tencent is a major investor in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">and backed Ubisoft's Vantage Studios subsidiary</a>.</p>
<p>Another example of Tencent investing could be Arrowhead Studios, the creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-roblox-riot-and-now-helldivers-tencent-just-acquired-a-15-stake-in-arrowhead-games">Tencent bought up a 15% stake in Arrowhead Games</a> following the release of the hugely popular PvE third person shooter.</p>
<p>However, unlike those aforementioned games, Tencent / TiMi's involvement in Wildlight wasn't publicly announced. You can't, for example, <a href="https://www.timistudios.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email#games">see the game listed in the TiMi Studio Group website</a>. Why was this?</p>
<p>Well, Games Business editor in chief Christopher Dring <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2023897547136237992">provided some context</a> to how independent studio funding works which could explain the situation. "When a big independent studio forms, they typically go through funding rounds where they ask investors to support their project/studio", Dring posted on X. "Various groups can invest in these rounds. Historically, Tencent has been a regular investor in new teams. You'd be surprised at how many other devs have 'secret' (but not actually secret) Tencent backing.</p><p>"Games require funds to be made. Being backed by investors doesn't make you any less independent. Heck, a lot of the time, the investment isn't even enough to cover everything. Multiple rounds are usually required, and even then it might need a publisher. Tencent, and similar investors, are not a well of money people can keep coming back to. In most cases, it's some funds to get going, and then it's on the developers to deliver the rest."</p>
<p>So, this all may be a lot less exciting than it initially appears. Even so, an interesting peak perhaps into the world of independent studios, how they're funded, and what that means. This report from Game File comes at roughly the same time as the Highguard website was suddenly taken down.</p>

            <p>
Classic arena shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament-2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a> has risen from the grave and is now available to download for free, all thanks to a dedicated group of fans working with developer Epic Games' blessing. And the upshot of all this is the much-loved arena FPS has received its first patch "in over 20 years".
</p>
<p>
When Unreal Tournament 2004 originally launched, Eurogamer branded it the "mother of all first-person shooters", praising its massive map roster, its 32-player Onslaught mode, and the welcome introduction of vehicles. All that was enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-ut2004-pc">earn it ye olde 9/10</a>, and plenty of other people loved it too. However, support for Unreal Tournament 2004 officially ended in 2022, when Epic terminated its legacy online services and pulled the game - alongside a number of titles - from digital storefronts.
</p>
<p>
But it turns out the end was not the end. Late last year, fan community OldUnreal announced it was working to revive Unreal Tournament 2004 (the group previously resurrected Unreal and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> 1999), patch it with bug fixes and quality of life improvements, then release it for free - all with Epic's blessing. And that day has finally arrived, with Unreal Tournament 2004 (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/unreal-tournament-2004-is-now-available-for-free-thanks-to-its-fan-community-and-theyve-even-updated-the-game-for-modern-pcs-this-is-the-first-public-patch-for-unreal-tournament-2004-in-over-20-years/">PC Gamer</a>) available to download right now.
</p>
<p>
By <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/ut2004/full-game-installers/">heading over to the OldUnreal website</a>, interested Windows users can download and run the group's newly released installer. That, in turn, will grab the original Unreal Tournament 2004 disc image from OldUnreal's servers, extract their contents, install the game, and automatically patch it to the latest version. Linux and macOS users are <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/FullGameInstallers/releases">pointed toward the group's Github page</a>.
</p><p>
"Please note that this is the first public patch for Unreal Tournament 2004 in over 20 years," project manager (and professor of computer science) Stijn-volckaert writes in the game's <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/releases">new patch notes</a>. "We have implemented numerous fixes and improvements, written a new SDL backend for Linux and macOS, and even a new renderer. We have also migrated the entire codebase to modern build systems. Some new bugs may have slipped in!"
</p>
<p>
So there you go! The "mother of all first-person shooters" can now be downloaded and played for free - and what better time to start revisiting some video game classics than right now, when AI companies are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">making it increasingly difficult to buy new hardware</a>?

            <p>Soulframe, the upcoming fantasy action RPG by Digital Extremes, has totally overhauled its progression system as part of the latest Preludes alpha update. Whereas before player progress involved a more traditional skilling system, a more intuitive alternative has been integrated.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of the three in-game Virtues - Courage, Spirit, and Grace - which to put simply represent melee, magic, and ranged respectively. Prior to this update, you could invest points into these Virtues to build towards the kind of playstyle you want.</p>
<p>With the latest update, players can instead see their virtues shift automatically with each level up. In addition, they can equip a 'Virtue Prism' to concentrate on a particular direction for their character, which will result in the virtues shifting manually. In addition, a new armour system attaches virtue scaling to equipment, the idea being a full set of melee armour will work better with more Courage, etc.</p>
<p>Alongside these drastic changes to player progression, more customisation options have been added to the game. These include face, hair, and weapon customisation, all of which can be played with via the Verminia in the Nightfold hub. There are also three new weapons to unlock: the Clivers, Basker's Wrest, and Seathorn.</p><p>Finally, there's a new mission type in which you destroy polluting towers dotted across the map. Also,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026"> if you watched the Tennocon trailer last year</a>, you may remember a big bear boss battle! Beating that now unlocks a more challenging open world bear boss that you can take on for tantalising rewards.</p>
<p>When Soulframe will leave this period of Prelude alpha tests remains a mystery, though it's clear the team at Digital Extremes is cramming as many updates to the game as they can before a big launch event, perhaps a smart move <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframes-leads-dont-know-if-itll-survive-the-brutal-live-service-market-so-theyre-betting-big-on-a-community-first-approach">given how treacherous the live service space is</a>. That being said, players have been able to spend some cash early to support development, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-is-getting-founders-packs">Founders packs offering exclusive cosmetics and more</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil</a> franchise is the <em>bad </em>kind of nightmare when it comes to adaptations. The movie series kickstarted by Paul W.S. Anderson back in 2002 found tonnes of success, but it's hard to suggest it was quality blockbuster filmmaking. Then came an <em>even worse </em>(despite all the reverence for the source material) movie in 2021, that failed to create a new continuity. And let's not talk about Netflix's 2022 series... Now, in 2026, we're waiting to see whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger can right this ship</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside Sinners, it's safe to say Weapons was one of 2025's biggest and most celebrated horror movies, mixing refreshing thrills, raw horror, unexpected comedy and wild twists in a way we rarely see these days. By all accounts, Cregger <em>should </em>have the sauce to make a very fun Resident Evil movie even if he chooses to completely step away from what's been done before in movies and video games. (And it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-resident-evil-film-lives-in-the-world-of-re2-and-re3-but-with-the-tone-of-4">he's doing exactly that</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, during a <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/oliver-berben-constantin-film-resident-evil-berlin-efm-1236718667/">chat with Deadline</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/weapons-director-had-carte-blanche-to-do-whatever-he-wanted-with-resident-evil-movie-reboot-studio-ceo-says/">VGC</a>), Constantin Film CEO Oliver Berben, who stepped into the role nearly two years ago, elaborated on how the team is approaching this new attempt at 'cracking the code' of the enduring horror franchise. First, he doubled down on the idea that it's "far away from everything that is connected to Resident Evil, only because Zach Cregger has his own style".</p>
<p>Like horror aficionados who have been keeping track and loving the last few years' best flicks in the space, Berben is also of the opinion the genre needs voices willing to take a handful of risks with every project. Of course, Cregger's body of work in the genre so far perfectly embodies that spirit, so it was "a no-brainer" to give him "the carte blanche to do whatever he wanted to do with that IP".</p><p>"With Resident Evil, we have had an incredible journey with one of the most successful international IPs of more than a billion dollars in box office for many years and now we are creating something new, not just a new story idea, but to allow a new generation to take the IP into their own hands and form something different," Berben added.</p>
<p>The next Resident Evil movie, which doesn't have an official title yet, was also co-written by Cregger alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-biggest-surprise-of-the-night-a-brand-new-aaa-john-wick-game-coming-from-the-developer-of-space-marine-2">John Wick</a> veteran Shay Hatten. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">stars Austin Abrams (who already was a fan-favourite in Weapons)</a>, Paul Walter Hauser, Zach Cherry, and Kali Reis, among others. It's set to be distributed theatrically by Sony Pictures and will invade cinemas on September 18, 2026.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a pretty sweet co-op game full of surprises. It also has one of the best original soundtracks of 2025, and that includes its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3531720/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN_The_Forsaken_Hollows/">Forsaken Hollows</a> DLC. Sadly, we were barred from putting together the ultimate FromSoftware-made Soulslike playlist until the expansion's music was made officially available. Now, the wait is finally over.</p>
<p>On 16th February, the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/2023396957709058235?s=20">Elden Ring social media channels</a> announced The Forsaken Hollows' unique tracks were free and out in the wild after a longer-than-desirable wait. It's no secret one of the most celebrated aspects of FromSoftware's output is the amazing compositions that accompany every banger, and Shoi Miyazawa's work on the DLC deserved to be fully released too.</p>
<p>You can find all the available options to listen to the full soundtrack <a href="https://lnk.to/vfQOnLvR">here</a>; Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, Line Music, and more are included, so co-publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware went big with the release once again. The full album runs slightly over 44 minutes versus Nightreign's 2 hours and 24 minutes, fitting the DLC's size when compared to the full base game.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-composer-on-marilyn-manson-myst-and-more-ign-first">IGN interviewed Miyazawa</a> about his work on Nightreign and experience working for FromSoftware. He admitted he was an Armored Core fan first and foremost, well before joining the studio's efforts, and said King Crimson and Marilyn Manson are some of his key musical influences. For <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Nightreign, however, the vibes were understandably more dark fantasy-like, and most players would agree he's created legendary soundtracks for these games alongside the other credited composers. Let's hope this isn't his last rodeo in the Lands Between.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> continues to enjoy tons of success, nearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">almost 1m concurrent players </a>on PC alone and pushing onwards with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">events</a> and regular updates <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">planned out until April</a>. Its <em>actual health </em>hasn't been great in 2026 so far though.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-latest-duplication-glitch-has-players-placing-hundreds-of-ziplines-and-trigger-nades-and-safe-to-say-its-scaring-everyone-i-hope-this-gets-addressed-soon/">massive duplication glitch</a> allowed cheeky players to double anything they were holding in their hands, which translated in maps littered with all sorts of traps and ziplines, among other things. Game balance issues aside, this was also bad for performance in especially crowded areas, so you can imagine why Embark Studios needed to act quickly on that whole mess.</p>
<p>Right after a hotfix was deployed to deal with the duplication glitch, another problem arose: <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-immediately-suffers-an-infinite-ammo-exploit-after-embark-fixes-a-dupe-heightening-criticism-of-the-studios-soft-response-to-cheaters/">an infinite ammo exploit</a>. This one also affected magazine sizes and even gun durability, which completely demolished Arc Raiders' in-game economy and the loop of looting and making do with whatever you can scavenge and preserve. In the following weeks, Embark has been hitting the game hard with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/allnews/">patches</a>, both small and large, ahead of <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-arrives-next-week-embark-confirms-but-there-will-be-no-major-game-update-this-week-to-tide-you-over-until-then/">this month's 'Shrouded Sky' content update</a>.</p>
<p>Today, 17th February, the developers also confirmed <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/an-update-on-recent-exploits-and-corrective-actions">they'd finished conducting a large investigation</a> into how the recent exploits and glitches came to be and how to deal with offenders now and in the future. "Though these exploits stemmed from a design flaw on our part, the way they were used had a real impact on the game's economy and the way the community experienced ARC Raiders. It's on us to address that and work to restore balance," the article states before elaborating on why it's taken a while to see more substantial comms regarding all this drama.</p><p>Though the studios is supposedly better prepared for future events like these, the powers that be are warning they'll "be taking actions based on severity, intent, frequency, and impact." Warnings will be issued for "low-severity cases," coins obtained through these glitches will be deleted, and suspensions will be dished out for the "severe cases" that completely ruined other players' fun.</p>
<p>Embark is fully aware this won't be the last time it has to deal with rampaging exploits and whatnot, and is encouraging lawful raiders to share their findings through the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders">official Discord sever</a>.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has revealed the next batch of games coming to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service this February, and into next month.</p>
<p>Along with the already announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-february">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Avowed</a>, which are available from today (17th February), Game Pass subscribers can look forward to the following games making their way onto the service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aerial_Knight's DropShot</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 17th February via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Death Howl</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>EA Sports College Football 26</strong> (Cloud and Xbox Series X/S) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate</li>
<li><strong>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</strong> – Complete Edition (Cloud and Console) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium</li>
<li><strong>TCG Card Shop Simulator</strong> (Game Preview) (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 24th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Dice A Million</strong> (PC) – 25th February via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Towerborne</strong> (Full Game Release) (Console, Handheld, and PC) – 26th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Final Fantasy 3</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) – 3rd March via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </strong>(Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) – 3rd March via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>I am quite intrigued by Death Howl, which is a soulslike deck builder.  The game is described as a "poignant tale of grief, healing, and resilience", and follows the journey of hunter Ro as she leaves her tribe and ventures into a disturbingly realised realm of the spirits in the hope of reuniting with her deceased son.</p><p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, meanwhile, garnered a lot of love for its dedication to toil and turmoil in Bohemia, told through the eyes of Henry of Skalitz. A hardy combat system and eager embrace of vulgarity come together in a compelling RPG well worth playing.</p>

            <p>One of the best racing horses in the modern era of the sport will be coming to Umamusume: Pretty Derby, according to a statement from the horse's owner.</p>
<p>Speaking to horse racing outlet Idolhorse following Forever Young's victory at the Saudi Cup yesterday, Susumu Fujita teases the appearance of the champion: "Forever Young will be in Umamusume soon, I can't say the exact details, but it's a huge thing for me personally that Forever Young can contribute to Umamusume."</p>
<p>This follows <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1984753867087888389">a mysterious tease from the official Umamusume: Pretty Derby last year</a>, which showed a silhouette of a horse and a date. This date, it turns out, is Forever Young's birthday. So there's some extra proof if you aren't convinced.</p>
<p>Umamusame: Pretty Derby remains an incredibly popular mobile game since it released back in 2021, and further still when it came out in Europe and America last year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">It even won a Game Award</a> for Best Mobile Game, which is certainly something.</p>
<p>The developers of Pretty Derby, Cygames, announced in January <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cygames-ai-studio-formed">its intention to create an AI-focused sub studio</a>, aimed at producing "AI-services and tools". Following backlash, Cygames rolled this back somewhat, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/umamusume-developer-apologises-after-ai-studio-backlash-says-it-will-not-use-generative-ai-without-prior-notice">it wouldn't use generative AI "without prior notice"</a>.</p>
<p>Do you have a horse you'd like to see in Umamusame: Pretty Derby? Oh, and if a certain song is stuck in your head, you're looking for Forever Young by Alphaville.</p>

            <p>
Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg has touted generative AI advancements in its game engine that'll soon enable users to "prompt full casual games into existence" just by using natural language.
</p>
<p>
While generative AI remains controversial, given its many ethical implications, the technology has found a foothold in game development. A GDC survey conducted earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gdc-survey-reveals-layoffs-up-6-36-of-industry-using-ai-and-overwhelming-support-for-unionisation-in-the-us">revealed 36 percent of respondents now use AI</a> - predominantly for 'research and brainstorming', although code assistance and daily tasks such as writing emails were the other most cited uses.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, game engine company Unity has been looking to both drive and capitalise on the AI boom, with CEO Matthew Bromberg now bullishly highlighting what he sees as the next step in 'democratising' game development. As <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-">reported by Game Developer</a>, Bromberg - speaking to investors during a recent earnings called - flagged an upcoming Unity AI beta update that'll expand the company's ambitions for "AI-driven authoring".
</p>
<p>
This new beta, set to be unveiled at the Game Developer Conference in March, will "enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform," Bloomberg claimed, "so it's simple to move from prototype to finished product." 
</p><p>
"Our goal, he continued, "is to remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience". Bromberg later told investors the company is envisaging a future where "tens of millions" of people are "creating interactive entertainment" driven by AI-enabled development tools.
</p>
<p>
While generative AI adoption increases, its use remains contentious. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> studio Larian reversed course after its admission of using the technology for concept art creation drew ire. Meanwhile, other studios have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/worried-about-project-windless-and-generative-ai-dont-fret-krafton-says-the-game-is-not-using-generative-ai-for-content-creation-or-narrative-elements">sought to get ahead of controversy</a> by assuring audiences their use of generative AI is limited. Last week, for instance, Krafton's Project Windless team said it would not be using the tool for "content creation or narrative elements" but confirmed it was using generative AI "internally during exploratory phases to support iteration and efficiency".
</p>
<p>
Back in 2024, Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">explored some of the ways AI is changing game development</a> - although the escalating AI arms among tech giants, and the resulting memory shortages it's now causing, are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">increasingly threatening to impact the games industry in other ways</a>.

            <p>Things aren't looking great when it comes to the ongoing RAM and storage shortages, and the Asus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> is being hit with a price increase in Japan that may or may not extend to other territories.</p>
<p>The current tech drama kickstarted by the AI and data centre boom is already altering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">Sony and Nintendo's plans for hardware in the coming years</a>, with Microsoft likely missing the big console generation refresh next year too. Even worse, prices are expected to keep surging as stock dwindles and hardware production stalls or greatly slows down. It's bad, it'll get <em>way worse</em>, and no one knows when things might get better.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-gets-a-price-increase-of-nearly-200-in-japan/">via VGC</a>, we're learning about the ROG Xbox Ally X situation in Japan. As spotted by the site <a href="https://0115765.com/archives/172482">Otaku Souken</a>, the ROG Xbox Ally X is upping its price tag to ¥169,800 ($1,109) vs. the previous ¥139,800 ($913) mark. That's a whopping $196 increase. The standard ROG Xbox Ally seemingly isn't altering its ¥89,800 ($585) price, however.</p>
<p>An official reason for the price increase hasn't been shared yet, but everyone is thinking about the same thing pending confirmation; as pointed out by VGC, the RAM on the big Xbox Ally is faster than the regular model's. With the more expensive model now almost doubling the price of the regular one, it'll be quite interesting to see how both perform in the Japanese market in the coming months. As a reminder, Xbox products have never been too big over there, so this probably won't go down well.</p><p>The difficult situation has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">forced Valve to delay the release (originally planned for early 2026) of the Steam Machine and Frame</a>, which are now expected by most enthusiasts to arrive at higher price points (though we never got official word on those with the reveal). Even worse, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">securing a Steam Deck is becoming harder</a> as I write this. Thanks, Big Tech.</p>

<p>Word of the studio's fate comes from numerous LinkedIn posts citing the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brandon-miller-3734ba77_hi-everyone-im-currently-exploring-new-ugcPost-7429285429494984704-qbn8/">"recent closure" of Atomic Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately Hasbro has made the call to close Atomic Arcade," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/justinkimball_opentowork-activity-7429273899965636608-4DCD/">one such post reads</a>. "I was only with the studio for about a year, but from the start I felt the studio had tons of talent and potential. I'll miss working with the team we had, and wish everyone the best."</p>
<p>Atomic Arcade was working on a game based around GI Joe character Snake Eyes, which for now remains in development despite changes at the studio.</p>
<p>"The Snake Eyes game is not cancelled. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game," a Hasbro representative said in a statement shared with <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/amp/">Wccftech</a>. "While decisions haven't been finalised, we're committed to providing updates as soon as we're able."</p>
<p>Hasbro first announced plans to make a GI Joe game based on Snake Eyes all the way back in 2022, and Atomic Arcade was established. At this time, Atomic Arcade's Ames Kirshen told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/snake-eyes-and-the-evolution-of-adaptation">Eurogamer's sister-site GamesIndustrybiz</a>:</p>
<p>"I always had this great desire to tackle G.I. Joe and take a crack at making an amazing game with the IP because I think there's a lot of potential there... So long story short, we decided to build a studio to support that franchise, to support that game."</p>
<p>Atomic Arcade is not the only studio to be the subject of layoffs this year. Just this weekend, GTFO and Den of Wolves developer 10 Chambers confirmed a "large number" of layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gtfo-and-den-of-wolves-developer-10-chambers-confirms-large-number-of-layoffs-including-several-of-the-studios-co-founders">which included "several of the studio's co-founders"</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Highlight developer Wildlight was also impacted by layoffs earlier this month, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">only a "core" group left to work on the free-to-play shooter</a>.</p>

            <p>Metal Gear Solid 4: Sons of the Patriots and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a> have seemingly been removed from the PS3 digital store, shortly after the reveal of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol.2.</p>
<p>Spotted by the keen enthusiasts <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1r6o33l/konami_have_delisted_the_psn_versions_of_metal/">on the dedicated PS3 Reddit</a>, players can still see both games on the store, but are unable to actually buy them. It's worth noting that if you already own the game digitally or physically, those copies should still work just fine on the PS3.</p>
<p>The Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2, which was revealed during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony State of Play earlier this year</a>, includes both of the aforementioned games as well as Metal Gear Ghost Babel. It'll be coming to the PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. This collection is especially noteworthy as Metal Gear Solid 4 was previous trapped on the PS3, having not been ported to other platforms.</p>
<p>That game does, however, have some features and quirks unique to the PS3. Konami stated many of these will be faithfully replicated in the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol.2, but sadly multiplayer is being left in the past. It's a shame too, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a> certainly had a dedicated community of keen players back in the PS3 era.</p><p>Previously, Konami developers said that remaking Metal Gear Solid 4: Sons of the Patriots like Metal Gear Solid 3 was in the recent Metal Gear Delta  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-series-producer-remakes-metal-gear-solid-4">would be "pretty hard"</a>. This port in the Master Collection certainly isn't that, but who knows? Maybe if it proves popular we'll see a fully remade reimagination of the end of Snake's saga.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years</link>
            <guid>https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>This is much more like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> I wanted when it launched. We're having a redo moment. Blizzard isn't calling this a relaunch but to me, it feels like it is. This is a reintroduction of a game that floundered back in 2023 at launch, but three years later, it's solid and it's stacked. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (the 2 was symbolically dropped from the title recently) knows what it wants to be now and this is the fullest and strongest this game has ever been. Arguably it's also the strongest the series (can we call it a series now?) has ever been, which is a provocative thing to say, I know. But I haven't been this excited about Overwatch since the original came out 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Note, I haven't played for three years since the sequel launched, which is an important factor here because returning after all that time is borderline overwhelming - in a very good way. Last week's expansion was the catalyst that brought me back, but even putting aside the five new heroes, the UI overhaul and the story push the expansion brings, there are maps, heroes and modes I've never seen before. How long have you been able to upgrade abilities for?! It doesn't matter: the point is that to me, it's all new. Loading the Practice Range to try these unknown heroes is like diving into an unopened chocolate box. It's a hell of a sugar rush.</p>
<p>Case in point: I'm a support player at my core, a healer of sorts. Like Mother Teresa. And one of my bugbears with the original Overwatch was that there weren't many support characters to play. I got bored with what was on offer and the slow wait for new characters to refresh the list. (This comment could be applied to many areas of the game.) But now there are several support heroes and my current obsession is Juno, who bombs around the map on hover boots with a Martian ray-gun that can heal and also damage, and damage enough that I'd be tempted to classify her as a damage dealer. I've taken names; I even got a Play of the Game once. She's great. But she isn't new - Juno was added in August 2024.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>I love you Juno, even if I've given you a Hello Kitty skin. But look at all those heroes! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Or take Stadium, a whole new mode added to Overwatch last summer. Here you buy buffs for characters' abilities as you play, a bit like how you do in a MOBA. It's a best of five match spread across different game types, and before you begin, and between each round thereafter, you have time to buy upgrades from an armoury. This means you can alter the builds of your favourite heroes, doubling down on damage or survivability or utility - whatever you like. And this is mind-blowing to me. I've never been able to alter or adjust a character's abilities in Overwatch before. It is wild and it <em>feels </em>wild in play. Imagine a whole team of supercharged Overwatch heroes and you're close to what it's like. It's a significantly different way to play.</p><p>But again, Stadium isn't new - it's <em>newer </em>but it's still been around for a bit. There is a new part of it, a build-helper, which suggests builds and auto-applies them, and it's incredibly helpful for new players - I don't know where I'd be without it. And actually, it's in this helper that a wider point about Overwatch - and why it's currently so enjoyable - comes to the surface. Yes, it's giddying exploring everything that's been added and done to the game in three years, as well all of the expansion-based stuff. But more pertinent is a feeling that this moment is designated for lapsed Overwatch players to return, or for new players to come in.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The Stadium helper in action. Here, I'm playing as Reinhardt, and these are the initial Armoury options available to me. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I can't stress the importance of this point enough. New and returning players seem to be here in abundance. It doesn't only mean that the game feels re-energised because there are more people playing it - match queues are short to nonexistent - but it feels welcoming because of who is playing it. You don't know the ropes? Fine. You're in good company. There are newer players (visible by the levels of the characters they're playing) everywhere, which not only gives you and me a chance in matches, but also makes for a wider kind of tolerance from the existing players in the game.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I avoided going back to Overwatch 2 for so long was because I was out of touch and out of practice, and didn't want to be told off for not knowing what I was doing by some idiot in group chat. Whether or not that would have happened, I don't know, but it certainly isn't happening now. People are, dare I say it, friendly, which might be because I'm (probably annoyingly) chatty, but there's a palpable sense of camaraderie here, both in people reconnecting with the game and in people pleased the game they play is resurgent. I feel welcomed. I feel encouraged. It's like people are happy to see Overwatch doing well again, and that's a very nice feeling to be around, though I can't speak to the mood in Competitive, which tends to be more tense, because I haven't mustered the courage to play there yet.</p><p>This expansion moment has been like Blizzard firing a gun in the woods and startling people into noticing Overwatch again, and the difference this time is Overwatch is ready for the attention. The happy added bonus is that adding five new heroes at once to the game has also - to continue my weaponised metaphors - thrown a hand grenade into the game's meta. Currently, things are upended, unsettled, and that's exciting - there's enough new stuff happening at the moment that even regular players have things to discover. Jetpack Cat in particular is capturing attention for her ability to tow other characters through the air and open new tactical possibilities. But for all the talk about her, I haven't seen her much in game. Or if I have, I haven't noticed her having a game-shaking effect. Though again, maybe that's different at higher skill levels.</p>
<p>Whether or not Overwatch maintains this excitement for me, and this general sense of momentum, I can't yet know. There are moments when staleness creeps in, while playing old heroes on old maps, but there's still so much newness around it that it doesn't taint the experience for long. Plus of course there are more heroes and hero reworks to come this year, which I'm particularly excited about, and a new expansion promised at the start of every year hereafter. The intention from Blizzard is clearly to try and keep the momentum up. Still, Overwatch doesn't exist in a vacuum any more. There's strong competition in Marvel Rivals, and in hero-shooter-inspired games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and Valorant, which wasn't the case when Overwatch once reigned supreme. But for me, right now, Overwatch is back.</p>

            <p>
As the tech giants' escalating AI arms race continues to impact RAM supplies, Valve has confirmed Steam Deck is the latest machine to face availability issues as a result of memory and storage shortages.
</p>
<p>
Memory shortages and soaring prices are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">direct results of the tech industry's continuing push into AI</a>. Substantial quantities of RAM are required to power AI platforms, so as tech giant including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta continue to invest in new AI data centres to remain competitive, the demand for RAM has increased dramatically.
</p>
<p>
It's an issue that's already threatening to have a significant impact on consumer electronics. Earlier this year, for instance, Valve <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">announced a delay for its new Steam Machines</a>, specifically blaming memory and storage shortages - but it's not just the company's future hardware that's impacted. Valve has also now confirmed its current Steam Deck line-up is similarly affected.
</p>
<p>
As per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">message on its Steam Deck store page</a>, Steam Deck OLED "may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages". At the time of writing, all three Steam Deck models - the 256GB LCD model, as well as the 512GB and 1TB OLED - are unavailable in the US, but supplies in other countries, including the UK, remain available for now. Notably, Valve confirmed it was discontinuing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB back in December, meaning no more stock is being produced.
</p><p>
Valve's dwindling Steam Deck supplies come amid reports that other gaming companies are considering dramatic responses to AI-driven memory shortages. This week, Bloomberg claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">Sony is looking to delay the launch of its PS6</a> into 2028 or 2029, while Nintendo is said to be mulling over a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> price increase later this year.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Robert Purchese recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">took a closer look at the issues surrounding RAM</a> and what they might mean for gaming.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyper-scape">Hyper Scape</a> feels like something that happened ages ago, but Ubisoft's failed battle royale game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-beleaguered-battle-royale-game-hyper-scape-is-shutting-down-in-april">was shut down in April 2022</a> after halting its content updates a year before that. The game itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-scape-review-a-battle-royale-as-smart-as-it-is-generic">wasn't anything special</a>, yet no small amount of FPS veterans praised its core traversal and movement mechanics. This is why a passionate fan is attempting to bring it back from the live-service graveyard.</p>
<p>On 16th February, <a href="https://x.com/fiirce">Fiirce</a> on X/Twitter revealed Hyper Scape working offline (with bots that serve as target practice) perfectly fine. That alone is an achievement, as the game's core functionality was tied to Ubisoft's server infrastructure, which was shut down back in 2022. The user underlines this is a very early effort running on a private server, with largely limited alpha access that must be requested and primarily targets players with "reverse engineering experience" that want to help out with the project. You can see the game running below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hyperscape Revival.<br>Game feels exactly as I left it (perfect).<br>Singleplayer works for now, will be awhile before anything multiplayer works (could be months or even years). Early alpha/private for now.<br>Reach out to me if you have reverse engineering experience and want to help. <a href="https://t.co/EnzhADUTfW">pic.twitter.com/EnzhADUTfW</a></p>— Fiirce (@fiirce) <a href="https://twitter.com/fiirce/status/2023452799439434111?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Fiirce isn't promising a working release of Hyper Scape anytime soon, as figuring out how to make <em>at least </em>the basic online features work could take "months or even years." That said, it has been getting a lot of traction over at X/Twitter since the gameplay clip was posted, which could summon the required expertise quickly and get a proper reverse-engineering effort going soon.</p>
<p>In any case, there's also the question of whether Ubisoft will step in and shut down the project as many publishers do when fans take over dead IPs to work on non-profit new games or revivals. Nobody's expecting the powers that be to ever revisit Hyper Scape, so this shouldn't bother them, but you never know if another publisher could swoop in and pick up the rights to do <em>something</em>. Remember <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/paragon-the-overprime">Paragon: The Overprime</a>?</p><p>This fan-led revival project joins the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-can-run-on-private-servers-youtube-video-reveals">the experiments some people are doing on Anthem</a> shortly after its death. Live-service games are hard to maintain and make really sustainable, but when these endeavours become so common, you have to wonder if the failed IPs that litter the games industry should be made public instead of thrown into vaults.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Mewgenics, the cat breeding indie hit from the creators of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End is Nigh, has broken a rather impressive Steam record.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Mewgenics - which sees players using "tactical" breeding to raise a cat army before sending their feline Frankenstein-like creations into the fray - welcomed 115,428 concurrent players on Steam.</p>
<p>This number probably doesn't mean that much to you on its own, though it is of course an impressive figure. However, Mewgenics' latest concurrent player peak actually means it now has the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em>.</p>
<p>The Steam game with the highest concurrent player count before Mewgenics took the crown was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, Supergiant's sequel to the incredibly successful Hades and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">2025 Game of the Year nominee</a>.</p>
<p>As you can see via the image below, Hades 2 has a concurrent player peak of 112,947, which was reached five months ago. This means Mewgenics has welcomed 2,481 more concurrent players than Steam's previous roguelike record holder (look at me doing maths early in the morning).</p><p>So, yes, Mewgenics is really rather popular, something that has taken co-creators Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel by surprise. On its release, it sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and developer Glaiel later revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in 36 hours (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3men362utkk2f">in the words of Glaiel</a>, "wtf").</p>

<p>The team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">already confirmed that Mewgenics DLC is planned</a>, though for when we don't yet know. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-console-release-for-steams-cat-breeding-roguelike-hit-mewgenics-is-currently-in-the-works">console version is also on the cards</a>, but again, we don't know when exactly it may materialise.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> might not be one of the most popular roguelites around, but it's charmed enough veterans and newcomers since it launched into 1.0 last year. We figured it would be ending its development run shortly afterwards, but Evil Empire (one of the studios now hard at work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castlevania-belmonts-curse-is-the-beginning-of-numerous-new-products-around-castlevania">the next Castlevania</a>) isn't done upgrading it yet.</p>
<p>On 16th February, the developer revealed a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2717880/view/541130614987817395">spring 2026 roadmap</a> featuring two major updates currently scheduled to drop in April and May. You can check it out below:</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>First up, the 'Breathless Update' will add the Freeze element, arenas, a higher difficulty option, weapon and tool affixes, new tools, new medallions, faster pacing, and other improvements which aim to both amp up and streamline the overall experience. What does the team mean by "faster pacing"? Well, it appears the first hour of the game is getting a substantial rework, and then we'll have "quicker and tougher" versions of the following biomes. This will be done through updates to the level design and the difficulty provided by enemies (regular and bosses alike).</p><p>Later, the 'Endgame Update' (which hasn't been fully locked down yet) will add the Nyamtur trials for "risk &amp; reward" across all levels, a still-undefined "parkour mode," and a rework of the Palace biome. Moreover, challenges and pets (we don't know anything about them yet) are coming. Even Evil Empire isn't sure about what will be included in this one, but the devs are confident it might be <em>even </em>larger in the end.</p>
<p>As an extra, The Rogue Prince of Persia is kicking off 2026 with a new tool that's already available in-game: "We've added the Flaming Horses — a tool that will unleash a herd of flaming horses that charge forward, leaving a burning trail behind them." Cool stuff.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Activision Blizzard has announced that Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, a spin off from the hugely popular battle royale, will be shutting down on 17th April.</p>
<p>This comes following previous changes to the ongoing support for the game, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-pulls-call-of-duty-warzone-from-ios-and-google-play-stores">which included its removal from app stores in May 2025</a>. With no new content added to the game since then, it seems the final death knell for the ill-fated shooter is almost here.</p>
<p>A statement posted <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">on the Activision Support website reads</a>: "Since then, we have made the final decision to take Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile offline. While we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately did not meet our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences."</p>
<p>Guest accounts used to play Call of Duty Warzone Mobile will no longer be able to play the game when it shuts down. However, if you used an Activision account, you'll obviously still be able to use that to play Call of Duty Mobile or Call of Duty on PC and consoles. If you've got any unspent CoD points lying around on Call of Duty Warzone Mobile, the FAQ section suggests spending them before the 17th as they'll be unavailable to use after the servers shut down. Some unlockable content in Warzone mobile can be used in other versions of Warzone.</p><p>This game publicly launched shakily when compared to Call of Duty Mobile. According to Pocket Gamer, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-generates-14m-in-first-four-days/">Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile generated $1.4m in its first four days</a>. Call of Duty Mobile made $4.2m in the same amount of time. Add that on top of recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">falling play numbers for Call of Duty in general</a> and you can glimpse at why the servers are being turned off.</p>

            <p>Do you remember the .hack series? Are you even old enough to know what it is? Don't worry if your answer is negative, as even RPG veterans admit it wasn't particularly big in the West. Still, it remains one of the most fascinating series out there, albeit a hard one to follow due to its complicated titling and transmedia characteristics.</p>
<p>Now, just in time for studio CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, a new project has been announced out of nowhere: .hack//Z.E.R.O. marks the return of the franchise, which had been dormant on the games front since 2017's .hack//G.U. Last Recode remaster. You can watch the first trailer below:</p> <figure>

<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bandai-namco-entertainment">Bandai Namco Entertainment</a> has given CyberConnect2 permission to manage the entirety of the project from planning and development to release. It will be a title that is fully self-published by CyberConnect2," <a href="https://www.cc2.co.jp/hackzero/en/">the official website</a> reveals. Yes, <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19641-cyberconnect2s-30th-anniversary-game-revealed-as-hackzero-action-rpg-for-consoles">it appears Bandai Namco isn't letting go of the IP rights</a> and doesn't want to put money into the project, but thankfully, the entertainment giant has allowed it to happen with the original developers.</p>
<p>Shortly after the reveal, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66142">Famitsu</a> has published an interview with CyberConnect2's CEO Hiroshi "Piros" Matsuyama, who's serving as executive producer on Z.E.R.O. It's unclear right now if the game will follow an episodic format or happen over several entries in the style of the original series and the G.U. trilogy. However, more details were uncovered.</p><p>First, Matsuyama has said Z.E.R.O. isn't connected to previous entries in the franchise, which should help newcomers jump in without previous knowledge of the universe. The World, the online game inside which the bulk of the stories was set, will also return, but they're pushing 10 years into the future with the setting in order to double down on social media as a central part of our lives. Moreover, there will be a special focus on real drama between humans and "multiple layers of society as the main enemies," including an evil corporation (of course).</p>
<p>You'll have to wait for more details and the first in-game footage, but CyberConnect2 has also stated <a href="https://nichegamer.com/hack-z-e-r-o-announced/">they've been trying to get this game done for nearly a decade</a>, so chances are this is being treated as a big new beginning for the franchise rather than a one-and-done spinoff.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has shared its Winter Roadmap for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>The roadmap includes a community parkour challenge, as well as full manual jump, a detailed stats page and critical hit visual improvements. These particular upcoming additions all arrive tomorrow, 17th February.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has said Shadows' upcoming detailed stats page will be ideal for "all the min-maxers out there". As for that manual jump being added to Parkour, players will need to enable Advanced Parkour Options in the gameplay settings to get this chap working.</p>
<p>If you are curious about that aforementioned community parkour challenge, here is what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535499747044098727">Ubisoft</a> has to say about it all:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Create your perfect one-shot run</li>
<li>Think flow, style, momentum. Choose a unique location or craft the coolest combo you can imagine. Your clip must be: One unedited shot, 45 to 60 seconds long and set anywhere in the world of Assassin's Creed Shadows</li>
<li>Upload and share: Upload your run to YouTube before March 8th, then share it on X using #ACShadowsParkourChallenge.</li>
<li>Get noticed: You might become one of the lucky few that'll be showcased across Ubisoft social media or win cool prizes!</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Then looking ahead to next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> players can expect the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Claws of Awaji expansion</a> on 10th March. This expansion introduces a new region, as well as a new weapon and abilities, new outfits and legendary gear, a new enemy faction and bosses, and a new chapter of Shadow's story. Ahead of its release elsewhere, Ubisoft said this expansion would add over 10 hours of content to the game.</p>
<p>Last up for this batch of winter events, all players can look forward to livestreams and giveaways to celebrate the game's first anniversary on 20th March.</p>

<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows had a strong debut on its release last year, and in July Ubisoft celebrated five million players (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">which also made up 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted</a>). That number will of course be higher now, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Shadows' Switch 2 release in December</a>.</p><p>It hasn't all been good news for the Assassin's Creed franchise and Ubisoft, though. In October, then-Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté left the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">following the formation of the new Tencent-backed subsidiary</a> Vantage Studios. It soon transpired that Côté "did not walk away" but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">asked to "step aside" by Ubisoft</a>. In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">it was reported Côté was suing Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation is finally picking up some momentum, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">having been initially announced several years ago</a>. The show is set to star Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor said to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>

            <p>Some upcoming skins for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> which initially had edgy skull masks appear to have been drastically changed to look a bit more realistic, judging by community findings.</p>
<p>These skins, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x4zaBaEKK/?spm_id_from=333.1387.collection.video_card.click">which you can see in their original glory on Bilibili</a>, are a mix between standard military face paints donning stylised combat gear and straight up My Chemical Romance vibe skull masks over military headgear. Those latter skins drawing the ire of a portion of the Battlefield 6 playerbase, especially those who want the game to stay grounded.</p>
<p>"They're all garbage. I just want new playable content, new mechanics and equipment, more vehicle customization, and a customizable class ability system like in BF4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r2slm0/comment/o4z2kj1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote user Kejdurapa on the Battlefield Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>However, luckily for those with a similar taste to the pro-realism Battlefield crowd, additional screenshots released in the following days <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/most_of_upcoming_skins_have_changed/">appear to show these same skins toned down in edginess drastically</a>. This either indicates an overhauled version of these same skins, or perhaps an alternative version for those same skins.</p><p>As you can imagine, those previously aggravated Battlefield enjoyers are now very pleased indeed. "That's more like it, not the clown show that was in season 1," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o0ewb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote Ali-S earlier today</a>. Their sentiment was shared by one eaeb4, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o1jg0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">who wrote</a>: "This is a big improvement across the board. Some people might like some of the skull mask designs but we don't need it on every other skin.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, who cares, right? A few skins look to have been changed in a live service shooter. Well, it's worth noting that Battlefield 6 was sold to players on the back of its realistic approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">making direct comparisons to its major competitor Call of Duty and its wackier approach to modern military warfare</a>.</p>
<p>This was true even in pre-release interviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">Lead developers told Eurogamer the game would</a> "stray true to Battlefield" when asked about its approach to cosmetics, indicating a desire to keep things away from the wilder fantasies created elsewhere. These skull masks, as well as some prior DLC released in Battlefield 6, have strained such statements.</p>
<p>Whether things like these skull-faced cosmetics will be buried forever, or if a hint of the absurd will continue to creep into Battlefield 6, is a question for the future. What isn't a question is where the Eurogamer Battlefield 6 review is - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">it's right here</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has slowly but steadily become one of 2026's open world games to watch out for, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visually-impressive-open-world-fantasy-adventure-crimson-desert-goes-gold-locks-march-launch">with a March release date now locked</a>, lots of people are seriously starting to consider making a trip to Pywel soon. At the same time, veterans might have reservations about jumping in at launch based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a>'s MTX-heavy model.</p>
<p>Of course, large numbers of microtransactions and optional cosmetics are to be expected any time a game's model is free-to-play, and Pearl Abyss' PR and marketing director Will Powers reminded everyone of that during his appearance in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">episode 457 of the Dropped Frames</a> podcast (hat tip to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/that-is-the-transaction-crimson-desert-wont-have-microtransactions-says-pearl-abyss-because-the-promising-open-world-game-is-a-premium-experience/">GamesRadar</a>): "It's a monetization model: if you do free-to-play, then you need to make up the revenue in a different way." Easy to understand if you've been playing video games in the last 20 years or so, but we all know we often need to make things as clear as possible.</p>
<p>You can't blame veterans for thinking even a strictly single-player game like Crimson Desert (which did start off as an online project) could be filled with microtransactions à la Assassin's Creed though. After all, it'd be easy for Pearl Abyss to pull the trigger on those if the game is a massive success, as we know for a fact players typically like putting more money into the experiences they greatly enjoy.</p>
<p>Powers shot such thoughts and comments down quickly: "This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions." Here's where we underline such decisions are above his pay grade and anything could happen post-launch, but it seems that's where Pearl Abyss officially stands right now. If you're picking up Crimson Desert, you're getting a traditional, fully featured open-world adventure with no cosmetics or mounts earned via MTX. "This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Like, full stop."</p><p>That said, <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert has three different editions</a> (both digital and physical) up for pre-order at the time of writing, each of which with extra items and cosmetics, so you're definitely missing out on some stuff if you simply pick up the cheaper version. <a href="https://x.com/WillJPowers/status/2023218876105072790?s=20">Powers has acknowledged those</a> on X/Twitter though: "The overall point is that we're not holding back content to sell separately."</p>
<p>In any case, I doubt anyone was fearing Crimson Desert could be short on content, as every piece of footage from the game we've seen suggests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4euv-AX4E">it's trying to do <em>almost </em>everything</a> the devs came up with during the concept and planning stage. Will it pay off? It won't be long before we find out, as the game launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and even Mac on 19th March.</p>

            <p>
Sony is reportedly looking to push back the launch of PlayStation 6 in response to memory shortages caused by tech giants' continuing AI expansion drive, while Nintendo is said to be considering a price hike for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Memory shortages and soaring prices have made headlines in recent times, both issues arising as tech companies continue their push into AI. Substantial amounts of RAM are required to power AI platforms, so as the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta continue to throw money at AI data centres in order to stay competitive, the demand for RAM has increased dramatically.
</p>
<p>
Supply issues and spiralling costs could have a significant impact on consumer electronics, with Valve having already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-admits-its-steam-machine-and-steam-frame-will-be-delayed-due-to-ram-and-storage-price-surges">announced a delay for its Steam Machines</a> as it grapples with memory and storage shortages. Similarly, Microsoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">reportedly looking to increase the price of its Xbox Series X/S yet again</a> in response to global RAM shortages.
</p>
<p>
As to how Xbox's closest rivals might respond, Bloomberg - citing "people familiar with the company's thinking" - <a href="https://archive.is/20260216113541/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis">now reports</a> Sony is considering shifting the release of PlayStation 6 to 2028 or 2029. While the company has never publicly discussed a launch window for its next-gen console, documents leaked in 2022 suggested it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-doesnt-expect-playstation-6-before-2027-confidential-document-suggests">wouldn't release PS6 until at least 2027</a>.
</p><p>
Since then, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM1Fq8nAGPo&amp;t=3399s">reports have surfaced</a> claiming Sony is looking to begin manufacturing its next-gen console early next year for a 2027 release, but some analysts have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps6-may-not-arrive-in-2028-analyst-predicts">more recently suggested a launch in 2028 or beyond</a> is now likelier. Bloomberg writes that if Sony delays PS6 into 2028 or 2029 as a result of memory issues, it would be a "major upset to a carefully orchestrated strategy to sustain user engagement between hardware generations". Sony's current console, PS5, launched in 2020.
</p>
<p>
As for Nintendo, Bloomberg says a price hike for Switch 2 may be on the way. Citing "people familiar with [the company's] plans", it claims Nintendo is currently "contemplating" raising the price of its latest console - which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-finally-surpasses-the-nintendo-ds-to-become-companys-best-selling-console-ever">sold over 17m units</a> since launching in 2025 - later this year. In January, Nintendo said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-the-switch-2-getting-more-expensive-soon-nintendo-says-theres-no-immediate-impact-but-will-keep-an-eye-on-volatile-memory-market">RAM shortages would have no "immediate impact" on the price of Switch 2</a>, but earlier this month, company president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/memory-price-rises-have-not-impacted-the-switch-2-yet-says-nintendo-president">warned things might change</a> if the trend continues into the next fiscal year.
</p>
<p>
If you're curious to learn more about the issues surrounding RAM at present, and what they might mean for gaming, Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">recently took a closer look</a> at what one tech commentator has called a "perfect storm of unpreparedness, panic, and greed".

            <p>If you were watching <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">last week's Sony State of Play</a>, you'll have surely seen the latest trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>. Hectic chases through exotic planets, tense moments between the drivers, and… Wait. Hang on. That crash, it looked a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/burnout-paradise-remastered-studio-teases-series-revival">a Burnout crash</a>? Was that real, or some cinematic sleight of hand aimed at getting 2000's arcade racing fans overly eager?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out it was the real thing. That trailer, entirely captured in-engine, did in fact show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-creators-of-burnout-are-making-a-crash-mode-spiritual-successor-called-danger-zone">a Burnout-style crash</a> as a small exciting moment in Galactic Racer's campaign mode. This, while obviously being a sweet touch for a ramshackle racing game, is one element of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-galactic-racer-will-have-podracers">what appears to be narrative-rich rally royale fitting snuggly within Star Wars canon</a>.</p>
<p>"Yes, you might have seen a bit of that!" Kieran Crimmins told Eurogamer, laughing from what appeared to be his home office. Crimmins, as the creative director of Star Wars Galactic Racer, is one of many who formed Fuse Games; a backup car filled with former Criterion developers. These creatives, with a lengthy history working on all manner of racing games including the Burnout series, are bringing their talents to a galaxy far far away.</p>
<p>"Fuse was made with a combination of people who have worked together for a fairly long time, there's things we've loved in Arcade racing - visceral high-octane action and want to bring that to this game," Crimmins explained. "Those sensibilities and some of that DNA from previous games we've worked on, obviously that's in this game because we want to bring that stuff. It's the core of pick-up-and-play arcade racing with great depth, but also great thrill. There's also certain game mechanics that are part of our DNA in there as well."</p><p>Crimmins was joined by one Craig Derrick, executive producer at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/lucasfilm-games">Lucasfilm Games</a> working alongside Fuse Games on Galactic Racer, eager to speak on the game's authenticity. "I'd jump in to say it's high thrill, but also high risk! The spectacular crashes in Galactic Racer, there's elements of that you see in the Burnout series and other racing games, but also the Pod Racing sequence in Star Wars Episode One!</p>
<p>"The fragility of these vehicles in this game, the scrappiness we're implying in this era… They're really just put together for racing, sort of inherently dangerous to race and in a place where crashes are gonna happen. We want to be able to show that! Cinematically in a fun way, but also lean into the arcade elements while emphasizing this is a dangerous sport you're engaging in.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Speedbikes are one of the many vehicles you'll be able to mess around with. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Fuse Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"All the vehicles we have tie into that threat level, as well as the opportunistic choices you can make to win the race. This includes the vehicle you choose, the type of environment you're in, the type of line you're racing in. But yeah, spectacular crashes are going to happen."</p><p>These Burnout-style crashes, while certainly appealing to the Star Wars layperson, also play an integral part of the fantasy according to Derrick and Crimmins. With the Galactic Empire in tatters, people across the Star Wars fiction are having to pull the pieces together and build something meaningful, with some using these pieces to build junkyard vehicles to race vicious across the stars.</p>
<p>"There's a few different things from a play point-of-view," Crimmins said. "Putting our expertise and studio sensibilities into the Star Wars space, it has a rich landscape of vehicle fantasies. Some core pillar racing fantasy, but also as Craig said this used-universe of cobbled together vehicles. All those flavourings are key to that Star Wars vehicle fantasy.</p>
<p>"So while we have our own studio sensibilities, we looked to our partners at Lucas to make sure we translate those into an authentic Star Wars experience. That means having high-octane visceral action with risk / reward mechanics, but also a breadth of experiences you can have in the game. Telling a story, you've got characters and a running storyline that feels like a Star Wars journey you're going on. It's why we've worked so closely with Lucas, so you get that Star Wars magic."</p>
<p>Derrick linked the game very much to this particular era of Star Wars, as well as real world racing history: "For us at Lucas it's all about story, it starts with story. Obviously the film part of Lucas Film is the storytelling part of that, the games part is how you make that interactive. How do you tell an amazing story where you have agency? I think we do that really well, and we're doing that well here. This is ultimately an underdog story and it leans into elements you see in other racing stories, it speaks to the origins of this new league popping up around the end of the Galactic Empire. It's also evocative of this time around the end of World War 2, when all these people had all this machinery. When it was about Hot Rods, testing out jet engines and slamming them in the Salt Flats and trying to race. We have a scrappy group of characters in this that I feel is very exciting.</p><p>"And it's not galactic-wide stakes, it's a local story. There are stakes to each of these characters, they have agendas and reasons for why they're doing what they're doing. But it's less life or death and more win or lose. So it's strongly linked to the competitiveness of the story. The last thing I'll say about authenticity is it's all about aesthetics. It has to look like Star Wars. It has to read familiar as racing in that universe, and it's also the sounds. The music, the engines and these vehicles crunching and hitting each other that's grounded in some authenticity."</p>
<p>Star Wars Galactic Racer is out in 2026 on the PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S. No specific release date has been announced.</p>

            <section><p>The sequel to Squanch Games' detestable FPS demonstrates significant improvement, though its biggest features remain its weakest - and technical issues hinder the progress made.</p></section>
<p>I cannot stress how much I detested High on Life when its loser-ass jiggled out of its mum's basement in a suffocating cloud of weed-smoke. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a>' 2022 FPS was a cynical, jabbering mess that overcompensated for its limp gunplay with meandering, interminable stoner humour. Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-review-a-mediocre-shooter-with-an-unfunny-attitude-problem">High on Life review</a> rightly lambasted it for its failings, and I personally would have been happy to never look at one of its grinning guns ever again.</p>

<p>At the same time, I believe in second chances, and High on Life 2 is at least a partial vindication of that belief. While I wouldn't say all is forgiven after our disastrous first date, Squanch Games has clearly been working on itself over the last three years. High on Life 2 is friendlier, funnier, and faster on the trigger than it was on our first outing. It's also become really effing good at skateboarding, which is unexpected but kinda hot.</p>
<p>Reprising your role of adolescent intergalactic bounty hunter, High on Life 2 kicks off with a playable montage of the events following your victory over the drug-dealing G3 cartel, which sought to corner the market in human-based narcotics. Rescuing humanity from the bottom of alien bongs has catapulted you to celebrity status, and High on Life 2's opening sequence flicks through your subsequent talk-show appearances, hover-limo rides, and battles against alien kaiju with impressive efficiency.</p>
<p>High on Life's high life is clearly wearing on your character, so it's something of a relief when a chance encounter with your sister (now a self-made resistance fighter) course-corrects you onto a new mission – taking down the ringleaders of Rhea Pharmaceutical. The galaxy's biggest drug manufacturer plans to get humans reclassified from illegal drug to medicinal pill, a move that would spell doom for the species… again.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a High on Life 2 trailer to show it in its chatty action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLpk12m1V3E" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>While hardly a sophisticated satire of Big Pharma, the switch yields a more interesting series of objectives than before. High on Life 2 sees you taking down eccentric billionaires, mad scientists, corrupt politicians and literal finance wizards in an array of colourful missions.</p><p>The highlight of these is ConCon, where you're tasked with assassinating the unfortunately named Muppy Doo – Rhea's biggest political supporter – on a planet that's basically Coruscant for conventions. Every activity imaginable has its own celebratory event on ConCon, from politics to murder. Even parking <em>for </em>the conventions is its own, brutally competitive festival, as drivers from across the galaxy compete for the best parking spots in a deadly game that combines musical chairs with vehicular manslaughter.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>This is why I write. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Squanch Games / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From this opening parking-lot brawl to its fourth-wall breaking finale, ConCon showcases High on Life 2 at its most accomplished. Not every mission is so successful – a mid-game scenario where you infiltrate a cult in the Wyoming countryside suffers from staid level design and an overlong boss fight – but unlike the first game, High on Life 2 doesn't run out of imaginative steam halfway through, delivering new ideas into its final hour.</p>
<p>Even its least interesting locations are elevated by the sequel's biggest new feature – the skateboard. There's something mildly miraculous in how Squanch integrates skateboarding into both platforming and combat. By combining simplified controls that focus on ollies, wall-rides and glue-on grinding with more traditional action-game manoeuvres like a double jump and air-dash, Squanch produces a movement toolset that facilitates thrilling acrobatics without knotting your fingers together. Bunny-hopping across lines of hovering traffic in ConCon is tremendously satisfying, as is knocking down enemies by ollie-ing into their faces.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Compared to its colourful aliens, the human characters in High on Life 2 look Unreal Engine as heck. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Squanch Games / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The breeziness of the skateboarding is complemented by High on Life 2's broader adjustment in tone. Put simply, its writing is significantly less annoying than the first game. It's less crass, less misanthropic, less prone to adlibs that run on for far too long. In its place is a more sincere attempt to get you to bond with your talking arsenal. This is most successfully achieved with Travis, your new pistol who you meet in the depths of a self-pitying spiral after falling out with his weaponised wife, Jan. Over the course of several missions, their turbulent relationship is explored in noisy, but well-observed fashion, while Travis' lame-duck persona is the foundation of some fun jokes.</p><p>While a big improvement, I still think High on Life 2's humour falls short of games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a> or Thank Goodness You're Here. The gap between word count and jokes that land is still too wide for my liking, and it still occasionally does that thing where an NPC obstructs you while constantly chittering about it. Nonetheless, the reduced hostility makes it easier to forgive High on Life 2 when the humour doesn't land, and there are good gags within the voluminous script. A late-game joke about stealth mechanics gave me a good chuckle, as did a running joke about one of your weapons' resemblance to a certain Star Wars character.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption> Finally, the Karma Chameleon has caught up with me. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Squanch Games / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>High on Life 2's biggest problem is that its primary mechanic – shooting – remains its weakest element. Again, it's a better FPS than Squanch's first attempt. The enemies are more varied and interesting, the skateboard adds versatility in navigating arenas, and your arsenal has been expanded with a couple of interesting firearms. These include a composite bow that can create dimensional rifts to shoot through, and an assault rifle voiced by Ralph Ineson (which is a back-of-the-box feature in and of itself.)</p>
<p>The problem is that it's all still too floaty and insubstantial, lacking that audio/visual kick that's fundamental to a great shooter. Melee attacks still feel like you're wafting Knifey in front of you rather than slicing your enemy's throat. Juggling enemies with the glob shot is still clumsy and of questionable tactical advantage, while Assault Ralph's sonorous voice is not matched by the pathetic pew of his projectiles.</p>

<figcaption>ConCon is High on Life 2 at its best, while the ringworld hub of Arcadia is shockingly pretty, but the game doesn't make a whole lot of use of it. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Squanch Games / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ultimately, when your shotgun fizzles rather than booms, you've got problems, no matter how meticulously animated its face is. Indeed, much as I enjoy the skateboard's presence, it ultimately serves to distract you from the problems with High on Life 2's combat rather than actually solving them. Sure, being able to launch my skateboard into an opponent's teeth is a fun mechanical flourish. Would I swap this for a shotgun that rattles your soul when you pull the trigger? Without hesitation.</p><p>There are other lingering issues too. The music is still hideous; a tuneless electronic wail that's less an earworm and more an ear infection. The voice acting remains a mix of genuinely excellent performances and oddly flat delivery. There's still an inexplicably huge open-hub area that gives you little impetus to explore it, and I can't help but feel those resources would be better spent on one or two more high-concept missions.</p>

<div>



<p>1: There truly is a Con for everything. 2: Do you like random jumpscares with your disappointing restaurant  food? 3: You can't call High on Life 2 plain.</p>

</div>


<p>Finally, the version of High on Life 2 I played suffered from several major bugs. The most notable of these prevented me from talking to key characters outside of cutscenes, essentially skipping all of their dialogue. This didn’t seem like it would be too much of a problem until I found myself having to solve a murder in the game's first act, wherein said bug prevented me from interrogating any of the suspects. As it happens, I still managed to correctly identify the killer, so just call me Lieutenant Sherlock Poirot from now on.</p>
<p>Regardless, I came away from High on Life 2 pleasantly surprised. Not mesmerised. Not blown away. But also not wishing I could charge Justin Roiland for 15 of the sorriest hours of my life. I won't speculate on how Roiland's departure from Squanch affected the trajectory of the sequel. But from an outside perspective, High on Life 2 has grown up in mostly the right ways, while retaining enough of its goofball personality to be a good hang when it counts. Is it love? Not quite. But I wouldn't kick it out of bed either.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunner-teases-ron-perlman-role-in-future-seasons">Fallout Season 2</a> and the imminent arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> port have led to a plethora of news on the past, present, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">future</a> of the franchise. Of course, that includes plenty of new insights on the development of the more distant games, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/FalloutOralHistory-PartII">Game Informer's multi-part Oral History</a> of the enduring RPG series is the gift that keeps on giving (really, give it a full read if you have the time), and now we're sharing an interesting bit on what actually happened with Fallout 3's Washington DC area, which we've always known <a href="https://archive.ph/2JtWq">was severely cut down in the final release</a> as Bethesda Games Studios readjusted the scope and depth of the ambitious game.</p>
<p>It was lead designer and writer Emil Pagliarulo, a well-known name for Bethesda fans and detractors, who commented again on the problems the team ran into as they bit more than they could chew: "Originally, we had this thought that the Metro would be connected completely underground. And we realized it was just too sprawling. It was too big."</p>
<p>If you're familiar with Fallout 3, you know that, at least in your first playthrough, moving through DC's Metro underground is pretty much unavoidable in order to advance the main questline early on. Of course, it's not a must once you figure out how things are structured and the absurd number of quests you can straight-up skip, but the ghoul-infested stations are places we've all visited at least once or twice. The problem? They're too samey and quite limited in variety. Plus, they're simply full of load screens as you transition between cells and into the topside areas of Washington.</p><p>Overall, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/if-a-fallout-3-remaster-is-happening-im-hoping-it-fixes-the-rpgs-biggest-level-design-issue/">Fallout 3's Metro map was never very enjoyable to traverse or loot</a> because of its disjointed nature, which ironically happened as a result of having to "cut down sections" because "traversing miles of underground subway stations" is all realism, but the lesson BGS has learned over the years is "that being realistic sometimes isn't fun."</p>
<p>Needless to say, there's a huge crowd for denser experiences like that, as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/36101">some great mods</a> for Bethesda's games have proven, but when you're targeting a mainstream audience, it just makes sense to hold back a bit and put your resources elsewhere. At least that's what I think as a renowned Bethesda sicko who'd no doubt enjoy an expanded Metro underground.</p>
<p>In any case, thinking about the more casual crowd and empowering other aspects of the RPGs clearly paid off, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-developers-talk-fallout-4-success-and-legacy">Fallout 4 instantly became Bethesda's biggest Fallout ever</a> and remains many players' personal favourite over a decade after its launch.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It is fair to say God of War creator David Jaffe is less than enamoured with the series' newest entry, 2D side-scroller Sons of Sparta.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced during last week's PlayStation State of Play, coming from Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Santa Monica Studio. It's a canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>
<p>At the same time it was announced, Sons of Sparta released on PS5 consoles. And, well, Jaffe is not impressed.</p>
<p>During a nine minute YouTube video, Jaffe quickly laid into the series' latest offering. "This is the kind of game I have always wanted in terms of 2.5D God of War… but this to me is not what I was talking about," Jaffe begins, before stating in no uncertain terms: "I don't like it, I don't recommend it."</p>
<p>That was fairly gentle, though, compared to the rest of the video, where Jaffe calls Sons of Sparta "crap", "dumb" and even "stupid".</p>
<p>"What the f**k are they thinking," Jaffe expressed. While the original God of War director did say the gameplay in Sons of Sparta is "fine" and "servicable", he still can't wrap his head around why the game is "in existence" at all.</p><p>"I don't understand, I don't understand," Jaffe said with his face in his hand, reflecting on a conversation he had had with a former Sony Santa Monica developer about the scene in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> where Atreus and Angrboda chat while riding along together. Allegedly, the developer told Jaffe Sony Santa Monica is "these days driven primarily by story", which Jaffe seemed less than enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>"In Sons of Sparta, what I played – which was only about an hour of it, and I'll never go back to it – it's just like 'get over yourselves, man,” the God of War creator said. "They just kept stopping over and over and having the characters just talk and talk and talk. And the voice acting's not very good, the story - at least what I played… maybe it gets really good… - [but] who the f**k wants to play [Sons of Sparta]. This is not God of War."</p>
<p>He continued: "I want you to think about this for a minute, and the choice this team had… the idea of saying 'hey, we want a 2.5D metroidvania God of War game'. Most gamers would say 'oh my god, yes please'. [But] the idea of 'aaand, we don't want it to be the Kratos that you know and love from either 2018's God of War, or the Greek trilogy God of War. F**k it, that character's boring, no one likes that Kratos, that we've built billions of dollars franchises on. Let's make him just some generic f**king kid'... it makes no f**king sense."</p>
<p>Jaffe then said Sons of Sparta's origin story for Kratos as a "dumb idea", and suggested fans would have rather played a game like the much bloodier and violent Metroidvania title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. This, Jaffe said, has the "tone" of the earlier God of Wars. "I'm pretty sure when people said they wanted a 2D God of War, they meant [like Blasphemous]", not Sons of Sparta. "Who the f**k greenlit this? Who thought this was what the audience wants?"</p><p>Meanwhile, if that wasn't enough, Jaffe also laid into Sons of Sparta's production quality. "Compared to what we got just this last year," he said, "if you look at the gameplay variety and just the joy of playing a game like Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, if you look at the art and level of detail and just genuine interesting scenarios at a moment-to-moment gameplay level of Neon Inferno – which also came out towards the end of last year, which is just an excellent shooter by the way, I highly recommend it - if you of course look at the production value of the 2D Shinobi, I mean look at that thing.</p>
<p>"People want this production value, and they want this vibe, and they want it to be classic Kratos."</p>
<p>Jaffe suggested that if you "pulled God of War" out of Sons of Sparta, and instead said "hey, we are making a game about this kid", people wouldn't be interested. "I want to know who at Sony thought this was what people wanted," he said. "By the way, I don't need the big budgets. I would have loved bigger production value, smoother animations, this, that, and the other, but I don’t need that, right? If the gameplay was interesting, if it was violent, if it had personality, if you opened immediately and the players were like 'oh my God, I've never thought of that kind of mechanic in a game like this', or 'this is so fun to do', you could make it super inexpensive like this seems to be. I can't imagine this cost that much money to make.</p>
<p>"But why would you even put this out? All it does is leave a bad taste in God of War fans' mouths, in my assumption."</p>
<p>Jaffe said this whole thing "shows such a collapse of the great executive work that Sony in the past has done", and "the fact that they would think this is what people want from God of War… I just don't know what to f**king tell you".</p>
<p>You can check out Jaffe's increasingly - erm - impassioned speech in full below.</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade (which will hopefully not receive the same reception from Jaffe on its release). However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

            <p>Like it or not, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> was a hit. Developer Shift Up (and PS5/PC publisher Sony) has been trying to avoid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up">all sorts of drama</a> since its release, but with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/as-stellar-blade-reaches-3-million-sales-shift-up-ceo-rewards-all-300-employees-with-a-switch-2/">over 3m copies sold</a> overall by mid-2025, it's safe to say the action-adventure game found an audience.</p>
<p>Shortly before its PC release last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">Shift Up confirmed the game would get a sequel</a>, and that plans were already underway. Now, thanks to the Q&amp;A section in <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">the company's last financial report</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-sounds-like-stellar-blade-may-launch-on-xbox-and-nintendo-switch-2-this-year">IGN</a>), we've gotten confirmation that the powers that be are looking at expanding to platforms beyond PS5 and PC... which essentially means current-gen Xbox consoles and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are in their sights.</p>
<p>The Korean studio has once again described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> as a "steady, long-tail IP" which will be capitalised on in the coming years. Since the sequel is (predictably) a way off, we don't find the news of tentative Xbox and Switch 2 ports particularly shocking. Again, this doesn't mean they're 100 percent happening, but the move makes sense and is definitely on the table. "This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up added, before explicitly mentioning advances on that front will happen as soon as later this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the developer is also working on <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-spirits">Project Spirits</a>, an all-new "flagship title" which will be published by Level Infinite and is targeting consoles, PC, and mobile. Whether the new versions of Stellar Blade would be self-published is up in the air too, but if I had to bet, I'm not expecting Sony to be involved after helping out with the PS5 and PC launches.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shiftup-ceo-receives-presidential-commendation-for-stellar-blade-and-nikke">Shift Up's CEO received</a> "a presidential commendation for boosting the South Korean games industry" following the game's exceptional financial performance and its impact on making the Korean games industry another heavyweight to watch out for in the AAA space, with Neowiz and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">Lies of P</a> also adding to that conversation.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is one of those multiplayer games that continue to thrive without making much noise outside their core communities. In fact, last year brought a number of substantial changes to the game through the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-x-update-detailed-as-game-goes-free-to-play">Rainbow Six Siege X update</a>. Shame about those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-still-struggling-after-ubisoft-was-forced-to-briefly-intentionally-shut-it-down-following-third-party-hack">massive attacks from hackers</a> though.</p>
<p>In any case, a new year brings new opportunities, and this next content drop had probably been brewing for a long while. The rumours were true: Solid Snake as seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> is coming to the game on 3rd March. Yep, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-mgs4-from-the-ps3-with-august-release-date-sony-state-of-play">Konami has gone beast mode</a> and is even doing a huge collaboration now with a publisher that was a major competitor years ago.</p> <figure>

<p>The reveal trailer is self-explanatory: Sam Fisher (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> series) and Solid Snake in the same game? Working together? Time-travel back to the mid-2000s with this trailer and you'd blow the gaming industry's collective mind. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-ification of every franchise big enough is real, but if that's the future of entertainment, we might as well enjoy team-ups that always were destined to happen.</p>
<p>Fisher joined Rainbow Six Siege a few years back, when it was starting to embrace the potential of crossovers with other IPs. Of course, it's far more shocking when those big collabs happen with different publishers, and even more special when we're talking about stealth game legends. And if you were thinking Solid Snake is just a skin or a lazy operator design, you'd be wrong:</p><figure>

<p>As thoroughly described by <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7wYca8Fw674NP93tZe9uDe/solid-snake-joins-rainbow-six-siege-in-operation-silent-hunt">the blog post on Operation Silent Hunt</a>, "Solid Snake excels at tracking down Defender positions and scavenging supplies on the battlefield to adapt to any situation" thanks to the familiar Soliton Radar MKIII gadget and an "On-Site Procurement ability." The battle pass for this season instantly unlocks Snake and includes cosmetics for other operators, like the Psycho Mantis outfit for Smoke. Later, a mystery new mode will be added alongside more MGS outfits and the long-awaited team-up with Sam Fisher, which is a limited-time mode of sorts.</p>
<p>Beyond the fan excitement surrounding Snake's arrival to R6 Siege, it's safe to say this new addition to the roster will shake the meta up in big ways, as the stealth legend is a master of controlling movement in the battlefield and can carry more secondary gadgets. Can he be a lore-friendly <em>and</em> balanced operator? Let's hope so.</p>

            <p>So, we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">looking impressive</a> so far, and we've also been told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">it's a pretty long game</a> even if you aren't planning on sticking around after the credits roll. With so much to do and a multiplayer option that's promising one of the most relaxing experiences of the year, how do its online functionalities work exactly?</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu's big interview</a> with key Pokémon, Game Freak, and Koei Tecmo figures (hat tip to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mexpgsz4t22m">Kano on Bluesky</a>), we've found out about another bit of info that should please everyone who was already looking forward to the game, especially those who spent way too much time playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> with friends on private servers back in the day.</p>
<p>Before getting into how the multiplayer actually works in Pokopia, game director Takuto Edagawa revealed the project is Omega Force's largest to date: "I can't give you a specific number of people, but this is the largest number of people involved in any title developed by ω-Force (Omega Force)* to date." Moreover, creative work on the game wasn't one-sided with Game Freak and The Pokémon Company only approving submissions; new Pokémon designs were created and iterated on together all the way through.</p>
<p>About multiplayer, Edagawa says it indeed works as explained in the trailer released so far: You can either visit a host's main island or develop a "blank" one that's completely separate from the story mode progress. That second one allows players to "work together" in order to fully develop and reshape it into the peaceful village of their dreams.</p><p>The important bit here is that "even if the host (island owner) isn't playing, everyone can join in and play." The team is calling this system "Cloud Island" and it essentially works like you were thinking: Minecraft's private, persistent servers. This potentially means it's the sort of online feature that will one day go offline, but it opens up many possibilities and should make Pokémon Pokopia immensely more attractive for those of us whose schedules rarely line up. In fact, Edagawa basically states <em>that</em> was the driving force behind the functionality.</p>
<p>With only a little over two weeks to go, Pokopia is looking like one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s strongest exclusives yet, and I'm personally thinking it's going to be among 2026's biggest hits. Are you excited by the news on how multiplayer works or are you going full solo?</p>

            <p>If learning that the next entry into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> series was going multiplatform had you worried about the graphical quality of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s upcoming narrative rollercoaster, a recent interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi should put those fears to rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/">Speaking to Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi reassured fans concerned about the graphical quality of FF7 Remake, when asked whether recent ports to the Xbox Series S or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> had any impact on development.</p>
<p>"Both the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox versions have been incredibly well received and generated a lot of buzz online," Hamaguchi said. "That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment. Our development structure simply doesn't work that way to begin with. ...I suppose I'll just have to keep saying it (laughs). "</p>
<p>Later in the interview Hamaguchi explained that due to the gradual explosion of PC popularity in Japan, and the faster rate of PC adoption in the West, the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series is being built with PCs in mind, reducing the quality of assets for medium-end platforms like the PS5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, then lower still for other platforms.</p><p>"While PC gaming is gradually expanding in Japan, overseas growth has been even more rapid," Hamaguchi  explained. "The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC. The FF7 Remake series has sold very well on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we develop assets with the broad PC market in mind. In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p>
<p>"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third installment. As our fundamental principle, we do not design assets to meet the lowest baseline. Instead, we create them for high-end environments first. "</p>
<p>As of March last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-series-has-now-sold-over-200m-copies-worldwide">the Final Fantasy series had sold over 200m copies worldwide</a>, while the Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Its sequel, as well as Final Fantasy 16 did not meet expectations according to Square Enix</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A console release for Steam's cat-breeding roguelike Mewgenics is currently in the works.</p>
<p>That's coming from none other than Mewgenics' co-creator Edmund McMillen, who over the weekend responded to a question on social media about when players can expect a console release of the indie hit.</p>
<p>Alas, while McMillen and his fellow co-creator Tyler Glaiel are working on this console version "now", it isn't clear when it will be released. "Not sure when it will be done," <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2022933090423968119">McMillen said</a>.</p>
<p>On the plus side, though, it sounds like everyone regardless of console preference could get a bite of the Mewgenics pie, as McMillen added "at this point it might be in Dev for all systems". Personally, I can picture losing more than a few hours to Mewgenics while curled up in bed with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent post, McMillen again affirmed a console version is on the cards, and that <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?s=20">there is DLC coming</a>. It doesn't sound like this DLC will be free, though, with the <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023171863946613160?s=20">developer stating</a> "it's going to take a lot of work/people".</p>
<p>As for that DLC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">McMillen has said the Mewgenics team will start work on DLC "in a few months"</a>, only after seeing exactly what it is fans actually like about the game.</p>
<p>Oh, and also, McMillen was not expecting Mewgenics to become the hit that it has. As a reminder, the game sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and last week developer Glaiel revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in just 36 hours. That's not too shabby at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> are sitting at a "Very Positive" average, with comments such as "McMillen you did it again I want to punch you". There is also a lot of love for Mewgenics' soundtrack, which has been described as both "amazing" and "bonkers".</p>

<p>The lovely Christian Donlan has already been hands-on with Mewgenics, and all in all was quite taken with it. "If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">Eurogamer's Mewgenics Now Playing feature</a>.</p>

<p>"What David and Alexandre bring to Dead by Daylight is a rare balance of character driven storytelling and relentless genre intensity," said Jason Blum, Blumhouse's founder and CEO.</p>
<p>"Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale."</p>
<p>Behaviour seem similarly happy with the writers, too.</p>
<p>"Alexandre and David are two modern masters of horror, and their script celebrates a dark distinction, Dead by Daylight is a game, its world is a nightmare," added Stephen Mulrooney, producer and Behaviour's chief product officer.</p>
<p>"We look forward to working with a director who appreciates the depth of their story, and cannot wait to see their visceral vision brought to life."</p>
<p>We found out that Blumhouse - the horror-focused movie production company behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, and Get Out - had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-is-turning-dead-by-daylight-into-a-movie">plans to adapt Dead by Daylight into a film back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The project is being developed in conjunction with Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour Interactive and Atomic Monster (the production company run by prominent horror director James Wan), with the latter calling the game's "incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains...perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation".</p><p>Dead by Daylight launched its asymmetrical multiplayer horror - which sees four survivors attempting to escape a powerful killer - back in 2016, and the game's been played by over 50 million people since then and features some of cinema's most iconic horror villains, including Halloween's Michael Myers, Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface, Saw's Amanda Young, and Scream's Ghost Face.</p>
