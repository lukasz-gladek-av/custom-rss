            <p>A Q&amp;A between shareholders and Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa has been released alongside February's quarterly financial report, in which the topic of rising memory costs was discussed. While the price hikes haven't impacted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> yet, Furukawa states that might change if the trend continues into the next fiscal year.
</p>
<p>When asked if the rising price of memory has impacted the Switch 2's profitability, and whether this could lead to a price revision for the console, Furukawa responded with the following:</p>
<p>"We do not disclose details regarding individual components, but we can say that we are working to secure stable supplies of memory components by holding discussions from a long term perspective with our business partners. As a result, the recent rise in memory prices did not have a significant impact on hardware profitability in the third quarter. In addition, we do not expect any significant impact in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>"However, if this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability. If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond. As for any future change in the price of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, no decision has been made at this time. Any decision to change the price will be determined comprehensively, taking into consideration not only profitability, but also other factors like the platform's installed base, sales trends, and the market environment."</p>

</figure>
<p>Furukawa was also asked if Nintendo will focus on expanding the install-base of the Switch 2 or the console's profitability in the future, given the context of these rising component prices. To this, he responded: "The current rise in memory prices is happening at a pace that exceeds our expectations. In general, the profitability of hardware tends to improve with economies of scale, and we want to continue to reduce costs as much as possible through mass production of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. With regard to not selling hardware at a loss, what we are focusing on is profitability on a global basis.</p><p>"There are various external factors, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, but looking at the global picture, we have traditionally tried to avoid situations where individual units are sold at a loss as much as possible. It is difficult to predict the changes in the external environment that are currently taking place, but I think it is not an appropriate approach to be excessively influenced by short-term trends. The second and third years for Nintendo Switch 2 are very important, and if we can expand the hardware installed base, we can use that as a basis to greatly expand software sales. We will take this into account when making business decisions and flexibly consider various options."</p>
<p>One shareholder, noticing that inventory of the Switch 2 was higher than usual, asked whether this stocking up on the console was an intentional decision made with the rising cost of memory in-mind. This, it turns out, wasn't the case. Instead, the higher than usual inventory was to get ahead of potential supply issues leading into last year's holiday season.</p>
<p>"Our aim was to begin production as early as possible so that we could secure sufficient inventory at launch," states Furukawa. "Even after the release of Nintendo Switch 2, we worked to expand production capacity to establish a position where we can respond appropriately if demand during the holiday season exceeded projections. As a result of these initiatives, we hold a certain amount of components and products, and these are recorded as inventory. While we currently expect some sort of impact on profitability if the increase in memory prices continues over the long term, we do not anticipate constraints in our production plans due to insufficient supply in the next fiscal year and beyond."</p>
<p>These rising memory prices, caused by the ongoing production strain of AI datacenters and the wider generative AI boom, has resulted in widespread industry shifts as certain components skyrocket in demand.<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/nvidia-is-reportedly-looking-to-cut-gaming-gpu-production-by-up-to-40-percent-in-2026-due-to-vram-supply-issues-but-its-not-as-bad-news-as-you-might-think-not-yet-at-least/"> It was only earlier this year that reports indicated that Nvidia would cut gaming GPU production due to VRAM shortages</a>. Here's hoping things settle down before consoles - the Nintendo Switch 2 included - are seriously impacted.</p>

            <p>To remake anything beloved is to walk a tightrope. There is always a delicate balance to be struck between keeping what made the original great intact and delivering on the remake's promise to modernise, improve and strengthen. It's such a hard task that one can be forgiven for being reluctant to undertake it even once, but in the case of Dragon Quest 7 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> now faces down this conundrum a second time.  Are they gluttons for punishment?</p>

<p>Dragon Quest 7 was first released for PlayStation way back in the year 2000. The game became known as a solid cult classic, and in particular garnered praise for its unique structure, with the narrative taking place across a series of islands each with its own largely self-enclosed narrative. Instead of one huge over-arching story, DQ7 is essentially a series of lovely vignettes that eventually broadly tie together. This structure also helped to lend this game the other thing it became famous for: its size. It is absolutely enormous, a proper poster child for the Japanese RPG stuffed-to-bursting.</p>
<p>Fast forward thirteen years, and Square Enix had a second crack of the whip with a remake for the Nintendo 3DS. This version, the first to be officially released in Europe, made a number of changes to streamline the game to the point where Square Enix referred to it as an 'abridged' version of the original. Tack on another thirteen years and somebody at Square Enix had clearly concluded that the 3DS version wasn't abridged enough - as here we now are in 2026 with Dragon Quest 7: Reimagined.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, this is not an abridged version of that sprawling original. It is a reimagined version instead - reconsidered, with the cuts and design changes deeper and more wide-ranging than had been attempted on the 3DS. Remakes of games that are loved can be a scary business, but nobody could say here that Reimagined's developers have been timid: they have gone for it, and been unafraid to wield the axe. The result is the most welcoming version of DQ7 yet - though that in turn comes at a cost.</p><p>Reimagined does not hold back. Because of the siloed nature of its narrative, it is easy enough to drop entire islands or plot lines, for instance, without damaging the overarching story. This game does that. Other places have been pruned back so significantly they are tough to recognise. Dragon Quest 7 was a truly non-handholdy RPG, which led to scenarios where players could be confused about where to go or what to do next, especially after some time away from the game. Reimagined aggressively curtails this - objectives are now clearly marked at all times. Key item nearby? It'll be boldly highlighted on your map. Conversations between your allies often serve double duty as character building and ensuring you absolutely do not forget where to go next.</p>
<p>Battles are closer to the 3DS than the original, triggered by encountering visible enemies on the overworld rather than through pure random encounters. DQ7's turn-based combat is still classic fare for this series and totally satisfying, though it has been gently softened in myriad ways. Enemy weaknesses are instantly highlighted from the very moment you first meet them. It's much easier to heal fully and much harder for your party to wipe now - and even if that happens the punishment for doing so is breezy. The increased frequency of full, free heals at the Sacred Statues means Dragon Quest's familiar careful resource management is a lot less important.</p>

</figure>
<p>You can even cut down weaker enemies on the field, without entering combat at all, if you're powerful enough. If you know your way around a turn-based RPG, you will inherently know in your very soul how much time that will inevitably save. In the end, failure has been made almost impossible and busywork has been all but eliminated. You likely won't need to fret about the game's admittedly generous difficulty options, for the default is already easy enough.</p><p>All of this is of the like that it will certainly provoke a range of responses, especially given the reputation of the original as an unwieldy beast. Undeniably brilliant without debate is Reimagined's gorgeous new doll-like art style, though. For my money this is one of the most pleasing and lovely ways I've yet seen to bring sprite-based pixel art and the poppy colorful designs of Akira Toriyama into 3D.</p>
<p>These character models have a fascinating story, for Square Enix actually built scale dolls of each of Dragon Quest 7's characters and then scanned and captured them in order to understand things like materials, lighting conditions, and articulation. I think you can really tell - they're slightly uncanny, but they're also absolutely brilliant. They're expressive and detailed in all the right ways while retaining a playful vigor that is at the heart of Dragon Quest.</p>
<p>When you take it all in - the approachable art, the gameplay lubricated to the point where any attempt to grapple with its systems too thoroughly will have it slip through your fingers - one gets the sense that this is actually Square Enix taking what it knows is one of its most beloved entries in the Dragon Quest series with the hardcore and making a bold attempt to reorient that experience as the sort of game that could be somebody's very first Dragon Quest. It makes for a curious comparison and companion piece to the recent remakes of the first three titles in the series. Those are more faithful to the originals. This is something else.</p>



<p>That something isn't bad, either. In fact, I think it's rather good. But it is a different kind of good to the original versions of Dragon Quest 7. What was once a game filled with friction, difficulty, challenge, scale - yes, arguably too much scale - has now sanded down every rough edge in sight. It is the Japanese RPG equivalent of when you buy those rubber things to pad the edges of your coffee table so your toddler doesn't fall over and take their eye out.</p><p>I'm sort of alright with that. The brisk and cheerful journey that has been presented here does play to DQ7's strengths, allowing even the most casual and vaguely curious player to meander from one island to the next experiencing the various storylines and vignettes on offer. With how deep these cuts and changes go there was a danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, as the saying goes, but I do think that fate has been largely avoided. There's some regrettable cuts, yes. More experienced fans like myself may very well bemoan the handholding or the lack of difficulty - but I also expect this game isn't really made for me. I had the constitution, after all, to get through the previous two versions even when they were at their most sluggish and grindy.</p>
<p>In short, this is a fascinating new way to experience a classic, and while plainly not as definingly brilliant as the original, it is certainly a more approachable and modern way to understand why it was so. I just wish, as with some of the Final Fantasy titles, this version existed alongside a reliable way to play one of the other versions on existing systems. Both side-by-side, with players offered a choice between the two, would be perfect. But this reimagining on its own isn't bad, either.</p>

            <p>One of the greatest things on earth is when you're talking to someone you sort of know and they quietly switch from talking about human friends or family members to talking about their cats. It's great because there's often no meaningful alteration in tone to tell you something has changed. Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility. They are known by their names but also by their behaviours.</p>

<p>The cats in Mewgenics are known by their behaviours.</p>
<p>Mewgenics - strange harmony here: Francis Galton, cousin of Darwin and originator of the racist pseudoscience of eugenics, also published a paper called Three Generations of Lunatic Cats - is all about cats and what they get up to. An easy way in might be to see it as a kind of XCOM for cats. You gather a gang of four cats and then take them out on a violent adventure, moving through different cat-adjacent spaces - caves, sewers - and engaging in turn-based battles with the various creeping horrors you find there.</p>
<p>In battles, the cats rove about a grid and use a variety of attacks or passive abilities to defeat everyone they're up against before moving on. Each adventure is a kind of roguelite run, so alongside battles and bosses you'll encounter little vignettes that could turn out to be good or bad - eat the mystery meat? - or treasure chests, or branching paths that allow you to take a different route depending on how good you're feeling about your chances.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a Mewgenics trailer to show it in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH9xJU44Ffg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>So why is it called Mewgenics and not, say, XCOM: Enemy's Gone and Dumped on the Carpet? This is because after a run, you retire your cats and they go and live in a house together. Well, sometimes they do. Because where XCOM had a bit of base-building, Mewgenics has a whole machine that runs on cats. Strays come by and can be dropped into the house to then take out on new adventures. Retired cats can mate and create kittens that can grow up and - you're with me - be taken out on new adventures with the former strays. Fine.</p><p>But then it gets weird. Because around your house is a whole town of people who will give you things <em>in return for cats</em>. This upgrade system is decidedly non-fun, and all the more brilliantly squeamish for it. Someone in town wants retired cats in return for adding a new room to your house. Someone wants kittens to teach you about cat ancestry. Someone wants dead cats. Of course they do. The machine that runs on cats chugs along and you exchange your cats judiciously to expand your house, to get a bigger stash, to learn more about the world of Mewgenics and cat breeding all that jazz.</p>



<p>Oh yes, cat breeding. I'm still early on in this dazzlingly rich and complex game but I'm already understanding that success in the long term revolves around breeding cats and making sure you like the outcomes. Cats have traits and abilities that are useful in battle, but because you can only take a cat out for one roguelite run before it's retired, you need to be careful about then breeding your retired cats to keep the traits and abilities you like in play. The right environment helps: certain rooms boost your chances of interesting mutations or of healing damage or of passing on better abilities. Further on in the breeding distance - this is a thing? - lies new class abilities, which opens the door to multiclassing. Hold me.</p><p>This is important, I can tell even now, because the turn-based stuff really isn't screwing around. XCOM may be the closest touchstone but it isn't a perfect match. Rather than Firaxis' ingenious and much copied two-actions-per-turn design, Mewgenics opens things out a bit. You can move and you can attack each turn, but each cat also has a pool of mana that allows them to use various powers and abilities that they have been bequeathed, either by the random number game of birth genetics, or clever breeding, or the collar they're given that denotes their class - healer, archer etc. etc. - or by levelling up and unlocking stuff on their run.</p>
<p>There are dozens and dozens of these abilities and they're frequently brilliant. At the simple end you have something like a straightforward melee attack or a fur-ball ranged move, say, but very quickly you get interesting variants. One cat might have an attack that can also heal friendly units. Another might have a move that puts them in a certain position behind enemies: crucial for a game in which attacking from a certain angle gives you better results. Another might send a fly zipping across the screen or perform a dash attack. My favourite so far is a move that punches an enemy INTO SPACE for the rest of the turn before they land and do massive damage. (To themselves, happily.)</p>



<p>Add on passives and you get really game-changing builds. On one run, for example, I was completely pummeled by an enemy that lobbed mines around the screen, mines that would slowly tick down and then explode inflicting harsh pain along rows and columns. Next time around I was dreading this guy, but I found out two of my cats on this run had passives that meant they did automatic spit attacks whenever anything moved within range, and so all this guy's mines were automatically rendered useless. This is just one example. The passives in this game kind of rule.</p><p>Then there are things like the vermin and goop-heavy enemies - often disgusting, but always creatively designed and game-altering - and the environments you move through. Some will be littered with chunks of masonry you can use as cover. Others will have grass or patches of broken glass that alter your movement options. A lot of the attacks you're given are elemental, so electrical attacks to an enemy standing in a pool of water will radiate outwards. Then you hit the sewer levels where pools of water shift around, moving units with them. Fire attacks are great until all that grass gamely catches light.</p>



<p>Onwards the game unspools with new ideas, but the reason it remains rich rather than bewildering is that the ideas all make sense. You innately know what thorns are going to do to a unit. You know that taking your cat wearing paper armour into a lake is not going to be good for the paper armour. (Oh yes, there's a rich item game in play, too. The things you can deck these cats out with.)</p>

<p>Mewgenics is the work of Edmund McMillen, as well as Tyler Glaiel, and there's a lot of McMillen's previous work in particular at play here. Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> are a fascinating and distinctive blend of grot and high-powered thought, so it's not rare to fight a bunch of feces monsters in the sewers in Mewgenics and then be frozen in place for a few seconds by the brilliant wording of a tooltip. The art is thick felt pen lines on the greys and blacks of wet newsprint. It's instantly obvious who made this stuff.</p>

<p>If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in. New classes, new abilities, new items, new environments, new ramifications to the cat breeding - not a sentence I type every day - make it clear even to a dimwit like me that twelve hours from now this is going to be a very different game to the one I think I'm playing at the moment. It's cats, then, and they're definitely all lunatics. But expect far more than three generations of them this time out.</p>

            <p>
Bandai Namco has pledged a range of fixes for its Soulslike sequel Code Vein 2, including frame rate and performance improvements, following "feedback".
</p>
<p>
Code Vein 2 launched for PlayStation 5, Xbox series X/S, and PC late last month, sending players on a post-apocalyptic adventure through time in a bid to thwart an impending disaster. Its reception was mixed, but one consistent criticism focused its wonky performance.
</p>

<p>
And now Bandai Namco has acknowledged these complaints in a message <a href="https://x.com/CodeVeinGame/status/2019724775665340440">on social media</a>, saying the Code Vein 2 team is "committed to improving the game for a better experience" and will be making a number of "major adjustments" in response to player feedback.
</p><p>
Top of the list is stability, with Bandai Namco promising improved frame rates during combat (with boss battles said to be a priority), a reduction in stuttering and lag during field exploration, and more general adjustments to reduce temporary frame rate drops during play. It's also looking to improve frame rates when using "Prioritise Action" mode on consoles.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Additionally, players can expect a range of "action balance" adjustments intended to, among other things, enhance the responsiveness of Evasion and Guarding, and to improve "game feel" relating to controls and feedback for certain player attacks. That's alongside changes to enemy behaviour, plus broader adjustments and bug fixes. Oh, and customisation fans are getting bangs as a new 'front hair' accessory too.
</p>
<p>
There's no news on when these updates will arrive, but Bandai Namco says it plans to release them over the course of "multiple patches".
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, as a series newcomer and Soulslike fan, I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-wasnt-expecting-much-from-code-vein-2-but-its-a-very-pleasant-surprise">quite enjoyed my time with Code Vein 2</a> when I took it for a whirl last month, even if that erratic performance wasn't exactly easy on the eyes.

            <p>Sophie Turner has started filming for Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider adaptation, and we now have our first look at her Lara Croft making her way through a soggy woodland.</p>
<p>The brief footage, which you can see below, shows Turner's Lara with holsters-a-plenty, because yes, those are her dual pistols you can see strapped to her thighs. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turner's hair has been styled in a long braid for the scene, which according to the YouTube description accompanying this footage, was shot in Surrey (that explains the weather).</p>

<p>Additional set photos show Turner doing her own stunts, and parachuting in to the scene (via <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html">Daily Mail</a>).</p>
<p>You can see some images of this below.</p>

<p>We've recently had a flurry of cast announcements for Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>. Along with Turner's Lara Croft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs has been cast as Lara's Uncle Atlas</a>, while Martin Bobb-Semple will play Zip, Bill Paterson will play Winston and Celia Imrie will play Francine (that is to say, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, who is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne").</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a>, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p>

<p>"It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Waller-Bridge has said of Tomb Raider</a>. "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p>

            <p>The Highguard team has released another patch for its live-service hero shooter.</p>
<p>This update includes a new Warden, known as Ekon. Ekon is described as a "legendary Wildwalker" who is able to shapeshift into a direwolf. This means he doesn't need a mount, as he is the mount.</p>
<p>"When his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard, there is no monster or Warden this great predator will allow to stand in his way," developer Wildlight teases.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As well as this new Warden, the update - which welcomes in Highguard episode two - also adds a new map known as Skydrift which, as the name suggests, takes place above the clouds. From a quick glance at the artwork for this map (see further below), I get flashbacks to the sky islands in Legend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but with more structures dotted about.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements include the likes of being able to leave the party by clicking on party member's social card, Dead players no longer show up on the minimap and more.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>PC game-download store GOG has come under scrutiny for using generative-AI in marketing artwork, then for seeming to sit on the fence in an answer about whether it will keep using the tech in the future.</p>
<p>The piece of artwork was a banner advertising a 2026 sale, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/post69?cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj">which a GOG forum user, presumed to be a GOG artist, spoke out about</a> and confirmed was created with AI. This caused a stink and so gen-AI use was one of the topics GOG was immediately questioned about during <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qu09vg/ask_the_gog_team_and_micha%C5%82_kici%C5%84ski_anything/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">an Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski - when asked about the negative reaction and whether GOG would move away from gen-AI use in the future - replied: "We're not planning on making absolute statements in either direction. AI tools are one of many technologies we test and try out, and in some contexts it genuinely helps us push the company (and the mission) forward.</p>
<p>"What we will change, though, is how and where those tools are used; we understand that using new technology doesn't mean skipping human judgment." His answer did nothing to cool or calm the crowd.</p>

<p>I followed this response up with GOG and Gołębiewski this morning but was told GOG wouldn't elaborate on what had been said. However, I did speak to Gołębiewski at length in January, in an interview about GOG's private acquisition, and gen-AI was one of the topics we broached.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use"</em></blockquote>
<p>Gołębiewski told me at the time: "We are not using it [gen-AI] as of right now, but we've seen instances where communities have used the AI or neural network to analyse all of the code that is available for a game - all of the repositories or the documentation that's available for a game - with an aim of making it run better or maybe making it run on a different operating system or different hardware. AI is pretty good at absorbing the context and then guessing some action points based on that context.</p>
<p>"We haven't done this in this form," he added, "but I'm sure that at some point the application of AI - not necessarily generative AI in terms of artworks or code or whatever - will be found for how this can be used to advance game preservation. Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use. It's just the road to that is usually windy, shaky, however you might call it. So we haven't yet, but I'm not saying we won't do it in the future. If this can be used to advance our mission, then we will do it."</p>

<p>GOG's founding mission - and continuing mission - is restoring and preserving classic games, whether they be old classics or more modern classics, and ensuring they can be played in their best form into the future without being locked behind DRM. This often requires a lot of work on GOG's end, hence the attraction of AI in helping alleviate some of that.</p><p>But GOG is a store that also sells newer games, both indie and bigger games, and that prides itself on a selective approach, and on being close to its audience and receptive to them. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">GOG earned plenty of respect by stocking provocative indie horror game Horses</a> last year, when other stores, like Epic and Steam, wouldn't. "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values," Maciej Gołębiewski said to me about making that decision. It's a statement that seems to grate against what it's saying now about gen-AI.</p>
<p>GOG recently became a private company after having spent its entire existence as part of CD Projekt - the house of The Witcher games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. And one of the positive potential ramifications of this is not being burdened by that huge game-making business, and therefore being more agile and able to take risks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">new owner Michał Kiciński explained to me recently</a>. I wonder if this moment will be a telling one in the company's new era.</p>

            <p>The Exit 8 is one of the many video game series currently getting a film or TV adaptation, and ahead of its international cinematic debut in April, the team has released a new trailer for the subway-bound horror flick.</p>
<p>If it wasn't already on your radar, The Exit 8 became quite a cult hit on its initial release back in 2023. It's a walking simulator inspired by Japanese underground passageways, and while I admit that doesn't sound great at first, here's the thing: you are trapped in this seemingly endless passageway, and have to pay careful attention to your surroundings in order to find your way out. And, things get weird.</p>

<p>This is the exact premise Exit 8's film adaptation will also lean on. "A man trapped in an endless sterile subway passageway sets out to find Exit 8. The rules of his quest are simple: do not overlook anything out of the ordinary. If you discover an anomaly, turn back immediately. If you don't, carry on. Then leave from Exit 8. But even a single oversight will send him back to the beginning. Will he ever reach his goal and escape this infinite corridor?" reads the film's official blurb.</p>
<p>We had a little look at what this film would be like last year, but now we have a new extended trailer, showing just how claustrophobic and nightmarish this looping plight will be for the poor chap - played by singer and actor Kazunari Ninomiya - who is doomed to wander the subway alone (well, kind of alone, if you catch my drift...).</p>
<p>You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

            <p>MachineGames' most recent release may be the brilliant Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but the studio is of course also known for its Wolfenstein games. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-doesnt-sound-like-weve-heard-the-last-from-machinegames-wolfenstein-series">following an earlier hint that the studio wasn't finished with its nazi-busting series</a>, we now have more concrete word on the fate of MachineGames' Wolfenstein trilogy.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>This word comes from studio director Jerk Gustafsson, who was chatting with Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry</a> about MachineGames' 15 year legacy. During this conversation, Gustafsson admitted that because of the time it takes to make a video game in this day and age, he may only have a few more projects left in him before the end of his career.</p>
<p>"There's so many things that I would like to do, but I'm also getting a bit older, so I don't have that many games left in me," he said. "It takes a long time to make a game now, and let's say that we release one every four years, then maybe two more, maybe three if I'm lucky."</p>
<p>So, could one of these hypothetical projects be Wolfenstein 3? While Gustafsson was careful with his answer, he did say this:</p>
<p>"Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein. We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say."</p>

<p>As for the more immediate future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">MachineGames is set to release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2 later this year</a>. Like I have said, this game is brilliant, and I loved being able to whip crack my way across the globe with Indy.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review from 2024</a>.</p>

            <p>A new report has claimed that Gears of War E-Day is eyeing a release window in the second half of 2026, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> tentatively targeting a launch some time this Summer.</p>
<p>This report, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad">written by The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, claims that Microsoft wants both Gears of War E-Day and Fable to dodge the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, with Tom Warren writing: "I understand Microsoft has a good idea of when both should launch, but it's also keen to avoid being too close to Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19th date."</p>
<p>The report also touches on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> Remake, which The Verge reports is in "active development". The article also states that Bethesda wants the game to reach a similar bar of quality as the Oblivion Remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-in-the-shadow-of-skyrims-mountains-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-still-matters">which was well-received in part due to its faithfulness and level of polish</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, The Verge reports that Double Fine's The Kiln is aiming for an April release, and new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> content is due for a reveal soon. All of this comes with a caveat, with Warren sensibly writing: "Don't be surprised if any of these game dates slip or change -- such is the reality of video game development."</p><p>If these release windows are accurate, which they may very well be (The Verge has a solid track record with this stuff), then Microsoft certainly has a packed 2026. Fable, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">which we already know is due to launch some time this Autumn</a>, recently got a dedicated showcase in an Xbox Developer Direct. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, set in Japan and landing on the 19th May.</p>
<p>If these dates and release windows are accurate, what do you reckon of Xbox line-up this year? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <p>
Craig Mazin, showrunner on HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-wins-series-another-emmy">award-winning The Last of Us adaptation</a>, has confirmed he's giving <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> the TV treatment next, with the new show set to continue the story of the acclaimed fantasy RPG - although developer Larian seemingly won't be directly involved.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/baldurs-gate-hbo-craig-mazin-1236654094/">Variety</a>, HBO is developing the Baldur's Gate 3 TV adaptation, hot of the success of its live-action The Last of Us series, with Mazin serving as both as showrunner and executive producer on the new project.
</p>
<p>
In a statement accompanying the news, Mazin claimed he'd put "nearly 1000 hours" into the video game version of Baldur's Gate 3. "It is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created," he said. "I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can't wait to help bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can."
</p>
<p>
Francesca Orsi, HBO's executive vice president and head of drama, added that Mazin's "deep and long-standing passion for the source material paired with his remarkable talent for building immersive worlds filled with rich, compelling characters promises groundbreaking results."
</p>
<p>
After news of the adaptation broken, The Games Awards' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2019563522339082576?s=20">took to social media</a>, claiming Larian had told him directly the studio - which officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">wrapped up work</a> on Baldur's Gate 3 last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">moving away from D&amp;D</a> - has "no involvement in the series." Larian boss Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061?s=20">later confirmed</a> no Larian writers were consulting on the adaptation 'to his knowledge', but did note Mazin had reached out "to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope."
</p><p>
"We worked incredibly hard on making Baldur's Gate 3 worthy of its legacy," Vincke wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143?s=20">separate social media post</a>. "Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they'll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion."
</p>
<p>
"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventure," he continued. "There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts."
</p>
<p>
Larian director of publishing Michael Douse also <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680?s=20">shared his feelings</a> on the news, writing, "I've spent the last eight to 10 years of my life with the writers and creators of Baldur's Gate 3 and they're the most incredible storytellers and creators in the space. Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved and the characters are represented at the same level as the game.
</p>
<p>
"Our stories are built by fierce comeraderie and resolve," Douse added. "I have watched them write and write and write and through respect for audience and material come up with some of the finest shit I have ever played. I hope TV allows for the same thoroughness."
</p><p>
There's no word on when HBO might be looking to bring its Baldur's Gate 3 adaptation to air, but Mazin will be tied up with his The Last of Us show for a little while longer at least. While Mazin had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">previously confirmed a four-season plan</a> for his post-apocalyptic series, insisting there was "no way" its story could be wrapped up sooner, HBO boss Casey Bloys <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">recently indicated season three will be its last</a>. "It certainly seems that way," he told Deadline, "but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners."

            <p>Guerrilla and PlayStation have lifted the lid on Horizon Hunters Gathering, a new co-op game set for PC and PS5.</p>
<p>Introducing the studio's next game, Guerrilla lead Jan-Bart van Beek said while the team will still keep making single player games ("they are a huge part of who we are as a studio," van Beek said), it was time to try something new. And this is where Horizon Hunters Gathering comes in.</p>

<p>Horizon Hunters Gathering is described as a tactical co-op action game, which allows up to three players to join up as "heroic Hunters" to protect the world. But, not just any world, though. This one - as you would expect from the Horizon series - is "under threat from deadly machines".</p>
<p>Guerilla stated in a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/">PlayStation blog post</a> that the upcoming game will include combat that is "tactical, reactive and deeply skill-based" (which, to be honest, means I probably won't be very good at it, as I am more of a 'spray and pray' kinda gal). All of this will take place in replayable hunts, the developer explained, before going into more detail about two game modes.</p><p>The first of these is Machine Incursion, which is "a high-intensity mission where waves of machines pour out from underground gateways, led by a formidable boss". Then there is Cauldron Descent, which is a "longer, multi-stage trial in which ever-changing rooms push Hunters to their limits, from brutal machine encounters to hidden doors that promise power and reward for teams prepared to open them".</p>

<p>Before setting out on these hunts, players will be able to choose from a roster of hunters with varying skills, motivations and "personal struggles". This is all part of the new stories Guerrilla wants to tell within its Horizon world.</p>
<p>"The game has a narrative campaign which will introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats, but we're keeping it under wraps for now," the developer teased. "What we can say is that Hunters Gathering is fully canon and its story doesn't stop at launch!"</p><p>If this sounds like your thing, Guerrill has announced a first, small-scale closed playtest for the end of the month; <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/?hr=true&amp;betaId=DEA61B71-0498-4EEB-9EAF-53C71761F968">you can sign up via the PlayStation Beta Program and mark your interest in any future Horizon Hunters Gathering playtest on PC or PS5</a>.</p>
<p>"This is both an exciting and daunting step for us," Horizon Hunters Gathering game director Arjan Bak said. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-horizon-series-was-always-thought-about-as-a-multiplayer-game-says-studio-head-following-mmo-announcement">Multiplayer games have always been part of our studio’s DNA</a>, and it's where I began my own career. Bringing a co-op hunting experience into the Horizon universe is something we’ve envisioned for a long time, and we’re approaching it with care, ambition, and passion.</p>
<p>"On behalf of everyone at Guerrilla, thank you to our Horizon fans and creators who support and believe in us. And welcome to all new Hunters excited to join us on this adventure. Horizon Hunters Gathering is about taking on challenges together – and we’re just getting started."</p>

<p>Last year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-horizon-series-reportedly-surpasses-40m-sales-further-cementing-its-position-as-one-of-sonys-best-selling-franchises">PlayStation and Guerrilla's Horizon franchise had surpassed 40m copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to Horizon Hunters Gathering, there is also a Horizon MMO from NCSoft on the cards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Horizon Steel Frontiers, as it is known, is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system" on the game's eventual release.</p>

            <p>Right, any game that looks like you let the artisans from Studio Ghibli or Cowboy Bebop makers Sunrise make a Daft Punk video is immediately going to pique my curiosity. Layer on some puzzle-heavy, playful-looking co-op gameplay, and you've got my attention. Tell me I can play it with my partner, across two Switches, for the entry price of just the one game, and I'm sold. Day one with bells on.</p>
<p>I was already interested in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/orbitals">Orbitals</a> after its impressive showing at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards</a> back in December 2025. There, we get the meat of the game: it's from Kepler Interactive and Japanese indie dev Shapefarm, it's an intergalactic puzzle adventure game, and it is coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> sometime in 2026 (as of today, we know it's 'summer').</p>
<p>You play as Maki and Omura, a pair of friends that are trying to save their space station home from cosmic storms that have decimated their habitat once before. You can each use tools to affect the environment and solve puzzles, and in a pretty cool gimmick, it seems that individual players using tools alongside their co-op partner will be able to create new and unexpected effects.</p>
<p>The gameplay and art style are enough of a selling point, to be honest (it looks like something between Astro Boy and Evangelion, somehow) but then you add in the work from Studio Massket - an animation studio that's worked on bits of Edgerunners, One Piece, and more - you've got a recipe for something really special. Studio Massket has done all the anime cutscenes that serve as connective tissue for the game, rounding out the world and giving it this very analogue, very lived-in feel that so much 80s and 90s anime had (here's looking at you again, Cowboy Bebop).</p>

<p>So, the game itself looks great. Just take a look at the trailer if you need more convincing: it seems to be shooting for the same space Josef Fares and Hazelight have been playing around in over the past few generations: one where games are built explicitly "from the ground up"for co-op, telling stories that only work when multiple people are playing them together, bridging mental gaps to help players solve puzzles as one.</p><p>Fares and his team have already proved that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-players-on-switch-2-can-invite-original-switch-owners-to-join-the-fun">the 'Friend's Pass' mechanic</a> is integral to the success of this co-op new-wave. "I felt that if you are playing together on a couch, you shouldn’t pay extra if you're playing online with someone," <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would?utm_source=post-email-title">he told The Games Business earlier this year</a>. "That didn't make sense. So, we came up with the Friends Pass, and that in itself became good for business. It started from a creative decision and then became a business thing."</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction sold 2m copies in one week</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">broke three Guinness World Records within days of its launch</a>.  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> has sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marital-platformer-it-takes-two-sales-pass-20m">way over 20m copies</a>, at this point. Trusting people to play games like this with a friend (and knowing there's enough appeal for that to work) rather than forcing them to buy two copies if they want to play on two machines? It's a refreshing bit of consumer-friendly decision-making, in an industry that is otherwise feeling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">increasingly hostile</a> to the average player.</p>
<p>So, back to Orbitals. I plan to play this game with one of my partners, wedged together on the sofa, me on my Switch 2 and them on their Switch Lite. Knowing that I can simply buy the game and invite them to play with me from a few meters away endears me to this game <em>so much</em>, and it's not even out yet. Better yet, I travel with work a fair amount, and so knowing we can pick up where we left off with online play and <em>still </em>without having to shell out for a second copy is another big tick (as is the ability to just play it together on the big screen in a pinch).</p>
<p>I know GameShare is not a new feature - on the Switch 2 alone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, 51 Worldwide Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> and more make use of the gimmick - but it's a good one. One that should be shouted about more, and one that feels like it exists at the core of Nintendo's 'family friendly' focus. And good on Orbitals, for being a beacon of this sort of consumer-forward, co-op-first way of thinking - at least from how it looks here in theory. I can't wait to see how it all works in practice.</p>

            <p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase in February 2026 may not have brought insight into what first party games are arriving on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but it did give us a great look at what third party games are coming to the console in 2026. (Hopefully we'll get a look at the upcoming Nintendo titles for this year soon. The end of the tax year is approaching…)</p>
<p>Whether you missed the Nintendo Direct or simply want to revisit the announcements, you'll find all of the showcased games down below.</p>
<h3>Orbitals</h3>
<p>We started off this Nintendo Direct with... an anime? Well it's actually Orbitals - a co-op sci-fi adventure where you'll work with a friend using various tools, like the Liquid Launcher, to explore different areas. There's even cute little pets you can cuddle with during your adventures!</p>
<p>Orbitals will be released on Nintendo Switch 2 in Summer 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse</strong></p>
<p>Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse is the sequel to 2023's Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. If you're a horror fan and enjoy visual novels, then I highly recommend giving the original game a try. The ability to switch between the different storylines and character perspectives gives the game a unique feel, while some of the horror scenes can hit quite hard especially when you're unprepared for them.</p><p>In this sequel, you'll be venturing to a mysterious island to investigate the mermaid's curse and strange doublegangers. It really was meant to be an normal day pearl diving... As before there's a range of characters you can play as!</p>
<p>Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse will be released on Nintendo Switch on 19th February.</p>

<h3>Captain Tsubasa 2: World Fighters</h3>
<p>It's football time with Captain Tsubasa 2: World Fighters! I don't know much about football - seriously I've only watched one match with Wes and it was fine I guess. I probably would have paid more attention if it was like the football in this game trailer.</p>
<p>Captain Tsubasa 2: World Fighters will launch on Nintendo Switch in 2026.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Scramble</h3>
<p>A cavein has lead to an underground world being discovered beneath Tokyo. This isn't your fun, mysterious, underworld world though thanks to the Zinos, dinosaur like creatures who really want to eat you. Since you can't fight the Zinos, you'll have to use traps and your stealth skills to stay alive. Up to four players can play different aspects of Anne's adventure at the same time.</p>
<p>Tokyo Scramble will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on 11th February.</p>

<h3>Valheim</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/valheim">Valheim</a> is coming to Switch 2!

Just don't forget to protect yourself from the cold as you explore the wilderness. Up to 10 players will be able to play online together.</p>
<p>Valheim will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.</p>

<h3>Hollow Knight: Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</h3>
<p>Last year finally saw the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, so this year sees the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>.

<p>eFootball Kick-Off! will be released on Nintendo Switch 2 this Summer.</p>

We already knew - or at least strongly suspected, thanks to a couple of leaks - Bethesda would have a big presence during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-partner-direct-february-2026-live-report">Nintendo's latest Partner Direct showcase</a>, but it turns out the studio had a little more up its sleeve than just Fallout and Indiana Jones. It's now confirmed that last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is, of course, a spruced-up version of Bethesda's well-regarded 2006 open-world fantasy RPG - setting players loose in a much-beautified version of Cyrodiil, courtesy of Unreal Engine 5. Alongside an obvious visual upgrade - including new character models - it also features improved combat, a new levelling system, an updated UI, and more. Not that you'll likely notice any of this stuff if it's your first time with Oblivion.

<p>
"What a treat to go back to this one again," Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wrote of Oblivion Remastered when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">named it one of our top 50 game of 2025</a>. "Oblivion may have shed some of the complexity and outlandishness of Morrowind, but in doing so it also shed the intimidation factor. This is really the genesis of all modern - especially western - open world RPGs today, and frankly it's still a lesson in how that structure should be done."
</p><p>
As for the newly announced Switch 2 version, there's not a whole lot of specific information to report just yet, with Bethesda mostly whizzing through the basics during Oblivion Remastered's Nintendo Partner Direct debut. What we do know, though, is that it's heading to the platform sometime in "2026", joining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> and Indiana Jones: The Great Circle - both of which have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">also now been officially confirmed for Switch 2</a>.

            <p>Resident Evil: Requiem players on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be able to pick up brand-new amiibos of both Grace and Leon this Summer.
</p>
<p>The Amiibos, revealed during today's Nintendo Partner Direct, will be available to purchase seperately from the game later this year. One features Grace donning a black backpack and slick brown jacket, while the other has Leon with his handy hatchet. </p>
<p>As for what they actually do, aside from sit on your desk as a cool collectable, players who place them on their Switch 2 controllers will be able to unlock special in-game weapon skins for Resident Evil: Requiem. So it you fancy getting a bit stylish in 2026's biggest horror release, that's how you go about it.

<p>Resident Evil: Requiem, set to release on the 27th February, is looking to be a nice blend of first-person and classic third-person Resident Evil. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">You can read Eurogamer's final preview on the game ahead of its release later this month for a more in-depth look at the game</a>. 
</p><p>In it, Alex Donaldson wrote: "All told, this final hands-on can consider mission accomplished: I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in. I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."

            <p>
It's a good day for those those interests lie at the intersection of 'spooky' and 'deduction' - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s acclaimed visual novel Paranormasight is officially getting a sequel and it's coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> later this month, on 19th February.
</p>
<p>
The original Paranormasight, subtitled The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, launched back in 2023, offering an engaging, intriguing blend of spooks and investigatory adventure, all tied to a story of dark rituals and murder in Tokyo, Japan. "Paranormasight is a delight," reckoned Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-review-spooky-goings-on-in-tokyo">review</a>. "A mystery, a puzzle, and a ghost story that's genuinely haunted by the player on the other side of the screen."

<p>
So news of a sequel is exciting indeed, and Square Enix has now shared early details as part of Nintendo's latest Partner Direct. Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse, as it's known, whisks players to coastal Japan, introducing them to a young pearl diver called Yuza Minakuchi who, while diving one day, encounters another version of himself at the bottom of the ocean.
</p>
<p>But soon, other mysteries begin to plague the island's inhabitants, and - as the adventure unfolds - you'll talk to them, and explore the bay's depths, to uncover the truth of the Mermaid's Curse.
</p>
<p>
So there you go. That's Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse, coming to Switch 2 on 19th February.

<p>We previously suspected the entire Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy would make its way onto Nintendo's console. Back in May of last year, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi discussed the Switch 2 technical specs, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">kept making references to the Final Fantasy 7 remake series</a>. That has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-za/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html">all since been confirmed</a>.</p>
<p>"After escaping the dystopian city of Midgar, join Cloud and his friends on an epic journey across the planet in pursuit of Sephiroth. Ride chocobos, sprint across sweeping plains, and explore a vibrant, expansive world," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>You can check out the Switch 2 trailer for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth below.

<p>As for how we enjoyed Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on its initial PS5 release, well here is what Ed Nightingale had to say about it all: "Rebirth is a playful take on an emo classic that's bloated but full of character in a bid to justify its own existence."</p>
<p>Ed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">awarded Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth four out of five stars</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, I know it has a terrible name, but The Adventures of Elliot does look rather lovely. It mixes the visuals of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> with the gameplay of classic Zelda - Hey, listen, the main character even has a fairy companion (see what I did there).</p>
<p>The Adventures of Elliot will arrive on Switch 2 on 18th June. There is a demo you can try out today. </p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for The Adventures of Elliot below. Will you be playing?</p>

<p>I have been hands-on with Planet of Lana 2 already, and I was charmed by Wishfully's upcoming sequel. It has taken everything that I loved from the original, and levelled it up, to create a deeper narrative and more expressive world. That includes underwater sections, and a much more agile Lana.</p><p>As for the original, here is what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-of-lana-review-pace-poise-and-something-more">Christian Donlan had to say about Planet of Lana on its release in 2023</a>: "It's a game that disappears in pleasant little sips... Nothing is introduced that is not easy to understand, so that you can get to the fun of puzzling how to use it quickly. Nothing is arduous to use - your AI companion is both beautifully behaved and responds to very clear controls, as does all the machinery you get to interact with in the later acts. There are brainteasers here, but no frustrations."</p>

            <p>The original Planet of Lana is a game that has stayed with me since its release back in 2023. Its Ghibli-inspired 2D art direction, its story told in a made-up language, its swelling and emotive music - all of these areas are still, to me, some of the most beautiful in games today. However, I've always felt that developer Wishfully was just scratching the surface with Planet of Lana, and could push to do <em>more</em> with the land of Novo and its intricacies.</p>

<p>Well, a few years later, that's exactly what Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf hopes to do, with the upcoming sequel expanding not just the original's story, but its mechanics and world as well. Wishfully has today announced a release date of 5th March, with a demo also coming to Steam, Xbox and Playstation from 11th February, and to coincide with that announcement I spoke to Wishfully's creative director and co-studio head Adam Stjärnljus.</p>
<p>"During [the original] Planet of Lana, we first aimed to only create one stand-alone game," Stjärnljus tells me during a visit to the studio last month, but he says the team never really wanted to stop there. "There was just so much to tell about Lana and Mui's story, as well as the history of the people and the planet of Novo. So it became very natural as we needed to satisfy our own curiosity."</p>

<p>This curiosity soon saw the studio begin work on Children of the Leaf, which is set to release later this year. Lana is now of course older than she was in the first game, and is much more agile and quick. Meanwhile her adorable sidekick Mui - who Stjärnljus describes as a monkey/cat/dog-like companion - now has some upgraded powers, which sees him able to override machines, as well as hypnotise and control certain creatures throughout the world.</p><p>"We've focused on improving all different parts of the game; Lana has a more fluid and responsive movement. The collaboration between Lana and Mui is much more expanded, enabling more intense stealth scenes and bigger puzzles," Stjärnljus elaborates. "We've also focused on adding more weird creatures that you now have full control over," the goal again being to expand the ways in which you can explore. Stjärnljus adds it "both made sense for Mui to have upgraded powers and it filled a need to improve the collaboration with Lana".</p>
<p>Indeed, Mui's powers combined with Lana's improved athletic prowess are key for Planet of Lana 2's considerably more complex puzzles and stealth sections, as I discovered during a hands-on preview where I was able to play the first four hours. There was more than one occasion where I was left scratching my head as I pondered how to bypass a robotic sentry at the top of a frigid mountain fortress, or navigate an underwater labyrinth.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wishfully</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let's start with those underwater sections, an all-new depth (sorry) for Planet of Lana 2. Early on, I needed to find healing seaweed to make some medicine for a sick girl. However, this seaweed was not only submerged in the waters surrounding Lana's village of Tailo, but also guarded by a hostile, inky-black sea beast, crackling with electricity (isn't that always the way). Thankfully, I could use Mui's powers to take control of and pilot some small fish through various underwater passages, and - once Lana had cleared the rocks blocking the way - lure this larger aquatic predator away from the plant.</p><p>Then, controlling Lana once again, I was able to trap the beast by closing an underwater gate which was activated from above. This took a decent amount of timing and skill to get just right, because the sea beast would soon return to its original place guarding the seaweed if I didn't act quickly enough, and was a good example of that expanded collaboration Stjärnljus was talking about earlier.</p>
<p>"A platformer is limited in exploration by definition," he says. "You can go left, right, up or down. That’s it. So, it felt like a very natural step to go down, and for the down to be filled with water that we could populate with a bunch of new creatures, mechanics and secrets.</p>
<p>"Also," he adds, "because Mui is famously incompatible with water, we got really excited about working with that restriction both through gameplay mechanics and narrative."</p>
<p>Ah yes, Mui not liking water! I had forgotten about that, but was soon reminded when I had to get Lana's companion from one end of a watery expanse to another. At first I tried Lana's whistle to call him over, but he did not come. I then tried to direct Mui (just like in the original game, you can instruct Mui to stay put, scout on ahead or interact with items like switches in the sequel), but again he did not comply.</p><p>Then I remembered Mui's aversion to water, so I turned my attention back to Lana and dived under to find something I could use to transport my sidekick across to the other side. It was here I discovered Lana could run out of breath and drown - sorry about that, Lana. On the plus side, for larger areas of underwater exploration there will be pockets of air for Lana (and me) to catch a breath.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wishfully</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Soon after these azure waters, Lana and Mui found themselves in another new environment, this time up against the harsh winds and bitter cold of a snowy mountainside. Platforming came into play much more during this section, as Lana and Mui made their way up rocky ledges, occasionally ensuring they were both ducked behind boulders and such to protect themselves from sporadic bursts of wind that could blow them off the edge.</p>
<p>Once safe from the storm and tucked inside a cavern, I then discovered another new creature Mui could pilot: a white pom-pom of a being, which could stick to surfaces and leave a trail of flammable ash (at least, that is what I am going to assume it is) behind it. This creature could then roll into a flame to ignite the ash left in its wake, and burn through large webs blocking Lana and Mui's path, or cause pillars to retract into the wall to clear a safe passage.</p><p>Again though, timing was key, because these pillars would soon reemerge from the walls. Sometimes there was more than one pillar to circumnavigate, which meant being canny with how I laid the ash trail. Ignite one too soon or too late, and I wouldn't have time to reach the upper ledge before another pillar blocked Lana and Mui's path ahead.</p>
<p>It may sound simple enough reading about it all here, but in practice, it was decidedly tricksy to coordinate… and I relished that challenge. When I ultimately puzzled my way out of the cavernous area, I was left with a sense of accomplishment I do not remember feeling in the original. Like I said, I did enjoy the first Planet of Lana, but I never really felt like my little grey cells (to borrow from Poirot) were getting enough exercise. Here, though, I felt like they had stretched, gone for a little jog, and then come home for a reviving yoga session.</p>

<p>Another area I explored during the preview was around a large, mechanically-themed facility and down into a mine. To add an extra layer of tension, this area also included patrolling machines, guards and security cameras. Again, Mui was an essential sidekick, and was able to temporarily disrupt cameras to allow Lana to pass safely. Sometimes there was more than one camera, and Lana would need to crouch inside drifts of snow to avoid detection, timing her runs between defensive sweeps of the vicinity.</p><p>Then we had those patrolling machines I mentioned. There were times when Lana and Mui had to work together to manipulate and position beams of light, which these machines had an aversion to. This essentially trapped the machines in a corner, allowing Lana and Mui to clear a safe passage forward. Other times it would again be a case of timing, so getting ready to sprint away from a scout machine and then sliding out of reach before getting struck. Again, this sounds deceptively simple, but my heart still raced each time Lana narrowly missed being caught.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I came away from my time with Planet of Lana 2 impressed. It is the kind of game I can imagine curling up with at the end of a busy day, and sinking an hour or so into each evening to unwind. The world of Novo remains as beautiful as ever with Lana's bucolic fishing community a bright contrast to the cold and harsh industrial areas' black and grey. Meanwhile, the music is as evocative as you would expect from composer Takeshi Furukawa. When the orchestra picks up during a mountainside climb, you can't help but feel your soul swell, and the score feels as much a character in Planet of Lana 2 as Novo does.</p>
<p>Essentially, everything in Planet of Lana 2 has improved. And yes, it could be challenging, but it is also full of heart and emotion, with family, friendship and that sense of connection to others a key part of the experience. An achievement, given Planet of Lana 2's scant dialogue and made-up language.</p><p>"We just love working with limitations! It really forces us to boil everything down to the essentials," Stjärnljus says when I ask about players still feeling a connection to Lana and Mui, despite not actually being able to understand them. "In both Planet of Lana 1 and 2 we use every tool at our disposal to convey emotion as simply as possible to ensure nothing is lost in translation."</p>
<p>Stjärnljus describes "Music, animation, voice acting and body language" as tools used by the studio to "fill the gaps" left by ostensibly simple character models with unintelligible language. You could argue that applies to most games, but there are good examples of it here, even right at the very start of Planet of Lana 2, when Lana and her niece meet and playfully roll down on the grass, the little girl clapping her hands together in delight. It's the kind of warmth you feel throughout, from silly games in an old shipwreck, to the ache Lana feels when her young niece becomes ill. Oh, and before I forget, of course Lana can pet Mui.</p>
<p>"One of our favourite things to observe is when new players get past the point of just focusing on getting Lana where she needs to go, and start worrying if Mui is following along. Before long, most of them even start to feel guilty if they forget about her," Stjärnljus says.</p>
<p>I can confirm that, yes, I did feel guilty on the odd occasion I forgot about Mui. One time he got struck by a machine after I (as Lana) had managed to evade it, and therefore assumed we were all in the clear. Well, it turned out we were not, and the game let me know by taking me back to my last checkpoint to try again, this time with Mui in tow. I also accidentally electrocuted Mui once, but the less said about that the better…</p>

<p>Planet of Lana 2 is obviously a more ambitious and far chunkier game than its rather snappy five-hour-long predecessor, thanks to all of its new puzzle mechanics and controllable creatures. In fact according to Stjärnljus, Planet of Lana 2 will be roughly double the length of the first game, so we are looking at around 8-10 hours overall. He assures me though that even though the two games are linked, you won't need to have played Planet of Lana to still appreciate the upcoming sequel. But, if you did enjoy the first Planet of Lana, then I have no doubt that its sequel will be right up your alley.</p><p>Wishfully set out to improve and build on its original ideas from Planet of Lana, and from what I have seen so far, it is fair to say the studio has done just that. The world is bigger, the enemies are smarter and the puzzles are harder. As I had hoped it would, the developer has scratched further down beyond Planet of Lana's surface, and unearthed something potentially deeper and richer.</p>

<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 1.43pm:</strong> The Switch 2 release dates for both Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Fallout 4 have leaked.</p>
<p>We are less than an hour away from Nintendo's upcoming Partner Direct, and it seems two of the planned announcements have broken free ahead of schedule. As shared by the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/nintendo-direct-on-vous-devoile-les-dates-de-sortie-des-titres-xbox-a-paraitre-sur-switch-2-61002">billbil-kun</a> of Dealabs, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition will launch its physical edition with a digital download code on 28th April. This chap will retail for $59.99/€59.99, billbil-kun said, though they did not offer UK pricing.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Meanwhile, the insider added Fallout 4 could arrive digitally via the Nintendo eShop, before then, with billbil-kun suggesting later today isn't out of the question. If this does prove accurate, it wouldn't be too surprising - after all, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">acclaimed Fallout adaptation on Amazon has just wrapped its second season</a>, so Bethesda and co would likely want to capitalise on the interest around the franchise as a whole.</p>
<p>As for Indy, well apparently The Great Circle will arrive on Switch 2 on 12th May, retailing for €69.99 / $69.99. I would absolutely recommend giving this game a shot, if you haven't already done so.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>To top it all off, a physical Switch 2 version of Skyrim Anniversary Edition is also said to be coming. According to billbil-kun, this will be released on 28th April. I will update this story once the Direct is live, and we get confirmation.</p>

What else do you hope to see coming to Switch 2 this afternoon? I am rooting for an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> release date, and more from The Duskbloods.

            <p>For decades now, the adage has been to add a little damning-with-faint-praise caveat to a complement about good-looking games, especially third party ones, on Nintendo platforms. It looks great, we might muse… '<em>for a Nintendo platform'</em>.</p>
<p>In this context, one can see why Nintendo would want to make Capcom's upcoming releases of Resident Evil 9 and Pragmata such tentpoles. That backhanded complement still lingers, but when you look at and play these games on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, they no longer feel like heavily compromised versions. Compromises <em>are</em> present, naturally, but in this presentation they feel more reasonable, and ultimately these games feel right at home on Nintendo's newest platform. I look back to the days of properly hobbled, materially different versions of multiplatform games on Nintendo platforms and think: Those days may finally be over.</p>
<p>I've played a fair amount of Resident Evil: Requiem pre-release demos, and so I sit in a pretty good position to compare and contrast. I was one of the first people to play it in June (PS5), and then did so again in August (PS again) and September (Switch 2, handheld), and then last month I played three hours of a near-final version (PS5 again). A little over a week ago, I finally got to play the missing piece - not Xbox Series X, which will surely profile close enough to PS5, but the Switch 2 version docked, on a TV.</p>

<p>This is a crucial step - handheld, many Switch 2 games present better thanks to the relatively modest screen size going a long way to hide away some technical shortcomings. Case in point: I heartily recommend Switch 2's version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but only really if you plan to primarily play handheld. Docked, on a TV, there's really nowhere to hide.</p><p>This is a challenge for a game like Resident Evil in particular. I reckon horror is absolutely best experienced in a darkened room on a decently large display, ideally with a surround sound system so the gleefully cruel sound design can properly turn your stomach. Horror games can work on handheld - RE had a great turn on 3DS, for instance - but I do think it's an experience most at home in a more cinematic setting.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the upcoming Resident Evil 9 on Switch 2. Point is, I've run the gamut. The best thing I can tell you is this: I'd happily play this game entirely on Switch 2, if the circumstances suited. Docked <em>or</em> handheld.</p>
<p>This is a shift for me. I'm a bit of a snob; I've got a ludicrously powerful PC, so that's my primary port of call. A Switch version of any high-fidelity game was always either a novelty or an 'if I have to' thing. But as I sat there experiencing a solid-looking version of RE9 at a frame rate that is comfortably shooting for 60, I simply thought: I'd happily play this as my main version of the game.</p>

<div>



<p>Crucially, Resident Evil 9 on Switch 2 looks good on the handheld and on a TV (docked mode).</p>

</div>

<p>It has of course been nipped and tucked and graphically tweaked to make everything work on this platform. So this doesn't look as good as the PS5 version that I played by quite some way. But it also speaks to the overall trend of diminishing returns on ever bigger and better game graphics that the difference is now no longer fundamental. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say that the Switch 2 version of Resident Evil 9 is probably a little stronger than what a PS4 version of the game would look like - and I don't actually think this franchise (or gaming in general) has visually moved on that far from how the PS4-era Resi games looked. Things look better, but each graphical upgrade is more granular than the last - and it's clear here that the Switch 2 has more than enough oomph for these new RE Engine games to get by. At a time when huge budgets dictate games can reach the biggest audiences possible, these versions don't just feel appropriate - they feel a must.</p><p>In practice the slight cosmetic pull-backs means that a jump scare from a big nasty monster is perhaps slightly less visceral because the mix of blood and saliva that glistens on its teeth when the game pushes into an extreme close-up after the jump scare isn't quite so realistic - but the moment still works. Protagonist Grace's lavishly rendered hair looks a generation older here than it does on PlayStation - but that isn't really fundamental to the experience. Meanwhile, some new-gen features make it over - so ray tracing is in, even if it perhaps isn't in its full-blown form on Nintendo's platform.</p>
<p>Pragmata felt a touch less stable than Resident Evil, but that perhaps makes sense with it having action that can get more frantic with sci-fi particle effects firing off as you battle robots. It still felt fine, though - it felt at home on Switch 2, which just wasn't the case for older entries in franchises like this.</p>

<div>



<p>Pragmata has more effects going off during combat, which can hurt performance, but overall it still looks great on Switch 2.</p>

</div>

<p>There's a lot of work being done here by DLSS, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amidst-a-sea-of-genai-nvidias-dlss-45-update-means-gamers-are-at-least-getting-something-out-of-ces">aka Deep Learning Super Sampling</a> - an AI-powered technology that essentially renders games at a lower resolution initially to increase performance and allow for advanced features like ray tracing, but then upscales that initial image to the desired output resolution. There's trade-offs to this around input lag and visual artifacting, but I think the majority of users will struggle to see the difference.</p><p>DLSS is a cheat, but it's a cheat inherent to all gaming, pretty much. Everybody is at it; PlayStation's biggest exclusives are now often deploying their equivalent, PSSR, and even my PC's RTX 5090 is putting in DLSS duty. On the Switch 2 it's a vital tool to get games like RE9 and Pragmata over the line - but honestly, I'm not all that interested in debates about fake resolution or fake frames or whatever else. I'm interested in the result, not the journey. This result is pretty fantastic, all things considered.</p>
<p>As they have in many matters third party, Capcom does rather appear to be paving the way. Its in-house RE Engine is ready for the Switch 2 big-time. This isn't Diet RE9 or Pragmata Zero; it's the full-fat thing. It's a way of playing these games that I can recommend to anyone; it's no longer strictly circumstantial. And those trade-offs are now beginning to feel more like footnotes than glaring caveats marked with the boldest asterisks. If other third parties follow suit as strongly as Capcom, the Switch 2 is even more irresistible than I first thought.</p>

            <p>There's a Nintendo Direct broadcast happening today, focusing on non-Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> games, and we'll be covering everything divulged right here. You know the drill: watch along, chat along, possibly make a pithy remark. Or be refreshingly positive - it's up to you!</p>
<p>What we know: the Nintendo Partner Direct will begin at 2pm UK time and will be short and sweet with a running-time of 30 minutes. No need to stay up half the night for this one - mentioning no names, ahem, Sony.</p>
<p>What we don't know: what will be in the broadcast. There aren't any official sighters to go by, which means we have plenty to speculate about. Are we about to get a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring on Switch 2</a>, for example? And speaking of FromSoftware: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">what's going on with Switch 2-exclusive The Duskbloods</a>? You can't just dangle that in front of us one year and then not say anything about it, can you?</p>
<p>Beyond that, maybe we'll get a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-coming-to-switch-2-next-year">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2</a>, and potentially something about the second <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> game Rebirth coming to Switch 2 - there are rumours.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's theoretically a good moment for third-party games on Switch 2, while Nintendo's new console has comparable power, so let's see how the Switch 2 capitalises on it.</p>

Hello everybody! I do like these chattery moments. So, what are you hoping to see? Frankly, I'll take almost anything on Switch 2. I wonder if it's a pyschological thing most of the time but the concept of being able to take a game around with me, that was previously stuck in my TV, never gets old to me. Welcome to 10 years ago, Bertie.

<blockquote><cite>Rahmus says:</cite> <p>Dream announcements:</p>
<p>Sega show off their rebooted IP, such as Crazy Taxi and Jet Set Radio. Then they wow the world with a brand new Sega Rally. Fade to black...one more thing...RISTAR IS BACK</p>
<p>Oh and then Capcom show off a native Resident Evil 2 Remake port so I can buy it for the third time. But this one's different - it has Amiibo support!</p></blockquote>
<p>A new Sega Rally! I'd eat that up. Digitally of course.</p>
<blockquote><cite>Ninginja says:</cite> Here's some insight for you: Caves of Qud is releasing 16th February</blockquote>
<p>Insight accepted. Thank you.</p>

<p>I can't quite make out what you're getting at here. Is there a particular game you're hoping for?</p>

      <p>Switch 2 co-op exclusive Orbitals launches this summer</p>
    <p>
Here we go.
</p>
<p>
What is Direct opener I wonder? 
</p>
<p>
We're straight into a game. An anime-looking game. "Deep in space a research station was suddenly struck by a cosmic storm..." This looks like a Japanese cartoon. Orbitals, it's called. I can't see any semblance of gameplay yet.
</p>
<p>
Now I can! It's the two-player co-op adventure we've heard about before, a bit like Hazelight's games - It Takes Two, Split Fiction. In other words, you need to work together. You have different guns to do different things. It looks very Hazelight, with a different visual finish.
</p>
<p>
Gameshare is supported so you only need one copy of the game. Good. 
</p>
<p>
Orbitals is a Switch 2-exclusive and launches this summer.

      <p>Paranormasight tells a mermaid mystery on 19th February</p>
    <p>
Paranormasight now. A mystery adventure. This one's about mermaids and pearl divers - a classic combination if ever I've seen one. A pearl diver finds a copy of himself under the water. Looks a bit dark.
</p>
<p>
You need to investigate by talking to people, and by taking a dip in the water. There seems to be a nice variation of gameplay types here.
</p>
<p>
Paranormasight The Mermaid's Curse launches 19th February.

Glossed over an anime football game there, apologies.
</p>
<p>
A dinosaur-related, subterranean Tokyo third-person stealth game now. Well, they're not just dinosaurs but strange underground creatures. If you're found in this game, you're dead. 
</p>
<p>
It's got Gameshare so you and your friends can share controls, which sounds strange.
</p>

Tokyo Scramble, it's called. It's coming next week - February 11th.

    <p>
Capcom's Pragmata now, which is about a man and his android-girl-partner's journey. A company sends bots against them and Dianna, the android, needs to hack the enemies to soften them up for you to shoot.
</p>
<p>
Looks like a twiddly thing to control, hacking and shooting at once. Interesting idea though.
</p>
<p>
Pragmata is coming 24th April to Switch 2. And there's a demo going live today.

It's a mix of 2D platforming and 3D boss battling, and then there's a card-based upgrading cycle inbetween. A mix of game-types, in other words. 
</p>
<p>
That's due this summer on Switch and Switch 2.

Lots of games are flitting by now that are coming to Switch 2, or getting Switch 2 versions. I don't think there's been anything particularly interesting, but it's nice variety all the same.

"Tales of Arise" seems like a dangerous thing to call your name, especially if your keyboard has a dodgy "i" key.

This isn't an RE4 remake, Capcom.

But look how chiselled the new Leon Kennedy is. Requiem will have dual-protagonists, in case you don't know. And guess what? Leon can fire guns and chainsaw people. He's a brute. Grace is much more refined.

            <p><strong>Update</strong> (2:10PM): An upgraded port of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> has been revealed at the Nintendo Partner Direct. It's coming out later today, and owners of the original Nintendo Switch version of the game can get a free upgrade on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Original article (11:40AM)</strong>: Hollow Knight has received a PEGI rating for the Switch 2, hinting towards a port to the latest Nintendo console.</p>
<p>As can be seen<a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight"> on the PEGI website</a>, the beloved metroidvania can be seen rated across all its console versions. However, if you peer down at the base version of Hollow Knight (not the Voidheart Edition) you can see a Switch 2 version rated today, the 5th February 2026.</p>
<p>This comes at a peculiar time, as we have a Nintendo Partner Direct to look forward to later today at 2PM GMT / 3PM CEST / 6AM PST / 9AM EST. Perhaps this is a early indicator of a reveal to come.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight hasn't become a household name without cause. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-so-special-about-the-original-hollow-knight-the-intoxicating-power-of-team-cherrys-invisible-insistent-guiding-hand">has an extremely compelling guiding hand</a> that urges players to explore a collection of endearing, often gorgeous, sometimes horrifying, locations that are both lovingly-crafted and packed with weaving narratives.</p><p>If you've not actually played the original Hollow Knight yet, perhaps you jumped first into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> or just haven't found the time, it's an absolute must-play. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-a-slick-stylish-and-super-tough-metroidvania">You can read Eurogamer's review of Hollow Knight here</a>, in which Vikki Blake describes the game as: "A stern yet scintillating 2D adventure that makes a point of not holding your hand."</p>

            <p>Original Mario voice actor Charles Martinet has shared more on how he came up with the voice for Nintendo's moustachioed plumber.</p>
<p>Back in 2023, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-charles-martinet-no-longer-video-game-voice-of-mario">no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo's most recognisable mascot</a>, after almost 30 years in the job. Starting with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/internet-briefly-thinks-its-identified-marios-new-voice-actor-until-he-says-no">the role was instead taken on by Kevin Afghani</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-explains-what-charles-martinets-mario-ambassador-job-actually-entails">Martinet became a Mario Ambassador</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But, how did Martinet actually come up with the 'whoops' and 'wahoooooos' of Mario? Well, first off, it turns out that Martinet actually crashed Nintendo's audition for Mario without knowing anything about the character. In fact, he didn't even know anything about Nintendo. But even so, he had "so much fun at the audition" many decades ago, and soon his iconic legacy began.</p>
<p>"I was simply told to start talking, and when you run out of things to say, that's your audition," Martinet told <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/mario-actor-interview-never-heard-nintendo-203132-20260203">GamingBible</a>. "I didn't want to do an Italian plumber sounding gruff, mean and nasty or scary to children, like a Mafia member. I didn't know whether the audience would have children in it, but I have a principle of comedy of always being kind. I thought to myself that I'll do something much more silly and fun. I didn't know anything about video games, so I just made things up about food and started talking."</p>
<p>Martinet added that "being able to bring that joy into children's and adults' lives" has been a "tremendous honour" for him.</p>
<p>"When they tell me stories of growing up with Mario, and playing the games with their parents, grandparents, and now their children, it gives me such a feeling of joy that cannot be described. I'm just grateful for those moments every day."</p>

<p>Since his turn as the voice of Mario in the games, Martinet did have a rather charming cameo in the Super Mario Bros. Movie. Here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-charles-martinet-voices-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">he voiced Mario and Luigi's father</a>. Mario and Luigi's father appears in multiple scenes during the film's opening section in Brooklyn, and again at the end, when Bowser's castle comes crashing back through to the "human" world.</p>
<p>At one point, we hear Mario and Luigi's father congratulating his sons by saying: "That's my boys!" Awww! I wonder if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-unveils-new-characters-that-do-not-disappoint">he will return for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, as well…?</p>

            <p>Have you heard the word '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-masocore-action-with-an-approachable-twist">masocore</a>' before? It's a portmanteau of 'masochist' and 'hardcore', and it's what Team Ninja used to describe the first few games in the Nioh franchise. In an interview <a href="https://www.fandom.com/articles/nioh-2">a long time ago</a>, Yosuke Hayashi (general producer at Team Ninja) told me that the team working on the Nioh games never really wanted to make them 'Soulslikes', and thought that 'masocore' suited the developer's vision slightly better.</p>
<p>"We weren't trying to make a game in this genre to begin with, but when we played the original Dark Souls, we were really inspired," Hayashi told me back in 2020. "Team Ninja is famous for difficult action games, but it wasn’t our primary intention to make a difficult game. It was more about detecting the tension of samurai games - and the genre that worked for that, for us, happened to be 'masocore'."</p>
<p>Now, on the eve of the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, I had the chance to chat to Masaki Fujita, game director of the third game in the hardcore action-RPG series. I was curious about the evolution of Team Ninja's experience in the genre, and if its approach to difficulty had changed at all when it came to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-review-4">Nioh</a>, especially after working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-4">a new Ninja Gaiden</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin-review-a-trashy-soulslike-that-packs-surprising-depth">Final Fantasy: Stranger of Paradise</a> in the interim.</p>

<p>For context, there is a long-running - and often quite exhausting - discourse around difficulty in action-RPGs. Should games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-review">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> have difficulty options? Would it make the titles more accessible for players? Would it compromise the feeling of achievement that even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> believes lies at the core of the experience? Would the entire genre be as beloved, as infamous, as popular, if it wasn't for its relationship with brutal difficulty?</p><p>"We've never considered adding difficulty settings to the Nioh series," Fujita tells me when I askew whether the challenge level in these games is non-negotiable for Team Ninja. "The value of clearing the game is something that is unifying, and since Nioh 3 has even more variations on strategies to clear the game compared to previous games in the series, our approach is not to change the difficulty setting when you can't clear it."</p>
<p>This is actually a sentiment echoed by 'father of the genre', Miyazaki. The Dark Souls boss is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tough-love-on-dark-souls-difficulty">on the record</a> as saying you don't need to be 'particularly skilled' to play Sark Souls games: you just need to know how to adapt, how to pick up a new spell, a different weapon, a new way of thinking, if bashing your Moonlight Greatsword against a boss over and over again isn't yielding any success for you.</p>



<p>The same is true in Nioh - and (after pumping 80 hours into it) especially Nioh 3: there are so many tools at your disposal now, with magic, ninjutsu, summons, Guardian Spirit skills and more being made more available and easier to use, that any roadblock you come up against can be chipped away at… if you know how to re-spec and re-evaluate. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">In my review</a>, I mentioned it's the easiest title in the series so far, and that's partly because of the '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> effect'; if something is proving too tough, you can simply wander out into the open field, check off more side missions, and come back later. The level scaling is pretty intense in Nioh 3, and you'll soon find even five or so levels can make an eye-watering difference.</p><p>"The enjoyment and sense of accomplishment of being able to figure out on your own how to overcome a situation is what we see as one of the best parts of this series," concludes Fujita. Personally, I think that feels more apparent in Nioh 3 than in any other game in the series, precisely because Team Ninja gives you so much freedom in choosing how to tackle the various gatekeepers and difficulty spikes. I think the formula is more potent here than in any other Team Ninja game, period. Nioh or not.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve time strikes again. Three months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">announcing a trio of new hardware products</a>, including the Steam Machine, Steam Frame and Steam Controller, Valve has published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">blog post detailing their delay</a>. The new hardware was meant to arrive in the first quarter of this year, but this has now been "revisited" to the first half of the year due to the "memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about". </p>
<p>The Steam Machine is likely the major catalyst behind the decision, as the sharp rise in RAM and storage prices could force a rethink for a living room box that was intended to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">bridge the gap between consoles and entry-level PCs</a>. With RAM and storage prices doubling, tripling or even quadrupling over the past three months, even the relatively modest base model with 16GB of DDR5 RAM and 512GB will now cost significantly more to produce. </p>
<p>For context, the cheapest 16GB DDR5 SODIMM kit has <a href="https://zdcs.link/98AyY1">more than doubled in price on Amazon UK</a>, from £67 on Valve's November announcement date to £148 today. A 512GB 2230 NVMe SSD of the type used by Valve in the Steam Machine has <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8YMG">also rocketed up in price</a>, from £54 to £88 in the same time period. If we look at 2TB drives, it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxg3D">a steeper climb</a>, from £129 to £244. </p>
<p>Valve isn't paying consumer prices from Amazon, of course, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">these price surges are a worldwide affair</a> that have affected nearly every part of the PC industry. The situation could even postpone the release of the next generation of games consoles. </p><p>While the Steam Machine is the most obviously affected, the Steam Frame VR headset is also a miniature Snapdragon-powered gaming PC, with its own 16GB of LPDDR5X memory and 256GB or 1TB of storage, and its pricing will therefore need to be reconsidered. Previously, Valve had indicated that it expected the Frame to undercut the Valve Index in price, which retails for £919. The Steam Controller is the only member of the trio relatively immune to the current climate, though its launch is necessarily tied to the other two products. </p>
<p>Valve's post states that it expected to be able to share pricing and availability data by now, so it will be interesting to see how long it will take the Washingtonian firm to release revised information. In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">the recent blog</a> to see a few more frequently-asked questions answered, on topics including RAM/storage upgradability, ongoing support for the Valve Index and expected Steam Machine performance figures, with more blogs to come over the coming weeks. </p>

            <p>You wouldn't know it to hear it, but decorated video game actor Jennifer Hale - famously the voice of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Commander Shepard - is the person providing the meows of new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> hero Jetpack Cat.</p>
<p>Blizzard confirmed this at its headquarters last week while detailing Jetpack Cat and the four other heroes coming to Overwatch (formerly known as "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>") next week. "The voice actor is Jennifer Hale," audio and technical director Scott Lawson told a group of press that I was in, "and she did an incredible job, and working with it was so much fun."</p>
<p>Note that Hale already voices another Overwatch hero, gunslinger Ashe, who was added to the game in November 2018.</p>
<p>Jetpack Cat has been a rumoured hero for Overwatch for a long time, and she finally arrives alongside four other new heroes on 10th February with the game-changing ability to tow other characters through the air. She can do this to both allies and enemies, though doing it to enemies requires using her Ultimate.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>I've played her; she's great fun. Very manoeuvrable, very fast, and with some useful healing abilities for supporting diving or flanking characters, not to mention the ability to pick up slower heroes from base or airlift Bastion in chaingunning form over groups of enemies. She also has lots of voice lines, although they're all variations of "meow", amusingly.</p><p>Jetpack Cat has been around as a concept nearly as long as Overwatch itself. "Jetpack Cat in particular, as a concept, is something the team has wanted to do since, man, we launched Overwatch 1," lead hero producer Kenny Hudson told me. "We've had early concept art for Jetpack Cat on the wall in our hallway for like eight years now." But the idea never got any further. "You'd walk by it like every day, like, 'Maybe we should...'," added associate game director Alec Dawson.</p>
<p>The reason why Blizzard can do Jetpack Cat now is because it's releasing so many new heroes at once - five on 10th February and a further five over the course of the year. "Going all out on making five Heroes at a time gave us some cover to explore new things, try new things," Hudson said. "When we said okay who are the five going to be...? It's funny because Jetpack Cat was always in the conversation from day one."</p>

<p>"It just felt like it's time for the cat," art director Dion Rogers said in a separate interview.</p>
<p>Jetpack Cat may seem silly but she's not the first animal character in the game. Winston, a gorilla, has been at the heart of Overwatch since it launched, and a hamster was added in the shape of Wrecking Ball in 2018. And, as Rogers told me, there are ideas for more.</p><p>"We actually have a random idea we joke about," Rogers said, "this character called the Oranga-tank. It's an orangutan that's a tank and he's a villain. Because most of our animal characters are good guys, we were like how do we make villain animals? And Oranga-tank is an idea that's been floating around for a while. I don't know if he'll show up in the game. It's a funny drawing; there's a bunch of funny drawings everywhere."</p>

It also announced it would be removing the tainted "2" from the game's name to make it, simply, "Overwatch" again. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-nearly-had-an-f-bomb-problem<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Bright-eyed and hopeful Blizzard shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> nearly had an f-bomb problem.</p>
<p>It relates to new hero Emre, who's Turkish, and to his Ultimate ability which, for a long time, was called "Seek and Destroy". It wasn't until Turkish actor Kerem Erdinc stepped into the booth to record Emre's lines that Blizzard was alerted to the mistake it nearly made.</p>
<p>"I got a story for you," Erdinc told me during a group interview at Blizzard last week. "I got to name Emre's Ultimate line, and the reason behind it is hilarious.</p>
<p>"Originally the line for Emre's Ultimate, where he jumps up in the air and does his thing, was 'Seek and Destroy'. But the word 'seek', if you translate it into Turkish - don't look that up - it is a very bad word. It is <em>the</em> bad word. The f-word - that's what it means. So I said, 'Guys, you might want to avoid that one.'</p><p>"I said how about 'Search and Destroy'? And Miranda [Moyer, lead narrative designer] said, 'Well that's what we're calling the comics, so that works.'" Erdinc added: "It would have been the butt of every Turkish player's jokes about Emre where he's just saying eff and destroy."</p>
<p>Emre is one of five new heroes coming to Overwatch on 10th February. He's the last of the characters seen on that old Overwatch group image from years ago, and when played, he feels a lot like Soldier 76 - a kind of run-and-gun first-person shooter hero. Emre can aim down sights - a first for Overwatch - and has bouncy grenades, a semi-automatic sidearm, and various movement and health regen boosts. His Ultimate makes him hover in the air, in a Tron-like AI form, and fire charged explosive blasts that explode upon impact.</p>



<p>Kerem Erdinc shared the story of the Ultimate line tweak by way of highlighting how Blizzard allows voice actors to inform the design of the characters they're playing. This is a game that tries to create characters from every region of the world, so having a Turkish actor make a Turkish character feel authentic is important to Blizzard.</p><p>"Our philosophy is always to lead on our actors a lot because, as a diverse game, we're looking for people from all walks of life to tell stories from all walks of life," Overwatch senior lead narrative designer Joshi Zhang said in the same interview. "And what makes that come to life is by leaning on real experiences from real people.</p>
<blockquote><em>"I didn't grow up seeing Turkish characters in anything" -Kerem Erdinc</em></blockquote>
<p>"As writers, we don't know what those experiences are. We target them, and when our actors are able to lock on to that, that's amazing, that's where the magic happens. But we need the actors and their incredible thinking in order to make that happen.</p>
<p>"It's always really important for us that the actors have a say in: what does this line mean to you? Because what it means to you will probably be a lot closer to whatever it means to someone like you, and someone like you might be seeing themselves in the game for the first time."</p><p>Erdinc said he's been an Overwatch fan since the game came out, and for him, the idea of a Turkish hero being added to the game - for Emre has been long-rumoured - was mouth watering. "I was wishing for this character, just as a fan, for eight years since it was covered in Overwatch Declassified," he said - "just obsessed with like 'oh a Turkish hero!'. It would be so cool.</p>
<p>"I didn't grow up seeing Turkish characters in anything," he added. "I can count how many are in video games on one hand, and the Overwatch team putting such care into introducing him, fully authentic, as a Turkish character with Turkish lines..." He paused here to say he'd thrown various jokes into the Turkish localisation "to make Turkish players smile". "That means everything to me," he said.</p>
<p>"But it also comes with a sense of responsibility that if I goof this up, then that would be horrible. It's hallowed ground for me and I take it very seriously."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Overwatch - the "2" has been dropped from the name - will welcome its first expansion-like release on 10th February</a>, which will bring new heroes but also a UI overhaul and a serious story-delivery rework and push. It also kicks off a year of various additions grouped under The Reign of Talon banner, during which five more heroes will be added to the game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">It's a big, exciting moment for Overwatch</a>.</p>

        <p>We're getting 10 new heroes, total, in 2026.</p>

    </div>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> will henceforth be known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, Blizzard has announced, as it outlines a major new plan that will revolve around free, annual, expansion-like releases for the game. The first of these - The Reign of Talon - arrives next week, on Tuesday, 10th February.</p>
<p>The undeniable headline feature is adding <em>five</em> new heroes at once, which is the largest new-hero-drop Overwatch has ever had - two more than Overwatch 2 launched with. Then, a further five heroes will be added throughout 2026, one in each Reign of Talon season (from season 2-6), taking the total new-hero count this year to 10. For Overwatch, that release-pace is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The new five new heroes are spread across all character roles. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domina, a tank who's a little like Zarya,</li>
<li>Emre, a damage dealer who's a lot like Soldier 76,</li>
<li>Mizuki, a support who has a magical healing hat he throws,</li>
<li>Anran, a damage dealer who sets people on fire and then literally fans the flames to deal damage to them, and</li>
<li>Jetpack Cat, a long-rumoured support who permanently flies and can tow team-mates and enemies through the air.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">I have played all of these heroes and shared my thoughts on them in a longer Overwatch revamp article</a>.</p>
<p>The switch to a yearly focus has had a major knock-on effect for story, allowing Blizzard to move from a smaller piecemeal storytelling formula to one shaped over the course of a year, affording a much more ambitious and dramatic scope. Six 'season' releases are planned for Reign of Talon, and the game's season-count will be reset to one (from 20) to coincide with it.</p><p>The story will be told in familiar ways to Overwatch, through a mix of cinematic videos and animated comics, but you'll now be able to see and track this inside of the game, and to feel the effects of it as you play. Characters will refer to story events in voice lines, and some maps will be altered to reflect what's been going on. Watchpoint: Gibraltar will be the first of these, and it will change structurally following an invasion by Talon's evil forces when The Reign of Talon begins.</p>

<p>Showcasing all of this will be a five-week story event called Conquest, which will allow players to side with either Overwatch or Talon in a faction war. You pick a side and carry out objectives for them, earning points for the faction and rewards for yourself.</p>
<p>There's still more: Overwatch is getting a full-on user interface overhaul for Reign of Talon to better organise the information the game presents to you, and to enable a 3D hero lobby, which will expand to a full party lobby in Season 4.</p><p>There are sub-roles being added to the hero roster as well, which not only help break-up the rapidly expanding roster visually, but give gameplay perks depending on the sub-role you choose. A Flanker like Tracer gets more health from health packs, for example, whereas a Medic like Moira heals themselves while healing others.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Stadium - the recently added MOBA-like 'develop your character as you play' mode - is getting an icon overhaul, and a build helper for newer players.</p>
<p>Blizzard has also said we should also expect two new core maps during the Reign of Talon year, as well as the reintroduction of post-match accolades and reworks for existing heroes (Blizzard wouldn't tell me which ones). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-proper-switch-2-version-coming">There's a dedicated Switch 2 release that will launch with Season 2</a>, which hasn't been dated, but I expect will arrive sometime in April.</p>
<p>It's a bold and headline-grabbing change for Overwatch 2, which struggled to convince players a few years ago when it launched. More importantly, it makes Overwatch 2 exciting again.</p>

            <p>It sounds as though Blizzard is open to exploring generative AI during the development of its games.</p>
<p>Answering a question I asked during an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> press conference at Blizzard campus last week, Blizzard president Johanna Faries said: "I like when we are dev-led in our approach. We want our dev teams to be able to utilise or explore whatever new technology is out there, to the extent that they're comfortable doing with it what we believe is responsible, and a lot of those principles that are communicated are really around rooting in responsible choices."</p>
<p>The principles she's referring to were outlined internally to staff at Blizzard, I was later told. I wasn't told what they were.</p>
<p>Faries went on to say: "We do actually, at Blizzard, have a centralised governance team specifically focused on AI and the role it can or should play in our development cycles.</p>
<p>"What's great about that is it's very cross functional, so you're going to have voices from around the horn thinking about not just what's hot-topic now, but where do we want to be five, 10 years from now? What's the implication on our teams? What's the implication on our values? How do we make sure that we don't stymie the opportunity for devs, artists, whomever, to want to play with new tools and play in the sandbox, if it unlocks creativity or gets rid of drudgery or what have you? We want happy devs, right?</p><p>"But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it's a responsible tool and aligned with how we want to show up as a company," she said. "So I feel very good in terms of the process we have in terms of vetting: is it secure, is it safe, is it values led? But I keep coming back to: I want the teams to feel safe, to explore to the extent that it drives joy in the work. And I think we have a good process, all up, in terms of making sure we're doing it in a responsible manner."</p>
<blockquote><em>"But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it's a responsible tool" -Johanna Faries</em></blockquote>
<p>Faries' remarks come a few months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-about-incredibly-talented-people-not-doing-incredibly-boring-stuff-blizzard-devs-say-its-possible-to-use-ai-tools-while-still-feeling-handcrafted">a lead World of Warcraft artist talked about using AI to remove some of the "boring" tasks</a> of game development, such as tweaking helmets to fit the heads of different-sized races in the game. "Things like AI help a lot with that," Gabriel Gonzalez explained. "I would say the philosophy is always how we free up more time for our team to be creative, and take away the menial." Gonzalez balanced his comment by emphasising the strength of Blizzard's handcrafted approach to art and making games. "That is, and always will be, a big part of it," he said.</p>
<p>Overwatch director Aaron Keller echoed that sentiment in the same interview, seemingly ruling out AI-use in the development of his game. "Right now, we don't use AI to create characters or gameplay," he said. "I think Blizzard as a whole is known for handcrafted games and handcrafted worlds. So, we try to pour all of our creative energy and all of our passion into doing that.</p><p>"For us, it is more important to get the details right, and to make sure that the gameplay is as impeccable as it can be and withholds the Blizzard standard, rather than trying to make something as quick as we possibly can."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-hops-on-controversial-ai-train-with-concept-art-tool">Blizzard has been linked with generative AI-use before</a>. In 2023, Blizzard reportedly told staff about a generative-AI concept art tool it had developed, called Stable Diffusion, that had been trained on the company's artwork. "We are on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games," read an email from Allen Adham, one of the co-founders of Blizzard, who once led the company. He left and rejoined the company a couple of times since those earlier days, leaving again in 2024. The email also mentioned "voice cloning", "game coding", "anti-toxicity", and "autonomous, intelligent in-game NPCs" among other potential uses for the generative AI tool. It's not clear whether this still exists in any form.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, generative AI is, as Aaron Keller noted in the above interview, an increasingly prevalent technology, "So we are going to see more of it." Exactly how much we'll see of it in Blizzard games, however, remains the question.</p>
<p>But Blizzard isn't the only major game development studio exploring the use of generative AI. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian revealed in December that it was exploring some uses of gen-AI</a> during development - a decision it faced heated backlash for, causing it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">to walk back on some uses it had in mind</a>.</p><p>I visited Blizzard campus last week for three separate days devoted to Overwatch, Diablo and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>. The coverage embargoes for these days are staggered, but the Overwatch restriction has now lifted, hence a barrage of Overwatch news hitting the site. And there's a lot to write about. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">Overwatch is getting a big push from Blizzard</a>, as it drops a giant expansion-like release and adopts an expansion-like approach, and drops the "2" from the name to make it "Overwatch" again.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has finally announced a proper <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> - the game formerly known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> - which it plans to release alongside the second season of The Reign of Talon this year. The current estimate for this is mid-April, Blizzard told me this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Reign of Talon is the year-long event that begins 10th February with an expansion-like release, which, among other things, introduces five new heroes to the game, overhauls the user interface, and brings story inside the game and makes a big fuss of it. There will also be five more heroes added over the course of 2026 - one in each of the five proceeding Reign of Talon seasons.</p>
<p>You can already play Overwatch (as in, Overwatch 2) on Switch, incidentally, but not in a way that's optimised to take advantage of Nintendo's newer and more powerful hardware. Presumably, we'll see much needed performance gains when the game <em>is </em>optimised, but could we also see support for some of the Switch 2's quirkier features like its mouse-pointer controls? We'll see.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Today is a big day for Overwatch, as Blizzard announces a bold new vision for the game</a> and - perhaps most significantly - drops the tainted "2" from the game's name. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">There is, as I explore in a separate Overwatch piece, much to be excited about</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> had a problem. It's a problem a lot of live service games have, to be fair. It wasn't particularly exciting any more. It had a chance at launch a few years ago to excite people, to create a wave of momentum to surf thereafter, but it floundered, beset as it was with identity problems and a misguided obsession with PvE, which sounded lovely on paper but never really worked in practice. Plenty of good work was done since on the game but most people outside of Overwatch 2 don't care - or don't know, because they're not looking anymore. They've moved on, they're playing other things. Incremental updates weren't enough to turn their heads. As far as many people were concerned, Overwatch 2 was yesterday's news, been and gone. How, then, does Blizzard make people care again?</p>
<p>That was the question at the forefront of my mind when I travelled to Blizzard's head offices recently. And I was delighted to discover, as a lapsed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> player, that it does have an answer - and a convincing one. Blizzard is <em>sort of</em> relaunching the game. Specifically, Overwatch 2 is getting an enormous release this month akin to an expansion, which will contain five new heroes - far more than we've ever had in an update before. Even Overwatch 2 itself, a whole new game, only launched with three new heroes. On top of that, there are plans for further five new heroes to be released over the course of the year. That's 10 new heroes in 2026, which for Overwatch is unprecedented.</p>
<p>That's not all: there's a top-to-bottom user interface overhaul and a huge story push I'd go as far as to call Story 2.0, as well as the many game alterations and new skins we'd expect from a regular seasonal release. Perhaps most significantly of all, though, Blizzard is renaming the game, erasing the "2" from the title to make it, simply, "Overwatch" again.</p>

<p>It's symbolic; there's more going on here than new heroes. This is a series that's been bruised and battered in recent years, first when the ambitious Overwatch League esports dream didn't work out, then when the sequel floundered, and then when Marvel Rivals used a barely disguised Overwatch formula to find huge success last year. Overwatch has been on the ropes. But this Overwatch rethink, and with it a pledge to do huge expansion-like releases every year, represents Blizzard fighting back.</p><p>The seriousness of the company's intentions were made clear by who attended the press conference I watched. There wasn't only the Overwatch trio of Aaron Keller, game director, Dion Rogers, art director, and new executive producer Ben Bell on the stage. There was Walter Kong, the head of live service development at Blizzard, and Blizzard's president herself, Johanna Faries. Here, in this article, I've assembled their thoughts from the press conference, as well as what I learned in a one-on-one interview with Aaron Keller and in a series of group interviews about different aspects of the game. I've also included my thoughts on the new heroes, which I had a chance to play.</p>
<p>Is this a turnaround moment for the game? Will Overwatch be a part of the conversation again? Could a comeback be on?</p>

<h2>No, Overwatch 2 being renamed is not an admission of any previous errors or guilt, Blizzard says</h2>
<p>The "2" in the name was tainted. To begin with, there was the controversy that Overwatch 2 would replace Overwatch 1 rather than live alongside it - a forced migration plenty of people didn't want. Then there were the things Overwatch 2 did that people didn't like, such as locking new heroes behind Battle Pass progression or moving to 5v5 matches from 6v6 - decisions Blizzard has since revised. The "2" represented a PvE dream which never properly materialised, too. It represented all of that; it came to symbolise Overwatch losing its way. But now the "2" is being dropped.</p><p>"What would I change if we could go back?" says Blizzard live service head Walter Kong during the press conference. "Probably not call it Overwatch 2." He smiles. "But when I look back at that period, I do think that it was a positive period for us, because we made an important transition. We made a transition to an ongoing live game, and that wasn't easy. It was really, really hard.</p>
<p>"It was a necessary period of challenge that we had to get through to get to where we are today. I don't think we could jump straight here. Just thinking back to what we experienced during those years makes me feel a bit exhausted, but it is what's allowed us to take Overwatch into the future."</p>
<blockquote><em>"It was a necessary period of challenge that we had to get through to get to where we are today" -Walter Kong</em> </blockquote>
<p>"It's a tricky question," game director Aaron Keller says when we talk one-on-one, and I ask whether dropping the "2" was an admission of error in any way. "From our player's point of view, they'll tell us, 'Hey, Overwatch is in the best state it's ever been in.' And a lot of times we even hear like, 'Overwatch has finally earned the two.' So I don't think this is us trying to admit there was a failure here, especially when we start hearing from the community that we've earned it.</p>
<p>"But for us what this is saying is that because Overwatch is this forever game, we don't want our players worrying about when it's going to get replaced by Overwatch 3."</p>
<p>There was once a broad trilogy idea for Overwatch, if you didn't know. The first game was to be quite contained and focus on competitive multiplayer, which it did. The second game would then expand to include a PvE experience, which it tried to do. Then the third game would expand again to be a full blown do-everything persistent online world - an MMO, in other words, just like the cancelled Titan MMO Overwatch was once salvaged from. This information comes from Jason Schreier's Blizzard book, Play Nice, by the way, which is well worth a read.</p><p>But as several Overwatch-related people reiterated during the course of the day, Overwatch is refocused on being entirely a competitive PvP game. Those old plans are no more, and there may well never be an Overwatch 3. "Never is a big word to say," Keller says in our interview, "but our intention is to continue supporting this game, this competitive hero-based, team-based shooter, for as far into the future as our players will continue playing."</p>
<p>Does that mean PvE is absolutely definitely out for good? "I think when you you talk about the PvE missions by themselves: as we developed them, and especially as we released a few of them, we didn't see a lot of excitement from players for those missions," Keller says, "and we realised that where we ought to be putting our resources in this game is on that core competitive PvP experience, and that is what we've been doing for the last few years. I don't think I could say that PvE is forever off the table for Overwatch, but it is definitely not something that we're focusing on right now or looking to get back to anytime soon."</p>

<h2>These five new heroes will shake things up</h2>
<p>The thinking behind introducing five new heroes at once is there will be something for everybody. The characters are spread across all roles - there's a tank, two supports, and two damage dealers. And what I find particularly impressive about them is how they bring never before seen ideas to the game.</p><p>Jetpack Cat is the most blatant of them. Superficially, she's ridiculous - a cat with a jetpack - but she plays brilliantly, being the game's only permanently flying hero, which means she has incredible manoeuvrability and impressive speed. That, plus her few healing abilities, makes her a great pairing for D.Vas or other dive/flanking characters that are usually hard to keep up with.</p>
<p>But Jetpack Cat also brings arguably the most exciting new tactical possibility to the game it's had in a long time, in the form of her tow rope - or beam - which she dangles for other heroes to use for a lift somewhere. This means you can do things like fly back to base to collect slow characters who've respawned there, or airlift characters to places they wouldn't otherwise be able to get. Or you could, say, airlift Bastion in chaingun form for a devastating aerial assault; or you could carry Junkrat around for him to drop grenades on teams from above. You can tow enemies too, although only as a consequence of using your Ultimate, which limits it. Still, it's an enormously powerful way to remove an obstinate tank from the battlefield as you dump them over a ledge somewhere.</p>
<p>My favourite hero of the day, though, was probably Anran, a damage dealer who's the older sister of support character Wuyang, if you're interested in lore. I don't normally go for damage types because I lack the precise skill to use them, but Anran is forgiving in that regard, which is what I really liked.</p>
<p>Anran's theme is setting people on fire with flaming fan strikes and abilities, and then literally fanning the flames to deal more damage to them. And because fanning the flames doesn't require great accuracy, just close proximity, it's much easier to reliably do. Couple that with her flaming dash and dash-around flame strike and she's got manoeuvrability and a bit of survivability. But Anran's most attention-grabbing ability is one of her <em>two </em>Ultimates, which brings her back from the dead when you use it, in a fiery explosion.</p><p>Mizuki, the other new support, will take a bit of getting used to, but he seems to already be the favourite of a few developers at Blizzard, which bodes well. I struggled with him. He's themed around a large circular hat he throws to heal people, a bit like Kung Lao does in Mortal Kombat, although with less slicing people apart. Throw the hat and it automatically bounces around allies in a loose line in front of you, and sometimes off of scenery, and then it returns to you, which feels cool. He also has a healing aura like Lucio, and a remember-where-you-were teleport to get out of trouble.</p>

<div>



<p>The new Overwatch heroes - Anran, Emre, Domina, Mizuki and Jetpack Cat.</p>

</div>

<p>But Mizuki's potential I think lies in his chain grapple, which he fires out at people to bind them, again like a Mortal Kombat character but this time Scorpion - although he doesn't pull enemies to him, he binds them in place. This can stop enemies in their tracks so it's super-useful for holding quick flankers, but it will also ground flying characters, so if you spot a Pharah or a Jetpack Cat hovering over a cliff-edge somewhere: Binding Chain them and they'll fall to their death. Plenty of potential if you have the accuracy to land it.</p><p>Domina, the new tank, is an imposing presence, power-dressed for corporate success with two floating robot arms to accompany her. She's all about barrier shields, but her barriers are a kind we haven't seen before. Hers are made up of hexagonal segments that can be individually blown away, so the whole thing doesn't go down at once, like Reinhardt's, for instance - only parts of it do. Her Ultimate also traps individual enemies <em>inside </em>their own personal shield, then explodes.</p>
<p>The key to getting the most out of Domina will be getting to grips with her laser rifle, which is like a delayed blast railgun. As you shoot it, it charges up to release a final, more powerful blast, meaning you have to stay on your target for a second or so. Some of my opponents during the playtest showed me how devastating this can be when handled well.</p>
<blockquote><em>"The strategy that we would like to go forward with is to find a way to start every year off for Overwatch with a really big, ambitious moment like this" -Aaron Keller</em></blockquote>
<p>The last of the heroes, Emre, doesn't seem exciting on paper. He's very similar to Soldier 76, the run-and-gun character who's a bit of a concession to first-person shooter players. Emre's the same thing - he even brings aim-down-sights to Overwatch for the first time. He has a grenade (a bouncy one) and a sidearm with life-stealing abilities, which temporarily boosts his jump distance and speed. Coupled with a passive that makes his health regen kick in quicker, it means he's a very forgiving kind of hero, a bit of an all-rounder.</p>
<p>But there's potential here. Emre's main weapon is hitscan - meaning your shots will hit a target the moment you shoot - which means he has great damage capability at distance, especially where annoying flying characters are concerned. His Ultimate is also one of the most intimidating I faced during our playtest. Emre shouts out and then turns into a Tron-like AI person, hovers in the air, and fires charged, explosive blasts that can devastate clustered groups.</p><p>There's something to like in all of the heroes, regardless of your playstyle, and the impact of them arriving together in the game will be considerable. We've rarely, if ever, had to shuffle multiple heroes into the pack at once, so there'll be a period of all-change as people think of ways to work them in. And then there will be five more. Just as we settle with these heroes, another one will arrive, and then another, and then another. This can't help but throw game balance out of whack this year, even though Blizzard assures me it has tools to better deal with this these days, but does it matter? Isn't the chaos a large part of the excitement, of the fun?</p>
<h2>Yearly expansions forever more</h2>
<p>As big as this moment is - and Aaron Keller tells me "this is our most ambitious launch that we've ever had for Overwatch", and "the largest year we've ever had" - Blizzard doesn't apparently think of it as a relaunch moment, even if I do. "We think about it more as an expansion moment for the game," Keller says when we talk. But it's not calling them expansions either, confusingly. It's more accurate to think of them as year-long things that begin with a big moment and then progress in several smaller seasons over the course of the year. This year is The Reign of Talon, for example, which will have six seasons within it (roughly one every couple of months, it seems). The important thing to take from this is that each season will be akin to the seasonal Overwatch updates of the past, so the expansion-like drops are on top of that, not in place of that. We're getting significantly more overall with this new way of doing things.</p>
<p>"If you look at the year we're just jumping into, yes, we have this massive moment at the start, and we do want to do something big next year," Keller tells me. "But at the same time, we are releasing a new hero every season this year and it's something we've never done before. So this is, in essence, us really committing to something bigger."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>There are still five more heroes to come this year, as seen here by their silhouettes. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As suggested there, the plan is to repeat this formula each year, which I suppose brings the game much more in line with World of Warcraft and Diablo, which are also trying to stick to yearly expansion plans with several smaller updates in between. "The strategy that we would like to go forward with is to find a way to start every year off for Overwatch with a really big, ambitious moment like this," Keller says. "Okay, we don't think every one of them is going to be the same. We don't want a cookie cutter template for it, but we would like a moment where everyone can sit up and take notice and be like, 'Wow, look what Overwatch is doing.'"</p><p>But don't expect five new heroes every February. "This isn't something that we're promising to do every year and it's not even something I think that if we had the capability to do it that we would want to do every year," Keller says. So next year it might be a map and mode overhaul, potentially, or something else entirely. "We do want there to be an element of surprise and delight in the way that we put together some of these bigger releases for our players."</p>
<p>And in case you're wondering, these expansion-like releases will be free. "This is just part of the live service for Overwatch," Keller says. And in case you're also wondering, what with all the focus on <em>new</em> heroes, Blizzard isn't forgetting the existing ones. There's a plan to devote a season this year to reworking some of them. "We would love to have a season this year that would be a rework season," Keller says, "and so we're talking about maybe a midpoint to the year where we release multiple hero reworks and map reworks at the same time." As for which ones: "Oh I think we're going to keep that under wraps."</p>
<h2>Story 2.0</h2>
<p>Overwatch has always had lore. Since the beginning, there have been impressive cinematic videos showcasing heroes and their backstories, as well as comics and clue-laden voice-line interactions between characters in the game. But until now most of this has existed <em>outside</em> of the game, on the periphery, whereas in Reign of Talon it's being brought inside, into the foreground, in a narrative viewer part of the game. Stories are also changing to become year-long things with beginnings, middles and climactic ends, rather than occasional dollops that accompany new heroes a few times a year. This has made for a significant developmental change, allowing the designers to plan story arcs further out and go much bigger with them.</p>
<p>The Reign of Talon begins with recently added hero Vendetta slicing off Talon leader Doomfist's iconic cybernetic arm, to take control of the baddie group herself, then enacting, well, The Reign of Talon. This begins with an attack on Watchpoint: Gibraltar, a long-standing map in the game, and what's exciting about this moment is we'll see the in-game consequence of this attack when we play.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Vendetta takes over Talon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Watchpoint: Gibraltar is going to look very different," says Keller during the press conference, "and even play differently." Art director Dion Rogers expands on this in a group interview, saying: "This time it's not just additive where we just placed a couple props around and some fire. Bridges are destroyed, there's new pathways in the map. We've edited the level design to support what's happening in the storyline."</p><p>Rogers goes on, perhaps daydreaming a little: "I can see this happening to a character, too, based on what's going on. They may go through some sort of transformation that would affect their gameplay or maybe gain some temporary new power for a little while. Or even their artwork may change..."</p>
<p>Doomfist would be a brilliant test-case for this approach, with him losing his special arm, but Blizzard isn't ready to go there yet. "This isn't going to signal a change for Doomfist," Keller says. "We're not taking him out of the game. There's not going to be a version without the arm. But I don't think it means that we wouldn't do some of that stuff in the future... I think that when the game feels like it's more connected to the story, it is more powerful that way."</p>
<p>Season 1 of The Reign of Talon will begin the story and in Season 5, "It's all going to come to a head," Keller says. "We're going to have the big climactic finale. And then if this really resonates with players, that means Season 6 of this year is when we start setting up the next story with the newest hero that we developed."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>This is what the faction war event will look like.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But that's not all. There's going to be a five-week faction war between the forces of Overwatch and Talon to really emphasise this, and the alluring part of this is your being able to choose a faction to ally with. Pick a side and complete objective-based missions to earn points for the faction and rewards for yourself. "And at the end of the event," Keller says, "depending on which side wins, we're going to be making some changes in some of our maps in order to reflect which one of those sides won."</p><p>I think this feels like a push from Blizzard to engender a Warcraft-style Horde vs. Alliance sense of factional divide between players in the game, but when I put this to Keller, he seems genuinely surprised. "Oh," he says. "Hey I was on the World of Warcraft team. We had a lot of people on Team 4 [the Overwatch team] that were on the World of Warcraft team. So when we think of something like the Ahn'Qiraj event or something, we have fond memories of that."</p>
<h2>Overwatch as the golden goose of Blizzard going forward</h2>
<p>The clear message of the day is that Blizzard is committed to Overwatch in a big way. "We look at this business as something that will carry Overwatch to the next 10 years," says Walter Kong during the press conference - "that we don't look at it as a sprint, but a marathon." And while some of that could be put down to familiar marketing bluster, there is an underlying sense that Blizzard has dug in and turned things around here, and that, with this new strategy, it's throwing even more at the game going forward. Some of that is sheer Blizzard obstinacy and pride, I'm sure, and a desire to reassert its hero shooter as the dominant one out there. But there's something else going on between the lines here, too, I believe, and it's a sense that Overwatch is being shaped as a super-brand for Blizzard going forward.</p>
<blockquote><em>"It sets us up for a much broader conversation on where the future of this universe and these characters are going to go" -Johanna Faries</em></blockquote>
<p>Listen to Blizzard president Johanna Faries' opening remark from the press conference: "I think there's a vision that Overwatch is a pillar for Blizzard that we believe is a timeless game," she says. "It's not limited to chronology. It's certainly not limited to number structures. And as we think about putting a forever game mindset to this universe, not only for what it is today, but what it can continue to grow to become multiple experiences - this is by no means the capstone of what people should expect from the Overwatch universe in terms of how Blizzard is going to wrap our arms around it. [...] It sets us up for a much broader conversation on where the future of this universe and these characters are going to go."</p>
<p>Add to that Walter Kong's remarks: "We have this wonderful pantheon of heroes. We have the set of values that I think are fairly timeless, that fit today as well as they did 10 years ago - hope and optimism - and we want to be able to tell more stories and set up more experiences within that franchise, but it's something that we're not rushing."</p><p>"Multiple experiences", "tell more stories", "set up more experiences" - those are all indications Blizzard is exploring ways to expand Overwatch, beyond what it's doing now. Are those references to other Overwatch game experiences? Or are they allusions to feature film desires on the team? Riot Games managed to successfully turn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> into a blockbuster animated TV series in Arcane, although it did so at considerable, eye-watering cost. Exactly what Blizzard is exploring, then, I don't know, but it's clear how important Overwatch is to the company. Above all, it's an exciting time to be an Overwatch player, and oh how I've longed to say those words again.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/">Evercade</a> consoles remain one of the most fascinating pieces of modern hardware on the market. Mainly aimed at collectors, but also welcoming enough so that younger gamers become interested in retro gaming, they blur the line between modern emulation and older original consoles. Now, the king of retro shooters is coming to them: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom">Doom</a> is invading yet another platform.</p>
<p>The gory demon-slaying series somehow hadn't launched on the Evercade consoles yet, but it now seems that Blaze Entertainment has figured out a deal with Xbox-owned ZeniMax and Bethesda just in time for id Software's 35th anniversary.</p>
<p>On 4th February, a short teaser was shared on social media channels and through YouTube. There's not much to it, and it doesn't even confirm how many games will be included in the long-awaited cartridge, but it's a start:</p>

<p>Hopefully, "coming in 2026" doesn't mean Evercade owners and Doom fans (often the same) will have to wait until the next <a href="https://quakecon.bethesda.net/">QuakeCon</a> to get a date or shadow drop. And before you ask, nope, you can't preorder this release yet.</p><p>The logical assumption here is that <em>at least</em> Doom 1 &amp; 2 will be part of the hot package, but if they really want to celebrate the series' legacy, the latter re-releases (with extra content) and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-64">Doom 64</a> should be included too. Recent jumbo-sized retro offerings like the extremely rich <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-just-leaked-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollections-release-date">Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection</a> have raised the bar for physical re-releases of olden classics, so we won't be surprised if Doom diehards set their expectations high for this one.</p>

            <p>We're sure we'll be hearing a lot <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-30th-Celebration-Teaser">from The Pokémon Company</a> this year, as the massive franchise is turning 30 this month and already announced a major spinoff in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a>. It's also reasonable to expect news on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">the next generation</a> sooner rather than later, but first, Jigglypuff might show up at this year's Super Bowl. Yes, really.</p>
<p>On 4th February, the official Pokémon social media accounts revealed a "special video" will be shown during the 8th February broadcast, and The Pokémon Company even gave fans a cheeky tease that you can watch below:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Jigglypuff appears to be set to be the star of the show, and while we're low-key hoping for a halftime musical performance of sorts that puts everyone to sleep, the most likely scenario is that we'll get a nostalgic edit that also hypes up the franchise's busy future.</p>
<p>In any case, I personally doubt Nintendo and TPC have chosen to reveal more about the next batch of Pokémon games at the Super Bowl of all places, but I wouldn't rule out a few quick teases and/or winks. That's just speculation on my part, and I invite you all to theorize as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/30th-celebration/">Pokémon Center site</a> has also kicked off a big anniversary promotion with all-new 30th anniversary items presented as the 30th Collection. Pikachu's head shape has been chosen as the main icon for the celebrations, with the number 30 replacing the species' famous red cheeks. Cute!</p>
<p>Though we're still waiting for official updates on what's next for Pokémon on the gaming front past <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive Pokopia, recent weeks have brought us fun little behind-the-scenes tidbits about the making of older Pokémon games like the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-original-pokemon-games-took-lots-of-trial-and-error-to-develop">Red &amp; Green</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-sun-and-moon-ultra-beasts-design-inspiration-confirmed">Sun &amp; Moon</a>.</p>

            <p>A Netease spokesperson has told Eurogamer that statements made by Suda 51 on its generative AI policy are not correct, and that the company continues to work with the technology.</p>
<p>The spokesperson has also pointed to an upcoming GDC talk hosted by Netease covering generative AI."The assertion that NetEase Games has closed an AI department or that we've mandated teams or studios not to use AI is not true," said a representative speaking on behalf of the publisher. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/">Elsewhere</a>, NetEase has offered a comment saying: "The situation described did not occur, and we have not published any related policies".</p>
<p>Suda 51, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-melting-faces-generative-ai-jazz-band">talking to Eurogamer as part of an interview on Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming game Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, stated the following: "They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all."</p>
<p>"I don't know, they never explained directly why," Suda continued. "If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly."</p>

<p>As for Grasshopper's own involvement with generative AI, Suda 51 also stated the company had not done any research into AI, and he believes there's something in the human brain that tells them something is off when they see it.</p><p>Suda told Eurogamer: "At some point there may be this thing I've heard be called the "New Reality", but even if it does get to that point and it's really good and realistic, I feel humans have something in their brain that tells them something is off. So while I don't have a strict opinion either way on people using it in their own games, that's not the way we do it. That's one of the things that bring people to Grasshopper games - they can feel people's efforts themselves. It's something we're proud of.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is about to turn 10 this month and I'm turning to literal dust as I type this sentence. However, that isn't stopping Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) from updating the incredibly successful life/farming sim in big ways.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">quick update</a> on the state of his new game, Haunted Chocolatier, IGN had the opportunity to sit down with Barone to discuss Stardew Valley's past, present, and future. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">full interview</a> is long and deep, a must-read for anyone interested in the hit game, but those looking for an excuse to get back into the cozy grind of this modern indie classic are waiting for news on what's coming with the 1.7 patch, and we thankfully have two biggies to share.</p>
<p>While it's going to be a while before we get a definitive release date and full patch notes, the developer was kind enough to share a couple of nuggets of information even if he wants the update to be a "surprise" for the most part. Think of it as a big 10th birthday gift.</p>
<p>First, following fan noise, he's worked on an upgrade of sorts to the children, who will be "a little more interesting" after the patch arrives. What that entails is currently unknown, but it's not unreasonable to expect a deeper family experience on that front. Players had been saying for the longest time that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/15klpr3/is_there_any_point_to_children/">there was no point to them</a> and they mostly felt like "set dressing" when compared to other social elements in the game, so that's a victory.</p><p>A second update to families will arrive in the form of "two more marriage candidates" that he wasn't ready to reveal yet. You'll have to wait until 26th February to learn about those, and you can start placing your bets now. Will they be new characters or veterans that players have been wanting to romance for ages? Everything's possible.</p>
<p>In any case, it's nice to see Stardew Valley receiving extra love after 10 years that many indie studios would kill for. At this point, it's reminding me of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>'s endless "actually, more patches are happening" state, and you won't be hearing me complain even if the massive game sits barely touched in my Steam library.</p>

            <p>Despite being approached "many times", Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has so far said no to a Stardew Valley film or TV adaptation. However, if David Lynch had offered, it would have probably been a different story.</p>
<p>We are in a rather ripe age of video game adaptations. That's the good, the bad and the ugly. So when everything under the sun seems to be getting adapted for film or TV, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">even Slime Rancher</a>, why not wholesome farming-sim Stardew Valley?</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"I think the main reason is that I would be worried that I wouldn't be happy with the final result. Stardew Valley is very much about the characters and the world and the tone of the game," Barone told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-uses-harry-potter-to-explain-why-there-isnt-a-stardew-valley-tv-show">IGN</a>. "So to take those characters, which, they don't have voices in the game. You have to use your imagination a bit to fill in the gaps, which I think makes the game more personal to every player. They're filling in the gaps. If it becomes a movie or a TV show, suddenly those gaps are all filled for you."</p>
<p>Barone referenced his own experience with the Harry Potter books, which he read before watching the Daniel Radcliffe-fronted films. "I had my own idea of what Harry looked like, what Ron looked like and everything. Then you see the movies. I can't remember what my own idea was anymore. It's all just now what the movies are," he explained, noting it was the same with books like The Lord of the Rings in a post-Peter Jackson world (which to be fair, Aragorn will always be Viggo Mortensen in my head).</p><p>"With Stardew Valley, I'm a little bit wary of taking that step because I feel like it might- I care about Stardew Valley so much that I don't - Even though it would be cool to see Stardew Valley on the silver screen and drive by a movie theater and see Stardew Valley on the marquee, that would be cool, but it's like, 'Is it really the best for Stardew Valley?' I guess that's my worry," the solo creator said.</p>
<p>But while Barone makes a fair point here, and one that should be admired, there is one person he would have trusted with a Stardew Valley adaptation: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remembering-david-lynch-and-his-wonderfully-surreal-playstation-2-adverts">the late, great David Lynch</a>. "I said once, that if David Lynch had wanted to make a Stardew Valley movie in the style of Twin Peaks or something, I would've been like, 'Yeah, great. You can do whatever you want, Mr. Lynch.' Honestly, I would've let him just do whatever," Barone said.</p>
<p>"I think it would've been great. Especially if it's like this mainstream Hollywood Stardew Valley. It's like, 'Is this really the heart and soul of what Stardew Valley is about?' And I'm sure someone could do a great job, but it feels like it's a bit of a roll of the dice."</p>
<p>Barone added Lynch had "a transcendental understanding of the world", which you could "see in his art". Sadly, though, the two never met. Oh, what could have been.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley will be celebrating its 10th anniversary this month. Back in January last year, Barone revealed that, as of December 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p><p>As well as Stardew Valley, Barone also has his next game - Haunted Chocolatier - in the works.  Earlier this year, Baron said he had "been very productive lately", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was indeed alive and well</a> (as is he).</p>

            <section><p>Innovation is the ki to success for Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, as Nioh 3 iterates on the formula once more to take an already great 'masocore' series to new heights.</p></section>
<p>The Nioh series isn't exactly known for its nuance: there is good and evil, strong and weak, and little in-between. From feuding clans to the machinations of political elites, this binary is at the heart of everything in Team Ninja's pseudo-historical canon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> takes this black-and-white worldview and applies it to the feuding Tokugawa brothers at the start of the Seventeenth Century. Your character, Takechiyo, is good: noble, just, <em>proper</em>. Your brother, a bitter little rat tempted by ancient powers beyond his understanding (of course), is evil. His desire for power and notoriety is so distinct, in fact, that it has somehow summoned a supernatural 'crucible' from the darkest reaches of space-time, and this consuming chaos is so profound, it has managed to seep into four major eras of Japanese history. Uh oh!</p>

<p>So begins the tale of Nioh 3. Inexplicably, playing as the sickliest of the great Tokugawa Ieyasu's grandchildren, you are whisked away through various periods of Japanese history. It is your task - nay, your birthright! - to insert yourself into the thorniest bits of political intrigue in shogunate canon and undo the evil influence called forth by your brother across the Heian period, the Bakumatsu period, antiquity, and beyond. Even by Nioh standards, <em>this is nonsense</em>. But therein lies the charm, I think.</p>
<p>What this 'time cop' setup does is pretty convenient for Team Ninja: after two games set during the major conflicts of the Sengoku period, this gimmick gives the developer free rein to jump outside its established timeline and show us other parts of Japanese culture: modifying history with myth, and giving more context to the 'spirit stone' MacGuffin that lies at the centre of Nioh's complicated web of lore.</p>

<p>I don't think it adds much to Nioh's story, though. The bulk of narrative is still delivered through campy cutscenes that don't make a whole lot of sense unless you're paying a lot of attention, with short animated sequences giving you insight into character motivations and key conflicts. There's a lot of yelling, dying, and asking the main character to continue forward whilst people sort things out <em>back here</em>. It's anachronistic in terms of storytelling, sure, but that's not why most people come to Nioh, is it?</p><p>Personally, I come for the combat and the menuing. Yes, really - the build-crafting of Nioh has always been this series' strength. The previous Nioh games were sumptuous feasts for fellow loot goblins, and Nioh 3 is even better. Now, there are two whole character builds you can enjoy: samurai <em>and </em>ninja. Before, you had to choose one or the other, and that meant that quick weapons like kusarigama or dual swords would have to share a build with massive, powerful weapons like naginata or odachi.</p>



<p>In Nioh 3, you can flit between ninja and samurai on a whim. This means two whole, unique builds available to you at the tap of R2. Common sense dictates you'd have your ninja - which can evade without using stamina and ready back-attacks with uncanny ease - focus on quick, stamina-draining moves, whilst your samurai is poised to dish out huge damage with slower, more ki-hungry attacks. There are probably other setups that work, but that logic carried me through 60 hours of Nioh 3 with only about two or three major roadblocks in terms of progress (so, yeah, it's easier than the other two games).</p><p>But two loadouts means two sets of menus. I think the longest I spent gazing at stats, armour set bonuses, and the meagre differences between 0.1 percent increments of buffs was about 28 minutes in one go. I can feel some of your eyes glazing over as I write that, sorry. But there are also people looking at their screens now going 'yes, <em>yes</em>' because you, like me, are deeply unwell and find comfort in this sort of Spreadsheet Simulator nonsense.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <em>powerful </em>level-scaling in Nioh 3, though, every whisper of stat increase counts. Swapping out new gear every five or so levels is pretty integral to the core experience (and Team Ninja has made it very easy to auto-sort your lower-level gear whenever you pray at a shrine, ridding you of some of the more taxing busywork and rewarding you with level-up materials basically for free). You can also auto-equip the best gear in your inventory, which can be adjusted for weight class or set bonus, meaning you won't accidentally go fat-rolling into battle against a tengu next time you accidentally wander into an encounter area.</p>

</figure>
<p>When you're all kitted out, it's time to grit your teeth and employ a bit of kiri-sute gomen (or: right to strike). The open-ended regions of Nioh 3 take inspiration from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, sort-of: yes, there's a singular marker for story completion, but it's bolstered and decorated with a decent, not-overbearing selection of side activities. Clear out bases, hunt down formidable enemies, chase some cats around, shoot weasels out of the sky, engage in secret boss battles, weaken the integrity of the pulsating, intimidating Crucible throbbing overhead at all times… Far Cry, Assassin's Creed this is not. Team Ninja calls Nioh 3 'open field', not 'open world', and I think the sizing and design of the maps is pretty perfect - I only found myself getting bored with one of the four huge areas, and only because I'd over-levelled myself to some degree re-doing an optional mission over and over again to get gear for an odachi-based build that carried my samurai through most of the game.</p><p>As is series tradition, combat is as good as you'll find in the genre. Nioh 3 is the high tide. I was dubious about the separation of ninja and samurai to begin with ('I want high poses for all weapons', I moaned after seeing the baton-like tonfa weapons seemingly relegated to one move pool), but within a few hours I was sold. I can't actually imagine going back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a>, now: the distinction between classes feels so natural and so intuitive, it's hard to believe it was ever any different. The class switch button is also your 'burst counter' button, meaning that big, powerful moves denoted by a red aura can only be stopped by switching classes at the right time. This is baked into so many enemy movesets, the game essentially forces you into a dance between the two loadouts. Use both, or die. So goes the unofficial Nioh 3 motto.</p>



<p>Stance-based combat is still there in samurai mode, and I think that remains one of the best, most unique things about the series: dancing from low to mid to high stance to take advantage of enemy vulnerabilities, timing your stance switches to perform ki bursts and purify yokai-affected areas, and then weaving this altogether to pull off a new 'martial art' special move and finish off your hulking adversary in one combo string? Pump it into my veins. The newly-added utility of being able to swap to ninja mid-run to recover stamina (or ki) when you over-exert and open up some high-damage back attacks? It's as close as you're going to get to poetry in action game terms.</p><p>Previous games made using the extent of your toolkit a pain in arse (or fingers, I suppose, with all the dexterous gymnastics you'd have to do just to ready, say, a 'Sloth Talisman' to apply a slowing debuff to an enemy). Readying magic, ninjutsu or items all lived on the same set of buttons - your item UI in the bottom left corner. Now, ninjutsu is particular to the ninja class, meaning bombs, caltrops, traps, poison mists, substitute tech and more can only be used in ninja class - and it auto-refills as you deal damage. This one change opens up the Nioh toolkit in a spectacular fashion, and as someone that has platinumed both original games twice (yes, I know), I found myself using so many more tricks and tools in this playthrough than I ever have before. The boomerang-like shuriken pinwheel, for what it's worth, is a lifesaver. More tools means more by-the-skin-of-your-teeth survivals, and it means Team Ninja can ram more boss gauntlets into the crevices of the game without the risk of pissing you off too much.</p>

<p>Since Nioh 2, we've seen Team Ninja release Final Fantasy: Stranger of Paradise, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>. That auto-equip feature I mentioned was something actually introduced in Stranger of Paradise. The massive zones you have to explore in Nioh 3 feel like a cross between Wo Long and Rise of the Ronin, with the stat bonuses conferred upon you for completing various side tasks taken straight from the latter. A lot of the newly-optimised ninja moves feel inspired by - you guessed it - Ninja Gaiden 4.</p>
<p>Nioh 3 feels like the crucible in which all of Team Ninja's experience has been siphoned into. It studied the fundamentals of every discipline learned by Team Ninja, and wove them all together to create something unique and new, more expansive and more focused. It gives you more freedom in your combat, more depth to your builds, and more expression in how you navigate the nuances of samurai/ninja melee. All the best bosses from the franchise return, and are bolstered by some all-time classics in newcomers in turn. The historical melodrama of the story is <em>fine, </em>and the semi-open world level design shows why restraint is as important as scope when it comes to scale.</p><p>It feels as though the series, after three iterations, has finally refined its formula to the point of excellence: like the shogun it so reveres, it has taken the roots of what has come before, paid homage to its legacy, and deigned to build something even more powerful - something even more enduring - on those foundations. Enjoy the brutality, revel in the power fantasy, and let yourself be hammered into the ground by the blunt-force trauma of a world dedicated to seeing everything in terms of absolutes.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a Direct showcase for later this week.</p>
<p>This Direct will be focused on third-party releases, the company has said. As for the when and where, you will be able to watch the partner showcase on YouTube tomorrow, 5th February, at 2pm UK time.</p>

<p>"The livestreamed presentation will feature roughly 30 minutes of upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Nintendo Switch games from publishing and development partners," Nintendo said of tomorrow's Direct.</p>
<p>So, what can we hope to see? Well, I am sure many of you are champing at the bit to find out a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">release date for Elden Ring on Switch 2</a>. When it does arrive on Nintendo's console,  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: Tarnished Edition (as it is known) will include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">two new classes for players to choose from when they set off for the Lands Between</a>.</p><p>Then, sticking with the FromSoft, we are also still quite light on news about The Duskbloods. Announced last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods is a "PvPvE title with online multiplayer"</a>, which features up to eight participants vying for "supremacy among themselves and against challenging foes". It is quite an eclectic offering by the looks of things, complete with jetpacks, creepy moons and, erm, dinosaurs!?</p>

<p>We may also get to see something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>-flavoured tomorrow. This chap <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-coming-to-switch-2-next-year">was announced for Switch 2 last year</a>, so a release date isn't out of the question.</p>
<p>What do you hope turns up during tomorrow's Nintendo Partner Direct?</p>

            <p>A new stage in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> galactic war for democracy has begun in earnest, spurred on by the Automatons stealing blueprints for Super Earth's Star of Peace space station. In response to this rebellious action, players will have to travel back to their home planet first introduced in the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>: Cyberstan.</p>
<p>This space station, in the wrong hands, can destroy whole planets (much like another space station you may be familiar with). As such, Helldivers 2 players have been thrust across the galaxy to stop an evil, undemocratic, copy of it being built.</p>
<p>Players have done the math and, it doesn't look good for the community of Helldivers 2 patriots. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1qvh51e/ive_done_the_math/">User CommodoreDrize on the Helldivers 2 Reddit</a> has tracked the Helldivers reserves (essentially a numerical count of how many lives the community has to spare when taking Cyberstan). At the current rate, these reserves may dry up before players event take a crack at conquering Cyberstan, unless of course Helldivers 2 game master Joel leaps to the rescue.</p>

<p>To help them do so, tanks have now been added to the game. This multi-person vehicle can be seen briefly in the announcement trailer for this update, mowing down robots, guns blazing. What else could one ask for.</p>
<p>That's not all players have to help them push forward into robot territory. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-update-adds-bastion-tank-siege-breakers-warbond">The recently-released premium warbond</a> provides the LAS-16 trident gun, as well as a huge hammer people have been using to charge in and deal serious close-quarters damage with.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-sun-and-moon-review">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a> turn 10 this year. Feel old yet? It doesn't matter, as we're only just now learning new fun tidbits about their development and what the hell was up with the very divisive Ultra Beast designs.</p>
<p>Renowned illustrator Yusuke Omura, former character designer at main Pokémon developer Game Freak and lead designer on Sun and Moon, took to X/Twitter to comment on several fan theories that popped up over the years about the mysterious extradimensional beings which shook things up when they were revealed:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">ウルトラビーストは、僕がそれまで杉森さんにNGを出されてきたデザインを思い出して、その理由を逆に利用しながらディレクションをした<br>なので僕の怨念の集合体みたいな側面もありましてこわいですね<br>杉森さんを憎んでいるということでは全然ないです</p>— 大村祐介 (@yusuke_omura) <a href="https://twitter.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018851331562500430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemons-ultra-beasts-were-based-on-past-pokemon-designs-rejected-by-game-freak-art-director-ken-sugimori-artist-reveals-thats-why-they-look-so-creepy/">Automaton</a>, we got a translation of his post, where he explained the Ultra Beasts were essentially based on designs for Pokémon that "were rejected by Mr. Sugimori." He talks about Ken Sugimori, who's been the primary character designer and art director on the iconic franchise for a long time. "I decided to deliberately use the very reasons for why they were rejected and base the artistic direction of the designs on them. So in some way, they’re like a manifestation of my own resentment– pretty scary," Omura added.</p>
<p>So there you have it: We were right to be put off by most of those designs. The news straight from the designer should also quell <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/qnmhbo/ultra_beasts_arent_just_from_a_different/">fan theories on the matter</a> which have been around since the games came out in 2016. It turns out most of them were right on the money.</p><p>Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the designs even if they were meant to represent totally different beings from another dimension, but at the same time, I appreciate Pokémon getting weird from time to time. Most of the valid recent criticisms of the franchise are about its fear of breaking new ground, and if you ask around now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1h0ub6a/why_did_people_hate_sun_and_moon_and_usum_when/">players are far more positive on Sun and Moon</a> than they were a decade ago. Maybe the fact they were actually polished products also has something to do with it, ey?</p>

            <p>Nintendo Switch Online members can now get their hands on two more classic Game Boy games.</p>
<p>The first of these games is puzzler Yoshi, developed by Game Freak of Pokémon fame, which sees players trying to help Mario liberate his dino-buddy from inside an egg he has been trapped inside. "Now it's raining Goombas, Bloopers, and Boo Buddies, and you have to help Mario stop the airborne invasion," reads the official blurb for Yoshi.</p>

<p>"As the critters fall, catch them on trays. Stack two of a kind and they both disappear, or capture the whole bunch in between eggshells. When the eggshells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The action heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. To save the day, switch and shuffle, and don't let your piles get too high!"</p>
<p>The second game is Balloon Kid, which casts players as Alice, a young girl who needs to rescue her brother Jim after he gets swept away by strong winds. "In the little town of Pencilvania, there lived a brother and sister who loved to play with balloons. Alice and her younger brother Jim would spend countless days filling the skies with their balloons. One day, Jim filled all of his balloons and tied them together to make a beautiful balloon rainbow across the sky. But suddenly, a strong wind came and carried Jim away," the game description teases.</p>
<p>As Alice, players will be able to float delightfully through eight stages, following Jim's balloon trail. Collecting balloons will earn player's bonus points.</p>

            <p>Two new cast members have been announced for the third season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation.</p>
<p>Clea DuVall and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. will both join the show for the upcoming season, which will be told from Abby's (played by Kaytlin Dever) perspective.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news/the-last-of-us-adds-clea-duvall-jorge-lendeborg-jr-takes-over-manny-role-in-season-3/ar-AA1VBnrx?ocid=BingNewsSerp">Deadline</a>, DuVall will play a member of the Seraphites, though further specifics are currently unknown. The Seraphites are one of the warring factions in The Last of Us Part 2, who frequently clash (putting it mildly) with the WLF, which Abby is a member of.</p>
<p>DuVall has had an extensive film and TV career, with recurring roles in the likes of Better Call Saul (pictured below), Heroes and The First Lady.</p>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Lendeborg Jr. will star as WLF member Manny in The Last of Us season three. He will replace Danny Ramirez, who played Manny in season two. Ramires was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-three-to-recast-manny">unable to return to the show due to scheduling conflicts</a>.</p>
<p>Other series with Lendeborg Jr. have included Wu-Tang: An American Saga and Graceland. He has also starred in Marvel films Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home.</p>
<p>As for Manny, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">when Ramirez was first announced to be joining The Last of Us</a>, the showrunners described his character as "a loyal soldier whose sunny outlook belies the pain of old wounds and a fear that he will fail his friends when they need him most".</p>

<p>It is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">suspected that the third season of The Last of Us will be its last</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer. While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> delivered more of what its passionate fans wanted, and for the most part, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-2026-roadmap-revealed">substantial 2026 roadmap</a> looks promising, but what about that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port that was <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/uh-oh-borderlands-4-is-delayed-indefinitely-on-switch-2-just-a-week-and-a-half-away-from-its-october-3-release">pushed aside at the last minute</a>?</p>
<p>Well, considering the performance issues plaguing the game (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-blames-borderlands-4s-softer-than-expected-sales-on-troublesome-pc-release-gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-insisted-was-pretty-damn-optimal">especially the PC version</a>) at launch and how heavy to run it continues to be, we weren't super optimistic about it coming out and <em>also </em>being stable enough. Mind you, the Switch 2 has been running <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">some genuinely impressive third-party ports</a> so far, but Borderlands 4 always felt like a tricky one to pull off.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/">Variety</a>, we're now learning Take-Two and Gearbox have "made the difficult decision to pause development" on the troubled port. Note how the exact word used here is "paused" and not "cancelled" (publishers aren't afraid of throwing the latter one around), but if you ask us, we're thinking it may never come out. In any case, a final decision hasn't been made. It appears that, right now, the focus is on "delivering quality post-launch content for players" and fixing what's broken on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Maybe that ongoing effort will reveal the answers needed to find a viable path forward for the Switch 2 port, but as it stands, Nintendo players are better off playing through <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-first-20-minutes-of-borderlands-2-gameplay-on-nintendo-switch">that excellent collection of the first few games for Switch 1</a> and the surprisingly decent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> port, which also runs steadier on Switch 2.</p><p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis also told Variety that, regardless of what happens with Borderlands 4, the plan is to continue to collaborate with Nintendo. Up next, the company is looking to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pga-tour-2k25-review">PGA Tour 2K25</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/wwe-2k26">WWE 2K26</a> on Switch 2.</p>

            <p>That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">Fallout Season 2</a> finale was quite good even if some subplots barely moved during the second set of eight episodes, I'd say. It also made many of us eager to see what comes next (especially the teased new setting). Diehard Fallout fans, however, maybe were paying more attention to the mystery countdown <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">on the show's interactive map site</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, we got no news on those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-crossover-mod-not-getting-remastered">long-rumoured Fallout 3 and New Vegas remasters</a>, which are reportedly a ways off at the time of writing, but Amazon and Bethesda's parting gift is cool nonetheless. It may even be a cheeky unofficial tease of things to come if you're very high on copium, like me.</p>
<p>The final icon on the top right part of the map was revealed to be <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#/penthouse">Mr. House's penthouse</a> at the top of New Vegas' iconic tower. Unless we're missing something, no Easter eggs related to the potential remasters are to be found, though we're sure the most dedicated fans are on the case as I type this.</p>
<p>Instead, it's more of a cool interactive extra for fans of both the show and the 2010 RPG; a 3D model of the well-known location as seen in the show (it's packing some upgrades and new secrets). Those who are familiar with the game will instantly notice this 3D render feels shinier and more detailed (and not live-action at all). I wouldn't go as far as to say this is an in-progress chunk from the rumoured remaster (remake?) for obvious reasons, but it could give us a solid idea of how a touched-up New Vegas may feel like.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Amazon MGM Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In any case, it's fun to see a big show's marketing returning to the early Internet days, where new movies and TV series were constantly promoted with neat interactive sites (and even flash games) on top of the more traditional promotional materials. If you find something else in this room, ping us, but we're just enjoying the vistas as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">we think about the show and game series' future</a>.</p>
<p>For now, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">Season 3 starts shooting soon-ish</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owners can look forward to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">port of Fallout 4</a> that should arrive in the near future.</p>

            <p>With two seasons and 16 episodes behind us, it's now quite easy to safely and confidently say that the smartest decision Bethesda and its TV production partner Kilter Films made was to ensure that Fallout's foray into the world of TV was canon to the games.</p>
<p>Fallout is, in a sense, built for this. Each entry in the series is pretty much standalone after all, only broadly connected by major events and the occasional cameo. The segregated nature of the vaults and the irradiated US supports this - each vault is unique, and though there are attempts at larger organisations, really each territory is its own pocket of chaos. Even so, it would've been easy to either make the show a separate universe entirely, or set it within the universe of the games but stay far away from the places, eras, and characters covered by the source material.</p>
<p>Like I say, the show's creatives made the right choice to <em>not</em> do that - but it was doubtless also the <em>hard</em> choice. That leaves you with more canonical detritus to trip over, for a start - and it makes the framework within which the show must exist tighter. Plus, this is a series where pretty much every game has multiple endings, all of which must be vaguely respected. The cost for doing this would be to potentially sully the universe itself, which is a precious golden goose. Plus, the hardcore fans that should be the show's biggest cheerleaders could quickly become a toxic drag on discourse around it.</p>

<p>Season 1 already toed the line pretty closely on this front, with revelations about the history of Vault-Tec that completely alter the way one might look at the games and the brutal off-screen destruction of a beloved location from the first two games. The second season goes further and harder, though. It's more bold and ambitious out of the gate. We knew this would be the case when the end of the first season teased New Vegas, really - if you're going to that city and the timeline is set <em>after</em> the game, some level of acknowledgement of what is arguably Fallout's best narrative must happen.</p><p>At first blush, Fallout's second season seems to struggle a little with the threads left from the first. Knight Maximus (Aaron Morten) is separated from the show's other main characters and feels a little like he's on a wheel-spinning side quest, even if he's surrounded by compelling and well-realised folk. This is a supremely well-cast show, and well-shot, too.</p>
<p>That fact draws you along through the first few episodes. Ultimately New Vegas proper is held back in what I will childishly call the House Edge until a few episodes in, with The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) and Lucy (Ella Purnell) gradually making their way there over multiple episodes. When they finally arrived, I felt that pang that the showrunners risked: vague disappointment at how a beloved game location was represented - familiar but decidedly not.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Amazon</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You have to trust the process, though. Over the course of the show, all of the decisions made do begin to justify themselves. By the end, your mind is positively buzzing with the opportunities and potential this season has set up, as well as with the implications of each of the revelations about the existing Fallout lore.</p><p>One can also sense a third party taking a look at the games through fresh eyes. For instance, Robert House is arguably one of the best characters the games have generated - so regardless of how the end of New Vegas played out, who wouldn't want <em>more</em> of him? The narrative is built to find a way to that conclusion. There's a few decisions like this, and there is a refreshing honesty to them.</p>
<p>This is where I think the choices made around the TV show's canonicity and its choice of subject material really lands. Even when the show is a little unsteady on its feet, it is doing things that ultimately only deepen my interest in, fan affinity for, and dedication to the Fallout universe. The risks it takes have made me into <em>more</em> of a fan, not less.</p>
<p>In the end I didn't feel this season was as strong as the first - I can easily see this later being viewed as a 'bridge' between the first and whatever comes next. But I nevertheless left it with a very familiar feeling - mind racing with the thoughts of what this all <em>means</em>. For the show, for the next game, for the series in general. Any tie-in or spin-off that can achieve that is a winner.</p>

            <p>Rockstar's highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will not feature any Generative AI.</p>
<p>That's coming from Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick, who assured the GTA community that the controversial tech has "zero part in what Rockstar is building".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Zelnick was talking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/strauss-zelnick-generative-ai-has-zero-part-in-what-rockstar-games-is-building-with-gta-6">Eurogamer's sister site gamesindustry.biz</a> ahead of Take-Two's Q3 financial results, when the topic of AI came up. The company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">he has "been enthusiastic" about AI from the beginning</a>, and Take-Two's "products have always been built with machine learning and artificial intelligence".</p>
<p>Zelnick called Take-Two a "leader in the space", with the company currently having "hundreds of pilots and implementations" across the board, and that includes "within our studios". He added the company has seen instances where generative AI tools are "driving costs and time efficiencies", though he does not believe these tools in isolation can "create great entertainment properties". </p>
<p>This is when the conversation turned to Rockstar and GTA 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-fans-in-disarray-as-release-date-clock-reset-following-gta6-release-day-delay">which is expected to debut on 19th November</a> (a date Zelnick remains confident about).</p>
<p>"Specifically with regards to GTA 6, Generative AI has zero part in what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> is building," Zelnick said, adding the studio's "worlds are handcrafted" and that is what sets it apart from other studios.</p>
<p>"They're built from the ground up, building by building, street by street, neighbourhood by neighbourhood. They're not procedurally generated, they shouldn't be," Zelnick stated. "That's what makes great entertainment."</p>

<p>Zelnick's words come soon after Take-Two saw its stock price plunge to an 11-month-low after Google rolled out Project Genie 3, an AI tool which allows users to generate virtual worlds in 60-second bursts from text prompts.</p>
<p>As Vikki reported at the weekend, several companies in addition to Take-Two - including CD Projekt, Unity and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - saw between 8-20 percent wiped off the value of their companies as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-companies-see-share-prices-plummet-following-the-launch-of-googles-very-limited-virtual-world-generator-project-genie">spooked investors seemingly went into the weekend thinking tech like this could replace the game development process</a>.</p>

<p>Zelnick responded to Variety: "That's not the plan" - a brief but sharp rebuttal of the prior reporting. So if you're keen on getting your actual hands on a copy of GTA6 day one, you should be in luck.</p>

            <p>When 2025 wrapped up, Obsidian's open-world fantasy RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Avowed</a> had been overlooked on many end-of-year lists. Despite garnering <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/avowed/">favourable reviews</a> overall and delivering a type of Elder Scrolls-inspired experience that stands on its own, it wasn't a massive hit. Later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-2-review">The Outer Worlds 2</a> landed with similar results. Meanwhile, the mostly continuist survival crafting adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-wobbles-while-walking-a-line-between-frustration-and-brilliance">Grounded 2</a> was enjoying lots of success.</p>
<p>According to Feargus Urquhart, head of Obsidian Entertainment, a lot can be learned from the studio's busy 2025 and the end results. Jason Schreier's latest for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">Bloomberg</a> reveals what him and other prominent figures at the company have to say. About last year's RPG behemoths, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the veteran openly explained: "They're not disasters... I'm not going to say this was a kick in the teeth. It was more like: 'That sucks. What are we learning?'"</p>
<p>Of course, there's an immediate read to be made after two triple-A giants failed to meet their targets and a scrappy, still-in-early-access survival crafting game landed Obsidian a big win. Urquhart says this situation has pushed the studio to "think a lot about how much we put into the games, how much we spend on them, how long they take." In the case of Avowed, the game ended up taking "nearly seven years" to put together, with a reboot to pivot away from making a mix of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny">Destiny</a> (multiplayer included) happening two years into the creative process. "I don't think there’s a team on the planet that could execute on this," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> director Josh Sawyer stated.</p>
<p>While the press and gamers alike have been saying for a while the Western games industry should course-correct back into a more sustainable model, that kind of huge change doesn't happen overnight, especially if those at the top want bigger returns. "I don't think anybody really likes five-, six-, seven-year dev cycles," added Brandon Adler, director of The Outer Worlds 2. I'm now thinking about Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> for no reason.</p>

<p>In spite of everything, Obsidian, has managed (so far) to succeed where many have failed under the scrutiny of Microsoft's Xbox division... which is also under pressure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-push-for-high-xbox-profit-margins-behind-job-cuts-publishing-on-playstation-and-cancellation-of-projects-like-perfect-dark-claims-report">as the tech giant demands better profit margins</a>. The trick might be a good cadence of releases since the acquisition happened back in late 2018. With easy wins on a budget like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pentiment-review-a-sixteenth-century-mystery-that-blossoms-with-intrigue-and-human-warmth">Pentiment</a> or the two Grounded games, it's easy to offset the bigger disappointments. "You need to keep having at-bats, because at some point, if you can consistently make good stuff, you'll get those breakout hits," said Marcus Morgan, VP of Operations at Obsidian.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">full piece</a> is well worth a read and shines some light on Obsidian's past, present, and future. It's hard to predict what might be next for its veteran teams, but personally, I'd say news about a more realistic vision for the RPG maker are encouraging.</p>

            <p>Funcom has released Chapter 3 for Dune Awakening today, bringing with it a host of new experiences and gameplay overhauls for players to enjoy. But can this update, described as the "biggest" the game has ever seen, reignite the excitement seen around it's launch?</p>
<p>Let's dive into what's been added to the game with Chapter 3. There's an increase on faction levels, allowing those who complete missions with their chosen faction to gain additional levels. The Landsraad endgame has been revamped too, allowing players to choose a Great House to complete missions for, which should invigorate the system somewhat.</p>
<p>There's also a specialisation system added to the game. Earning XP progresses you through a chosen specialisation, allowing players to pick a playstyle and dedicate themselves to it. Explorers can choose a path and be rewarded with unlocks that better serve that playstyle, such as traits and technologies.</p>

<p>These technologies include augmentations, which can be added to tier 6 armour to increase their power further. Schematics for these can be found in new Testing Stations added to the game, and augmented gear can be freely traded among players to encourage more interaction between players pursuing different progression paths, though some work on the crafting specialisation is needed to make these.</p><p>There are also new missions to complete, new locations on the Overland map, a removal of water and fuel requirements when traveling across the Overland map, and five new challenge locations for players to test their mettle and progress through Landsraad challenges. There are also five new Testing Stations to explore, and a new major story chapter for narrative-focused players to dive into.</p>
<p>As for combat, two new weapons have been added: the Pyrorocket and dual-wielded knives. The rapier, an original weapon type, has also been totally reworked with new attacks and defensive abilities.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who lapsed from the game and found their base taxed to ruins, these base taxes have been totally removed. Power requirements for bases are still required to maintain your digital home-away-from-home, but the money drain is no longer an issue. A new suite of cosmetics rewards have been added, as well as a returning player package to help people get back into the swing of things.</p>
<p>Finally, the deep desert has been changed once again. The shield wall has been moved further up to make those initial segments safer to explore, and ramps have been added to make ground vehicle travel more tenable.</p>
<p>Is this enough to tempt you back into Dune Awakening? Let us know!</p>

            <p>Amazon really seems to be knocking it out of the park with the casting for its live-action God of War series.</p>
<p>It was recently announced that Alastair Duncan has been cast as the wise Mimir, whose head Kratos often wears around his waist. If you think Duncan's name sounds familiar, that's because he also voiced Mimir in 2018's God of War and its sequel, Ragnarök.</p>

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As well as Duncan, actors Danny Woodburn and Jeff Gulka have been cast as God of War's talented blacksmith brothers, Brok and Sindri.</p>
<p>Woodburn is a veteran actor with a track record of appearing in numerous fantasy series, such as Conan the Adventurer, The Witcher, Charmed and Willow. If you're a Seinfeld fan, however, you likely know him best as the recurring character Mickey Abbott. Gulka, meanwhile, starred as Gibson Praise on The X-Files and as Charlie in Stargate-SG1, to name just two.</p>
<p>You can read the character descriptions for Mimir, Sindri and Brok (thanks, <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-alastair-duncan-mimir-brok-sindri-1236645903/">Variety</a>) below:</p>
<p><strong>Mimir:</strong> Mimir is a cheery fellow from Celtic lands with an expansive intellect, a quick wit and a good head on his shoulders. Never at a loss for words, Mimir is the self-described "Smartest Man in the World". He served as an advisor to Odin the All-Father, who ultimately banished Mimir to confinement in the trunk of a tree, forever cut off from the people he loves and anything that could nourish his mind. In the wake of his banishment, Mimir seeks atonement for the terrible deeds he committed in the All-Father's name.</p><p><strong>Brok:</strong> Brok is a legendary dwarven blacksmith who was alienated from his community when he helped build a super-weapon. He is brash, irreverent, and gruff – the complete opposite of his uptight brother and fellow blacksmith, Sindri, with whom he has a contentious relationship. Gamers will know Brok as the beloved weapons dealer with an unrivaled artistry for creative, foul-mouthed curses.</p>
<p><strong>Sindri:</strong> Sindri is a renowned dwarven blacksmith whose incredible weaponry is sought after across the realms. Neurotic, helpful, and extremely germophobic, Sindri is the complete opposite of his cranky, foul-mouthed brother and business partner, Brok.</p>

<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>As good as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' first 2026 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shares-early-2026-roadmap-escalation-content-updates">roadmap</a> looks, one of the latest crazes in the online extraction shooter has nothing to do with hunting down other players or banding together against the oppressive robotic threat. People are collecting rubber ducks, <em>lots of them</em>.</p>
<p>Why focus on meaningless rubber loot over everything else? Let me preface this by saying everyone loves to find an excellent gun or blueprint, but upgraded stashes have a fun side effect which is that you can show off your favourite loot <a href="https://deltiasgaming.com/arc-raiders-how-to-customise-your-raider-den/">in the raider's room</a>. Embark Studios has also added <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Duck_Locations:_Bird_City_Guide">collectible rubber ducks that you can find all over</a>, making them the perfect collectibles. It reminds me of the short period when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/xbaqik/people_really_like_the_moai_head_huh/">everyone was putting moais inside their lockers in Splatoon 3</a>. Hilarious stuff.</p>
<p>You know an online game has <em>the juice</em> when players start wholesome trends like these and don't spend all their time optimizing the fun out of it. Embark appears to aware of this saga, so <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2018656701893738739?s=20">Arc Raiders' latest update</a>, pushed on 3rd February, makes the Bird City map condition for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Buried_City">Buried City</a> more common.</p>
<p>What does this mean exactly and how does it connect to the coveted rubber birds? Well, the new map condition dropped after the Cold Snap event which covered Speranza in snow. As part of the return to normalcy, birds are flocking back to the Buried City, and you can often queue into the Bird City version of it, which has more feathered animals and boosted loot rates; look for nests on top of chimneys too.</p><p>Birds (the real ones) aren't your friends though. Like in other open-world games with strong stealth elements, they'll fly away in large groups when approached and in response to loud noises. You can imagine why this is a problem in a game where everyone and everything on the surface can kill you in an instant.</p>
<p>Rubber ducks are part of the boosted loot during this map condition, however, so the new "for funsies" meta is raiding the Buried City over and over again to snatch all the different toys as if they were Arc Raiders' version of limited-edition Funko Pops... or Tubbz.</p>
<p>In any case, it's heartwarming to see players chasing anything other than endgame loot and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you">more high risk, high reward experiences</a> inside a game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">as tense as Arc Raiders</a>. Maybe we can take Scrappy the Rooster topside soon, too. Let's start pitching that.</p>

            <p>Epic has released its usual stream of annual stats for the Epic Games Store, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-still-biggest-game-in-the-world-but-playtime-dropped-in-2025">a big increase in third-party spending and a confirmation of a notable drop in Fortnite playtime</a>. But alongside that the publisher-developer, engine-maker and storefront owner is also promising some major improvements to the oft-maligned store itself.</p>
<p>The headline improvements come in the form of much better speed, more features - noticeably social ones from player to player - and a cross-platform library between your PC and your mobile phone.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of things we need to fix," admitted Epic Games Store vice president and general manager Steven Allison said, during an interview with Eurogamer. "We have needed to fix them for years. We've been really focused on developer tooling and all the things we do there. But last year, we finally started to point more of our resources towards player experience stuff, all the things that our players have needed, wanted, and all critics rightfully take us to task on.</p>
<p>"We got a lot of stuff out the door last year, and this year is going to be probably the best year for that stuff on the 'big rocks'. And the big rocks are: the launcher sucks. Let's call it what it is. It's really slow," he continued.</p><p>"It makes calls to our back-end services to refresh every time you click around, and depending on your connection, you'll have to wait a couple seconds. And that just doesn't feel good, especially when people are comparing and contrasting and dual using one that doesn't do that."</p>
<p>Work on the architecture started in November 2025, he says, and is making "great progress. We're basically pulling the guts out, putting new guts in." Those speed improvements should appear for players around May or June, according to Allison, and Epic's official press release states "this summer".</p>
<p>"It should start to feel good, be faster and people be like, 'Holy shit. It doesn't suck so much.' And that will be a win for us."</p>
<p>It was a pretty candid acknowledgement from Allison, who seems well aware of the criticisms Epic has faced for its user experience. Another of those, in the Epic Games Store's lack of functionality compared to its main rivals such as Steam, is also now finally being addressed. He went on, "We have no social framework in the store, like other stores - even console platforms - [which] have the ability to communicate with your friends, and we just kind of stripped that out during Covid and never brought it back."</p><p>As a result, Epic is set to bring 'community spaces' to the Epic Games Store, adding avatars, player profiles and private messaging to cross-platform text chat, and adding voice chat and game independent parties from Q2 this year (Allison noted this is coming in May, to be precise). A cross-platform library will come in the autumn, along with new 'library management' functionality, region-specific storefronts, and a launch of the store on iOS in Japan in March and Brazil in June.</p>
<p>All this marks the first proper step towards addressing some of the many player-facing issues that have been raised by users over the years, from those lacking social functions to wider community features such as user reviews. One more that's set to arrive per Allison, that should go down especially well amongst internet users of a specific age missing the bygone era of static, non-instant-messaging communication: "a kind of forum-type experience," as he put it, which is set to arrive in test form later this year.</p>
<p>The prevailing question at this point is: what's taken the company, by no means short on resources, so long to pull these seemingly foundational features together?</p>
<p>Allison's answer was that it was "a two-sided marketplace," and "super complicated and hard" at first, as the store's sheer number of users on launch - approximately 30m users in the first 14 months - meant primarily focusing on the developer side. "We've got to get developers in the door, they are not going to deal with a back end where we have to do everything manually with them," and so "we really focused on that because free games was so powerful at the beginning," as an incentive to get the players to match the developers.</p><p>The store itself, Allison is keen to mention during our conversation, was ultimately launched as the "tip of the spear" for getting developers to a much higher revenue share of 88 percent to 12 percent, vs. Steam's infamous 30 percent cut (something currently the subject of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/14m-steam-users-could-receive-compensation-after-uk-rules-valve-case-can-proceed">£656m consumer lawsuit here in the UK</a>).</p>
<p>"It isn't that we ignored it," Allison said, "but we had to get out of the super manual onboarding of important titles. We had to build the tools for self-publishing, and that took us, like, almost three years. It was a major focus of our engineering."</p>
<p>At the same time, Allison seemed very much cognizant of the issues players have had with the storefront. Now, the company is spending "the majority of our engineering time, focus and capacity on player facing features that we know we have to get to," he said.</p>
<p>"The criticism is all fair…" he continued. Citing a particularly blunt subreddit. "r/fuckepic - there are people that feel that way, and we respect that. But we know the players are going to be happy when those features show up, and we just gotta knock them out.</p><p>"And so I hope, like, two years from now, we're not really having this conversation anymore. The multi platform stuff is cool, the social stuff maybe is better than anyone's doing." The goal, within that period, is that Epic is no longer "in a deficiency [compared] to expected features."</p>
<p>"We're trying to attack all the big buckets of things that are fair criticisms, and we have to do the work. We just have to do the work."</p>

            <p>Microsoft has revealed the first batch of games coming to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service this February.</p>

<ul>
<li>Madden NFL 26 (Cloud, Console, and PC) – February 5, now with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass.</li>
<li>Paw Patrol Rescue Wheels: Championship (Cloud, Console, Handheld, and PC) – February 5, now withGame Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass.</li>

</figure>
<p>There's a lot of bangers in that list, as well as some day-one Game Pass launches that are certainly worth checking out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-2-given-february-2026-release-date-and-confirmed-for-xbox-game-pass">High on Life 2 is a big new release this month</a>, with skateboarding as a major new addition to the typical humour-focused FPS gameplay.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">You've got Kingdom Come Deliverance</a>, the historical RPG that kicked off the story of Henry and his rough and rowdy quest across Bohemia. It received a critically acclaimed sequel last year, but if you've not played the original now may be the perfect time to do so.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">There's also Avowed</a>, the latest big-budget RPG by Obsidian Entertainment. A first-person action RPG with a lot of love poured into it, it's perhaps the polar opposite to Kingdom Come Deliverance, but matches it in terms of quality. A big month for RPG fans for certain.</p>
<p>As with all prior months, Game Pass is also waving goodbye to a number of games. This month, it's just <em>Madden NFL 24</em>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> keeps on rolling following its long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-reduced-installation-size">downsize of the PC installation size</a>. After a generous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-warbond-adds-hammer-new-explosive-weapons-teases-new-enemy-faction">tease</a> last week, the Siege Breakers warbond plus the heavy Bastion Tank are now in the game.</p>
<p>As promised, 3rd February was the date in which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/506226349467240138?l=english">Patch 6.0.1</a> dropped. According to the in-universe live narrative, the Automaton Collective has stolen the schematics for the big superweapon Star of Peace. Thus, the mighty forces of Super Earth must break the robot resistance on its "own turf." Does that ring a bell? <em>Are we the baddies?</em></p>
<p>It doesn't really matter, as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have been given new tools of destruction that will be used to spread democracy across the cosmos, whether the xenos want it or not. As the tip of the spear in this update, we have the Helldivers 1 classic <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Helldivers_1:TD-110_Bastion">Bastion Tank</a>, which offers scary firepower and high defence perfect to endure the most brutal enemy onslaughts. It'd been on many wishlists for months, so longtime fans will be happy to get their hands on it finally.</p>
<p>The Siege Breakers premium warbond (which you can farm for free as always) adds the bulk of new hard-hitting weaponry, with the LAS-16 Trident gun making a return, a huge hammer with explosive charges packing some pop, and the GL-28 Grenade Launcher and EAT-411 Leveller stratagems filling the scorched battlefields with grenade barrages and high-yield missiles respectively.</p>

<p>As always, plenty of cosmetics are also part of the non-rotating battle pass, as FOMO isn't part of Helldivers 2's language. The new melee weapon specifically may be the most fun to use, as melee damage has now been increased across the board to shake things up.</p><p>Additionally, plenty of regular guns have received changes to sway and other core stats, and victory poses and emotes are now interchangeable. Last but not least, a premium War Horse cosmetic set is now confirmed to arrive on 10th February through the Superstore if you need new preem swag.</p>
<p>It's all impressive and an excellent start to 2026, but Chinese-speaking players are probably celebrating the arrival of a complete Chinese voiceover to the game over everything else. If you've been plagued by instability following recent patches, more fixes have been included in this update as well, but it may take a while to check whether they're having the intended effect or not.</p>

            <p>Speaking to Eurogamer, Grasshopper Manufacture co-founder and Romeo is a Dead Man director Goichi Suda (also known as Suda 51) has spoken more about his opinions of generative AI in game development, after previous statements indicating the technology wouldn't be used in the upcoming action game.</p>
<p>Eurogamer asked Suda on whether the Romeo is a Dead Man people will play in a few days would be as good, or artistic, a game if generative AI were used in its development, he responded with the following:</p>
<p>"For me personally, a lot of the AI stuff I see pops up on social media. As far as it's come, there's something about the images and videos you see that feels off. Most people have that same kind of sense, something psychological lets you know something isn't right here. Something's kinda funky.</p>

<p>"They've been saying the day will come when AI will fool people, when you won't know something is AI. That may be true, but honestly, I don't think it has reached those levels yet. When I see something made with generative AI something in the back of my brain gets set off.</p><p>"If I used AI to make Romeo: A.) it would have been a fake Romeo. Not that he was a real person to begin with, but people would notice something shallow about the character. He would be hard to relate to, and kind of creepy.</p>
<p>"And, B.) The way we make games now, the specific skills of the studio and people we know, be it practical effects, art, creating graphics on their own… those skills and passion the humans put into their works comes across to players. It's something people can feel, not just that it was person-made not AI-made, but you can tell someone poured their heart into this. Someone worked hard to make this happen."</p>
<p>When asked about his previous statements, and how he felt about Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association survey last year which found <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese developers were using the technology in some form</a>, Suda emphasised he didn't have strong feelings on it, and shared his belief that wider use of the technology would depend on player wants.</p>
<p>He also revealed that, at one point, Netease had a research section looking into generative AI, but eventually shuttered it for reasons Suda couldn't confirm for certain. He did, however, have his theories.</p>
<p>"As far as not using any AI for our games, it started as a Netease policy for all their companies," Suda said. "They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all."</p><p>Suda, when asked why exactly the section shut down, shared his own assumptions. "I don't know, they never explained directly why. If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Epic Games has released a series of new figures today as part of a "year in review" lookback on Steam storefront rival, Apple lawsuit bane, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> forever-maker the Epic Games Store - and there are some interesting stats in the mix.</p>
<p>The headline figure, of a few, is that the Epic Games Store hit a total of 6.65bn gameplay hours in games launched via the store - a number that is down noticeably year-on-year, by 14 percent. But third-party gameplay hours - that is, time spent playing games that aren't Fortnite or any other published by Epic - were up by 4 percent to 2.78bn. Between the lines then, that suggests a fairly notable drop in first-party games' playtime, specifically that of Fortnite, with the wildly popular battle royale-cum-crossover platform still the top game on the store overall.</p>
<p>"That's the logical conclusion on hours [played]," Epic Games Store's vice president and general manager, Steve Allison, confirmed to Eurogamer during a brief interview on the figures. "But you've got to remember Fortnite's coming off one of its best years ever on PC," he added, noting that "relative to the state of the industry," it was still "outpacing" a lot of other games. Fortnite "still remains the biggest game in the world on many fronts," he added, while conceding that "the conclusion is fair and accurate" that it had seen a noticeable drop compared to 2024, enough to offset the rest of the store's growth.</p>
<p>Another key stat from the review details player spending - a tad businessy, maybe, but something that makes for interesting reading amongst the ongoing debate on live service games and, frankly, the future sustainability of the industry as a whole. There, third-party games saw a huge increase in spending, up by 57 percent to $400m. For context, Epic had what Allison called a "down year" in 2024, where the equivalent spending was $255 million, 18 percent down on 2023's figure of $310m, which also makes last year's increase especially large.</p><p>The reasonable guess as to what drove that would be the rising popularity of 'gacha' games, such as Kuro Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a> and MiHoYo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai Star Rail</a>, on the store. Epic puts Wuthering Waves, Honkai, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> in its top five, 'mythic'-rated top games rankings, alongside staples Fortnite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, and their relatively aggressive monetisation, centred on gachapon vending machine-style loot boxes, would suggest that's where the big spending growth is coming from.</p>
<p>"Obviously MiHoYo does really well here, and has chosen to be exclusive here" Allison said, "but they are not the lion's share of the spending on the store." Instead, Allison claimed the spending was "pretty dispersed across third-party games." Notably, other high-ranking games on the store continue to be live services with significant microtransactions, such as EA Sports FC 26, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Infinity Nikki.</p>
<p>There was also another record set, in total monthly active users playing Epic Game Store games in December 2025, with 78m logged-on, presumably tying in with the usual flurry of holiday freebies and sales - but again that's offset, this time over the wider year's average. Monthly active users were down 1 percent to 67m on average, and daily active users down 2 percent to 31m.</p>
<p>Those free games meanwhile have now ticked over the 100 mark, with 662m free games claimed, Epic putting the total value of those - presumably at full retail price - at $2,316 per player.</p>
<p>Finally, Epic also announced some relatively big plans for the Epic Game Store in terms of new features this year, including social functionality that "maybe is better than anyone's doing," Allison said. Expect much more on those, and the wider player opinion of the Epic Games Store, from us here very soon.</p>

            <p>Romeo is a Dead Man is nearly here at last, bringing the world another hyper-violent action game with a quirky hero and out-of-this-world narrative. It stands as the latest work from the collective minds of Suda 51 and his peers at Netease-owned Grasshopper Games, emitting that same strong Suda-signal as beloved prior works like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a> or Killer is Dead.</p>
<p>But what inspired this space-faring adventure? To find out, Eurogamer sat down for a chat with Suda 51 during his visit to the UK, translated directly by Grasshopper Games community manager James R. Mountain.</p>
<p>The topics discussed vary, between inspirations for Romeo is a Dead Man and how a cancelled project called Zombie Rider lives on in this latest release, what defines Grasshopper and Suda 51' signature style, a particularly gruesome face-melting game over screen, generative AI, and 'Jazz Band' game development. You can read the interview in full, below.</p>

<p><strong>What were your inspirations when creating Romeo is a Dead Man? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: There were actually a lot of inspirations when making the game. The first is Zombie movies, back in the 1960's there was Night of the Living Dead. I can't remember the director's name, but there's 28 Days Later. Another thing was, when you look at the relationship between Romeo Stargazer and his grandfather Ben, that was inspired by both Back to the Future and, obviously, a lot of Rick &amp; Morty.</p>
<p><strong>How did you land on Romeo's design? That kind of horrific spin on a cool action-protagonist?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: Some time ago I was planning a game called Zombie Rider, which would feature a guy that was half-human, half-zombie. Depending on the situation, you could switch back-and-forth between those two modes, changing what he could do. He had a motorcycle and he'd ride around taking on other zombies. That never came to fruition, but it's something I had in the back of my head.</p><p>I decided, okay instead of going for Zombie Rider, how about I go for what we have now in Romeo, where the character is half-dead. I started off with the ideas from Zombie Rider, tweaked it, and added Romeo's grandfather Ben using the Dead Gear to bring him back to life. There were originally going to be five different kinds of masks for Romeo, that you could swap out to throughout the game. Now it's been cut down to two.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to cut down from five masks to two?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: Mainly due to schedule reasons. The designs were really specific and detailed, and it would have taken too much time to flesh them all out.</p>
<p><strong>How would you say that Grasshopper Manufacture's - and your own! - style has evolved over the years? What do you think a Grasshopper game is today?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: When we started out we were a small team, we did text-based games. From there on, we designed more story-focused games, action games… I guess we're not an adventure game-specialised studio, but it's what we're best at, it's what we're doing a lot recently. There have been a lot of changes to Grasshopper as a studio, where we've had bigger teams at times, smaller teams at times. In general, we've had that core team of 10-12 people, with others that come and go to help out with various aspects of game development.</p><p>But it's hard for me to say what my style, or Grasshopper style, is. It's hard for me to look at it objectively. We get called a lot of things, and have a lot of labels put on us. A lot of people say we're a 'punk-style' studio. That sounds kind of cool so I'm happy to hear that. In an interview yesterday one of our interviewers said for a while I was referred to as a "maverick of game development"! Honestly, I thought that sounded really cool once I had the word explained to me. Not only does it sound like Tom Cruise in Top Gun, or whatever, it sounds like the way we try to develop games and function as a studio.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to call myself Tom Cruise or anything, but hopefully the studio can become something as cool as Maverick.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Over the years I think it's safe to say you've grown a fanbase that loves your particular style, both in terms of the tone in these games and the artistic approach. Like, in Romeo is a Dead Man, there's this really horrid, fantastic Game Over screen where Romeo's face melts off.</strong></p><p><strong>Suda</strong>: That's a practical effect actually! As far as the 'Grasshopper style' goes, when most developers create a game, you've got certain guidelines or ideas on what a game will be: what characters it'll have, what features it'll have. You fill that in and work from there - you colour inside the lines. We don't really do that at Grasshopper. Personally, I've never really done that. It's obviously important to know what you're making, but instead of having a set-in-stone blueprint, we have a more 'adlib development' style.</p>
<p>We'll have a couple basic ideas for the game, like who the main character will be, and we'll start from there. We'll have meetings with different members of staff and riff off each other. "If we have this, why don't we also have this? Or what about this to contrast it? In that case, let's remove this!" That way, a lot of things change when we're making a game. A lot of times when we have new staff coming in, at first they're confused! They go, aren't you meant to have this stuff figured out already?</p>
<p>Again, in game development it's important to know what you're doing. To some degree we have that, but that's not the way we make games. It's more like a jam session in a jazz band. Different people putting ideas together, stuff they came up with on the spot. It seems to work for us, I'd say that's the most Grasshopper-specific thing that plays into a Grasshopper style.</p>
<p><strong>And this allows the freedom to pursue these wilder ideas?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: Yeah, it definitely does give us some degree of freedom to implement ideas from out of nowhere, to change things here and there. At the same time, it does make things more difficult. I get bitched at a lot by our production team. They'll be like 'Hey man, we were doing this, and now we have to do this instead? We've got to consider schedules and stuff like that'. So it can make work harder for other staff members, and myself, as well. But that freedom stops us from being stuck in a blueprint if we feel something will make a game better, regardless of what point of development we may be in.</p>
<p><strong>Was that melting face one such example?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: The general idea was something I had pretty early on, I wanted to have Romeo's face melting. We originally wanted to do that in real time, but we found out quickly that was pretty much impossible. So we tried exploring other options: using animation, different kinds of CGI, but nothing really felt right.</p><p>One day, I was talking to our art director, and he said he had a friend who worked in special effects make-up in movies, practical effects stuff. We asked if his friend could so the face melting, like in Raiders of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>, and he was like 'yeah sure!'</p>
<p>We went over, tried some stuff out, and did a trial run first. It looked perfect, it didn't spring off half-way through. A day later, we did the second run and he nailed it.</p>

<p><strong>Ahead of this game's release, you said there would be no generative AI used in the development of Romeo is a Dead Man. Last year, Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association surveyed Japanese game developers and found that over half were using generative AI to create their games.  How do you feel about that?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda</strong>: As far as not using any AI for our games, it started as a Netease policy for all their companies. They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all.</p>
<p>As for Grasshopper ourselves, we never did any research into AI. It's hard to say… I don't have an extremely strong opinion on other people using it in their games one way or another. I think it'll come down to the future, is there going to be a point where gamers think generative AI gets really cool, and they want to see more of it? If it comes to that point, then I might not be opposed if it's what everyone wants, we can look into it.</p>
<p>Right now, we just don't use it. We have no interest in it. It's kind of hard to make a solid statement on how I feel about the industry, to be honest I don't have the knowledge-base to comment on it.</p>
<p><strong>We just spoke about a cool development story where someone with real-world practical effects experience added something unique to your game, something maybe you could try to imitate with gen AI, but is at its best with actual skill. Do you think Romeo is a Dead Man could be the game it is today through the use of this technology?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda</strong>: For me personally, a lot of the AI stuff I see pops up on social media. As far as it's come, there's something about the images and videos you see that feels off. Most people have that same kind of sense, something psychological lets you know something isn't right here. Something's kinda funky.</p>
<p>They've been saying the day will come when AI will fool people, when you won't know something is AI. That may be true, but honestly, I don't think it has reached those levels yet. When I see something made with generative AI something in the back of my brain gets set off.</p>
<p>If I used AI to make Romeo: A.) it would have been a fake Romeo. Not that he was a real person to begin with, but people would notice something shallow about the character. He would be hard to relate to, and kind of creepy.</p>
<p>And, B.) The way we make games now, the specific skills of the studio and people we know, be it practical effects, art, creating graphics on their own… those skills and passion the humans put into their works comes across to players. It's something people can feel, not just that it was person-made not AI-made, but you can tell someone poured their heart into this. Someone worked hard to make this happen.</p><p>At some point there may be this thing I've heard be called the "New Reality", but even if it does get to that point and it's really good and realistic, I feel humans have something in their brain that tells them something is off. So while I don't have a strict opinion either way on people using it in their own games, that's not the way we do it. That's one of the things that bring people to Grasshopper games - they can feel people's efforts themselves. It's something we're proud of.</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>You mentioned Netease closed their AI research section?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: I don't know, they never explained directly why. If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly.</p>
<p><strong>At this point you've created a collection of games over the years, all with their own dedicated audiences. What's left on your bucket list?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: There are about five in particular, but ten overall, projects that I've been cooking up for a while. Those are the ones I want to do in my lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Final question. After people play Romeo is a Dead Man, what games should people check out?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Suda</strong>: There's a game people are probably already familiar with but they should check out, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-story">Skate Story</a>. That's a really cool game, and I'd like more people to play that. There's another studio we hooked up with at Gamescom in Germany last year - Slow Bros. They made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/harold-halibut">Harold Halibut</a>. Last year the creator of this game lent us a PC for Gamescom, and he invited us to his studio. Super cool guys. I believe he's working on a new game at the moment ,so when it comes out I hope people play it!</p>

<p>Romeo is a Dead Man releases on the 11th February to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-virtual-boy</link>
            <guid>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-virtual-boy</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-virtual-boy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>Under a year ago, I purchased a Virtual Boy. I did so for two reasons: the first was to fill a curious little gap in my video game collection. The second and main reason was in service of a stupid joke: Nintendo had told us that there'd be no <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> consoles for media ahead of launch day, and so in order to have a 'day one review', I decided to review <em>another</em> Nintendo portable. It was an expensive gag.</p>
<p>I was glad I did it, in the end. As that article went on to explain, the Virtual Boy in practice was just <em>more</em> than its reputation as a weird, headache-inducing failure might suggest. It perhaps shouldn't be surprising that even a less-successful Nintendo product is nevertheless wildly <em>interesting</em> at the very least - and is home to some pretty great games.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I've sort of expected we might get a revival of the Virtual Boy for a little bit now. I was always surprised that VB titles never got a run-out as downloadable titles for the Nintendo 3DS - but perhaps, indeed, the Switch is a better fit. The real clue this was a goer came when Nintendo opened its museum and proudly featured the Virtual Boy prominently as one of its main console releases, complete with slews of VB merchandise. I figured there was no shame or desire to bury the thing. And if that is the case, why not pedal its library on Nintendo Switch Online's emulated suite of classic games? So it came to pass.</p>
<p>At a recent event held in Nintendo's European HQ, the Virtual Boy was off to the side - not exactly part of the main timed flow of the event, but something you could hop on for a few minutes and check out at your leisure. That makes sense, for this is not something that you need a lengthy amount of time with. You take a look at the hardware, you stick your face in the goggles, and, well.. That's it, really.</p><p>The question for me was always going to be how well the Switch implementation was going to be able to fully represent the original Virtual Boy experience. This is not a console that has typically emulated well. On normal screens, VB games tend to just look like an absolute sea of red - indeed they <em>are</em> an absolute sea of red, but on the proper hardware there's shades, layering, and a general nuance that I have never seen properly depicted anywhere but on the original hardware. It's this modulation and subtlety that makes playing these games bearable - so it was crucial that Nintendo's Switch implementation get that right.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to report that it does. Playing Wario Land or the head-spinning 3D Tetris, everything looks as I remember. Layers, subtle shades, and depth all properly intact. I'll be curious to see what others make of it - chatting to others present on the day, out of the many media in the room I came to the conclusion that only myself and one other person had ever played the original hardware before - but I was more than sufficiently pleased with the new emulated version. It looks right, it feels right - the way the Switch's speakers are sort of channeled to you by the headset means the sound functions similarly… it all just works.</p>

<p>The only thing that doesn't work is the 'automatic pause', which the Virtual Boy used to trigger if you pulled out of the headset in order to interact with another human or stick your face in a sick bag. Whatever sensor is used to detect that isn't present, so you will have to pause things manually even if you turn the automatic pause 'on' in the settings of each game. The rest, though, is as I remember it.</p><p>It works because of the hardware, of course. In order to play the Virtual Boy games you'll need not just a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, but also a shell within which you place your Switch console to essentially recreate the unique form factor of the original hardware. This makes it the first NSO console to truly require an additional investment - but given how unique and weird the original machine is, I think that's fine. It has also allowed Nintendo to set up the emulation knowing exactly how you'll be playing - which I presume is what has resulted in such an accurate experience.</p>
<p>What I can't be clear on is how the £17 cardboard version of the add-on works, as I didn't get to test that. We'll find out soon, when everything hits store shelves. I can report that the £67 'full fat' version is a very accurate 1:1 representation of the original, right down to now-useless non-functioning buttons and sliders across the top. Since the picture adjustment takes place inside the emulator, those serve no purpose here - but the important thing remains that the end result feels accurate and correct.</p>

<div>



<p>This is the accessory (not the cheaper cardboard one) for Switch, what Tetris looks like on the VB, and the original hardware and games.</p>

</div>

<p>The level of faithfulness does mean that the Virtual Boy's foibles are present. This is a machine where you prop it up on a desk and then crane down into it like you're a lab technician stooped over the world's most stupid-looking microscope. It's hard to get comfortable. It wasn't long before my neck started to hurt. There's no strap, and the hardware is arguably too heavy to 'wear' anyway. But in many ways I am glad of this: that, after all, is what the Virtual Boy <em>is</em>. This presentation replicates it fully, warts and all.</p><p>If I have one minor criticism, it's this: I love the Virtual Boy controller, and I'm sad that unlike the NES, SNES, N64, and GameCube, Nintendo didn't choose to reissue that pad - the most ergonomic bit of the original hardware - here. On the flip side, I respect that Nintendo probably quite appreciated that it was already asking people for as much as seventy quid to play this thing - so I get it.</p>
<p>Are you likely to find your new favourite game in this library of crimson classics? Probably not. Is it going to become a staple, a must-have for Switch owners? No. Will anyone under the age of thirty even care? I doubt it. But it's a wonderful little history lesson, I'm thrilled it is as accurate as it is, and it absolutely deserves to exist.</p>
<p>64DD next, yeah? I need SimCity 64 in the west for the first time.</p>

            <p>It appears that the press kit for Ubisoft's cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> would have included a collectible dagger.</p>
<p>A video which allegedly shows off this collectible was recently shared online, with the dagger being unpacked from a wooden box with Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake markings.</p>

<p>The purported Sands of Time dagger itself, meanwhile, featured a golden painted hilt and iridescent resin-looking blade (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-collectible-dagger-looks-to-have-popped-up-in-an-unboxing-video-days-after-games-cancelation">IGN</a>). As well as the dagger, this unboxing video (which you can see below) included a display stand within the box, which again had the game's name written across it in gold writing.</p>
<p>While this dagger is, for now, only an alleged collectible for Ubisoft's Sands of Time remake, which would have been part of the press Kit sent out to media, many have said its reported existence shows just how close the Prince of Persia team was to releasing its game.</p><p>As a reminder, Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, but suffered numerous delays and setbacks since. This included the game seemingly being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">rebooted from scratch</a> in 2023. However, it seemed the great wait was coming to an end, as towards the end of last year, Ubisoft itself had its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">Sands of Time Remake slated for release during"Q4" of the current financial year</a>, which comes to an end on 31st March. So, in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>Alas, it wasn't to be, though, and last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has Ubisoft for comment on the alleged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> press kit.</p>

<p>Soon after Ubisoft announced its company reset, the team behind Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time's embattled remake shared a few words of its own, acknowledging the cancellation was "deeply disappointing" for fans. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">it was keen to stress this "does not mean [its] stepping away from the franchise" for good</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> was a bit of an odd release last year. With a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/">Metacritic score</a> of 79 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">positive comments from Take-Two's leadership</a>, it was considered a success. Longtime Firaxis fans weren't as kind to it though, as many felt it was too disruptive or shallow. As expected, 2026 might be the year the studio makes the game's future brighter.</p>
<p>I'm saying it was to be expected because we've been here before. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-5-spain-inca">Civilization 5</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">6</a> also faced heavy criticism upon release, before going on to become stone-cold 4X classics of the modern era. Long story short: Firaxis likes to experiment, whereas Civilization diehards are allergic to big shakeups... at least at first. Now, following a number of quick reworks and hot patches (as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-loving-a-pirates-life-in-civilization-7-which-keeps-getting-better-as-firaxis-diligent-updates-continue">fun DLCs</a>), Civilization 7's future is coming into focus, and it's looking a lot brighter than we expected.</p>
<p>On 2nd February, 2K and Firaxis <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/anniversary/">shared their vision</a> for the seventh game in the series as it enters 2026. It all starts with Update 1.3.2, which is "going live soon" even if we've got zero words on a specific date yet. The tentative list of changes and additions is long, but players can expect nested tooltips, balance passes across more civs like the French Empire and the Mughal, and reworks of AI diplomacy, coastal raids, and the Appeal system. Moreover, the "legendary demigod of Uruk, Gilgamesh" is coming as a thank-you gift for free.</p>
<p>Further into 2026 (spring is the current target), a batch of deep-cut changes are coming with a huge expansion-sized update called 'Test of Time' which aims to heavily redesign the flow of the entire game and all end goals. The community will be invited to playtest these bigger changes through the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/firaxis-feature-workshop/">Firaxis Feature Workshop</a>, but we've got a quick rundown of what you can expect if you're waiting for the final release. And you can watch the video version below:</p><figure>

<p>First, players will be able to play as a single civilization throughout the entire game, offering a traditional alternative to the "dynamic empire-building experience" of vanilla Civilization 7. Of course, reworks will be happening to accommodate such a radical extra, with a system called Syncretism that allows to "create all-new builds" that borrow from other civilizations once per age without burying the original one.</p>
<p>Victories are getting a top-to-bottom rework as well; Legacy Paths are less important now, and victories can be achieved earlier and by completing "a wide range of different activities" that should make both short and long-term competition more flexible and engaging. In fact, Legacy Paths as we knew them will be binned, with Triumphs taking over. They're themed achievements of sorts that reward civilizations with bonuses and "cards" that can be used when an age starts.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that's a lot to digest, and we're not expecting all these changes to land from the get-go when they're out, but it's exciting to see Firaxis turn Civilization 7 into a game that bridges the gap between newcomers and veterans without erasing its original vision.</p>

            <p>AdHoc has said there is "no possibility" of an uncensored physical version of its superhero workplace comedy Dispatch on Switch or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">fans were disappointed to discover Dispatch was heavily censored on Switch and Switch 2 as standard</a>, with characters' nipples and penises covered with a black box by default, while noises of sexual pleasure were dampened down.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Soon after AdHoc announced Dispatch was censored on Switch consoles, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-comments-on-dispatchs-switch-censorship">Nintendo released its own statement on the issue</a>, saying the company "requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines".</p>
<p>Since then, AdHoc said it understood why its fans were "pissed", and it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-studio-apologises-if-it-looks-like-it-was-trying-to-hide-censored-switch-content-disclaimer-lots-of-lessons-learned-here">now working with Nintendo "on a path forward"</a>. The Dispatch studio added that while it "can't make any specific promises just yet", it is "confident we'll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content", albeit in several weeks' time due to the console submission process.</p><p>However, even with that being said, an uncensored Switch and Switch 2 physical version is not possible, according to a statement shared with <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/57271-dispatch-devs-say-uncensored-physical-switch-release-not-possible-can-t-comment-on">GoNintendo</a>. AdHoc added the discussion isn't "currently relevant as there are no announcements regarding a physical release at this time", despite previously hinting it would like to see a physical release of Dispatch.</p>
<p>GoNintendo also asked about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1qpxtya/i_think_dispatch_being_censored_on_switch_is/">singular worldwide release discussion</a> which has started to make the rounds following Dispatch's Switch censorship discussion. The publication got the following response back from AdHoc's PR: "AdHoc is legally unable to provide further comment on why separate SKUs were not possible for different regions."</p>

<p>Despite this recent blip in public favour, Dispatch has been a huge success for AdHoc, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a> following its initial release last year.</p>
<p>Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a>, possibly with even more sex scenes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>.</p>

            <p>Barely over a month in, 2026 has been busy, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/highguard">Highguard</a> is easily the strangest game release we've had so far. Following a baffling, nearly marketing-free rollout following its reveal at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a>, it crashed into a wall of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">negative reviews</a>, but developer Wildlight Entertainment was quick to react. Now, the sentiment is more positive following 5v5 matches being tested and locked - but can it survive the poisoned conversation that's sprung up around the game so far?</p>
<p>Ahead of the last weekend, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-update-reduces-crashes-by-90-adds-crouch-toggle-option">first patch</a> addressed some of the most pressing criticisms, with the devs also deciding to experiment with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-has-a-new-5v5-mode-but-its-only-live-this-weekend">limited-time 5v5 mode</a> that could maybe make Highguard's large maps feel less empty outside the attack and defence phases. It turns out that was a good call, as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Steam</a> reviews have now climbed up to "Mixed" as players (the hopeful ones, at least) engage with a more frenetic and brutal version of the shooter. Thus, the 5v5 queue is staying.</p>
<p>Of course, the conversation on social media and YouTube is far more negative, with the usual suspects using the latest big attempt at breaking into the live-service space as a punching bag instead of downvoting and moving on. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-we-being-too-hard-on-live-service-games">There's a conversation worth having</a> about the industry reaching peak live-service critical mass years ago, sure, but don't expect grifters to approach <em>any game</em> making waves in good faith.</p>
<p>That said, the reality of the situation is that Highguard is struggling after a confusing launch and due to its objectively under-cooked state. There's a few too many different shooters in that esports-oriented mix, and not all of them work or play well together. The 5v5 mode is promising in that it actually feels good to play and makes you catch a glimpse of what the game <em>could become</em> in the long run. That is, if there's a long run for it. We know <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-roadmap-apex-legends-live-service-plan/">Wildlight worked on a full-year roadmap for Highguard</a>, but can the game really sustain itself for so long?</p><p>The game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#1w">SteamDB profile</a> paints a grim picture, at least on PC, with the concurrent players chart steadily going down since Highguard opened its gates on 26th January. 3,157 players are inside the game at the time of writing, with 8,404 at its 24-hour peak. Positive reviews are up, yes, and even surpassing the negative ones now, but these numbers aren't what you want to see only a week after launch when you're thinking big with another online shooter.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>We don't have access to the data on consoles yet, but so far, the crossplay capabilities are ensuring that matchmaking is quick, so there might be a bigger interest there that we can't quantify. In my personal case, I'm now curious about where it could go following the 5v5 update, but <a href="https://www.vg247.com/concord-review">having been burned in the past</a> a few too many times by similar shooters, I'm also staying realistic.</p>

            <p>The Nintendo Switch has surpassed the DS to become the company's best selling console ever.</p>
<p>As shared in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf">Nintendo's latest financial report</a>, which covers the first nine months of FY2026 up until 31st December 2025, the Switch has now sold 155.37m units. To compare, the company's previous best selling console - the Nintendo DS - has clocked up 154.02m units sold as of 31st December 2025.</p>

            <p>If you think we've had enough takes on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/harvest-moon">Harvest Moon</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> formula, think again. Starsand Island is almost ready to invite players into a "peaceful paradise," and its looks alone could seal the deal for many lapsed farmers.</p>
<p>The game, teased again during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">the last Tokyo Game Show</a>, comes from Chinese developer Seed Sparkle Lab, who has decided to first drop it on Steam Early Access and Xbox Preview in order to "finalise the comprehensive content and finesse the end-game experience." After that period, which is supposedly ending in mid-2026, the game will hit 1.0 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/">Steam</a>, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and even macOS.</p> <figure>

<p>On top of the striking cozy anime aesthetic covering it all, Starsand Island's secret weapon might be its bigger focus on side activities which aren't strictly related to running a farm and more open-ended building and customization options. NPC relationships and fluffy animal companions will play huge roles as well.</p>
<p>There's even vehicles like roller blades and hoverboards, with cars and motorbikes serving as bigger, more traditional means of transport. Online multiplayer won't be supported when the game hits early access on 11th February, but it's coming with the full release. In fact, the devs are encouraging cooperative crafting and construction through "extensive DIY" systems that aim to remove a few of the usual guard rails.</p><p>The developers have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starsandisland/comments/1kbfutr/why_we_created_starsand_island_every_choice/">quite open about the entire creative process</a> for months now, and that included <a href="https://imgur.com/PrlU0ZU">shooting down accusations of genAI use</a>. Our quick look at the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ErpRrv2jbm">official Discord server</a> has also revealed a strong anti-AI stance in its community, so at the time of writing, it <em>seems</em> free of slop.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f</a> was one of last year's biggest surprises and marked a return to form for the veteran horror game franchise (if we don't count the SH2 remake). With a strong cast of characters, a 1960s Japan setting, and a dense atmosphere, it made an impression on veterans and newcomers alike. Now, two members of the main cast have been made ambassadors of the city that inspired the game's rural village.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-actors-appointed-tourism-ambassadors-for-japanese-city-that-inspired-the-game">IGN</a>, we've learned about the surprising <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fZn1IovXDYw">YouTube short</a> posted on 2nd February by Takeshi Masago and Tamami Hiraoka, who played Hinako's (the protagonist) father and mother respectively. At first, fans thought they had a serious announcement to make given the video's initial tone, but it all ends with excitement and screaming as they reveal they've been made tourism ambassadors for Gero City in Japan's Gifu Prefecture.</p>
<p>The Kanayama-cho area, filled with "narrow alleyways and old houses" that instantly look familiar, served as the main inspiration for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s fictional Ebisugaoka village. Here's an image of the real-life location:</p>

<p>The wholesome video also serves as the culmination of an ongoing saga that had many of the viewers following the pair of actors' clips together wishing they were married in real life (and hopefully in a healthier relationship than in the game). Many thought for a second they were getting married for real, but they're keeping things professional, so calm down.</p><p>Masago has also been promoting Gero City for a while now, <a href="https://x.com/okuhidashuzo/status/2017953960754286795?s=20">wine brewery included</a>. There's even Silent Hill f themed sake and chocolates now, with the first batch selling out instantly. It's yet another example of a Japan-set mainstream video game bringing lots of attention to certain areas of the country.</p>
<p>Only a few years ago, Tsushima Island got a massive boost to tourism following the release of Sucker Punch's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> too. That also led to the game's lead devs <a href="https://sea.ign.com/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/169560/news/ghost-of-tsushima-lead-devs-named-ambassadors-of-actual-island">becoming permanent tourism ambassadors of the city</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>2025 was a year packed with racing releases for the whole family, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a> absorbing hours and hours of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> owners' free time, yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> emerged as the go-to choice for veterans looking for meatier mechanics and demanding circuits. Now, we've learned that it's sold more than 1 million copies, but Sega is thinking bigger.</p>
<p>Following "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/">on Steam</a> and an over 80 <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">Metacritic score</a>, Sega is bullish on its long-term performance, especially with a physical Nintendo Switch 2 release that hasn't arrived yet. "Initial performance did not meet our expectations, and we are aiming to sell approximately another 1 million units within this fiscal year," an overlooked <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20251107_q2_presentation_with_scripts_e.pdf">results presentation</a> from November 2025 stated (hat tip to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-expecting-another-million-sales-of-sonic-racing-crossworlds-for-the-2026-fiscal-year-ending-march-31-2027.1422568/">ResetEra</a>).</p>
<p>For reference, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has sold over 2m copies in Japan alone, with its global total well past 9.5m copies by last September (we don't have the current figures). Mind you, these 1m sales numbers for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds are outdated as we wait for more recent results presentations, but with the Switch 2 port launching digitally ahead of Christmas and other versions <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4njxoc2w">showing promise</a> in the lead-up to that period, the racing game could be well on its way to hit the 2m mark.</p>
<p>While Sega has been enjoying a great deal of success thanks to franchises such as Sonic and Like a Dragon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-president-admits-live-service-games-are-the-companys-biggest-challenge">the company has struggled to break into the live-service space</a> while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-finally-admits-low-sales-of-games-may-have-been-impacted-by-players-waiting-for-definitive-editions-like-persona-5-royal-or-smt-5-vengeance">sales of well-received premium games haven't always matched its high expectations</a>. No one has a clear answer as to why critical acclaim and active fan bases aren't boosting the sales numbers further, but the entertainment giant isn't backing down.</p>
<figure>

<p>Also buried under the mountain of data and information primarily aimed at shareholders, the current rollout schedule makes it very clear the company is still committed to mining old IPs like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer">Crazy Taxi</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a>, and Golden Axe in hopes of finding more hits too. Even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-isolation-2-teased-by-creative-assembly-with-original-director-returning">Alien: Isolation sequel</a> fans manifested into existence (currently in development at Creative Assembly) is still on track to arrive in the coming years.</p>

            <p>For many, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-review">Borderlands 4</a> was a return to form after a so-so third entry. For others, it was more of the same. All in all, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critics largely liked it</a> while players had hotter takes. The FPS <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4pndwc2w">broke into 2025's best-selling list</a>, and that's what ultimately matters to the powers that be. Thus, we're now looking at plenty of new content coming to the looter shooter soon.</p>
<p>A stacked <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/">Borderlands 4 roadmap</a> was revealed on 29th January, with detailed plans that go up to Q3 2026. The game's "first major update" introduces a Photo Mode and is now live, but content and other substantial additions won't start pouring in until later this month. Before we give you a quick rundown on everything set to arrive, you can check out the full thing below:</p>

<p>In February, Bounty Pack 2: Legend of the Stone Demon introduces a new mission with extra Legendary loot and more cosmetics to unlock. It's important to note this second Bounty Pack will be paid, unlike the first one. Alongside this piece of DLC, Pearlescent gear, a rarity superior to even Legendary, will arrive to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> and for all players. Later, the first of the planned Story Packs, Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, will introduce "an all-new region of Kairos, new story missions, and the first new Vault Hunter" for the game.</p><p>C4SH is the name of the new playable character, "a former casino dealer bot turned drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts." I haven't played the game yet, but that sounds like really playful and off-beat game design for a subgenre in dire need of innovation, so thumbs up.</p>
<p>Though more pieces of content, both free and paid, are listed on the roadmap, Gearbox isn't ready to discuss all of them yet. That said, highly requested quality-of-life changes will come "as soon as possible" too. Those include a level cap increase, cross-platform saves, shared progression (world progress and other non-class unlocks) across all Vault Hunters, and more free events to spice things up.</p>
<p>Last but not least, endgame content appears to be set to receive meaty additions with more raid bosses (starting in Q2 2026), new Takedown missions, and other endgame activities in both small and big sizes. We're used to looter shooters taking a while to fully come together by now, but considering the Borderlands series refuses to fully embrace a live-service DNA, this all feels like a notable effort to keep it going for years to come.</p>

            <p>Hypergryph, the developers of Arknights Endfield, has today explained the cause and full scope of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem">last week's player mischarge problem</a>. According to a newly released statement, all players impacted by the unauthorized charges have been refunded.</p>
<p>The company has revealed that the single highest mischarge to a player's PayPal account was $5,289, with roughly $80,000 in total unauthorized charges being made across the playerbase. PayPal, the payment-option at the heart of this problem, remains disabled in Arknights Endfield as further tests are conducted to make sure no future issues with</p>
<p>A representative of Hypergryph provided Eurogamer the following statement: "The issue was caused by a payment processing glitch affecting certain PayPal transactions made via the official launcher and topup.gryphline.com. Based on our review, the issue affected 3,429 orders across servers, involving around 1,800 players. The total value of the affected orders was approximately $80,000, with the highest single affected transaction amounting to $5,289.</p>

<p>"After confirming the issue, PayPal payments were disabled within hours to prevent further impact. All affected transactions were identified on the same day, and full refunds were issued to all impacted players. In addition, no purchased items were revoked during this process -- players retained all items associated with the refunded transactions.</p><p>"Over the past week, we have completed a comprehensive internal review and implemented improvements to our order validation and monitoring processes. We have also introduced additional safeguards around third-party payment providers to further reduce the risk of similar issues occurring in the future.</p>
<p>"At present, PayPal payments remain disabled as a precautionary measure. This is not due to an unresolved issue, but a deliberate decision to allow for extended testing and verification before the payment option is re-enabled."</p>
<p>Now that this problem has seemingly been resolved, players should be good to hop into Arknights Endfield worry-free.

All three of its best aspects work in tandem to create a game that's worth playing for anyone with a hunger for a new action title."</p>

            <p>The Game Awards 2025 gave us plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">juicy reveals</a>, but few were as surprising as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-galactic-racer-puts-pod-racing-back-on-the-menu">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, a spiritual successor of sorts to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-episode-1-racer">Episode I: Racer</a> and the overlooked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-jail-break-star-wars-racer-revenge">Racer Revenge</a>. It looked stunning, but fans had one fear following its reveal: there were no old-school podracers to be found in the trailer.</p>
<p>While that last-second Sebulba tease already rekindled our hopes and dreams, <a href="https://fusegames.com/">Fuse Games</a> CEO and co-founder Matt Webster has now confirmed podracing will return alongside all sorts of other vehicles: "You can’t really make a Star Wars racing experience and not have podracing, can you? The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the Star Wars galaxy," the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games">Criterion</a> vet <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/">told GamesRadar</a> following the exciting reveal.</p> <figure>

<p>The question now is whether an older Sebulba, Anakin Skywalker's first nemesis, is the exception among a highly varied roster of racers or he'll be joined by other known faces that we saw in The Phantom Menace's lengthy Boonta Eve Classic scene. Galactic Racer takes place after the fall of the Empire, so it's been decades since podracing's glory days, but it's time to speak up, Ben Quadinaros stans.</p>
<p>What we know for sure is that Fuse Games was looking to reinvent Star Wars racing games without forgetting about their legacy: "We wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. Galactic Racer offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes." The mention of several solo and multiplayer modes is interesting here, as we'd only read about a unique runs-based "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4078430/STAR_WARS_Galactic_Racer/">story-driven campaign</a>" and regular PvP multiplayer via the materials released so far.</p><p>As much as we'd love to know more, it's likely we won't be hearing from Fuse Games for a while following Galactic Racer's big announcement, as the studio is now focusing on getting it ready for a tentative 2026 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, but with Burnout and Need for Speed pedigree, we have a really good feeling about this.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The Game Bakers has been putting in good work for years now with eye-catching indie games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/furi">Furi</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/haven">Haven</a>. One of the studio's core strengths is the ability to go from a genre into an entirely one with shocking ease. Mountain-climbing sim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cairn-is-a-welcome-reminder-of-the-power-of-the-pause">Cairn</a> is yet another glowing example of that, and it appears its sales numbers are reflecting <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/cairn/">the critical praise</a>.</p>
<p>On 1st February, the studio announced that its latest game, which launched on 29th January, had crossed an important milestone (considering its size and somewhat niche pitch): in barely over three days since it hit digital storefronts across PC and PS5, it has sold over 200,000 copies.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Is this the revival of Kami’s golden age of tourism?<br> We couldn’t be happier to have welcomed 200,000 climbers to the mountain over the weekend. <a href="https://t.co/mvD8BGopa9">pic.twitter.com/mvD8BGopa9</a></p>— The Game Bakers (@TheGameBakers) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGameBakers/status/2018061058657624307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>That's no small feat considering the marketing campaign has been restrained and the game contains no tried-and-tested, trend-y hooks for indies like roguelite elements or online co-op. However, its proposal was backed by the studio's successful previous works plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-review">Jusant</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baby-steps-review">Baby Steps</a> getting the more curious crowd into a climbing mood recently.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1588550/charts/">Steam data</a> (it's also available via GOG and Epic) backs this narrative up as well, with the game currently sitting at the 9th spot of Global Top Sellers (it's gone up and down inside the top 10) and also conquering the 4th spot in Wishlist Activity. Concurrent players peaked at almost 15,000 over the weekend. Again, it's pretty significant considering we're looking at a single-player adventure with very a specific set of mechanics and rhythm. The sort of stuff that makes us hopeful about the industry's future in spite of, well, <em>everything else</em>.</p><p>Though there's been no confirmation of Xbox or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> versions at the time of writing, it appears the self-published studio is quite happy with the results already, so we're hoping that means it'll reach more platforms in the future.</p>

            <p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>'s third season, packing a "back to basics" balance adjustment and four new characters. Three of those characters, returning veterans from the series' history, were also revealed in the announcement.</p>
<p>This update comes following the second season, which proved controversial as it stayed true to the overly-aggressive direction established when the game first released. Mechanics like Heat Dash allowed players to sidestep (ironically) traditional thoughtful defensive play. Season 2 drew plenty of ire from series veterans, and there seems to be a sense of refreshement in the community on the back of this announcemnet.</p>
<p>This season 3 trailer, showing less-flashy combos, sidestepping actually <em>working</em>, appears to be returning to a more traditional Tekken approach.</p>

<p>As for those four characters present in Season 3 as DLC, we saw a brief in-engine appearance of Kunimitsu. She'll be coming in Spring 2026, while Bob is coming in Summer in his regular Robust form. Roger Jr, the (in)famous boxing Kangaroo, will be hopping into the roster come Autumn. The fourth DLC character, as well as a purchasable DLC stage, will be the final addition in 2026's Winter season. These have not yet been revelead, however. Will it be another legacy character, or a brand-new figher? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The season 3 pass will go on sale on the 10th February, which will come digitally packaged with the Aurora costume pack: a total of 44 in-game costumes for the whole cast including upcoming season 3 characters.</p>

            <p>The director and creator of Ashes of Creation, the MMORPG brought to life via the $3.2 million donated by almost 20,000 backers in 2017, has quit "in protest" against decisions his board was making that he could "not ethically agree with or carry out".</p>
<p>Following a slew of unhappy messages from numerous people posted online across Discord and LinkedIn (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGN</a>), it appears that director Steven Sharif's resignation triggered further resignations across "much of the senior leadership team" of Intrepid Studios, after which the Board "proceed[ed] with a mass layoff".</p>

<p>Things seemed to be coming to a head towards the end of January, when, on the 27th, a notice was posted on the official <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">website</a> promising to address several issues and informing players that the studio was moving its Development Update to 13th February. It was signed by "The Ashes of Creation team", and did not address the game's future.</p><p>"I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation," Sharif wrote on Discord a couple of days later. "Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</p>
<p>"I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty that they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed at the situation."</p>
<p>Then, overnight (31st January), director of communications Margaret Krohn confirmed on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that their time at Intrepid Studios "has come to a close", writing: "As for how this all ended… I don't really have the words. It wasn't what I expected. But I'm holding onto the good because there was so much of it".</p>
<p>Players are now understandably concerned that the game they only purchased a couple of weeks ago - it released into early access on 11th December - could be in jeopardy, and the Steam page, and its subsequent reviews, is now filling up with concerns and complaints from players trying to get an answer on the game's fate. We've reached out to Intrepid Studios and will update should we get a response.</p><p>Asked by someone on LinkedIn if Ashes of Creation had indeed been cancelled, Krohn replied: "I don't work there anymore, so I can't answer that for you. Personally, I don't know how they would make it when the heart and soul of the product, the amazing dev team, was all laid off."</p>

            <p>Battlestate Games has confirmed its first major crossover event is on the way, and it's with Escape from Duckov.</p>
<p>It's currently unknown how the fan-favourite spin-off crossover will unfold in Tarkov, but the team behind Duckov has shared that from 10th February, it'll host a Tarkov-inspired map, a mount system, and "festival content". You'll also get to face off against "classic characters" from Escape from Tarkov, too.</p>

<p>Tarkov devs, on the other hand, have only shared this image, which features a crying duckie and the text: "Wanna have a party?" Which we do, of course.</p> <div>

<p>Without anything else to go on it's hard to be definitive about what to expect, but given Duckov's collab kicks off in February, it's plausible that Tarkov's event will, too. We'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>You'll remember that Escape from Duckov - which debuted on Steam shortly before Tarkov's long-anticipated Steam release late last year - took us by storm as well as surprise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-duckov-waddles-into-the-extraction-shooter-space-with-over-200000-concurrent-players">clocking up a staggering 301,322 concurrent players at release</a>, making it one of the biggest games on Steam ever. Since then, numbers have tapered off somewhat, but it apparently still very much made an impression on Battlestate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-players-slam-steam-launch-it-is-not-a-game-it-is-a-cosmic-punishment">Escape from Tarkov is still sitting on a Mixed rating after November's eagerly-awaited Steam debut</a> resulted in stability and performance issues that prevented players from even logging in, let alone play.</p>

            <p>Gaming companies saw share prices plummet this week after Google rolled out Project Genie 3, an AI tool that lets users generate virtual worlds in 60-second bursts from text prompts.</p>
<p>Companies like Take-Two, CD Projekt, Unity, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> saw between 8-20 percent wiped off the value of their companies as spooked investors seemingly went into the weekend thinking tech like this could replace the game development process. Which it can't, of course (not yet, anyway).</p>

<p>As Bloomberg's Jason Schreier wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mdnsxghxkk2t">BlueSky</a>, "Gaming stocks are dropping today after Google's rollout of Project Genie, an AI tool that lets users create and explore virtual worlds for 60 seconds. This is the result of a market that does not understand how video games are made.</p><p>"To be clear, this is not a referendum on the quality of AI content," he added. "Markets are spooked because they believe tools like Project Genie will allow anyone to generate a video game. This is not actually possible." He then suggested traders take a look at his latest book, Blood, Sweat, and Pixels.</p>

</span></p><p>Shinobi602 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shinobi602.bsky.social/post/3mdnsxei4lk2w">added</a> a similar sentiment: "Video game stocks are suddenly crashing today with the launch of Google's Project Genie as investors think games will start magically getting made with AI."</p>
<p><a href="https://deepmind.google/models/genie/">Genie 3</a> is described as a general-purpose world model that can take text descriptions and generate "photorealistic environments that can be explored in real-time". The environments are interactive and controllable, and offer "world consistency and stability". This includes both real-life and fantastical scenarios rendered in realistic 3D or animated styles.</p>
<p>And it does look incredible. The examples given - which include the prompts used to generate them - are undoubtedly impressive, most of which respond to external third-party controls or inputs.</p>
<p>But the tech comes with several limitations, not least that its interactive elements are significantly restricted, and creations are only a minute long. It would be extraordinarily unwise to suggest that Genie <em>couldn't</em> challenge game engines like Unity and Unreal one day, but given the incredibly limited examples provided, it's unlikely to do so anytime soon.</p><p>AI, of course, continues to generate heated debate across the industry. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development, most notably in animation. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. That number is now likely to be higher, and a more recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p>

            <p>HBO's CEO has suggested that the TV adaptation of The Last of Us could be wrapped up as soon as next season.</p>
<p>Asked to confirm if The Last of Us' upcoming season was "final" in an interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/">Deadline</a>, CEO and chairperson of HBO, Casey Bloys, said: "It certainly seems that way, but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners. So you can ask them."</p>

<p>Previously, that aforementioned showrunner, Craig Mazin, had claimed that the team <em>was</em> working to a four-season plan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">insisting there was "no way" the narrative could be wrapped up in three seasons</a>.</p>
<p>That wasn't even the first time the magic number four has been floated in regard to The Last of Us' TV adaptation, either. Mazin started the chatter all the way back in 2023, suggesting the show could "end up being three or five [seasons]. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."</p><p>Mazin discussed a four-season arc last May, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann stepped away from the TV adapation's third season last September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">stating he'd accomplished his "crazy goal" of elevating video games</a>. Mazin has yet to publicly respond to Bloys' comment.</p>
<p>ICYMI, the upcoming third season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-three-to-recast-manny">HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation will feature a new actor playing WLF member Manny</a>.</p>

            <p>Highguard's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">launch this week</a> would've probably passed by largely unremarked if it wasn't for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">appearance at last year's The Game Awards</a>. Unusually for a game with no prior hype or obvious pedigree, it featured as the show's big "and finally" reveal, immediately subjecting it to intense, and slightly bewildered, scrutiny. After that, even as hard facts on the game remained scarce, it continued to draw scorn, purely for the sin - or so it seemed - of being yet another live-service game. There's plenty more to say on Highguard specifically now it's out, but its arrival this week got us talking about the live service curse - the intense skepticism and innate ill-will that seems to accompany every announcement of a new contender, even before they've had a chance to prove themselves. So this week's Big Question for us and then you - are we being too hard on live-service games?</p>
<p>It's tough not to be skeptical, of course. Taken as a monolithic block, live service games have engendered ample reasonable distrust over the years as they've adopted increasingly manipulative, exploitative tactics to sustain themselves - from loot boxes and battle pass grinds to limited-time FOMO. But there're also those that have found a more benevolent formula for survival, garnering praise for their more player-friendly approach, even if it had to be earned.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Here's how Highguard introduced itself to the world back in December.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_6tjMvckZ0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"It's easy to decry live service games as awful - a waste of time and money and development resources - when you focus in on just the rancid stuff," reckons Eurogamer's Connor Makar, "but that'd be ignoring the player-minded games out there; the ones that understand that with great time investment must come great <em>respect</em> for that time: your Warframes, your <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 2s, your Old School RuneScapes; the finer few that float above the rest. Take a step back and there's clearly a good way to approach live service development, away from the trend-chasing, absurd monetisation, limited-time FOMO slop."</p><p>But, of course, it's hard to confidently hold any live service game up as the <em>one that got it right</em> when history is littered with examples of good 'uns slowly succumbing to enshitification. Look at something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>; it's far from the most egregious example, but after launching its paid store in 2019, the shift away from its starting point of limiting paid ship cosmetics to Rare-themed designs hasn't gone unnoticed. These days, its Pirate Emporium is awash with outfits, emotes, pets, trophies, trinkets, and £20+ ship sets of all stripes, while its non-time-limited free cosmetic additions are increasingly rare - and the game's news updates often feel more like ads for the paid store. And that's without getting into the time-hoovering seasonal battle pass grind introduced in 2021, or the increasing reliance on limited-time FOMO. It seems to suggest: even with the best intentions, when a system <em>can</em> be exploited - by corporate beancounters or otherwise - it probably will.</p>
<p>And Eurogamer's Dom Peppiat has a similar tale. "I was a hardcore <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> player, and didn't mind paying the (quite expensive) 'top ups' for content multiple times a year," they explain. "It was based on an old MMO-style way of thinking: pump in money, get a chunk of content per time. Fine. Good. I pretty much knew what to expect and what my money would get me. Since Bungie made the game free-to-play, though, the seasonal system of updates became more vague, and more prone to last-minute changes - suddenly, there was no expectation of value to updates or seasons, and gradually all the coolest cosmetics began to disappear behind a separate, currency-based paywall that you couldn't really earn in-game."</p>

<p>As Dom notes, there's an inherent Faustian Pact at the heart of any live service proposition: "either you pay to keep things going, or you eat the ads in order to have the developers keep their lights on." But Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell suggests there's something else going on here too: a perhaps unreasonable tendency to blindly dismiss any and all live service games as an exercise in corporate artlessness, when the situation is rarely quite so black and white. "The logic goes - and I should emphasise, very understandably in many cases - that a game is a live service because some clueless executive somewhere has decided it must be so," he explains. "And then the poor developers, void of free will, churn out some miserable; generic; FPS; hobby-grade coop campaign; genre-blended, multi-mode competitive e-sports; meta-growth, choice + epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battleborn">Battleborn</a> Heroes! (<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/486550022910005248?lang=en">to borrow a phrase</a>)."</p>
<p>"It's reasonable because this has genuinely happened lots of times," Chris continues. "See: Warner Bros. with Sledgehammer and EA with BioWare, for just a couple obvious examples. And because we, in the press, have emphasised this very silly executive reasoning as a key part of the catastrophic decline the games industry has had over the past few years - because it is! Along with a lot of other things, anyway. The narrative, which has some accuracy to it, goes that developers' creativity is being stifled for the sake of trend-chasing ventures (read: live service games) doomed from the outset."</p><p>Which does, of course, bring us back to Highguard; a game that has, as Chris puts it, been "utterly bludgeoned with YouTube video after YouTube video, mob Steam review after mob Steam review" because it's seen as 'another Concord'. "And because, at the risk of a tangent here," he continues, "YouTube revenue and viewership has become so strained in recent times that outrage 'content' is increasingly the only reliable source of income - and in a quiet January, that makes a fairly clunky, vaguely progressive-looking live service game like Highguard an easy target."  But the thing about Highguard is that it's not, as Chris points out, a "years-long publisher folly but an independent venture, made by people who made games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, who are making it because they're passionate about competitive online shooters with weird and interesting strategic elements and, erm, incomprehensible art styles."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"To put it plainly," he concludes, "there are many, many things wrong with many, many live service games, but there are other live service games that exist for exactly the reason we want any game to exist: because some talented, creative, desperately determined people wanted to make it. Not all (or even many) of those games will be good - but the odd one lands, and in those cases the effect of playing online with old friends, or new friends, or random, brilliant encounters, is about as good as any video game's can be."</p>
<p>But of course, as long as the Fortnites, Warzones, and GTA Onlines of this world keep bringing in the big bucks, there'll always be those approaching live service games not as a form of artistic expression but purely for their money printing potential  - and the cynical manipulations, the dark patterns and predatory monetisation, the destructively stupid executive decision-making, will continue. As Connor puts it, "Anyone who pretends this culture of negativity around live service games has emerged out of nowhere has had their head in the sand", and that means developers should probably accept their cool new live service game is riding in on a tide of well-earned cynicism. But does that mean we shouldn't at least give them the benefit of the doubt before damning them to the grave? Well, that's The Big Question, isn't it? Over to you!</p>

            <p>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has shared its 2026 roadmap, complete with hints of four seasonal events, two reworked maps, one completely new location, and a load of "major updates", including the player character overhaul, a Unity 6 update, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release, and, of course, that highly-anticipated 1.0 release.</p>
<p>And it all starts pretty soon, too. That player character overhaul - which some had hoped would release last year - should be out by March, complete with free cosmetics, new character models, and "fine-tuned animations".</p>

<p>"Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year," Kinetic teased. "Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game's launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0."</p><p>Following on from the reworked farmhouse maps, Willow Street and Tanglewood are the next residential maps to get the decorators in. While Tanglewood's layout will remain "similar" (interestingly, the same is not said of Willow Street, which is my personal favourite), players can expect "a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes, and more."</p>

<p>"For those with a keen eye, there's also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered," the team added.</p>
<p>As for the new map? Kinetic is playing its cards very close to its chest on that one, but it did tease that along with the return of the usual seasonal events, a mysterious one-time event is also planned for later this year, too.</p><p>"This year is set to be a big one for Phasmophobia, and we are so excited for our 1.0 launch, which will be one of the biggest moments since we released the game," said Daniel Knight , Kinetic CEO and game director of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"We are constantly working on creating a truly immersive experience for ghost hunters, and have been developing the game with this in mind. Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-years-in-the-history-of-co-op-ghosthunting-game-phasmophobia">"one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game</a>. In an update shared at the beginning of the year, the team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>

            <p>Wildlight has deployed another update to its live-service hero shooter, Highguard, introducing a 5v5 limited-time mode that will only be available this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of the most recent update you'll also find a brand new base, Soul Well, wherein "Wardens can now experiment with this dark relic from a lost age" in both the 3v3 and 5v5 rotations. You can find out more in the teaser below:</p>

<p>To accommodate the bigger fireteams, lobbies have been updated to permit parties of five, and raids are now 10 lives instead of six. You should also expect slightly longer respawns during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused", and the Firing Range cannot support 5v5 at this time, so expect the option to be greyed out if your party has more than three players.</p>
<p>"As one of two major patches released during launch week, this update is emblematic of the Highguard team's dedication to creating a 'ready for live service' game, resulting in immediate action," the team said.</p>
<p>"Just this week, the team has squashed hundreds of bugs, improved performance across the board: yesterday’s update, Patch 1.0.4 introduced a variety of bug fixes, new video settings, and highly-requested features."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Here's the full patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard the feedback!</p>
<p>For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!</p>
<p>The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live. Grab 4 friends and jump into some hectic raids!</p>
<p>A few small tweaks for this mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6</li>
<li>Respawns are slightly longer during raids to allow generators to be planted/defused</li>
</ul>
<p>Dev note: As most of you know, we are working on optimizations across the game. Many are in this patch and 3v3 should see good improvements! But… adding 4 more players to the game is not going to improve performance, right? Please keep that in mind as you try 5v5!</p>
<p>Dev note 2: Firing Range does not support 5v5 at this time, so the Play button will be grayed out if your party is over 3.</p>
<h2>New Base - Soul Well</h2>
<p>Soul Well is a dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak.</p>
<p>This new base will be added to the rotation in all modes.</p>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>This patch contains several optimizations that touch on animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and other gameplay systems. These optimizations benefit console and PC, but every PC is different, so the exact speedup to overall framerate is dependent on GPU, CPU, and other factors.</p>
<h2>Quality of Life</h2>
<p>Enabled these visual settings on PC and consoles</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion blur toggle for PC and consoles</li>
<li>Anisotropic materials toggle for consoles (PC has this already)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one." Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-update-reduces-crashes-by-90-adds-crouch-toggle-option">Wildlight released an update</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer AdHoc Studio has issued a statement insisting it was not "trying to hide" a disclaimer about censored content on Switch, but did admit it had inadvertently put the notice in "the absolute worst spot" on the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship would be implemented as standard</a>. As we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-comments-on-dispatchs-switch-censorship">reported at the time</a>, this meant black boxes would conceal explcit graphics, and sex noises would be toned down.</p>
<p>AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release". Nintendo's own statement said: "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines".</p>

<p>Now, acknowledging it has been "quiet for the last few days not because we don't want to address this stuff, but because we've been trying to make sure we're being good partners with Nintendo", the studio has issued a statement.</p><p>"As Nintendo states, any game that's going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to 'meet [Nintendo's] established content and platform guidelines'. This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That's what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms," AdHoc wrote.</p>
<p>"We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved."</p>
<p>The statement adds that AdHoc "absolutely need[s] to take full ownership" of the placement of that disclaimer, and while it "didn't have complete control of the language" the disclaimer contained, it did have control of its placement.</p>
<p>"It was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled 'Disclaimer', instead of the 'About The Game' section. We didn't catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it."</p><p>The team takes ownership of this, writing: "This is 100 percent our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We've also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, AdHoc says it is "already working with Nintendo on a path forward", and while "can't make any specific promises just yet", it is "confident we'll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content", albeit in several weeks' time due to the console submission process.</p>
<p>"To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we're truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed," the statement concluded. "Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon."</p>
<p>Dispatch is already hugely successful, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a>, possibly with even more sex scenes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>.</p>

<p>Respawn didn't provide a specific reason as to why updates would be discontinued on Switch - although we can guess that it's something to do with the hardware given support continues on Switch 2 - but did say the discontinuation was part of the studio's goal to "continue to evolve Apex Legends' content and technical foundation" and "deliver a high quality experience".</p><p>"All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts," the team explained. "Everything that has been earned or purchased, including Apex Coins and cosmetics, will carry over to Nintendo Switch 2, even if you purchase Nintendo Switch 2 after August 4, 2026. Please note that in some regions, local laws require you to use digital currency within 180 days of purchase.</p> <div>

            <h2>31st January</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing. This week, I've been failing to be competent at a video game, again, Marie has been trying to please Mama, Victoria passes the time in an airport, and Dom is off on one about Nioh again.</p>
<p>And if you're looking for something else to read, or a reminder of what you once wrote, there's a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">What We've Been Playing archive</a> to delve into.</p>
<h2>Blue Prince, PS5</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Dogubomb/Raw Fury</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This might be my third (maybe fourth?) attempt to get into Blue Prince. This is the puzzle game that took home <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-our-game-of-the-year-is-so-much-more-than-just-a-brilliant-puzzler">Eurogamer's 2025 Game of the Year</a> award, so I felt I simply must give it another shot. A few hours on, am I now a Blue Princian, dedicated to spreading the word of the game's brilliance to all who will listen? Well, no. I think I know the problem now, though. I simply can't dedicate enough time to the game in one session, so I end up feeling completely clueless every time I play. I'm sure I'll get over the hump one day, but that day isn't today.</p>

<h2>Cooking Mama 2, 3DS XL</h2>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>My palms are clammy, my anxiety is high, my stress levels are beyond their natural limits, and fear envelopes my body as I submit my creation. 'Terrific, even better than Mama!'. Those words still bring me the same elation I felt all those years ago when I first played it, Mama liked my food. However, now that I'm a bit older, I realise just how condescending Cooking Mama is when you get something wrong and how stressful it is to try to meet her demanding standards. When the flames ignite in her eyes after tasting a dish I've messed up, I know I am done for. I'd like to point out that some tasks are trickier than others and easy to mess up. For example, grilling anything within the time frame to get bonus points is near enough impossible. Not only is there not enough space to grill that much Squid that quickly, but to keep the flames at the right temperature to cook requires constant attention.</p>
<p>I'm starting to understand why I like Overcooked so much, my training in high-stress virtual kitchen environments began with a seemingly nice Mama in her home kitchen.</p>
<p><em>-Marie</em></p>
<h2>Waiting and Words, mobile</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I spent a good chunk of time in airports this week, playing that ol' fashioned waiting game, and since my previous airport go to of Star Wars Hunters has shut down, to while away some time, I returned to the ever-faithful trinity of Wordle, Strands and Connections.</p><p>I have to say, I think I have my Wordle tactic pretty down pat now. I can usually guess the correct word in well under a minute (not a brag, I am sure many others can also). What I do is I always start with OUIJA, a very vowel heavy word, and then for my second guess pick a word with any of the correct letters from my first guess, but this time make sure I get an E in there as well. I usually end up with something like BEANS or PLUME for guess two. From there, it is then pretty straightforward to get the right answer.</p>
<p>Connections, though, <em>man </em>some of those are obtuse! On the plus side, at least Connections kept my brain occupied for slightly longer while I waited for my flight to board. Wait, what do you mean it's been delayed again?!</p>
<p><em>-Victoria</em></p>
<h2>Nioh 3 demo, PS5 Pro</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Koei Tecmo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s here, it’s finally here. A sizeable, full-fat introduction to one of my most anticipated games of 2026 is now available to download on PlayStation and PC, and it absolutely rules. It looks sumptuous, the variety of build-crafting available to you is out of this world, and flitting between bruiser samurai builds and rapid ninja builds laces the whole action-RPG experience with something diabolically compelling. I think this has the potential to go the whole hog, surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a> (which, for my money, was a near-perfect game) and helping the niche franchise eat further into mainstream consciousness. Give it a go, you’ve nothing to lose.</p>

            <p>17-year Bethesda Bruce Nesmith veteran has given his take on a future Elder Scrolls Morrowind Remakes, stating he doubts the company even has the source code any more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout">In an interview with PressboxUK</a>, Nesmith spoke at length about the company and various projects he worked on. Having left in 2021 during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s development, he offered a frank response when asked why Bethesda would be hesitant to remake the old but beloved RPG.</p>
<p>The problem with doing Morrowind is that I bet they don't have the original code," Nesmith said. "The game is so old. I don't know if the original source code exists anymore. If it does, can you even compile it? When you're looking at Oblivion, they still had the code. They could still compile it. Putting the code into the new version of the engine was a possibility."</p>

<p>He also raised concerns around how Morrowind has aged, doubting that audiences would even enjoy playing that game today. "The other thing I would say is go back and play Morrowind and tell me that's the game you want to play again. We all have these fond memories of things that were pivotal moments in our gaming fantasy histories that we absolutely move but you go back and play a 20 year old game and you will cringe.</p><p>"People even had cringe moments with the Oblivion remake but they forgave it because they're reliving something, they're enjoying the nostalgia. I worked on Oblivion. I'm even responsible for some of those cringe moments! The further back you go, the more that's going to be an issue. The reality of playing Morrowind would not stand the test of time, in my opinion."</p>
<p>Instead, Nesmith raises the point that time would be better spent making something new within the Morrowind setting. He told Pressbox: "Now if you were to completely remake Morrowind with the Skyrim engine, to try and rebuild it from the ground up, that's a whole other story, but that's an entire project. That's a whole four-year development cycle. Why not go and make something new?</p>
<p>"Let's revisit the lands of Morrowind and do a new story. You can include the giant crab palace and all of that stuff but make it new and avoid all the things that would not have survived the test of time."</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered, which released back in April of last year, proved exceptionally popular. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">It sold over four million copies in five days</a>, and received <a href="http://eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">numerous community mods</a> that both added some additional wackiness to the beloved RPG and smoothed off some of its rougher edges. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-asks-the-elder-scrolls-fans-to-suggest-oblivion-remastered-improvements-with-difficulty-scaling-among-top-ideas">Bethesda also went to the community for ideas to improve the game</a>, difficulty scaling one of the more popular among them.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">Eurogamer's Jim Trinca made a case for a Morrowind remake last year</a>, in which he argued: Morrowind is a special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly. I love it warts and all, as much as I love Oblivion warts and all, but I find the latter much easier to recommend for the simple fact that Oblivion is brilliant because of its quirks and foibles, whereas Morrowind is brilliant in spite of them.</p>

            <p>A tease has been made by Blizzard for something special for Classic World of Warcraft players. Meanwhile, the Classic World of Warcraft community is polling itself to find out what they'd want from some sort of 'Classic+'.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkFMkdZWxdk">In the 2026 State of Azeroth presentation</a>, hosted by executive producer Holly Longdale, went over everything in the pipeline across both retail (modern) and Classic World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>On the topic of Classic WoW, Longdale stated the following before being playfully cut off. She stated: "I can say with confidence that all Classic players across the globe have a lot to look forward to. I'm excited to announce…" before being cut off with "Holly No!".</p>

<p>This continues <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24247148/2025-blizzard-yearbook">a trend of recent hints</a> at something substantial coming to Classic World of Warcraft, which has been presumed by swathes of the audience to be some sort of expansion of content to Classic World of Warcraft. Dubbed 'Classic+' by the community, this would be a sort of Old School <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> style strand of WoW in which new updates can be produced in the Classic style.</p><p>This tease comes at an interesting time, as a community-run initiative called 'The Classic+ Project' recently was released. This project has manifested initially as a survey website and Discord server, prompting players to vote on what they'd like to see added and changed to Classic WoW.</p>
<p>Announced in a video by creator Joardee titled '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWq2SFSI3zY">What Exactly is Classic+</a>', this project was created to pull together sentiment by players directly at a time when Blizzard is keeping its cards to its chest.</p>
<p>So discussion around Classic + is really reaching somewhat of a crescendo. Will Blizzard finally announce some form of Classic +, and will this community project refine the wants of the masses into a solid list of wants? If there's any time to announce something official, it's Blizzcon later this year.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a statement regarding the recent censorship of AdHoc's Dispatch on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn there would be some censorship differences on Nintendo's platforms. In versions of the game as it appears on other platforms, there is an option for players to toggle censorship of  explicit content on or off. In the case of Nintendo, though, players were not given this choice, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship being implemented in Dispatch as standard</a>. This saw black boxes covering characters' exposed breasts and penises, while noises of sexual pleasure were toned down.</p>
<p>At this time, AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release".</p>

<p>Nintendo has now shared its own statement regarding the Dispatch discourse.

<p>"While we inform partners when their titles don't meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations."</p>
<p>When it first came to attention that Dispatch would be automatically censored on Switch consoles, many were keen to point out that other games which also featured displays of nudity had not been met with the same stipulations. Games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, in which players can customise their Vs genitalia and more, are not censored on Switch consoles in the way Dispatch has been.</p><p>That being said, a specific Japanese version of Cyberpunk 2077 was released separately from the game's standard version, which removed nudity and decapitations. Therefore, some have speculated Dispatch's censorship issues may have come down to AdHoc not wishing to create a separate release of the game for Japan only. Again, though, this is speculation.</p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Soon after its initial release last year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>

            <p>To celebrate the conclusion of the Fallout show's second season, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> has gone free-to-play for a limited time. It also gained a new $30 DLC pack featuring a camo from the series.</p>
<p>The free-to-play period, which has already started and will last until the 5th February for Xbox and PC players (and the 4th February on PlayStation). You'll have access to all the released updates for the game, giving a pretty substantial peek into what Fallout 76 has got going on.</p>
<p>For those jumping in that are super fans of the Amazon show, the NCR power armour is available too! You'll have to bust out the wallet for it though, as it's part of the new Mojave bundle. It contains the power armour, as well as the ranger power armour paint, NCR flag, New Vegas neon sign, Ad Victoriam super sledge, legion legate outfit, and player titles.</p>

<p>That bundle costs $30. Steam reviews for the bundle currently lie at Mostly Positive, but taking a look at the reviews themselves paint a mixed picture.<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CirillaFionaElenRiannon/recommended/4250650/"> Some have added a phrase from the show</a>: "Never underestimate the power of brand recognition", <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/moonlitfrappe/recommended/4250650/">while others</a> wish they could buy the NCR power armour on its lonesome: "Only bought it for the Ranger armor, should've been in the atomic shop/earned via quest. I'm tired of Fallout being the staple of microtransactions franchise for content."</p><p>Amazon recent went to great lengths to tempt stragglers in to watch the popular Fallout show recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-watch-the-first-season-of-amazons-excellent-fallout-adaptation-free-on-youtube-but-act-quickly-as-it-wont-be-there-for-long">by uploading season one to YouTube</a>, though only for a limited time. As for Fallout 76, it recently received its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout show themed Burning Springs update</a>.</p>

            <p>Some games arrive as a burst of sensation and pure delight: a handful of images and emotions and ideas that wordlessly create a mood. This is Mio: Memories in Orbit. This game is Mucha-like hair billowing in zero G. It's a cluster of pearls and twills of off-cut brass twisting around the chill reaches of outer space. It's the future, or perhaps the weird cybernetic past, inspired by Art Nouveau. It's warm metal forming stamens and petals and entire gardens. The whole thing's gorgeous and sad and filled with visual cleverness.</p>

<p>It's also a Metroidvania - and with it there comes a reminder that Metroidvanias are the most elegant of games. They have maps that reveal themselves in darting headlong stretches, while the greater structure slowly curls ever-outwards. Metroidvanias are about looking at a world that you thought you already knew, and learning to see the fresh potential that's been threaded through it.</p>
<p>Mio does all this stuff wonderfully. I'm still in the early game, but this is already a beautiful adventure. Cast as a tiny robot left to explore a huge, dormant spaceship, the game kicks off with platform gauntlets drawn in sharp lines of gold pen as you learn to jump and double-jump. Only when that's mastered does the wider world fade in with all its complex organic dereliction - but even now, shadows arrive as bursts of delicate cross-hatching. The idea remains that you're exploring a landscape that is in the process of being drawn into existence.</p>



<p>And what a landscape. Early stages allow you to scrabble through cable-strewn passages and then out, suddenly, across gaping bridges where huge machines sleep in the distance. An ice biome arrives, but rather than simply chilling you until you take damage and forcing you to duck falling icicles, you're more concerned with managing speed and inertia as the ground itself becomes a rippling ramp that allows you to launch yourself across vast distances and avoid toxic pits of spikes.</p>



<p>Enemies, meanwhile, are brass and lightbulbs, dashing and rolling and scuttling and lunging. An early power-up allows you to see their health bars, but even the simplest and most ridiculous of these foes can still end a promising run of exploration with a well-swung hammer. I've just encountered a sort of animatronic hummingbird, and I was so taken with watching it that I gave it ample time to peck me to pieces.</p>



<p>Coming post-<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, Mio feels like a reprieve and a revelation. Silksong is deeply wonderful, of course, but it's a pleasure to be exploring a place that's not quite so devoted to causing me harm. If anything, Mio replaces the thrilling pressure of constant game-ending threat with a different kind of panic. I move so far on a single life, and explore so many branching paths - leaving so many other paths unvisited - that I end up with that kind of spatial and memory-based anxiety only the most wide-reaching and intricate games can deliver. How will I ever find my way back here? How will I remember to follow up on everything I'm ignoring for the time being?</p><p>These are good problems to have when a game provides such an interesting set of spaces to explore, and when it gives you such pleasure in the light-footed way you move through them. I loved Silksong very much, but afterwards I did feel like I needed a break from Metroidvanias, just for a bit. Mio makes me realise that I was wrong.</p>

            <p>The Metal Gear Solid series has sold over 65.5m copies worldwide, according to a new business post by Konami.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://www.konami.com/corporate/en/business/digitalentertainment.html">published on the official Konami corporate website</a>, breaks down a selection of milestone achievements for its various IPs. The crowning achievement of this breakdown is the Metal Gear Series, which has surpassed 65.5m total worldwide sales. However, other big series from the Japanese games company have also taken centre stage alongside the stealth action series.</p>
<p>These include the Pawafuru Puroyakyu series, which has passed 26.3m sales, YuGiOh games at 32.5m, Momotaro Dentetsu at 19.9m, and Silent Hill which has made it past 14m sales. Of of these stats run up to the end of December 2025.</p>

<p>The page also includes some pretty eye-watering download stats for various mobile and console games. eFootball has apparently surpassed 950m total sales since 1995, and YuGiOh Duel Links is no slouch either, passing 150m downloads since its release in 2016.</p><p>As a page aimed at impressing investors, there are additional interesting tidbits included in paragraphs meant to sell Konami as a forward-thinking company. This includes a descriptor of Konami as "a leading company in esports", thanks to YuGiOh, eFootball, and Pawafuru Puroyakyu.</p>
<p>The company also claims it will: "continue to take on challenges of the latest innovation by utilizing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), fifth/sixth generation mobile communications (5G/6G), cloud technology, WEB3, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>, and VR/AR."</p>
<p><a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2026/en0129_cf84s6.pdf">Looking at Konami's latest quarterly report</a>, it certainly seems as though the company is doing well. It saw a 16.3 percent increase in income from its digital entertainment sector compared to last year, and a total revenue increase of 13.6 percent.</p>

            <p>The first script for an upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> film adaptation based on Hazelight's game of the same name has been penned.</p>
<p>It was first announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction, which sees two aspiring writers trapped in simulations of their own stories, was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> last year. At this time, sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Soon after, it was revealed that Euphoria and Eden actor Sydney Sweeney would star in the upcoming film, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would handle the script</a>. And, handle the script, they appear to have done.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezine</a>, Hazelight studio head Josef Fares said he had seen the first finalised script for the Split Fiction film. "I got the first version of the script today but you know, there's so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this 'I believe it when I see it'," Fares said (translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>).</p><p>Fares added he had chatted with a "hyped" Sweeney about the project, as well [<strong>NOTE:</strong> Eurogamer commenter @f53b3d06 has said this is a mistranslation by Dexerto. Rather than the actress being 'hyped' for the film, Fares instead said: "It's kind of a done deal that it will star... what's her name, the one that is so hyped/popular... Sydney Sweeney", as he struggled to recall her name at first]. "I've had a meeting with her and she seems super chill," Fares said of the actor.</p>
<p>But, while this may be the case, there is still no word on when we can expect filming for Split Fiction to actually kick off. It could be some time, given how busy Sweeney's schedule is. As well as Split Fiction, the actor is also attached to Colman Domingo's romantic drama Scandalous, which is set to shoot early this year, and a Gundam adaptation. On the other side of the camera, it has been reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">Sweeney is set to produce an adaptation of OutRun</a>. </p>

<p>Split Fiction isn't the only Hazelight game getting the film treatment. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

            <p>According to Walton Goggins, we can all expect something "profound" to happen in the Fallout season two finale next week.</p>
<p>Goggins, who plays The Ghoul/Cooper Howard in Amazon's Fallout adaptation, has said his character's motivations have always been about finding his family. Of course, over the course of two seasons, we have seen the highs and lows of Cooper Howard's family life with his wife Barb and daughter Janey via flashbacks. Meanwhile, in the present day, a now Ghoul-ified Cooper is still searching for his family, and has been for centuries.</p>

<p>So, will he find them in the final episode of Fallout season two? Well, that remains to be seen, though Goggins has teased something "profound" happening not just to The Ghoul, but to the sweeter than sweet vault dweller Lucy as well.</p>
<p>"I can tell you that in episode eight, without giving something away to your audience, something profound happens for both the Ghoul and Lucy that would also be my favourite, but we can't talk about that," he told <a href="https://ew.com/fallout-season-2-finale-cover-story-exclusive-11893674">EW</a> ahead of the Fallout finale.</p><p>Goggins added viewers will also learn more about what Cooper was doing at that birthday party, way back at the start of season one. "I mean, the whole first seven minutes of this experience in season one was about [Cooper being] a guy at a birthday party. Well, how did he get to that birthday party? What happened? It's all leading somewhere," the actor said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to Lucy MacLean actor Ella Purnell, the second season's finale will be a "conflicted, explosive and character-defining" cocktail for the naive and trusting vault dweller.</p>
<p>"You get to see Lucy be a real human with real human problems, and I think at times, because of her strength and her optimism, it doesn't always feel that way with her," Purnell explained. "But in this moment, and that maybe says a lot about what her choices and decisions are, she's flawed and she's actually just getting more and more human."</p>
<p>Ooh, curious!</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-latest-episode-delivers-another-cameo-for-fans-of-the-video-game-series">many weeks of chaos and cameos</a>, Fallout season two will wrap up on 3rd February. Meanwhile, the third season of Fallout is already being written, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming expected to kick off this May</a>. Ghoul blimey, and all that.</p>

            <p>Word on the internet is that Nintendo will be holding another reveals-based livestream next week, and it'll be a Partner Showcase no less.</p>
<p>According to various sources, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">including NatetheHate and GameXplain</a>, the showcase will be focused on third party studios publishing on Nintendo systems, with NatetheHate going one step further stating it'll be hosted on the 5th February.</p>
<p>While these are folks who have a history of calling these sorts of events right in the past, they are still rumours and should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Still, it's been some time since we had a Nintendo Partner Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">Back in July of last year</a>, games like Monster Hunter Stories, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler-2">Octopath Traveler 2</a>, and more were shown off in quite the jam-packed occasion. Leading into 2026, there are plenty of games lined-up for release that we've not actually seen much of yet, including 007: First Light, and The Duskbloods. That last one being especially silent as of late.</p><p>Looking at the reactions to these rumours, there's excitement yet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qqj4qr/natethehate_next_weeks_nintendo_direct_is_a/">but also hunger for a Nintendo Direct focused on first-party releases</a>. It's clear to see why, with a new Fire Emblem on the way as well as a new Mario Tennis, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is looking strong on that front too.</p>
<p>What do you reckon? Will we see a Partner Direct next week? If so, what do you want to see in it?</p>

            <p>A report from GDC has shed a rather sobering light on the state of things, revealing that one third of surveyed US workers within the industry were laid off in the last two years.</p>
<p>According to GDC's <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/2026-SOTI">2026 State of the Game Industry Report</a> - which included data provided by over 2300 respondents including developers, producers, marketers, executives and investors - 33 percent of respondents in the US had been laid off over the past 24 months.</p>
<p>Looking further afield to include other countries as well, 28 percent of those surveyed from within the industry reported they had been laid off in the same period, which is over a quarter of all respondents.</p>

<p>17 percent of those surveyed, meanwhile, stated they had been laid off in the past 12 months. "The total number of layoffs could be higher, though, as some may have experienced more than one layoff in the past two years," the report notes.</p><p>Almost half of the respondents - 48 percent - said they were still looking for employment after being laid off. Of those who were laid off one to two years ago, 36 percent said they still haven't found other games industry employment.</p>
<p>"Over 450 respondents reported experiencing an acquisition, closure, or merger in the past year. About 31 percent of those people also reported being laid off, though it's unclear how many were a direct result of said company changes," the report reads. "AAA and older indie respondents were more likely to report their companies were acquired, and newer indie studios were more likely to close."</p>
<p>In terms of professions within the industry, game designers reported the highest percentage of layoffs over the last 12 months, with 20 percent of those surveyed affected. This percentage includes those in narrative design.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, those working in business operations and services reported the lowest percentage of layoffs, with eight percent affected.</p>
<p>As to the reason why these layoffs happened, 43 percent cited company restructuring, while 32 percent said it was due to a project getting cancelled. Budget cuts and market conditions were also cited by 38 percent of respondents.</p>
<p>"Leadership failed to see that the Covid-era boom was not permanent, [and the] company went on an acquisition spree before being acquired," one respondent told GDC. "Now, money is a lot tighter because the goldfish with the money want returns yesterday so they can funnel it into the current fad (genAI)."</p><p>Another respondent, who was laid off less than 12 months ago, said: "Executives who have never actually worked as a dev are pulling up the boards on their ships, throwing people overboard, and expecting these scuttled ghost ships to keep making them infinite money."</p>
<p>Some respondents added their employers were working to retain their staff, "in spite of ongoing challenges".</p>

<p>Layoffs and closures remain an ongoing issue in 2026. Earlier this month, Ubisoft shocked everyone when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, back in 2024, Chris Dring wrote an in-depth feature about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">everything going on with layoffs in the video games industry</a>.</p>

            <p>The team over at Wildlight has released an update for its live-service hero shooter, Highguard.</p>
<p>This update adds a number of "highly" requested features from its community, including a new crouch toggle option, field of view sliders on console and - importantly - improved stability. According to the studio, crashes have been reduced by 90 percent thanks to this update.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Highguard below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Settings Improvements</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localised in languages other than English. Properly localised settings will be prepared for a future patch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Game Input Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to set Crouch to Hold or Toggle for all platforms.</li>
<li>Added the ability to set Aim Down Sights to Hold or Toggle for PC only (for now).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Toggling into ADS then tapping Sprint (shift on PC, left stick on controller) will swap your scope. This is disorienting on controller. PC players are recommended to rebind scope swap if using Toggle ADS. We will continue to look into adding this for console players who can’t rebind buttons yet, but we will need more time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Video Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.</li>
<li>Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.</li>
<li>Low shadow setting now also disables volumetric fog.</li>
<li>Added a new "View Distance Quality" setting that controls skeletal mesh LODs, which can be another useful control to tune GPU and CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players now have the ability to toggle the following features on or off, irrespective of other quality options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anisotropic Materials</li>
<li>Chromatic Aberration</li>
<li>Bloom</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Motion Blur and Depth of Field need more testing to disable safely. Look for these options very soon.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS users now have the ability to select a DLSS preset.<em> More presets and better descriptions are coming in the next patch.</em></li>
<li>Players can now select Off to disable Global Illumination entirely.</li>
<li>Resolved an engine bug which could inadvertently throttled laptop users to 60 FPS regardless of frame rate settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crash and Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>This patch resolves crashes that could occur in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a match on PS5 with an unexpected input state.</li>
<li>Loading into matches on machines with slower storage devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other bugs related to online user presence and matchmaking were also resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friends now appear online correctly after accepting requests, and Xbox presence updates properly. Major crash fixes have reduced crashes by 90 percent, significantly improving stability.</li>
<li>Friend status is fixed - players now appear online correctly and Xbox presence updates reliably. Our top crash issues are gone resulting in a 90 percent crash reduction.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>And that's your lot for now.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>Despite Amazon's live-action God of War series following the plot of Santa Monica's 2018 Norse epic, the cast so far has a very Ragnarök (and roll) feel to it.</p>

<p>Last night, it was announced that Severance actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson will portray the Norse God of Thunder, Thor. "A mountain of a man who has weathered many a battle in his time, but whose actions in a war fought long ago now haunt his waking hours," reads Thor's character description.</p>
<p>As in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, Amazon's live-action Thor is "now but a shadow of his former self", and has turned to alcohol in an attempt to drown out his demons. "Keeping his wife and children at arm's length has only deepened his isolation, but the power (and danger) of the God of Thunder is still there just beneath the surface," the <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/">description ends</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Thor, Homeland and Princess Bride actor Mandy Patinkin has been announced as the show's "most powerful Aesir god", Odin. "Odin, the All-Father, is not physically imposing or particularly god-like: but looks can be deceiving," reads his <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/mandy-patinkin-god-of-war-odin-1236644947/">God of War character description</a>, adding that Odin is a "patriarch who leads with an iron fist, and an unrivaled seeker of knowledge".</p><p>Odin - who is the father of Thor - is "paranoid, manipulative, and dangerous", and will serve as "a formidable antagonist" to God of War's lead, Kratos. The Aesir god will do "anything to try and prevent Ragnarök, the Norse end of days".</p>

<p>Ólafsson and Patinkin join an already impressive cast, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">Ryan Hurst as Kratos</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-casts-thors-wife-sif">Teresa Palmer as Phoebe/Sif</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ey-up-this-lad-from-emmerdale-is-playing-norse-god-heimdall-in-amazons-god-of-war-show-thats-norse-not-up-north">Max Parker as Heimdall</a>. Meanwhile, behind the camera, Amazon's God of War adaptation includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore</a>, who will serve as showrunner on the upcoming series, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Emmy winning Shōgun director Frederick E.O. Toye</a>.</p><p>"God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," reads the show's official logline. I wonder when we will hear who will play Atreus…?</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>.</p>

Nintendo's delightfully quirky <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream has been given the full reveal treatment ahead of its Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> release on 16th April.

When Tomodachi Life released for 3DS back in 2013, players disappointed at the absence of same-sex romances launched a social media campaign to encourage Nintendo to add them in a post-launch update. The company's initial response was dismissive, insisting Tomodachi Life was not a "real-life simulation" nor "trying to provide social commentary." Later, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-refuses-to-allow-same-sex-relationships-in-tomodachi-life">took a more conciliatory tone</a>, apologising and pledging that while it was unable to make such a "significant development change" to the 3DS version of Tomodachi Life, it would be "more inclusive" if another instalment ever came.

Over a decade later, Nintendo has made good on that promise. As revealed in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtYngxAs1k">30-minute-long Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct</a>, players can choose from three gender identities when creating their Miis in the new game - male, female, or non-binary - plus any combination of relationship preferences from the same list, effectively making it possible to create characters who're gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or heterosexual. And because this is Tomodachi Life, you also get to pick facial features, body shape, personality, even the silly computer-synthesised voices they'll use.
</p>
<p>
And once your Miis are ready to descend on their new island home, it largely looks like business as usual. Rather than controlling Miis directly, you'll encourage their growth by feeding them, giving them gifts, and creating new neighbours for them to interact with and befriend. And you can help introduce those friends to other friends, acting as a sort of omnipotent matchmaker to create a network of not always blissful social bonds.

<p>
Some encounters might happen while you're away from the game - perhaps your Mii will meet someone they take a fancy to - and you can keep abreast of events via the island's News Channel. Elsewhere, you can buy your Miis outfits from the clothing store, food from the supermarket, apartment decor from the Renovation Centre, and more exotic items - a lion?? - from the market stall. There's also a photo studio if you want to take some daft snaps.
</p><p>
Tomodachi Life residents might also make requests for island improvements from time to take, and you can decorate its outdoor spaces with everything from fences and picnic benches to new houses and additional terrain, all purchased from the Island Design Centre. And if you want to have a little more impact on your Miis, you can bestow them with quirks and traits, or drop them down at points of interest, so they can, say, jiggle in a sprinkler. It all looks as delightfully ridiculous as its predecessor, and that's before we get to the Studio Workshop where you can doodle your residents a 2D pet, or customise food, clothing, the TV channels they watch, and more. And yes there's romance, awkward love triangles, and marriage. Even shared housing for up to nine Miis.
</p>
<p>
Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches for Switch and Switch 2 on 16th April, but there's currently no word on any Switch 2-specific enhancements.

            <p>Nintendo is introducing image sharing restrictions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream in order to create experiences that are "welcoming and enjoyable for everyone".</p>
<p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">As seen on the Nintendo America website</a>, a statement laying out why these restrictions are in place have been included. They read as follows: "Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way. In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising, or unpredictable moments during gameplay.</p>
<p>"While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>

<p>"Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>"To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p>
<p>"We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo's ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays."</p>
<p>As for the extent of these restrictions, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">Japanese Nintendo website</a> lays it out clearly: "The following features are unavailable: image transfer to smartphones, direct posting to social media, and automatic image uploads (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> only)." You can still share images via the Switch 2 Game Chat function.</p><p>The reaction to these restrictions are, as you can imagine, negative. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-restricting-image-sharing-features-for-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream.1419745/">Take Dal from ResetEra</a>, who described the decision as "wacky". Racoon, on the same ResetEra post covering the decision, stated their belief that Nintendo "killed the game", adding: "social media was going to shoot this into the stratosphere, instead they killed it". Another, Mullet2000, summed up their thoughts as such: "Nintendo gonna Nintendo".</p>
<p>It's clear that Nintendo is implementing such measures in order to prevent folks from sharing images from the game that could be considered a bit <em>naughty. </em>But given the funny, easily meme-able moments present in Tomodachi Life, it does feel a bit like throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p>

            <p>For those who have been hearing all about this little show called Fallout, but don't have an Amazon Prime account and therefore haven't been able to keep up with the various wasteland chaos, I have some good news for you:</p>
<p>Fallout season one is streaming for a limited time on YouTube.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The first two episodes of season one - The End and The Target - are available now via Amazon's Prime YouTube channel, with the remaining episodes then releasing steadily over the coming days.</p>
<p>Here is the premier schedule for Fallout season one on YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li>S1E1 - 28th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E2 - 28th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E3 - 29th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E4 - 29th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E5 - 30th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E6 - 30th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E7 - 31st January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E8 - 31st January, 6pm PT</li>
</ul>
<p>For those in the UK, 5pm PT is 1am the following day, and so of course 6pm PT is 2am.</p>
<p>This means, if this is your thing, you could probably squeeze episodes three and four into your morning routine before heading off to work tomorrow (though I am not sure Fallout gore and breakfast are the best combination, but who am I to say what works for you).</p>
<p>As per Prime's YouTube description, these episodes will expire on 11th February, at 11:59 pm PT. Will you be giving season one a watch?</p>
