            <p>Hytale boss Simon Collins-Laflamme has called the Minecraft-like's recent early access launch "the most challenging but rewarding experience" of his life.</p>
<p>Hytale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">started development in 2015</a> and soon began garnering a lot of attention. However, Riot Games, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquired Hytale developer Hypixel Studios in 2020</a>, opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">cancel the project last June</a>. Thankfully, though, Hytale was saved when Hypixel co-founder Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">successfully re-acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year. Then, seven days ago, and after years of waiting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">Hytale finally released in early access</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the past week, Collins-Laflamme has now thanked the community for its support, and offered a "big thank you" to the "rebuilt Hytale team" for trusting him to get the game "to the finish line" in just a few months.</p>
<p>"I haven't been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976">wrote on social media</a>. "I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference."</p><p>Ahead of Hytale's release, Hypixel announced its Minecraft-alike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">had already sold enough copies to fund the next two years of development</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," Collins-Laflamme said at the time, "we are looking very strong for the future."</p>

<p>Or, if you are unsure if Hytale is for you, our Matt has already given it a shot. "This week's early access release feels like a splendid start; a flexible, well-featured - and already enjoyable - foundation with plenty of polish and attention to detail," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">Eurogamer's Hytale Now Playing feature</a>.</p>

            <p>Raymond Bartos, producer on the World of Warcraft team, has announced his new role at a rival studio. He'll now be working on a whole new MMO, the much-anticipated and very mysterious Riot Games MMO no less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417390270268329984/">In a post on Bartos' Linkedin</a>, he wrote the following alongside a collection of pictures at Riot Games' LA office: "From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values--and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process. It made it obvious that kindness, respect, and care aren't just words here, but something the team truly lives by.</p>
<p>"I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can't wait to get started--showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy."</p>

<p>Bartos was part of the team which shipped the popular Plunderstorm mode for World of Warcraft, as well as multiple limited-time remix modes and the game's 20th anniversary event. Bartos also noted he'll be working alongside one Orlando Salvatore, another former World of Warcraft veteran who jumped ship to Riot Games late last year.</p><p>There are in fact quite a few big names, formerly of Blizzard, that have ended up working on this MMO. Natalia Leenhardt was an 11-year alumni at the company before joining Amazon Game Studios in 2021 for New World, later joining the Riot Games MMO team in 2023. Kevin Carter joined Riot back in 2017 after over ten years at Blizzard, and of course the old executive producer on the Riot MMO Greg Street was a legendary World of Warcraft developer,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-mmo-producer-departing-riot-games"> though he left back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So what do we know about the Riot MMO? Not much! We know it's set in the Runeterra universe, like most of Riot Games' works are. We know the game had a "reset in direction" some years ago, and that there's been very little in the way of on-the-record discussion about it. That is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkyjsM31Epk">except for an interview with League lore content creator Necrit back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So there's been no word of any sort of reveal as of yet, nor any sort of timeline as to when we're likely to see it happen. Still, the continued hiring of staff is certainly a good indicator that serious work is being done.</p>

            <p>Kenny Sun and Friends' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ball-x-pit-review">Ball x Pit</a> was among <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">Eurogamer's favourite games of 2025</a>, so imagine our excitement when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCmmoL2Mtq0">it was confirmed</a> free content drops were set to arrive this year. Now, the wait for the first major update is almost over.</p>
<p>On 19th January, publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481?l=english">the game's official channels</a> confirmed The Regal Update is coming on 26th January to all platforms. That's really soon and before we expected, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-2">February looking far busier</a> than January when it comes to new game releases, I guess it makes sense to push it out now.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>BALL x PIT’s first FREE major update, The Regal Update, launches on January 26th on all platforms! </p><p>Adding:<br>🤠2 new characters - The Carouser &amp; The Falconer<br>🏐8 new balls<br>🎯New passives<br>✨Plus a nice surprise you’re going to love! <a href="https://t.co/t0tYlwjOXk">pic.twitter.com/t0tYlwjOXk</a></p></div>— BALL x PIT 🏐 OUT NOW (@BALLxPIT) <a href="https://twitter.com/BALLxPIT/status/2013296280261234716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As explained by the official posts and the short but goofy trailer, we can expect to get two new characters, eight new balls, and an unspecified number of new passives. We're also taking bets on what that extra surprise might be. Patch notes should be with us soon.</p>
<p>The first hunter (more like juggler) is The Carouser, "whose returning balls orbit around him." Start thinking about those area-of-effect and defensive builds now. The other one makes use of two ball-shooting birds to up the DPS and is fittingly called The Falconer. As for the eight new balls, the powers that be have decided to keep them a secret, but looking at the many possible combos already in the game, getting several new additions to the arsenal at once will shake meta builds up for sure.</p><p>Similarly, there's no word on the teased new passives, but a fair criticism of the game is its lack of an actual endgame beyond re-doing the entire journey on a higher level of difficulty or maxing out stats that kinda become pointless past a certain point. In a space dominated by roguelite winners with a more ambitious approach to endgame loops, we're curious to see whether the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ball-x-pit-the-kenny-sun-story">Ball x Pit</a> can keep the diehards busy in the long run.</p>

            <section><p>2XKO is a tag fighter like no other, with a bold aesthetic and superbly crafted core gameplay experience. Beloved League of Legends characters are revitalised in a new light in a truly stunning free-to-play experience.</p></section>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> fighting game is the sort of idea only the most stoned bozo, most gormless ruffian, could have dreamt up a decade or so ago. It stands in the day-dream pantheon of a Riot Games MMO (wait a minute), or some kind of League of Legends trading card game (hang on a second). Yet, despite the odds not only does such a game exist, but it's class A kino. Though, not without fault.</p>
<p>2XKO is a free-to-play 2v2 tag fighting game from Riot Games, the studio behind such powerhouses like League of Legends and Valorant. Set as a sort of alternate spin on the League of Legends universe, it snatches characters from that game, morphing them into fighters, and lets you duke it out with folks online. You can even play alongside a friend on your team, adding a fun dynamic to the typical fighting game affair. You want to see your favourite character with a bit more funk about them? This game is a platform for that.</p>

<p>The game lies somewhere in the middle of the genre in terms of pacing - more hectic than genre mainstays like Tekken or Street Fighter while not going quite as wild as other tag fighters like the Marvel vs Capcom series or various anime fighting games. Great effort has been spent on the tag system itself, how a player (or two) can weave between characters to perform impressive feats. It is a game oozing with quality-of-life features, a sort-of tailored experience aiming to impress both those with a history in the genre and bright-eye newcomers alike.</p>
<p>So it's good news that this dedication to making a rich, velvety tag system has paid off so well in 2XKO. It all feels so fluid, so responsive. You throw out an assist with one character, charge up a heavy attack with another, then effortlessly tag into that assist just before the heavy goes off and it all just…works. At the ground level it's an energetic twist, but the higher you climb in terms of expertise the more these systems flourish into a sea of possibilities. It’s easy to learn, difficult to master: fighting game potential in its purest form.</p>

<p>Then you add the fuse system. This is an invention in its own class, but for comparison’s sake plays a similar role to Grooves in the Capcom vs SNK series - team modifiers that totally flip what you're able to do with your characters. This can include chaining supers together, expanding your options when tagging between characters altogether, or placing your second character into a more supportive role.</p><p>There is one dud in fuses that I've been torn on for some time: Juggernaut. This fuse removes the tag system entirely, in favour of a solitary, buffed-up fighter with a few extra boons to help them contend with two-character teams. After a few months playing the game, I ultimately see little purpose to Juggernaut, save for a concession to potential players who could be scared away from tag mechanics in this tag game.</p>
<p>It seems intended as a training tool, but shuts players off from the real meat and potatoes of 2XKO. It also appears to be a balancing nightmare: too strong and it feels as though those engaging with tag mechanics are working twice as hard for damage Juggernaut players can manage easily; too weak, and it feels utterly helpless against even middling players with access to a second character. If it were meant to be the suggested way to first engage with 2XKO, the game wouldn't recommend the Double Down fuse as a default. I'm left wishing Juggernaut was removed altogether.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>A game like this, without the tag mechanic, is far less interesting than the typical 2XKO match. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Especially given that 2XKO is not lacking in accessibility options to help people gradually embrace its more complicated bits. You can toggle on easy inputs (called Pulse Combos) in character select, making a game without motion inputs all the easier. The difference in damage between a Pulse Combo and one performed manually is, for the fledgling player just starting out, inconsequential. One fuse, Sidekick, allows a player to sit back and assist their duo partner, lessening damage and supporting from the sidelines in an ingenious onboarding mechanic that allows the unconfident out there to dip their toe in with a friend, without feeling like they're letting the team down.</p><p>The game is also free, which counts for a lot. It is not the first free-to-play fighting game by any means, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killer-instinct">Killer Instinct</a> had a free version over a decade ago, and Brawlhalla remains less-acknowledged than it probably deserves as a popular free-to-play platform fighter. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/granblue-fantasy-versus">Granblue Fantasy Versus</a>' free rotation of characters leaned into this, too. Still, 2XKO feels like the first time the live service hilt has been gripped with both hands. A rotating store of premium skins and seasonal battle pass supporting what is frankly a fighting game at the same level of quality as the premium <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>.</p>
<p>The game is, I believe, inherently an ankle-breaker. Meaning even intermediate play is complex by nature of the tag mechanics at the heart of 2XKO. A player using the 2X Assist fuse is playing their own game in which the goal is to hit you from cruel and unusual angles. Those using Double Down will use one character's super as cover for their second's largely incontestable offence. It matters little how slight an angle the ramp to 2XKO is, you will quite quickly be faced with The Sauce.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The game offers a rich amount of avatar customisation, with even a brand activation here and there. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now The Sauce is wonderful, and any good fighting game (like any good lasagna) needs plenty of it. In this liquid float hundreds of hours of Rocky-esque personal improvement. It's certainly what I play fighting games for, but I do worry that certain characters or design decisions may drown greener players in the slurry. Yasuo and Ekko, for example, are rich in skill expression and downright dirty in their ability to style on people with high-flying combos and outrageous mix-ups. I have seen Yasuo do things while playing 2XKO that have left me giggling, while Ekko's kit is so laden with powerful tools like his time winder projectile or Chronostrike that he appears as a smorgasbord to those with a taste for the genre's intricacies.</p><p>I believe the reason why he and Ekko have remained so strong throughout the game's early access release up until today (even with launch-day nerfs) is because, at its heart, 2XKO was built for characters like Ekko and Yasuo. They were clearly designed by fighting game fanatics who wanted to make a game in which the most rancid gameplay is possible. These characters will remain strong in spite of nerfs unless totally maimed, because their strength lies not in damage numbers, but in intentional design.</p>
<p>It's not just those two either. Warwick has gained a reputation of sorts as of late for ravaging scores of online players thanks to his speedy and unrelenting offence. There are multiple characters that are excellent Zoners, built to keep you at a distance with powerful projectiles, though all able to convert ranged pressure into beautiful combos. Blitzcrank is for the grappler goons out there, a down-and-dirty robot able to snatch opponents from a distance and slam them into the ground for loads of damage. All of these characters were painted with a master's brush, all of them nasty.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>It's no secret the cosmetics team have done great work here. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is totally fine, if not brilliant news, for those in love with fighting games already: training mode monsters, frame-data physicians and patch note academics. For the sizeable portion of potential players 2XKO is hoping to win over? I'm not so sure. With all the effort put into making 2XKO tempting for fighting game newbies, it is clearly in essence a game for fanatics. The argument 2XKO is built around is this: you do not need to make a fighting game shallow nor drain it of its complexity to attract a curious wave of new players. All you need to do is offer tools to help players engage with a fighting game's more daunting aspects. If millions play complicated games like League of Legends or Valorant, why not a fighting game like 2XKO?</p><p>Time will ultimately tell I suppose, but the 2XKO team have clearly gone all-in on this and in doing so have foregone the typical offering its contemporaries have. There is no story mode, no arcade mode, nor any bonus casual alternative mode for a more relaxing experience.  There is no Street Fighter 6 World Tour counterpart, nor an ARAM equivalent that League of Legends players may be familiar with. If the direction is right, it could very well be a bridge between untold thousands and the unique bounty of fighting games. If Riot is wrong, 2XKO could be the most delicious rum and raisin ice cream ever made, trying to win over crowds of vanilla enjoyers. It's a game built around the joys of tag fighters. As someone who has tried and failed to get friends to play 2XKO, I remain unconvinced of this strategy.</p>
<p>What I will say is that for those who do stick around with 2XKO, they'll find a game bolstered with quality in almost all areas. It's Saturday night stunning, a fascinating divergence from the stylised fantasy of League of Legends. If the father MOBA to 2XKO is a hand-drawn illustration, then 2XKO is a more rebellious cell-shaded piece. An almost punky, vibrant game in which characters erupt from excellently-crafted backgrounds and VFX. I love that the team had the confidence to break out in its own direction, remaining faithful to the source material while also making bold changes to beloved characters where it wanted to. Blitzcrank is the prime example of this, a character who is certainly showing his age in League of Legends but has found new life as a bulkier brawler in 2XKO. Not an easy thing to do, but done with class here.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>One look at Blitzcrank's 2XKO design is all it took for me to know the roster is in good hands. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I do wish there were more characters, and that’s a running theme ever since 2XKO's early access release. A launch cast of 12 is solid, there's no doubt. But given the tag nature of the game, you end up seeing a similar cast of fighters often (especially when the meta has clear winners already). The passing of time will resolve this, there's no doubt, and the fuse system does go a long way in remixing a team in interesting fashion, but nonetheless you can only see Warwick so many times before you tire of the dog.</p><p>The same is true for the music in 2XKO. The game has this blend of electronic and metal across the board which certainly helps set it apart from other fighting games out there. Guitars and electronics duel it out on the main menu screen, while character-themes on occasion pop in during tense moments. Some of these are darn catchy, like Darius' mean Metal anthem and Blitzcrank's more dubstep-y tune. However, one of the quirks of 2XKO's dynamic music system is that you're, sadly, unlikely to hear them much. I would very much love a BGM select option in the future.</p>
<p>The online netcode in 2XKO is exceptional. Very rarely did I encounter matches which I considered unplayable, or frustratingly laggy, a testament to the infrastructure Riot has provided. Given how good it is, I find it puzzling that no options for cross-region play are available for public matchmaking. I know for a fact that matches between the UK and US are of good quality, I played on an American account last year prior to the early access release and it was truly impressive. Given that you can play on different regional servers in other modern fighting games, it's a shame that 2XKO (with netcode likely far surpassing what's present in those titles) does not allow it. Perhaps a quirk with the 2v2 nature of the game, or a Riot server. A shame, nonetheless.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>2XKO presents beloved characters in a new light, on that suits them rather well. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Riot Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In terms of the game's live service component, it's a rather fair one. You can earn all the new characters as they release if you play the game regularly, and you are given access to a healthy number of cosmetics by just playing the game, rather than having to fork out cash for nice skins. What skins you can buy <em>are </em>a bit pricey perhaps, but the bills must be paid and, to be honest, I'm more than comfortable slapping down around £17 for a costume I fancy.</p><p>Plus, a dedicated skinline exists in 2XKO that contributes to real-world grassroots tournaments around the world. Riot Games's willingness to send money to the game's competitive scene through in-game microtransactions is a lovely touch that shows an eagerness to support the game's most dedicated players, and makes busting out the wallet feel like supporting a good cause.</p>

<p>2XKO is undoubtedly a fantastic fighting game. It's clearly been created by a talented team head-over-heels with the genre, with a boundless understanding of what fighting game players want from a modern title. It is not perfect, nor the genre saviour eager beavers drooled about years ago, but for a studio's first venture into a genre dominated by legacy franchises, it's a game that matches or surpasses those with bold new ideas. The question now is this: can 2XKO win over enough people to go the distance, and use its launch momentum to continue building a true live service fighting game? Or, will it wilt in the niche shadows? I hope for the former.</p>

            <p>Developer 1047 Games will add an Arena Royale mode to Splitgate Arena Reloaded later this week.</p>
<p>Arena Royale allows 24 players to team into six groups of four, and is "built to play at a similar pace and length to a traditional arena match". With this mode, as long as at least one member in a team remains alive, the rest of the squad is able to respawn. Well, at least until the final circle. When that arrives, the respawns end, "and it's all about survival". Ooh.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Arena Royale will allow for a better flow of action when it goes live on 22nd January, 1047 says, while also reducing downtime "significantly".</p>
<p>"Matches take place within a single biome," it explains, "keeping the experience tight and focused. This allows Arena Royale to emphasise constant action, fast fights, and moment-to-moment decision making rather than long stretches of setup or traversal. The result is a faster, cleaner take on battle royale that still feels unmistakably Splitgate."</p><p>Alongside the new mode, Splitgate Arena Reloaded's forthcoming update also adds two new maps, known as Trihard and Runway. Trihard takes players to the clouds, while Runway is set in a neon cityscape "inspired by the energy and density of Shinjuku". There's also a new endgame mastery camo on the cards, as well as a limited-time event - Teabag Takeover. Yes, that's actually what it's called, and yes, it's what you think it is.</p>
<p>"This new Limited Event is a celebration of a long-forgotten sign of respect. Some might even call it an elegant greeting, for a more civilised age," 1047 says. So, basically, players jump into matches and "teabag their opponents to earn points toward unlocking new teabag themed rewards".</p>
<p>Teabag Takeover arrives 23rd January. In the meantime, you can find more details about Splitgate Arena Reloaded's update in the video below.</p>

<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded started life as Splitgate 2, but after the sequel failed to hit the mark, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">1047 took it back into beta last July</a>, resulting in a number of layoffs at the studio.

            <p>As we prepare for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, set to finally launch in May, and celebrate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-all-time-classic">Hitman 3's five-year anniversary</a>, we've received news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> is, at long last, getting cross-progression support.</p>
<p>We figured this would happen at some point, especially after last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port and with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hitman/new-game-after-world-of-assassination-co-op">more content set to arrive this year</a>, but with all eyes on James Bond's game right now, it was hard to predict its arrival. Today, 20th January, <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account">IOI confirmed</a> the feature will be available starting 3rd February. Additionally, a "brand-new, fresh look launches today" for the IOI Account service on browsers and mobile phones.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">full cross-progression guide</a> with FAQ was shared, but the gist of the news is that players will be able to take their Hitman: WoA (the combination of Hitman 1, 2, and 3 under a single roof) progress with them no matter what device they play on. For example, you could launch your PC save on the PS5 in your living room and later continue your killing sprees on the go with the Switch 2 version... as long as you have access to an online connection.</p>
<p>IOI also revealed that a Steam patch (3.250.1) will be arriving next week, which will ensure everything is working for the new cross-progression functionality. Players will have to select, after logging on their IOI Account, a "primary platform" the other devices will follow. Game licences, DLC purchases, and unlocks tied to DLCs aren't shared, meaning you'll have to own all required content on each platform where you want to use cross-progression. That's how the feature has always worked, but it's good to remind the more casual crowd of its limitations.</p><p>On the matter of the saves themselves, IOI also notes "old save games created on a non-primary linked account will not be loadable while Cross-Progression is active." In summary, the system will only recognize saves tied to the IOI Account system, so we recommend making sure everything's properly updated and connected if you intend to embrace this feature.</p>
<p>As a footnote, IOI has also reminded players the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> to 3 "carryover" process will close come 3rd February so all progress is locked to the latest iteration of the three-part sandbox game. The company's approach to progression and upgrades has always been slightly too convoluted and often led to confusion, so it makes sense the devs are being extra careful ahead of this major feature drop.</p>
<p>If you're waiting for news on Hitman's future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-there-will-be-more-hitman-after-007-first-light-io-interactive-assures">IOI hasn't shied away from teasing there are plans in place</a>, but don't expect a reveal until World of Assassination's co-op mode and 007 First Light are out.</p>

<p>On Death Stranding's initial release, we here at Eurogamer were quite taken with it. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s first post-Metal Gear game is a messy, indulgent vanity project - but also a true original," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-review-a-baffling-haunting-grand-folly">Eurogamer's Death Stranding review</a>, with former editor Oli Welsh slapping it with a Recommended badge. He called it all a "baffling, haunting, grand folly".</p><p>Then we have Indika, which is another favourite among the team. In Indikia, players take control of the titular nun, who is looking to adjust to a monastic life. However, she also has a connection with none other than the devil. Our Matt described Indika as "a dark, surreal, and devilishly playful drama" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indika-review">Eurogamer's four star review</a>.</p>
<p>"Bleak realism meets absurdist fairytale in a stylish, surreal, and astonishingly sure-footed - if mechanically unadventurous - exploration of faith, free will, and demonic temptation," he wrote of Indika.</p>

            <p>Larian Studios' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">new Divinity game</a> has been the talk of town since it was revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a>. Even the comments on potential gen-AI use, ensuing backlash, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">course-correction</a> haven't sunk the excitement around the next RPG from the developers behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. In fact, the 2023 CRPG and the studio's previous game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-original-sin-2-review">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, have seen a surge in popularity.</p>
<p>Though <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/#max">BG3's hold for the past couple of years</a> has been quite solid, users took to social media on 20th January to point out it was faring well even in the face of new releases and online giants like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">Arc Raiders</a>. Larian boss Swen Vincke, who's also leading development on the new Divinity, quickly added a quick comment on their previous two games' very enduring appeal:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p><p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time :) <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p></div>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>It must be noted Vincke talked about sales for both games, which aren't fully represented by the actual concurrent players activity we're seeing. Moreover, we only have access to data on Steam's numbers, but with Larian's catalogue seeing recent sales across all the available platforms and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/divinity-original-sin-2-official-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-series-xs-ps5-launch-trailer">Original Sin 2 getting a native Switch 2 port and current-gen upgrades</a>, it's not hard to believe many folks are finally jumping on the massive RPGs now.</p>
<p>The developer also stated the previous Divinity game has had its best month since its launch in 2017, which might be true if you look at the full picture (again, we'll have to believe Larian here), but doesn't fit <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/435150/charts/#max">SteamDB's all-time chart</a>, which you can also find below.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game's highest post-launch peak is found on March 2020, right as the Covid pandemic started, when it got to 30,882 concurrent players. This month, it reached its best numbers (27,409) since then though.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/#max">As for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, its best post-launch moments happened in January 2024 (297,492) and April 2025 (169, 267). Right now, it's sitting at (127,254) on Steam. Again, the total could be much higher across all platforms.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a side note, Larian has also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-will-certainly-consider-a-divinity-switch-2-release">the studio will consider a Nintendo Switch 2 port of Divinity</a> as well as look into supporting Steam Deck again after BG3's success on Valve's handheld PC.</p>

            <p>
Following last week's announcement that long-running MMO The Elder Scrolls Online would be moving away from traditional major expansions to focus on smaller seasonal updates, developer ZeniMax Online has insisted the big shake-up is in no way related to last year's sweeping layoffs at parent company Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report">heavily impacted</a> the studio.
</p>
<p>
Last July, in a year that saw Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella boast "record performance" and a revenue increase to $281.7bn, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">announced mass layoffs</a> affecting over 9000 employees across the company, marking its third round of significant job cuts since 2023. The move - which impacted numerous Xbox studios including Rare, Turn 10, The Initiative, and Raven Software - was accompanied by multiple project cancellations.

ZeniMax Online Studios' in-development sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird was one of the games impacted, and its cancellation coincided with nearly 200 job cuts at the studio. But following last week's announcement that <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69137">The Elder Scrolls Online would be shifting to smaller seasonal releases</a>, executive producer Susan Kath has insisted the two events are unrelated.
</p>
<p>
"Seasons is not in any way a response to [the layoffs]," Kath <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">recently told RockPaperShotgun</a>. "We kicked off the Season work at least 12 to 14 months ago. We started making the changes in the team to move in this direction, knowing that this was our intent."
</p><p>
Kath describes 2025 as a "hard year for the studio", but acknowledges Blackbird's cancellation could be seen as a positive for ESO. "Ultimately, we had a lot of people doing double duty on those projects, splitting their time between projects," she continued. "[They] are now devoted 100 percent to Elder Scrolls Online. So, in fact, in some capacities, we actually increased the number of folks available as we came out of that because they weren't managing two products anymore. They were only devoted to one title."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax first publicly discussed the idea of smaller updates for The Elder Scrolls Online shortly after the layoffs. In September, studio game director Rich Lambert <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> the MMO was in "a bit of a transition year", and that the team was now looking to get "smaller, more bite-sized things out quicker". The aim, he said, was to launch these smaller updates roughly every six to nine months, compared to the 12-15 month release schedule for traditional expansions. And last week, ZeniMax formalised its plans, announcing a move to smaller, quarterly - and free - seasons, starting 2nd April, which will also see many earlier paid expansions rolled into the base game. This change coincides with the introduction of a seasonal (but not time-limited) battle pass, featuring a free tier and two paid extensions.

<p>
In a press briefing attended by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">RPS</a> ahead of the announcement, Elder Scrolls Online game director Nick Giaomini insisted the shift would give the team the "flexibility to make our game more exciting and invest in addressing long standing pain points, add features and improvements players have been asking for, and update and iterate on the core game, rather than always just chasing something brand new."
</p><p>
"To say that [the layoffs] didn't impact us wouldn't be right," Giacomini added. "We're putting on a strong face. We're human. It absolutely impacted us. But, you know, the team rallied. We're excited about the future. We're excited that we're making all these big changes."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon</a> is celebrating its 30th anniversary on 27th February, and we're collectively dying to see what might be revealed about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">long-rumoured next mainline game</a> and other projects. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> aims to shake things up with a new take on town life sims in early March. In its beginnings, however, the series took a long time to figure out.</p>
<p>This is what The Pokémon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara said during a brief appearance at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HNNugGXKQ0">New York Game Awards</a> through a special video (hat tip to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/pokemons-game-boy-development-process-took-a-great-deal-of-trial-and-error">Nintendo Life</a>). The franchise as a whole <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-to-receive-prestigious-award-at-the-15th-annual-new-york-game-awards">received the Andrew Yoon Legend Award</a>, which celebrates a "sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p>
<p>Ishihara took this opportunity to reflect on the series' humble origins. The games were made with "limited resources" back then, and he underlined Red and Green took "a great deal of trial and error" to get right and to the finish line. He even revealed the entire process ended up lasting six years, which is shocking to learn about when you consider dev cycles back in the day were substantially shorter than nowadays. What now feels normal rarely happened back then.</p>
<p>We know it all paid off in the end, and much like us, Ishihara believes it was all about having a strong base-level idea the team was confident about: "Still, we all felt confident in the main gameplay elements that would become the foundation of the Pokémon video game series: catch, raise, trade, and battle." These elements were designed with nostalgic themes and warm feelings in mind, as it was all tied to "fundamental experiences" many players had as children who connected with nature.</p><p>That said, he was "uncertain at first" about its appeal outside Japan as many formative childhood experiences aren't shared. Needless to say, there was nothing to be scared of. After that initial hit, Pokémon's core themes of friendship and our (often very complicated) relationship with the world shaped the franchise's identity.</p>
<p>No comments on the next main game from Ishihara beyond continuing to use those tenets as a "major driving force," but that could change soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-all-time-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>I can still very clearly remember the first time I was told anything about 2016's Hitman, the soft reboot of the adventures of gaming's most-beloved slaphead. It was at an industry event, several months before the game was due to be announced at E3 2015. It was the usual sort of 'told about a game early' affair. Someone from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> gushed over a pint.</p>
<p>"It's going to be f**king amazing," they enthuse in my strangely clear memory of the exchange, which I paraphrase here. "It has this system where extra assassination targets are sent down over the internet, and you only get one shot at them. If they escape, they're gone forever. We're getting celebrities for it.</p>
<p>"Like, imagine you get to assassinate someone famous, like Justin Bieber, but it's a one-time thing." I recall that Bieber, who ultimately never appeared in Hitman, was the one on this person's lips for whatever reason. I remember the exchange, I suppose, because it was such a novel idea. At the same time, I know I also wasn't <em>that</em> fussed about what I was told. My appreciation for Hitman had been dampened by 2012's Absolution, and my enthusiasm for Square Enix's western slate in general was low. If someone from Square was going to get candid over a pint at that time, I wanted to hear the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a> development gossip from Tokyo. This speaks to the hill that Hitman 2016 had to climb.</p>
<p>Fast forward a year or so and I remember going to play Hitman 2016 for a preview beat. One of Square Enix's public relations people at the time was the sort of person who did a diligent job on every title, but also had an energy where you could <em>really tell</em> if they were personally excited by a game. WIth Hitman 2016, it was clear they thought this was something properly special - which in a sense ignited my enthusiasm for it more than even the hands-on did. The final game later arrives and… it was magic, right? An instant click. Sometimes, a developer happens upon the correct formula like a cheat code. They find the dopamine button in your brain and hammer it mercilessly.</p><p>It hasn't been plain sailing, obviously. When you look at the journey <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has taken here, it's actually sort of wild. The first game had that forward-thinking but messily-communicated episodic release structure, which I still feel kneecapped its sales performance. As a Square Enix subsidiary, Hitman 2016's performance was apparently too soft amidst a general vibe of a retreat from the West at the publisher. In a rare instance of corporate kindness, IO and Hitman were sold into independence rather than closed or flogged to a culture-destroying third party. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> was then published by WB Games - and by the third, IO took its shot at full self-publishing independence.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IOI</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We're now five years on from IO's release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, and since then things have changed further still. Over the last five years, Hitman 3 has morphed from being the third in a trilogy to a complete trilogy package, and expanded with extra maps, modes, and of course those limited-time assassinations, which between me first hearing about them and release were given the moniker 'Elusive Target'.</p>
<p>At what point is it alright to put the hammer down and declare something a true, bonafide all-timer? A year? Five? Ten? I don't know. Maybe it's all relative. I expect we all knew that Super Mario 64 was an all-timer just about the day it came out. Breath of the Wild too, probably? But in my mind the cultural milestone nature of Rock Band, Arkham Asylum, or even Minecraft all took a while to sink in. So perhaps the point is malleable. And, of course, it's all subjective.</p><p>I digress. I think enough time has passed, and I think as the game that'd ultimately become the 'complete' World of Assassination package turns five, the earth has revolved around the sun enough times for us to have clarity and hindsight: Hitman: World of Assassination is an all-timer, and certainly should appear on any list of the greatest video games of all time.</p>
<p>The sandbox IO Interactive has built is incredible. It's video game purity in every sense - the clockwork worlds which you can carefully learn, the 'living' NPCs that are perfectly pitched in their predictable, exploitable stupidity… it is unashamed, unalloyed video gaming. There's minor ambitions towards the cinematic - but never at the cost of that formula where each level is an intricate Rube Goldberg machine, and you and 47 are the invader that mangles up the gears and sends the simulation flying off in unexpected, delightful, hugely satisfying ways that are as likely to be plan-breaking as affirming.</p>
<p>There is seldom a 'big', 'triple-A', single-player game that one can learn inside-out and replay again and again in this way. I treat Hitman as I do Balatro or the criminally underrated Dungeon Encounters (a gloriously stripped-back and refined RPG) - it is a simple yet brilliantly dense evergreen comfort blanket of a game.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>And the best thing of all? God, it just keeps getting better. Freelancer mode, introduced back in 2023, is a revelation of replayability. And those elusive targets still keep coming with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-agent-47-will-soon-be-able-to-assassinate-casino-royale-baddy-la-chiffre">a raft</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rapper-eminem-stars-in-the-next-elusive-target-mission-coming-to-hitman-world-of-assassination">celebrity</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-next-elusive-target-is-jean-claude-the-splitter-van-damme">appearances</a> that don't just drop a new NPC and a bit of voiceover into existing maps, but fully convert and adapt them with new visuals, mechanics, and more. The best elusive targets feel like you're playing properly messed up mods, like somebody has hacked the game - and these days, they <em>all</em> feel like that.</p><p>All of this is also a testament, I suppose, to independence. While Square Enix clearly believed in the World of Assassination vision enough to bankroll the first game, they clearly didn't have subsequent belief to continue. IO Interactive did and has ultimately reaped the rewards - and to be fair, much of what has been accomplished likely could not have been in a larger publishing operation. The way Hitman 3 has morphed into a hub for content from all three games, for instance, and the way it continues to deliver free content five years after release, feels like the sort of forward-thinking generosity only an independent studio could manage.</p>
<p>The truth is also that because Hitman's greatness accrued over time, like a snowball rolling down an ice-capped mountain, little of the launch criticism for any of the three games could truly predict how great it would become. That's what hindsight is for. Five years of hindsight tells us this: yes, it is an all-timer. Excellent work, 47.</p>

            <p>One of the original Tomb Raider creators has shared some details on a previous request from a Japanese publisher, which asked the team to give Lara Croft an anime-style redesign to make her more widely appealing.</p>
<p>According to Paul Douglas - who in his own words "co-created Tomb Raider half a lifetime ago" - publisher Victor Interactive wanted the team to change up Lara's in-game look to "appeal more to a Japanese audience".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The Tomb Raider creator said this redesign request included ideas for Lara to have "huge eyes/head etc". Douglas added the publisher went so far as to send over a fax with some design suggestions late in Tomb Raider's development. However, fellow Tomb Raider developer Toby Gard "didn't really want to alter Lara", Douglas said on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cnhyv.bsky.social/post/3mcq3dxcwv22o">Bluesky account</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/CoreDesign_com">@CoreDesign_com</a>).</p>
<p>In order to keep both parties happy, a compromise was reached. This saw Tomb Raider's manual and guide feature more "manga-style" characters, though Douglas is "not sure who did that render or illustrations".</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/cnhyv/status/1362414841424728073">Back in 2021</a>, Douglas shared some images of these characters, with a few extra background notes. At this time, the Tomb Raider co-creator said he believed Victor "just assumed altering all the models would only take a few days of work".  However, this was "early days of 3D... 🙄", so would of course take considerable time.</p>
<p>"It started out as a request to change all the in-game and cutscene models.Then just in-game. Then just Lara. Then just Lara's head…"</p>

<p>The original Tomb Raider is currently getting a from the ground up remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">known as Legacy of Atlantis</a>. This will be released later this year, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam.</p>
<p>Along with the remake, Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> entry with Amazon. It's known as Catalyst, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">takes Lara to Northern India</a>. Earlier this week, Eva La Dare - known to many as Sheva Alomar in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-5-and-street-fighter-actor-confirms-tomb-raider-catalyst-role">announced she was part of Tomb Raider: Catalyst's cast</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A top-to-bottom Atari-themed hotel is increasingly close to becoming a reality. A location has been found - in the centre of Phoenix, Arizona - and the company responsible, Intersection Development, says construction will begin late 2026 with a prospective opening date of late 2028.</p>
<p>The architectural company designing the building, Räkkhaus, revealed updated designs and features for the hotel. Renders show a large but not enormous building bearing the Atari logo and decked out with bright lighting everywhere. To me it looks like an arcade version of an Ibis.</p>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<p>But to borrow from the press release's much more poetic language: the Atari Hotel uses the "visual language" of Tron and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> to create a "glowing monolith of light and motion" (I bet the neighbours are pleased). The "fractured" design on the outside of the building is supposed to evoke pixel grids, and the streaks of light on the inside are supposed to remind us of arcade circuitry.</p><p>A defining feature will apparently be an LED-lit "breezeway" (pictured top) - a passage wrapped in programmable LEDs - which can be programmed to suit whatever event or season makes sense at the time. Räkkhaus reckons it'll feel like a portal from the outside world into the hotel.</p>

</figure>
<p>The 90,000 sqft building will also feature a 20,000 sqft concert center, an esports venue, several restaurants, retail spaces and an "oversized pool designed for high-energy parties and gatherings". There will be 72 rooms in the building - a nod to Atari being founded in 1972 - as well as 19 suites and a "Baller Suite" penthouse with a private pool, spa and sun deck.</p><p>Räkkhaus creative director Zac Cohen called it: "A tower defined by motion, responsive surfaces, and a frame that glows with its own internal logic. This is placemaking at a new scale, a building that will be truly unique in the world."</p>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<p>However, there's still a slight question over the Atari Hotel securing the rest of the funding it needs in order to be built. Because although $14m has been raised in investment to get things going, the total budget is estimated at $124m, according to the <a href="https://www.atarihotels.com/">Atari Hotels website</a>.</p>
<p>Intersection hopes to make the money by asking the public to invest. For a minimum investment of $500, you can own a piece of the project - the land, the building and the Atari Hotel name, apparently - as well as receive various owner perks.</p><p>"You're helping turn an iconic gaming legacy into a real destination and you'll share in the success of the project along the way. Think of it as owning a piece of the experience, not just the idea," says the Atari Hotel website FAQ.</p>

<p>It's not clear what will happen if the money is not raised by the public, though, and whether the Atari Hotel will be constructed anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/">The Atari Hotels were first announced six years ago in 2020</a>, as part of a masterplan to build a chain of them around the US. The first were earmarked for Las Vegas, Nevada, and Phoenix, Arizona, but the Vegas plans have been dropped along the way. <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/">The Las Vegas Sun reported</a> that the company explored deals in the city but none came to fruition.</p>
<p>Originally an architectural company called Gensler was attached to the Atari Hotel project and shared concept images that were much grander, featuring taller buildings with far more elaborate structures and designs. These new designs are more mundane, but perhaps more realistic as a result. Phoenix also makes sense as a starting place with both Räkkhaus and Intersection having offices in the city.</p>

            <p>With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-the-switch-2-getting-more-expensive-soon-nintendo-says-theres-no-immediate-impact-but-will-keep-an-eye-on-volatile-memory-market">menace of price hikes</a> looming over every piece of gaming hardware and early 2026 reports that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Nintendo Switch 2 was below Switch 1's sales curve over its first December period</a> in the US and Europe, many have started to wonder if we were looking at a strong start with bad legs for the newest hybrid console. But, in Japan at least, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-console-game-market-grew-by-138-8-in-2025-driven-by-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Automaton West</a> (from original reports by Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu), we have learned Japan's console game market saw a big boost year-on-year in 2025, with a 138.8 percent growth across the board. It reached 418.13 billion yen, which amounts to around $2.64 billion. These figures are based on physical software and hardware sales as reported through the end of 2025, so they include the bulk of the Christmas shopping we typically see every December.</p>
<p>Mind you, we haven't seen the more specific data for the Christmas period, but overall, Japan's console game market is looking remarkably strong, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pierre485.bsky.social/post/3mbwj5lp24s2o">outpacing Switch 1's first year</a> (and every other console's, it seems) in Nintendo's home turf. Things look even better when we take into account that digital sales, DLC, and in-game purchases are not accounted for in the aforementioned reports.</p>
<p>Moreover, the original Switch continued to perform well given its age and the presence of Nintendo's second hybrid console, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-japan-dominance-continues-as-switch-2-fuels-40-market-growth-in-2025/">1.52 million units reportedly sold in 2025</a>, putting it above PS5's sales in Japan last year. It must be noted <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466770/2025-japan-sales-comparison-charts-through-december-switch-2-vs-ps5-vs-xbox-series-vs-switch/">other charts aren't as optimistic</a>, but the information shared shows the Japanese market favours Nintendo's hardware.</p>
<p>When it comes to best-selling physical games in Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (2.668 million units) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> (2.534 million units) conquered the top spots with the Switch 1 &amp; 2 releases combined.</p>
<p>Looking at what early 2026 has in store for us and the strong focus on iconic JRPG series like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-demo-now-available-on-switch-2-and-xbox-series-xs-so-you-can-check-out-performance-on-nintendos-console">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-are-developing-this-to-be-the-masterpiece-version-dragon-quest-7s-producer-on-taking-a-scalpel-to-the-structure-of-a-classic">Dragon Quest</a> making the jump to Switch 2 before first-party heavy hitters start to arrive, we're not expecting a slowdown of that market's growth.</p>

            <p>Marathon has swiftly climbed Steam's Top Sellers list following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">reveal of its 5th March release date</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie's extraction shooter, which has up until now lived in the realm of closed betas and behind-closed-doors tests, was made available for pre-order overnight. In those midnight hours many wallets were opened by keen members of the public, landing on the number seven spot.</p>
<p>It lies currently behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, at third. There's also EA Sports FC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Those three currently ranking well due to substantial discounts on the PC marketplace. Marathon is currently retailing for £34.99 / $39.99.</p>

<p>It's a great first showing for the extraction shooter, which has until now had to power through a turbulent development process at Bungie. Only last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">its art lead left the company</a>, and prior to that the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-still-lives-as-bungie-announces-new-closed-technical-test-ahead-of-public-update">underwent drastic design changes</a> to the game following a mixed reception to initial public betas.</p><p>It follows on the heels of Arc Raiders, another extraction shooter which took the world by storm last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">growing in popularity through the winter holidays</a>. Whether that game has set the stage for wider extraction shooter popularity, allowing Marathon to launch to a comparable level of success, will be made clear as early as March.</p>

            <p>A mod for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> which enabled the game to be playable in VR has been removed following a legal takedown notice by CD Projekt.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, prolific VR modder Luke Ross said the Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 studio had issued a DMCA notice against him, requesting the removal of his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->

</span> </p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, it wasn't actually the mod itself that the team took issue with. Rather, CD Projekt requested the removal after Ross put his mod behind a Patreon paywall, effectively selling its content. This is at odds with the Cyberpunk 2077 studio's official 'Fan Guidelines' document, which states any content created with its games can not be used for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>"We're happy for you to accept reasonable donations in connection with your fan content, but you're not allowed to make people pay for it or have it behind any sort of paywall (e.g. don't make content only available to paid subscribers)," <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/fan-content">this document reads</a>.</p><p>Despite this, Ross has admitted he feels "bitter" about being forced to remove his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod. "In the end it amounted to the same iron-clad corpo logic: every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free," Ross wrote in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/148437771">very to the point Patreon post</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/luke-ross-cyberpunk-pc-vr-mod-dmca-takedown/">roadtovr</a>).</p>
<p>"As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualising 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property," Ross continued.</p>
<p>"And as usual they give absolutely zero f***s about how playing their game in VR made people happy." According to <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/2013313704004120925?s=20">@SynthPotato</a>, Ross generates $20k monthly from paid mods.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, our Ian took Ross' Cyberpunk 2077 mod out for a spin. You can check out his adventures in the video below. </p>

<p>Despite the legal issues between Ross and CD Projekt, he is not giving up his VR modding endeavours. In his same post, he announced the release of a new VR mode for Larian's acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in CDPR-related news, earlier this month Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-dont-we-see-male-v-in-post-launch-cyberpunk-2077-marketing-the-cyberpunk-2-creative-director-has-a-very-simple-explanation">why male V disappeared from the game's marketing after Cyberpunk 2077 launched its 2.0 update</a>.</p>

            <p>
With Marathon's 5th March release date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">now official</a>, developer Bungie has started sharing other bits of info about its PvPvE extraction shooter, including a lengthy cast list that - with names including Jennifer English and Ben Starr - reads like a bit of a who's who of video game acting talent.
</p>
<p>
Bungie has so far confirmed 30 actors making an appearance in Marathon's English voice cast "at launch", but it hasn't yet revealed the roles they'll be playing. Alongside Jennifer English, fresh off her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">award-winning turn as Maelle</a> in last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Marathon also features fellow Expedition 33 actors Ben Starr and Tracy Wiles. Wiles, who played the Paintress, also portrayed Jaheira in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and is joined by fellow BG3 veterans Neil Newbon (Astarion) and Samantha Béart (Karlach).

<p>
Marathon also stars Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption), Dave Fennoy (Lee Everett in The Walking Dead), Elias Toufexis (Adam Jensen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>), and Erin Yvette - who last year lent her voice to Samus Aran in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> and Dispatch's Blonde Blazer. Other confirmed talent includes Scott Whyte (Crash Bandicoot) and Jason Spisak (Silco in League of Legends TV adaptation Arcane). You'll find the complete announced English cast list below, with Bungie also noting Marathon will include fully localised dialogue for all its supported languages.

<p>
Marathon has, of course, had a turbulent road to release, finding itself embroiled in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">legal challenges</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a>, and more since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">unveiling back in 2023</a>. The shooter was initially due to launch on 23rd September last year, but Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">delayed its arrival</a> following a less-than-positive response to its big reveal and an equally divisive alpha playtest. Today, however, it confirmed Marathon will finally launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Steam on 5th March, arriving in standard, deluxe, and collector's edition forms.

            <p>
Sonic the Hedgehog might be in the spotlight this year as the legendary platformer's 35th anniversary looms, but it's not the only classic Sega series celebrating a major milestone in 2026. Much-loved match-puzzler Puyo Puyo is also turning 35, and the publisher has kicked off its blobby birthday celebrations with new artwork and more.
</p>
<p>
Puyo Puyo, for the uninitiated, sees players matching different coloured falling blobs in an attempt to score points and keep the play area clear. It debuted in 1991, and was initially the work of developer Compile. Since 2001, however, following Sega's aquisition of the series, it's been under the stewardship of Sonic creator Sonic Team - and its most recent appearance was last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive update of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/puyo-puyo-tetris-2-is-out-later-this-year">2020's Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And with the series now entering into its 35th year, Sega's birthday celebrations - officially dubbed the Dairensa! project - have begun. The publisher has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTrwFy9CVaz/">shared new anniversary artwork</a> to mark the occasion, and it's <a href="https://puyo.sega.jp/35th/">launched a new teaser website</a> pointing to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8yDvJmaMe8U">35th anniversary Puyo Puyo livestream</a>. The latter airs on 1st February, and while there's currently no suggestion it'll include any new game announcements, it's set to feature, among other things, news updates for mobile RPG Puyo Puyo!! Quest.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-shares-plans-for-another-big-35th-game-anniversary-this-year/">VGC</a> reports a number of other Japan-focused celebrations, including a Puyo Puyo 35th anniversary pop-up store. This begins its tour in Yokohama's Marui City (from 4th-28th February) before moving onto Kiddy Land Osaka Umeda (7th February to 15th March) and Tokyo's Annivroad (5th-22nd March). Additionally, Sonic and Puyo Puyo collaboration events will be held at Osaka's Hankyu Sanban-gai shopping centre in February and March, and a Sonic &amp; Puyo Puyo 35th Anniversary lottery is coming to Japanese stores.
</p><p>
Whether Sega will be making any sort of fuss about Puyo Puyo outside of Japan remains to be seen, but the publisher has a busy roster of birthdays to celebrate away from its long-running puzzle game. Beyond Sonic's 35th, Nights hits the big three-oh in 2026, as does Sakura Wars.

            <p>Another voice actor has confirmed their participation in upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a>, Catalyst.</p>
<p>Eva La Dare has revealed she is part of the Tomb Raider: Catalyst cast, after fans thought they recognised her voice <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">during last month's reveal trailer</a>. "Your ears are GOOD!" La Dare responded on social media.</p>

<p>La Dare did not go into details about her Tomb Raider: Catalyst character, <a href="https://x.com/KarenShevaEva/status/2011578365627810233?s=20">simply stating</a>: "Can't say more yet, but I'm so excited to be part of this legendary franchise" (thanks, <a href="https://www.tombraiderchronicles.com/headlines5409.html">TombRaiderChronicles</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to Tomb Raider: Catalyst, La Dare's other credits include Sheva Alomar in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> and as Elena in several games from Capcom's Street Fighter series. The actor joins Alix Wilton Regan, who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-newest-lara-croft-is-frightened-about-losing-the-role-after-being-absolutely-blindsided-by-perfect-dark-cancellation">taken over the role of Lara Croft from Camilla Luddington</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Luddington <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">shared a farewell post to the character she had embodied for 10 years</a>, writing: "The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created."</p>

<p>Tomb Raider Catalyst is due to release next year, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. It will take Lara to Northern India, following a "mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them".</p><p>Before that, though, we also have a remake of the first ever Tomb Raider game arriving sometime this year. Known as Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, it places players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">back in the shoes of Lara Croft as she hops from country to country in search of the Scion of Atlantis</a>.</p>

            <p>2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-top-notch-hack-and-slash-stumbles-off-the-battlefield">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, which has just celebrated its first anniversary, was <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dynasty-warriors-origins/">generally considered a big success</a> and a much-needed evolution of the long-running hack-and-slash series. Later this week, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dynasty-warriors-origins-visions-of-four-heroes-official-reveal-trailer-state-of-play">Visions of Four Heroes DLC</a> and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL69vFOt_lM">Nintendo Switch 2 port</a> are launching, and a recent interview with producer Tomohiko Sho has teased what might be coming next.</p>
<p>We've known for some time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> sold quite well, with Koei Tecmo itself <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/news/koei-tecmos-dynasty-warriors-origins-sells-over-1-million-units-worldwide/">confirming on February 2025</a> the game had crossed 1m sales during its first month on sale. On top of the aforementioned DLC and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> port, the general assumption (though <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-developers-eye-more-crossovers-hint-at-possible-sequel/">it hasn't been confirmed</a>) is that developer Omega Force is already looking at developing a sequel. Now, Sho has revealed during <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/63110">an interview with Famitsu</a> (with the relevant excerpt <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19385-dynasty-warriors-origins-continuation-may-be-expanded-from-duology-to-trilogy">translated by RPG Site</a>) that a single follow-up might not be big enough to tell the whole story the devs want to tell.</p>
<p>The producer has been sitting on those thoughts for a while, it seems: "I thought of making a duology where we would depict up until the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. But as we ended the development, the game depicted up until the Battle of Chi Bi with much more density than we guessed… In that case, if we maintain this density in the sequel, it would be impossible to depict up until the Battle of Wuzhang Plains (strained laugh). That’s why in the middle of the development, I ended up thinking that we would have to make it into a trilogy."</p>
<p>Traditionally, Dynasty Warriors games have covered (repeatedly) a very large portion of the Chinese Three Kingdoms period, starting with the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the 180s and taking players to the Battle of Wuzhang Plains in 234 AD. More recent games took us a bit further in order to also tell the Fall of Shu Kingdom in 264 AD. It all involves heroes (as well as villains) sending hordes of soldiers flying with all sorts of weapons, but at its core, it's a massive historical drama.</p><p>With Origins, the main pitch from a narrative perspective was to spend more time with each part of the larger story. The game goes up to the Battle of Chi Bi / Red Cliffs in 208 AD. The expectation was to have the rest of the period covered in just one sequel, but looking at the density of the content and intertwined story arcs, we're inclined to support Sho's tentative decision to go bigger and longer. Two more entries instead of one would also allow Omega Force to better iterate on the many changes to Dynasty Warriors' traditional combat system and the RPG layer that added much-welcome depth.</p>
<p>"I kindly want you to buy this DLC, and I want even more people to play the base game," the producer added, suggesting a final decision hasn't been made and encouraging fans to vote with their wallets.</p>

            <p>Cast your minds back to this day two years ago, and you will recall Pocketpair's creature catching survival game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> taking the internet and players by storm.</p>
<p>Soon after its early access debut on 19th January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">Palworld became only the second game to pass two million concurrent Steam players</a>, the first being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>. And, it wasn't only Steam where Palworld took off. Palworld's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-xbox-us-player-numbers-briefly-surpass-fortnite-as-steam-sales-hit-8m-in-six-days">US player numbers on Xbox also briefly surpassed those of perennial favourite Fortnite</a> that same month.</p>
<p>But, despite this clear popularity, there were plenty out there who would lambast the studio and its viral hit, with many dubbing Palworld 'Pokémon with guns'. So now, two years down the road, what is the studio's biggest learning from the last 24 months?</p>

<p>"It's crazy thinking back to the initial release of Palworld, because it honestly feels like another lifetime ago," Pocketpair's head of publishing and communications John 'Bucky' Buckley tells me, as he reflects on that day two years ago. "We've been so blessed throughout this whole experience, and our fans continue to surprise us with their passion on a daily basis!"</p><p>Bucky says there is "a lot to unpack over the last two years", however, "by far the most important thing" he has learned over this time is "how important it is to simply be transparent with our players". The Palworld exec of course understands this is not "a one-size-fits-all approach", and he is sure  "there are some games out there that perhaps can't be as open as they'd like". For Pocketpair, though, the team "found out pretty early on that the more open and communicative we are with our players, the more receptive they'll be to what we're trying to achieve".</p>
<p>Says Bucky: "Palworld is a game made by us, but it's also made by our players. We take so much feedback from them, and many of the updates over the last two years have been a direct result of what the community has been asking for."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Bucky admits, though, that even with this success, things haven't always been easy for Pocketpair. "Palworld is fortunate to enjoy a very large and very active community, but with that also comes a large number of contrarians who take every opportunity to snipe at it. I'm not talking about people who just don't like Palworld, that's fair enough, but as with every popular game, there's a percentage of people who make it their unofficial job to rant and rave about the game as often as they can," he says.</p>
<p>"Now, naturally, the impact these sorts of people have is basically non-existent, but we're only human, so at times even we can get swept up in that negativity."</p>
<p>He adds that "learning to tune out the performative drama and focus on our community" is something he still struggles with to this day, but "I'd like to think I’m getting better at it!"</p>
<p>As for what's next, Palworld 1.0 is due to be released later this year. "We have a lot of other fun things planned," Bucky closes. "We'll keep working hard to grow Palworld into something special that our fans can continue to enjoy for a long time to come!"</p>

<p>"Secrets. Buried and rotting. With the UESC holding the shovel," reads the trailer's official blurb. "That's where you come in, Runner."</p>
<p>Along with a Standard and Deluxe Edition, which includes Runner and Weapon cosmetics, there is also a Marathon Collector's Edition, which is described as a "premium unboxing experience inspired by Sekiguchi Genetics' shell-weaving process" by <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-releases-march-5-2026-new-trailer-and-more">Bungie</a>.</p>
<p>"Unbox to reveal a 1/6-scale Thief Runner Shell statue, collectible miniature WEAVEworm, embroidered patch, postcards, digital rewards, and more," the team teased. Below is a video with more details.</p>

<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 2.53pm:</strong> The release date for Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has seemingly leaked via an Xbox Store pre-order trailer.</p>
<p>According to this trailer, Marathon will be released on 5th March. There was also mention of a Deluxe Edition.</p>

<p>The trailer itself has since been removed from its original source, though the footage with Marathon's release date can still be found online.</p>
<p>"Infil into the dark sci-fi world of Tau Ceti 4: A derelict colony rife with rival Runners, hostile UESC security forces, and unpredictable environments. Play with your crew, as a solo Runner, or form uneasy alliances with proximity chat,"  reads <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28">Marathon's official blurb</a>.</p>
<p>"Scavenge, buildcraft, and take on greater PvPvE challenges - culminating with the derelict Marathon ship hanging above."</p>

<p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Bungie confirmed Marathon would be released sometime in March</a>, though at this time it didn't give a specific day.</p>
<p>After announcing its March release window, Marathon's art director and veteran Bungie developer Joseph Cross announced his departure from the company. "I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon. Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you," Cross said last month.</p>
<p>"Massive thank you to everyone who has supported through all of it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">Cross confirmed his departure from the studio was his own decision</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">it was discovered the extraction shooter used artist Antireal's work without permission</a>.</p>

            <p>It's safe to say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is 2026's biggest indie hit so far, with the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">securely funding the next two years of development</a> before it was even out into early access last week. It seems the idea of a proper competitor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> was a golden one, but that isn't stopping modders and passionate tinkerers from putting Minecraft <em>inside</em> Hytale.</p>
<p>On 17th January, X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/iamcxv711">iamcxv7</a> (Sadat Sahib/ssquadteam <a href="https://github.com/ssquadteam">on GitHub</a>) posted he'd gotten Minecraft running in Hytale's world map through "pure pixel data manipulation," which sounds pretty bonkers and signals the new blocky sensation may have a bright future ahead when it comes to modding and all sorts of experiments.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>The achievement was also shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qflbs7/got_minecraft_030_running_in_hytale_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on Reddit</a>, where the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qflbs7/comment/o05iv7j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">full explanation of the process</a> was explained: "No GPU, no OpenGL calls - just pure CPU-based 3D rendering". In short, no one who's really into software and creative problem-solving knows what he's saying, but it's all impressive if you're aware of the basics. At the time of writing, the game "runs entirely server-side at 35 FPS with a resolution of 320x240," so this isn't a trick of playing a short gameplay video via Hytale and calling it a day. It is an old version of Minecraft (0.30) though. That doesn't exactly make it any less impressive, however.</p>
<p>Further digging through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SSquadTeam/submitted/">Sahib's Reddit profile</a> also reveals other stunners, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qfp9xb/gameboy_gameboy_colour_emulator_working_in_hytale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">GB and GBC emulation</a> working through the same process (quite convincingly, I must add) and the entirety of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qg9lah/fully_functioning_windows_95_inside_hytale_wip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Windows 95</a> reportedly running with no visible hiccups. And in case you (like us) were wondering, yes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qfdo8c/yes_it_runs_doom_wip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it runs Doom</a> as well. Now we're talking.</p><p>So far, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">Hytale is shaping up to be a heavy hitter</a> due to its bigger focus on RPG elements versus Minecraft and similar open-world crafting games. It must also be noted the game hasn't been released on Steam at the time of writing, making its success story on PC far more impressive as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Valve's platform becomes the go-to place for millions of gamers</a>.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté is reportedly suing Ubisoft following a surprise and suspicious departure from the company last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté left Ubisoft in October</a> with the company claiming he'd chosen to leave but Côté claiming he was pushed out. <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio Canada</a> said Côté's lawsuit seeks CAD $1.3m (£698k) for a mixture of lost severance pay and "moral damages", and for Ubisoft to lift Côté's non-compete clause.</p>
<p>The lawsuit apparently claims (I can't independently find the filing) that problems began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">when Ubisoft created new company Vantage Studios with Tencent</a> in October, to control its most valuable gaming properties. These include Assassin's Creed - the franchise Côté was leading, or so he thought. Côté quickly discovered that Vantage was hiring for a new role, Head of Franchises, that would effectively overrule him.</p>

<p>He alleges that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot blocked his application for the role because Côté was based in Canada and not France, and said he was offered a lower role as Head of Production instead. "Tense" discussions ensued and resulted in an offer for Côté to lead a "Creative House" looking after second-tier Ubisoft brands.</p>
<p>Côté, "disoriented, confused, and affected by the anxiety-inducing situation", according to the filing, took a break from the company to think and reflect.</p>
<p>Ubisoft management apparently told him that at the end of his two week period of reflection, he'd have to make a choice whether or not to accept the position offered, which Côté saw as an "unacceptable demotion" and therefore a form of "disguised dismissal", so he demanded severance pay in accordance with that.</p><p>Côté had been expected back at work on 13th October but the lawsuit said Ubisoft told him not to show while it formulated a response. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">The company then suddenly announced he had left the company of his own accord</a>, seeking new opportunities elsewhere, which the lawsuit claims Ubisoft did to avoid paying severance and to apply a non-compete clause. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté wrote an emotional message at the time,</a> claiming he did not walk away but was asked to step aside.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has not yet responded to the lawsuit filing.</p>
<p>Marc-Alexis Côté worked at Ubisoft for 20 years, spending 15 of those on Assassin's Creed. He was a lead level designer on Brotherhead, director of 3, and then led Ubisoft Quebec as it made Black Flag add-on Freedom Cry, and Syndicate. He was senior producer of Odyssey, and then in 2022, Côté stepped up to take control of the entire Assassin's Creed franchise, rebooting it somewhat and kicking off the new era with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin's Creed Shadows, which launched in March last year</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 20/1/2026: </strong>Ubisoft has announced what we all suspected - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-primal">Far Cry Primal</a> is getting a free 60FPS update, which is arriving on 21 January.</p>
<p>"Return to the Stone Age, a time of omnipresent danger and limitless adventure, where giant woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers rule the Earth," reads the official blurb. You can check out a short teaser for Far Cry Primal's 60fps update below.</p>

<p>As well as Primal, Far Cry 3: Classic Edition and Blood Dragon are also getting a free 60fps boost on 21st January. You can read more about those in the original article below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 19/1/2026:</strong> Far Cry 3: Classic Edition will be getting itself a lovely performance boost later this week.</p>
<p>As shared by Ubisoft, series fans can soon revisit the beautiful Rook Islands once again, but this time with 60fps. Ahh, doesn't the sea look so clear and inviting? Doesn't the sand look so golden? Doesn't that pirate look, errr, a little deadly and terrifying? Yeah, maybe we should run...</p>

<p>Far Cry 3's upcoming frame rate boost will arrive on 21st January, for current gen consoles. You can check out a little teaser for it above.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem that Ubisoft will be stopping with Far Cry 3, though. Last week, the studio appeared to tease that Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-3-blood-dragon">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</a> Classic, and Far Cry Primal would all be getting those welcome 60fps updates with a cocktail of emojis.</p><p>Then, if these emojis - which included the likes of a palm tree, a dragon and an hourglass - weren't enough to convince fans of the impending updates, when one user replied "Far Cry 3 60 FPS, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon 60 FPS, Far Cry Primal 60 FPS", Ubisoft itself <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/2012224947603570962?s=20">sent them a gif</a> awarding a gold star.</p>
<p>So, yes, it is a case of when, not if. Stay tuned! [<strong>UPDATE 2.58pm:</strong> Another social media post from Ubisoft has been released, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Blood%20Dragon">announcing a 60fps upgrade for Blood Dragon</a>. This update also goes live on 21st January.]</p>

<p>If you haven't played Far Cry 3 for yourself, I would absolutely recommend it. While he is pretty awful and then some, there is no denying that the game's pirate Vaas is one of the best out there. As for the Rook Islands, yes they are hostile but my goddess they are gorgeous (she writes while looking out of her window, with the rain dripping down, the snow melting, and the sky grey).</p><p>"In the past, Far Cry's vision of a first-person shooter RPG where you explore, master and then control your environment has always been more seductive on paper than any of its developers have managed to deliver on disc. Far Cry 3 changes all that. For me, this is the new apex predator of open-world shooters," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Eurogamer's original Far Cry 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Hunt it down as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Ubisoft news, last week the studio added more flames to the fire that is its Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake. You see, earlier this month, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">reuploaded a sizable selection of sea shanties from Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> over on its YouTube music channel, which many assumed was because a remake of the studio's piratical adventure is on the cards.</p>
<p>It then claimed this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">music which was reuploaded due to "technical issues"</a>, however no one really believes that.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> is currently enjoying a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1m">boost in its player numbers</a> following the long-awaited debut of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadpool-is-joining-marvel-rivals-later-this-week-and-he-can-pretty-much-do-anything-he-wants">Deadpool</a>, but some players continue to ruin the fun for everyone. Thankfully, the developers of the game are on the case and planning to ult them into oblivion soon enough.</p>
<p>On 19th January, the <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552?s=20">official Marvel Rivals account</a> on X/Twitter acknowledged the annoying situation players are often running into, with some matches being disrupted by farmers who just stand still and farm the required stats to progress through the <a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Proficiency">hero proficiency</a> track fast.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hey Rivals,</p><p>Recently, we’ve noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points. This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players.</p><p>To address…</p></div>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>The answer will be to introduce a "combat behaviour detection system" which will punish the players engaging in such activities with warnings, short-term suspensions, and even longer time-offs. The worst offenders will face "permanent account bans" which may not amount to much since the game is free-to-play, but will surely enrage anyone fully committed to maxing out heroes.</p>
<p>Though this wave of farming has been partially enabled by Marvel Rivals' slightly convoluted hero proficiency system and its approach to challenges tied to cosmetic rewards, the online shooter isn't the only one that's been affected by exploiters who'd rather mindlessly farm for hours than play the game normally. Sadly, it's the kind of negative stuff that comes with the territory, but NetEase developers have, so far, done well at acting fast on negative feedback pertaining to the game's health and game environment, so we're hoping to see this system live in the game soon.</p><p>For now, players on the game's community subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">are celebrating the news</a>, with the most upvoted comment saying the banhammer "might actually help some of these lord farmers touch grass." If you're wondering what "lord farmers" are, some users are describing them as the people that engage in farming on dead regional servers in the night hours; when they queue at the same time, they face each other and just AFK as DPS, tanks, and healers do their thing taking turns. Proficiency is tied to excelling in those roles, so you can see where the boosts are coming from.</p>
<p>"Great, now do something about throwers," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/comment/o0g90ch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">another user says</a> in the same thread. This is more of a widespread competitive online game issue, but anyone who's spent enough time playing ranked Marvel Rivals matches knows it's easy to run into folks who jump ship as soon as they see things going south. That's an entirely different problem NetEase hasn't properly addressed yet, so don't get your hopes up.</p>

            <p>After almost three months of scavenging and fighting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players have become quite good at dealing with the extraction shooter's PvE foes. Diehards might be worried about that side of the game becoming stale soon, but don't worry: Embark could be about to unleash hell on us.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/will-this-blow-up-the-server-arc-raiders-players-are-so-good-at-killing-arc-that-embark-is-considering-how-to-escalate-pve-dev-teases-a-shredder-escape-and-the-giant-walking-ones-in-the-background/">GamesRadar</a>, Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins stated the team is "pretty happy" with the end-game loop of taking down the imposing Queens and Matriarchs.</p>
<p>The problem is that killing the same behemoths over and over again to get materials to craft better guns that excel at killing the same enemies can get pretty old, pretty quick. Of course, most players have yet to experience what Arc Raiders' later progression stages and threat levels have to offer, but online shooters typically thrive or die based on how well-fed the hardcore crowd that lives in the end-game is.</p>
<p>Instead of coming up with new "giant spidery" robots, Watkins suggests Embark Studios could look at ways to put them to good use in different scenarios and/or events: "I think it's looking toward where we take those types of experiences in the future to something else or something additional, seeing how we can escalate the experience for the player on the PvE side."</p><p>A potential buff to the Arcs or shaken-up world state wouldn't be limited to the boss robots, as drones are also becoming "much less of a threat to them" (that is, in regards to players deeper into the game). Nonetheless, some the smaller Arcs are simply meant to be annoyances we have to deal with as we rush through our favourite loot spots and (if we're feeling naughty) go after unsuspecting raiders.</p>
<p>About the titanic Arc bosses that can often be seen in the background, Embark isn't making promises due to the tech involved, but everything seems to be on the table: "We want to go wherever's practical for us, or wherever feels fun, but then you start running into the practical side of, will this blow up the server? … Our ambitions are definitely large, and I'm not going to say that you're going to meet one anytime soon, but obviously you see the giant walking ones in the background and stuff."</p>
<p>For now, I'd say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">more than 12m copies sold</a> and the glowing player sentiment are giving the studio plenty of space and time for experimentation.</p>

            <p>Update (3PM UK): A rockstar spokesperson has provided a statement to IGN addressing the matter, confirming a boiler malfunction was the cause of the incident. The statement reads as follows:
</p>
<p>"Early Monday morning, there was a malfunction in one of the heating boilers at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a>. Many thanks to those that reached out with concern, and also to the police and fire crews who were on scene quickly to assess the situation - please know that everyone is well and our studio remains open and operational."</p>
<hr>
<p>Original article (11:46AM UK): The Rockstar North office has been cordoned off by police following an explosion. While the source is currently unconfirmed, reports suggest that a boiler is the cause.</p>
<p>The building, located on Holyrood Road in Edinburgh, has been attended by both police and city fire departments. <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">According to the Scottish Herald</a>, around seven Scottish Fire and Rescue vehicles were sent to the scene after alarms were raised around 5am. No injuries or deaths have been announced by the authorities.</p><p><a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburghlive</a> has stated that Scottish Fire and Rescue have been on the scene for upwards of two hours after the call reporting the incident came in. The outlet was also provided a statement by Scottish Fire and Rescue, in which a spokesperson stated the following:</p>

<p>"I can confirm that we got a call at 5.02am this morning. We mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances. It's an ongoing incident and we're still in attendance at the moment with other agencies."</p><p>

The Scottish Herald were told, again by a spokesperson from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, that firefighters worked to secure "structural damage" to the building. These crews left after three hours after the area was deemed safe.

</p><p>This piece will be updated as more information on the explosion have been confirmed.</p>

            <p>We've been greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout Season 2</a> so far, and it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">most fans are</a> too, but the change from binge-based season drop to a weekly release schedule has had an impact on the show's ratings. Don't worry, though: this stumble isn't in danger of disappointing the powers that be.</p>
<p>On 15th January, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/streaming-ratings-dec-15-21-2025-1236475572/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> shared the latest report from Nielsen, a leader in media valuation and data analytics. As expected, the debut of Fallout's second season was a sizable one, with the show accumulating 794 million viewing minutes through the week of December 15th through 21st. At the same time, it was well below Season 1's appeal, which earned 2.9 billion for its opening week in April 2024. That one was Amazon's best-ever premiere on the platform.</p>
<p>Those keeping track of what goes down on the TV front might've already noticed what's going on here. Since Nielsen traditionally tracks viewership in minutes watched across devices that send the needed data, the company's numbers never give us the complete picture. It only tracks TV sets, but it's always been a good way to measure the temperature and streaming habits of the populace. The more important bit of info here is that 794 million minutes for a single episode versus 2.9 billion for an entire season that could be binged on Day One is very impressive all the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must take into account many viewers who have grown accustomed to Netflix's binge release strategy are just waiting for the entire thing to be available. All in all, Fallout is doing remarkably well still, and nabbed the 7th spot on <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/top-ten/">Nielsen's ranking</a> for the December 15th through 21st period. During that week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-things-final-battle-was-directly-influenced-by-baldurs-gate-3">Stranger Things</a> reigned supreme in the lead-up to its series finale with a massive 2.37 billion minutes watched.</p><p>As it stands, Fallout Season 3 is a go and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">already targeting a production start date for 1st May, 2026</a>. The Prime Video series is among the very few big-IP shows that are sticking to tight pre-production and filming schedules, with S2 arriving only a year and a half after S1. For comparison, we're still waiting for <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-ahsoka">Star Wars: Ahsoka</a>'s second season on Disney Plus; the first set of episodes came out during summer 2023.</p>
<p>Are you watching each episode of Fallout Season 2 weekly, or are you waiting to make your trip to New Vegas until it's all loaded up?</p>

            <p>Another name has been added to the growing cast list for Amazon's God of War live-action series.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, it was announced that <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/">Teresa Palmer will portray Phoebe/Sif</a>, Thor's wife and the goddess of family. This character's inclusion in Amazon's adaptation suggests we will see beyond Kratos' own journey in 2018's God of War, which the series is based on, and how his actions affect others in this world.</p>
<p>Along with the Amazon's upcoming show, Palmer's other acting credits include A Discovery of Witches and Warm Bodies.</p>

<p>Palmer joins <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">Ryan Hurst (who played Thor in God of War Ragnarök) as Kratos in the upcoming show</a>, which is a collaboration between Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios. Last month, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series</a>. Toye's works include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">Amazon's acclaimed Fallout series</a>, and The Walking Dead.</p>

<p>In addition, former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore  will serve as showrunner on the upcoming series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of 2024</a>, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>.</p>
<p>"God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," reads the show's official logline.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>As for the character of Sif, she appeared in God of War 2018's sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">Ragnarök</a>, where she was voiced by Emily Rose (aka, Elena Fisher in PlayStation's Uncharted games).</p>

            <p>Early indicators that advertisements are coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming service have been spotted by users, with messages stating that "ad-supported playtime" popping up for users when launching games.</p>
<p>One such user, The Verge's Tom Warren, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/2012346097465782273">posted their own experience seeing this message firsthand</a>. Ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming has not been confirmed by Microsoft as of writing, nor its scope across the service. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">last year an Xbox official confirmed </a>that the company would be experimenting with free ad-supported cloud gaming.</p>
<p>This hint at advertisement rollout across Xbox Cloud Gaming comes at an interesting time too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">with an Xbox Showcase set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. While it's been stated that the show will focus primarily on a handful of games including Fable and Forza, rumours have been circulating that such a shift with the company's cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">could be rolled out this year</a>.</p>

<p>It's also coming at an interesting time for cloud gaming in general. With the AI boom ongoing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">hardware prices have skyrocketed for consumers</a>. This will, or perhaps already has, curbed the ability of gaming enthusiasts to buy their own machines, potentially leading a new wave to Cloud Gaming services such as what Xbox is offering. While not especially great news for the consumer, there's no doubt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">Microsoft has positioned itself into a leading position as far as cloud gaming is concerned</a>.</p><p>Microsoft too has faced heavy criticism when it comes to its gaming output, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">laying off significant portions of its workforce last year</a> and cancelling several projects as a result. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-suffers-worst-year-on-record-for-console-sales-in-the-uk">2025 was also the worst year on record for Xbox console sales in the UK</a>, though competitors like the PS5 also saw a drop during the same period.</p>

            <p>Young Alfie Williams reckons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> should introduce his character from 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple into the multiplayer slasher-fest.</p>
<p>Williams was chatting with IGN's lovely social producer Mat Jones about the 28 Years Later sequel, when conversation turned to video games and Dead by Daylight. Now, when I say young Alfie Williams, I really do mean young. Williams is, at the time of writing, only 15.</p>

<p>However, the actor - who plays Spike in both 28 Years Later and the newly-released sequel The Bone Temple - says that the previous inclusion of Stranger Things' characters by in Dead by Daylight proves that minors can be part of the bloody fray, so, really, why shouldn't the team include him?</p>
<p>"I know they bring Stranger Things in, so they can have minors in the game," Williams reasoned. He added he believes Dr. Ian Kelson, played by Ralph Fiennes in both films, would probably be quite a good fit for a Dead by Daylight survivor.</p>
<p>You can check out the full exchange with Williams and Mat below.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple star Alfie Williams wants to get a collab with Dead by Daylight:</p><p>"I know they're bringing Stranger Things in, so they CAN have minors in the game." <a href="https://t.co/DCdKMGWujc">pic.twitter.com/DCdKMGWujc</a></p></div>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/2012351328685556026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As well as Stranger Things, other Dead by Daylight collaborations have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-details-its-walking-dead-collaboration-as-public-test-build-go-live">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's, The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nicolas-cage-is-now-available-in-dead-by-daylight">Nicolas Cage</a> (who was able to fake his own death).</p>
<p>Given all that, a 28 Years Later collaboration is hardly out of the question, though I do think I would feel a little uneasy hunting down a child. What do you think of Williams' idea to feature Spike in Dead by Daylight?</p>

            <p>Rockstar has helped a terminally ill fan play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> ahead of its November release date.</p>
<p>In a heartfelt plea on LinkedIn, developer at Ubisoft Toronto, Anthony Armstrong, reached out to colleagues and peers at Rockstar about a month ago to ask if they could help a member of their family who had been given "the worst possible news", and could may well lose their battle with cancer before the highly-anticipated sequel release.</p>

<p>"To any of my connections at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> and Rockstar Toronto, or anyone else that may be able to help. A member of my family who has been battling cancer for years just recently got the worst possible news, he was given 6-12 months to live," Armstrong wrote in a now-deleted post (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-terminally-ill-fan-wish-play-gta-6-early/">Insider Gaming</a>).</p><p>"The reason I'm reaching out is that they are a huge GTA fan and, with this latest updates [sic], he may not be around long enough to actually get to see GTA6 launch, best case scenario he will be leaving us the same month it does. He currently lives only a stones throw from the Oakville studio, so its my hope that one of you may be able to set up an exclusive playtest, so he can have a chance to experience the game, before passing.</p>
<p>"I absolutely understand the need for secrecy at this point of development, so at the very least an NDA is probably needed. If anyone could send me a private m[e]ssage about this or provide any contact who could point us in the right direction, please do."</p> <div>

<p>Fast forward a few weeks, and Armstong was able to provide an update: "The CEO of Take-Two reached out and we are just waiting to hear from the Rockstar team to discuss this further. Thank you to everyone who has shown support, reshared, and reached out to your contacts for us."</p>
<p>The final update said: "We spoke to them today and got great news. That's all I can really say, but thank you all from the bottom of my heart".</p>
<p>Last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> published its latest financial report, revealing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">GTA 6 had been delayed from 26th May, 2026 to 19th November, 2026</a>. According to Take-Two, this delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support, of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

            <p>It's quite the time to be somebody who loves both video games and Lego. In a sense, it perhaps shouldn't be surprising that the worlds of digital gaming and Danish brick-building toys are colliding so thoroughly - the venn diagram of the audiences of each is frequently simply a circle. In fact, it's sort of surprising that it took this long. Lego welcomed its first licensed brand sets in 1999 with the arrival of Star Wars - and by that logic, it took about a quarter century for video game-inspired builds to <em>really</em> take hold in the Lego space.</p>
<p>It's been a slow burn. The first time video games crossed into the Lego brick realm is a little fluffy, depending on your definition. A figure of a character from the PC gem Lego Island was made so early that it predates the Star Wars licensing - and then within Star Wars there was a 2007 set based on video game The Force Unleashed. The first <em>proper</em> brush didn't come until 2012, though, when a Minecraft set bought to market via the fan-designed Lego Ideas theme used the blocky similarities between the two brands as a potent proof of concept and market viability for video gaming Lego.</p>
<p>Lego has scarcely looked back since, and over the last few years there has been an explosion: more Minecraft, Mario, Sonic, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, Horizon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Animal Crossing, Pac-Man, Zelda, hardware both official and generic - the list goes on. The latest is of course Pokémon, which in February launches several adult-targeted, mega-scale, mega-priced sets aimed at thirty-something nostalgia like a Hyper Beam.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lego</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Anyway, all of this is to say that it seems that Lego's commitment to gaming is now absolute. It's arguably a match made in heaven - the previously one-way relationship of hugely successful Lego video games now matched by equally successful video game Lego. Though there are arguably challenges for Lego to solve as it navigates the gaming space.</p><p>Primarily raised this week is the question of pricing, a conversation spurred on by the existence of a Pokémon set that will retail for a whopping £580 - putting it comfortably among the top ten most expensive and largest Lego builds ever. It is, to be fair, eye-wateringly expensive - but I'm hopeful for how the rest of Lego Pokémon will shake out. We know from retailer listing leaks and the like that there is more to come in the Pokémon theme - and I expect what remains to be revealed will probably be a great deal more sensible and inevitably more kid-friendly.</p>
<p>If you look at Star Wars - a media property with similar cross-generational appeal to Pokémon - sets always run the gamut. Historically you've been able to get a simpler X-Wing playset for as little as £25, but some have run up to hundreds of pounds. The same is true for things like the Millenium Falcon, of course, and it'll doubtless over time also be true of Pokémon. The eye-poppingly expensive sets are for the most hardcore collectors - and for a franchise like Pokémon, with graded rare trading cards routinely changing hands for five figures or more, everyone knows that audience exists.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lego</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Some of Lego's best work in gaming exists in the lower price brackets, though. Two recent sets really embody this, I think. The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/game-boy-72046">£55 Game Boy replica</a>, complete with a couple of carts, is alarmingly accurate-looking, a delightfully entertaining build, and needles nostalgia in all the right ways. There are even upcoming unofficial kits to let you turn the brick-built Game Boy into a functional console, if you're a real sicko about it.</p><p>In a similar vein there's the generically-branded but lovingly-crafted <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/arcade-machine-40805">Arcade Machine</a>. This is an interesting one for showing off the cost of licensing, too: this cute little machine doesn't evoke any specific arcade classic but rather the more general look and feel of eighties cabinets. With no licensing baggage attached, it contains more pieces than the Game Boy but retails for £20 less.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lego</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I also think Lego Sonic has been delightful in its roll-out - simple play-sets, at kid-friendly price brackets (as cheap as £9, topping out at £60) with nary a techy gimmick in sight. That isn't to entirely disparage Lego Mario - I do see the value in its tech-driven play, especially to modern kids who might struggle to retain interest in toys that don't give something interactive back - but there is a delightful purity to the Sonic sets, and I'm enjoying how they don't seem too tied to any particular Sonic era or continuity - each set is simply a broad celebration of the series and its characters, as they should be.</p>
<p>Anyway. All of this is to say, chatter about account-emptying pricing or the necessity of gimmicks aside, it's clear that video games have now become as firm a part of Lego's portfolio as… well, Star Wars, or Potter, or any of those other mainstays. Like gaming's resurgence in Hollywood, I suppose it's a sign of the times: of us eighties and nineties kids getting older and having disposable income or kids of our own, and of gaming becoming a properly embedded part of 'the culture' as opposed to a fringe aberration that gets side-eyed by 'proper' entertainment. You love to see it.</p><p>As someone who truly loves Lego and video games, I'm excited. Even if that big Pokémon set is far too rich for my blood, what I see is that we're just a few short weeks into 2026 and we've already had the Pokémon announcement, a new Lego Zelda leak, and the year surely holds more promise of even more such reveals. As that happens, I expect we'll be doing a lot more about Lego here on Eurogamer. I honestly couldn't be more thrilled.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Capcom pulled back the (rotting) curtain on the latest instalment of its storied horror series, Resident Evil. And while we learned a bit more about Resident Evil Requiem's story and how it plays out, some fans were surprised that we didn't get a collector's edition (CE) reveal.</p>
<p>Like many publishers, Capcom usually goes all-in on pricey, limited-edition collector's editions, but in this case, almost all of the additional goodies for Requiem's deluxe version are digital, leaving some fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qdz2bw/finally_an_end_to_the_overpriced_collector/">wondering if we've seen the end of "overpriced" physical collector editions</a>.</p>

<p>With little more than a month to go to release, it seems unlikely Capcom's holding off on the announcement, particularly as the official figurines we usually see in CEs have popped up for sale, separately, elsewhere, breaking a decade-old tradition. And rather than a CE, Capcom revealed two one-sixth-scale figurines of <a href="https://www.hlj.com/1-6-scale-capcom-figure-builder-creators-model-resident-evil-requiem-leon-s-kennedy-cap13730">Leon</a> and <a href="https://www.hlj.com/1-6-scale-capcom-figure-builder-creators-model-resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-cap13731">Grace</a>, retailing for around £150 each.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, Requiem's physical Deluxe Edition comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium Stellbook (including the game)</li>
<li>A limited edition lenticular card</li>
<li>Digital code for 5 costumes</li>
<li>Digital code for 4 weapon skins</li>
<li>Digital code for 2 Charms</li>
<li>Digital code for filters</li>
<li>Digital code for bonus Audio Pack</li>
<li>Digital code for Files.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition is also available, albeit without the card and steelbook case. There's also a Requiem-styled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> controller available, and - also for Switch - the Resident Evil Generation Pack, which bundles together Resident Evil 7 and its DLC, Village and DLC, and Requiem. There's also amiibo coming in the summer, and all pre-orders get the bonus Grace costume, Apocalypse.</p><p>Leaker Dusk Golem, who has previously leaked correct (and some not-so-correct) details about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> ahead of time, posits the issue could be connected to the costs of getting items into the US.</p>
<p>"I think as much as some people don't want to hear it, Donald Trump and his unpredictable wishy-washy tariffs are what has actively lead [sic] to Resident Evil Requiem not really having a Collector's Edition like they usually do," they <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2011929965789659453">posted</a> after the showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to be released across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a> on 27th February. Director, Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed previous series entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, said it will be "an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date".</p>
<p>Nakanishi was talking during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-an-experience-with-an-emotional-range-unlike-any-other-series-entry-to-date-and-um-janitor-zombies">this week's Resident Evil broadcast</a>, which gave us all another look at Requiem's gameplay, including how the sections between Grace and Leon differ. Grace's gameplay will have a much stronger slant on horror, while things will be more action-focused when we are in Leon's shoes.</p>
<p>Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>.</p>

<p>The fixes include tweaks to the world and environment, NPCs, creatures, crafting, farming, audio and visual effects, UI, customisation, combat, balance, commands, and more.</p>

<figcaption>Here's an official look at Hytale's robust creative tools.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavNidH3wnc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notably, dinosaurs and other NPCs have been added to populate the underground jungles, albeit with "placeholder behaviours" while the team works on them. These new NPCs require a change to the environment in the biome, so you're advised to generate new unexplored areas if you'd like to drop by and say hello.</p>
<p>You can also expect "proper atmospheric effects and creature spawns" in the Devastated Lands sewers, volcanic environmental effects beneath volcanoes, and the invisible filler block between the bench in the Forgotten Temple has been removed.</p>
<p>All NPCs should have knockback resistance, and fire-themed NPCs should, quite rightly, be immune to fire damage (even if, for now, they'll still look like they're <em>catching</em> fire). Skeletons no longer drown, Kweebecs are now immune to cactus or brambles damage, and livestock should no longer climb atop the chicken coop. You'll also find that cautious wildlife predators like the Fox will no longer attack unless you attack them first.</p><p>You should now find it easier to locate the Backpack, as well as its upgrades, as the base backpack no longer requires a Tier 2 Workbench. Mercifully, it now takes fewer than 10 seconds to transform your hides into Leather now.</p>
<p>There's more – much more! – so head on over to the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-patch-notes-update-1">official website</a> for the full rundown.</p>
<p>"This week's early access release feels like a splendid start; a flexible, well-featured - and already enjoyable - foundation with plenty of polish and attention to detail," Matt wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">Eurogamer's Hytale preview</a>.</p>
<p>"And beyond what Hypixel is currently cooking up itself, the studio's offering substantial support for modding and other creative avenues as it looks to foster the sort of community that's served Minecraft so well. So yes, only a day in and Hytale shows lots of promise - and with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">next two years of funding already secured</a>, the once seemingly doomed game could be looking at a very bright future."</p>

            <p>Valve has amended its guidance on AI disclosure and clarified that while developers using "AI-powered tools" for "efficiency gains" is not the focus of its policy, they must still disclose if generative AI is used in their games.</p>
<p>Now, as spotted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/">GameDiscoverCo,</a> Valve has now amended its AI policy, making it clearer that studios that use "AI powered tools" such as code helpers may not have to disclose if there are no genAI assets like music, artwork, narrative design, or localisation in the content that "ships with [their] game".</p>
<p>"We are aware that many modern games development environments have AI powered tools built into them," the developer disclosure page now reads. "Efficiency gains through the use of these tools is not the focus of this section. Instead, it is concerned with the use of AI in creating content that ships with your game, and is consumed by players. This includes content such as artwork, sound narrative, localisation, etc."</p>
<p>Developers are then asked to indicate Yes or No to the question: "Does this game use generative artificial intelligence to generate content for the game, either pre-rendered or live-generated? This includes the game itself, the store page, and any Steam community assets or marketing materials."</p><p>Quite what qualifies as an "efficiency gain" and what doesn't remains to be seen, but ultimately, game makers publishing on Steam are still required to tell players if they use AI to generate any content, or its Steam-flavoured marketing materials.</p>
<p>"This feels like a really thoughtful middle ground that actually makes sense for developers," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7417944214812106752?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7417944214812106752%2C7417947262959513600%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287417947262959513600%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7417944214812106752%29">said</a> one commenter. "The way they've separated efficiency tools from actual content generation shows they understand how teams actually work. It's refreshing to see a platform think through the nuances instead of just blanket policies, and putting players first in these decisions feels like the right call."</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">Epic Games' Tim Sweeney criticised Valve's requirement to disclose generative AI</a>, saying "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Valve's platform recently crossed the 42 million barrier</a>, setting a new record.</p>

            <h2>17th January</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing. This week, Bertie thinks about boxes of chocolate; Victoria eats mini-eggs; Connor skives off work; Marie calls for Walker but Bill keeps on answering; and Matt feels all warm and fuzzy inside.</p>
<p>And if you're looking for something else to read, or a reminder of what you once wrote, there's a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">What We've Been Playing archive</a> to delve into.</p>
<h2>Hades 2, Switch 2</h2>
<p>Can I say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is like a box of chocolates? I don't mean it in the Forest Gump way, in that you're never sure which chocolate you're going to get, because that's stupid - chocolate boxes have a big picture insert that tells you exactly what you're going to get. Don't go for the strawberry cream. What I mean is a chocolate box that's full of hidden delights, things you don't expect, because there's so much in Hades 2 that's held back or hidden away.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcr_u7VKPF4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>The cyclical nature of a roguelike, whereby you get one attempt to see how far you can get and then try again, means you tend to see a lot of the game upfront, and this can lead to a feeling of 'I've seen most of it now'. But in Hades 2 you haven't, because the real magic comes later on. It's on your umpteenth time cycling around that you're delivered a significant dose of story development, or when you unlock a jacuzzi-like hot spring to bathe in, with your mentor. It's in the layers of this game - this pass the parcel sort of game - that the treats and genius lie.</p><p>It's when I'm served these kinds of things that I can only sit back and admire what I'm experiencing here, a game dense and layered that even on my 20th attempt at unwrapping it, I'm still having gawp-worthy treats fall out. It's like thinking a box of chocolates is done and then lifting a deceptively dark separator to discover there's another layer underneath. I haven't experienced a game that's gelled a repetitive roguelike structure and storytelling this well before. It's not just that the two things are complimentary, it's that they're fundamentally, inseparably, intertwined.</p>
<p><em>-Bertie</em></p>
<h2>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, PS5</h2>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Picture the scene. I am Snake. I am one with the jungle. I am hungry. I set down my controller and reach over to pop some mini-eggs into my mouth and cries suddenly start emitting from my TV. "Snake? Snake!!" Shit, I didn't realise Snake could sink into the mud and drown. Sorry, Snake!</p>
<p><em>-Victoria</em></p>
<h2>Old School RuneScape, PC</h2>
<p>I'm growing more convinced by the day that Old School <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> is one of the best MMORPGs of all time. Which is strange because I somehow didn't realise this when I first played it at school when teachers weren't looking.</p><p>I will likely be writing about the game in these weekly articles for some time so I'll leave you with the first of several anecdotes that may get me in a little bit of trouble. Did you know Old School RuneScape is a great game to play during work? It is packed with dozens of little gameplay hubs that can be played practically AFK. For the white collar worker this means doing your job, then every minute or so tabbing into RuneScape to click something once or twice, then tabbing back over to work.</p>

<p>While writing this very paragraph I am on the Fishing Trawler, a patchwork boat which players board to catch fish together and fend off a nasty kraken trying to take the ship down. To pass the minimum requirement for rewards in this five-minute minigame, all you have to do is click a tentacle twice. That's it. All you do then is park yourself in a spot away from the action and wait out the timer.</p>
<p>It's brilliant really, especially for those of us who have found ourselves becoming adults against our best efforts. Just keep it on the sly, yeah?</p>
<p><em>-Connor</em></p>
<h2>Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update, Switch 2</h2>
<p>I paid for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> update pack and is it too harsh to say I prefer the free 3.0 update content? I've spent far more time with the free content than I have with the stuff I paid for. The Switch 2 upgrade is yet to draw my attention. The only thing that has is the very temperamental Megaphone Tool you can use to locate your Villagers; I called for Walker and Bill kept answering...</p><p>I'm having a much better time renovating the rooms of the free Resort Hotel at the end of the pier. Granted, it does feel like a repeat of the Happy Home Paradise DLC, but if you don't have that then the freedom to decorate rooms this way should be a welcome addition. Rearranging furniture and creating new spaces: I just can't stop.</p>
<p><em>-Marie</em></p>
<h2>Super Mario Odyssey, Switch 2</h2>
<p>Exactly why I suddenly felt compelled to play an eight-year-old game over Christmas that I've only passingly fond memories of and that I'd largely already rinsed, I could not say, but there I was on Boxing Day starting a brand-new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> save. And when I say it hooked me, I mean it. Virtually all my holiday game time (not including the many, many hours I lost mopping up a bunch of expeditions in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>) was spent on a furious moon hunt. And honestly, what a treat – I'd genuinely forgotten what an absolute delight Odyssey is; just a joyful riot of imagination and creativity that made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside - just like those distant Nintendo Christmases of my youth. A couple of hundred stars in and the infuriating gauntlet of Darker Side of the Moon now finally unlocked, I think my enthusiasm is probably all tapped out, but it was a hell of a fun time while it lasted.</p>

            <p>Senior producer for The Division series Julian Gerighty has announced his departure from Ubisoft, heading over to Battlefield Studios.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">In a statement posted to social media</a>, the official Massive Entertainment account posted its fond farewells to Gerighty. It reads: "Today we want to share that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy's The Division</a> franchise is heading off on to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios. While we will miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we'll continue to bring the world he's been part of creating to our players for years to come.</p>
<p>"Julian, your legacy is part of this studio and remember: once an Agent, always an Agent."</p>

<p>This post ends with a short paragraph reassuring fans of The Division that the series will be left in good hands now that Gerighty is leaving, concluding: "Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/i/status/2012156450039033939">Gerighty himself posted a personal update</a>, stating: "It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. Long live The Division"</p>
<p>This news comes only a few months after <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1979546362405351487">Massive Entertainment had to curb rumours that Gerighty was leaving the company</a>, and just one week after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss">he took part in an interview during the New Game + showcase</a>. During this interview he described The Division 3 as "a monster", and shared his belief it would have: "as big of an impact as The Division 1".</p>
<p>Despite this peculiar timing, it does appear as if both Massive Entertainment and Julian are leaving on good terms. Which is nice, we should all be so lucky. The Division 3, the project he is leaving behind, still hasn't got a release date are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quietly-confirms-its-working-on-the-division-3">remains a bit of a mystery over at Ubisoft and Massive</a>. One wonders if we'll be seeing it soon...</p>

            <p>
In a sign it really has hit the big time, viral multiplayer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> smash Steal A Brainrot - which was the first game on the platform to surpass 25m concurrent players following its launch last year - has announced it's getting its first celebrity concert, with Bruno Mars set to make a "pop up" appearance to promote his new single this weekend.
</p>
<p>
Steal A Brainrot, in which players battle to acquire Brainrots (these, Wikipedia informs this old and bewildered writer, are voxel characters based on the Italian brainrot meme), has become a big enough success since its release last May that its developer, Spyder Games, is already embroiled in legal battles as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robloxs-steal-a-brainrot-creator-sues-copycat-fortnite-creative-game-stealing-brainrots">attempts to quash copycat games</a>. And Bruno Mars' people have clearly noted its success; the musician will be performing his new single I Just Might, alongside older hit Locked Out of Heaven, in-game this Saturday, 17th January.
</p>
<p>
This, according to Spyder Games, makes him the "first-ever artist to 'pop up'" in Steal A Brainrot, and his appearance will be accompanied by the opportunity for players to "finally" collect Bruno-themed traits and a limited-edition in-game Bruno Brainrot. You can <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/5740888218927704">register to be notified about the event</a>, should you be desperate to catch it, over on the Roblox website.
</p>
<p>
Away from Steal A Brainrot, Roblox has, of course, routinely found itself making headlines for all the wrong reasons, with the hugely popular platform frequently being accused of failing to safeguard its predominantly young userbase from harmful content and sexual predators. Last year, for instance, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louisiana-sues-roblox-for-allegedly-choosing-profits-over-child-safety-claiming-its-basically-open-season-for-sex-predators-on-this-app">US state of Louisiana sued Roblox</a>, alleging the company "endangers the safety of" and facilitates "the sexual exploitation of [the state's] children", citing the availability of "highly inappropriate" mini-games including Escape to Epstein Island, Public Bathroom Simulator, and Diddy Party. Over 20 lawsuits accusing the company of enabling sexual exploitation were filed in US federal court last year, including submissions by Kentucky and Texas.
</p>
<p>
Roblox, for its part, has taken steps it claims will improve child safety amid continued criticism of its platform, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adds-facial-age-checks-to-curb-concerns-around-online-safety-in-worlds-most-popular-game-for-children">rolling out facial age verification around the world</a> earlier this year.

            <p>It's the end of an era. After five years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' risqué but incredibly popular "adult only" island has been deleted by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The island in question was created by @churip_ccc, and was frequently visited by streamers and Japanese players. It featured a number of adult-oriented jokes, such as a "free information center" which greets players as they land. While this may sound safe enough at first glance, these centres are used in Japan to guide patrons to the likes of brothels and strip clubs.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>This island also boasted a red-light district, and "love hotel" with multiple copies of Michaelangelo's Statue of David with strategically placed foliage to emphasise his, ahem, manhood. There were also adult shops selling schoolgirl-inspired cosplays and toys, vending machines for "natural herbs", smoking areas, areas designed to look like casinos... You get the idea.</p>
<p>As for the islands' residents, well, they clearly had a penchant for some more mature activities. For example, Blathers - the wise owl who has a distaste for insects and bugs - had a room on this island that was littered with used tissues alongside numerous images of Isabelle adorning the walls.</p>

<p>But, now this Animal Crossing: New Horizons destination is no more, with <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc">@churip_ccc</a> <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc/status/2011099062666477894">announcing</a> their adult-themed creation would no longer be available for visits via Dream Islands, as it has been deleted by Nintendo. They don't seem bitter about it, though. Rather, the creator has both apologised to and thanked the company for "turning a blind eye for more than five years" (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>As for when their island got deleted, it apparently happened just before this week's big Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update">which added a new Resort Hotel down on the pier among other things</a>.</p>

            <p>The person allegedly once earmarked for the role of lead designer of The Elder Scrolls 6, Kurt Kuhlmann, has said that if they had their way, the game would have been like the beloved Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back.</p>
<p>His idea - he who spent 20 years working at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> on nearly every Elder Scrolls game, including being co-lead designer of Skyrim - was the elven supremacists the Thalmor, the game's baddies, would temporarily win, Kuhlmann told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PCGamer</a>. Evil would triumph and there'd be something of a cliffhanger, and you'd get a chance at revenge in the next instalment, The Elder Scrolls 7.</p>
<p>"I had in my mind that TES6 was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back," Kuhlmann said. The player might have "secretly saved the day" by rescuing an heir to the throne, say, preserving hope for another day, "but overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march". It would be a welcome change from the 'chosen one' storyline The Elder Scrolls games always use, he believed.</p>

The studio's plan then was apparently to make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> and return to the famed fantasy series afterwards. But this didn't come to be. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> diverted the studio's attention and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> preoccupied it for several years afterwards, meaning it would be 11 years before Bethesda Game Studios returned properly to the next Elder Scrolls game.</p>
<blockquote><em>"It wasn't just my expectation - I had been told that that was going to happen"</em></blockquote>
<p>Kuhlmann, who'd been a lead systems designer on Starfield in the meantime, was ready for his call-up. "I was obviously one of the old-timers there and had a lot of experience," he said. "Bruce [Nesmith] and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim. I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn't unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn't just my expectation - I had been told that that was going to happen. And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead."</p>
<p>Bethesda apparently offered him a different role on the project instead - "an important role", Kuhlmann said Howard called it. "But what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point," he said. There was no indication Howard remembered the alleged verbal promise made years earlier and no reference was ever made to it. This, coupled with the ways in which the studio had changed during the development of Starfield, as it ballooned across multiple studios, contributed to Kuhlmann's decision to leave Bethesda Game Studios in 2023.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Kuhlmann - once considered the loremaster of Elder Scrolls - acknowledges that leading the Elder Scrolls today is a different proposition to leading the studios back in 2011. "The role of lead on TES 6 is very different from the role of lead on Skyrim," he said. He also doesn't think his Empire Strikes Back idea would ever have flown with the team. Ending on a loss and a cliffhanger? "That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years."</p><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 is now, blessedly, properly under way, having been announced ridiculously early back at an E3 in 2018, before Starfield was anywhere near made. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">Todd Howard said last November that the game was still "a long way off"</a>, but it sounds like a lengthy pre-production process is done and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">the majority of the studio is working on it</a>. I can't wait to play it in 2030. Stop it, Bertie, stop it.</p>

            <p>The original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-quest-7-fragments-forgotten-past">Dragon Quest 7</a> is a masterpiece. But, despite its legendary status, even those who love it dearly should be able to readily admit that it is also highly flawed. One person who knows that acutely well is Takeshi Ichikawa - the producer at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in charge of shepherding Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined, an imminent remake of the game, to market.</p>
<p>"When the original was released I was in primary school," Ichikawa notes. "It was the first numbered title I ever played." The ideal man for the job to remake this classic, right?</p>
<p>"But," Ichikawa adds with a sheepish grin. "Because the introductory section is so notoriously long, I was actually one of the people who gave out and dropped out of DQ7 halfway through."</p>
<p>With this admission, made at the start of an extensive chat about rethinking the magic of Dragon Quest 7, Ichikawa instantly shows he <em>gets it</em>. When he was assigned the Reimagined project, Ichikawa then played the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-3ds-hands-on">Nintendo 3DS</a> version of DQ7 for the first time in order to get up to speed. From there, with these thoughts in mind, the project began.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Streamlined is the word. Dragon Quest 7's greatest strength is arguably also its greatest weakness. It has a unique story structure for the Dragon Quest series, where the narrative is, in a sense, told through a series of relatively enclosed vignettes. Events <em>do</em> string together into a larger world-saving story, of course - it wouldn't be Dragon Quest if they didn't - but broadly, you're sailing the oceans, landing on far-flung islands, and then experiencing a small episodic narrative of that island and its people. That story then resolves while also playing into a grand, over-arching plot.</p><p>In a sense -and excuse me for invoking one of the true gods of the genre in this - but it's a little bit like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. Except instead of travelling through time and learning of the dramas of each individual era and slowly figuring out how they tie together, you're sailing across a broader world map. Admittedly, things don't tie together in quite as satisfying a way. DQ7 is no Chrono Trigger, to be fair - but in places it does evoke some of the same magic.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the original game, though, was pacing. The game is long. Arguably far too lengthy for its own good. It is paced glacially, and in a sense shows a supreme disrespect for the player's time and attention. Thus Ichikawa - and many others - struggled to even make it through the intro. This core criticism of the original masterwork and even its 3DS mulligan</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Loot first, questions later. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Our goal was to preserve the original atmosphere and 'feel' while making the experience pacey, dense, and rich," Ichikawa explains.</p>
<p>"We've put a lot of effort into restructuring three specific areas," the producer continues. "Visual representation, scenario, and battles."</p>
<p>The new doll-like art style is the banner bearer for the visual overhaul, and it's one I honestly adore. Characters have been reimagined into cute proportions that vaguely resemble action figures. While this is something envisioned as new for Reimagined, Ichikawa is keen to point out that the new style has its roots in the game's original art from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">the late, great Akira Toriyama</a>.</p><p>"Akira Toriyama’s designs for Dragon Quest 7 have shorter, cuter proportions than the other titles," Ichikawa notes. "We wanted a visual style that emphasized that adorable, or 'chibi', feel. We also saw that doll-like or puppet-inspired styles are popular in global media and felt it was a perfect fit for Toriyama's DQ7 character designs."</p>
<p>The designs aren't just the work of brilliant character designers, though - the team behind Reimagined actually had real-life puppets of the characters created, which in turn were then scanned into the development tools to create the character models. Despite the expense, this was a challenge that Square Enix encouraged Ichikawa's team to take on.</p>
<p>"We believed that to get the right texture and realism, we had to physically create the dolls and scan them," Ichikawa reveals. "It wasn't perfectly smooth at first; when we put the scanned models in-game, there were errors and glitches with the animations that the development team had to work hard to solve."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>A visual overhaul is a vital part of the experience, but it was never a part of why Dragon Quest 7 was subject to any disparagement from fans or critics. So, while effort and expense has been put into the visual look, it's clearly reinvigorating DQ7's pacing which has been the largest focus - and it's a topic which Ichikawa becomes more animated when engaged on.</p><p>"The original is a series of short stories. To make the narrative easier to follow, we reordered some of these episodes. Others were changed into an optional experience, allowing players to tackle them in the order they choose," Ichikawa notes.</p>
<p>"However, we didn't just move elements around; we redesigned the scenario from scratch to find the optimum form for the storyline. To balance any cuts, we added completely new scenarios and backstory episodes to provide more depth to the characters. We worked closely with series creator Yuji Horii on every individual story to ensure we were on the right track."</p>
<p>Fans will notice some storylines and entire islands have been excised from the game (something which, despite being intended to address past criticism, will doubtlessly concern). But the team has clearly made a huge effort to do this with a scalpel rather than a hatchet; and rather than just cuts without further consideration, the entire game has been carefully rebalanced around these changes.</p>
<p>Battles are also a key part of the pace. Here's a big change: DQ7 Reimagined retains visible enemies over random encounters, a change first introduced in the 3DS version. This makes it easier to see what you're getting into, and also makes it easier to avoid encounters when you've had enough of them or need to avoid them. This, alone, is a huge page-changer.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Crystal clear. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Because the game is so long, symbol encounters [visible enemies] are the correct decision. It gives players the choice: if you want to focus on the story, you can skip battles; if you want to grind, you can seek them out intentionally.</p><p>"Our benchmark was that minor encounters should be fast, while boss battles should be deep and tactical. For the fast-paced side, we added adjustable battle speeds, auto-battle, and the ability to cut down weak monsters on the field map without entering a battle screen," Ichikawa expands. "For bosses, we added 'Burst' super attacks and the ability to 'moonlight' in different job combinations to add tactical depth."</p>
<p>It all amounts to a lot, and with some time in a non-final preview version of Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined, one can see how these changes might actually manage to thread the needle and accomplish the near-impossible - to make a classic, albeit a flawed one, better. Too often tinkering around the edges makes bangers worse - but that doesn't look likely to be the case here.</p>
<p>"We are developing this to be the 'Masterpiece' version of Dragon Quest 7," Ichikawa affirms. Soon, fans will deliver the verdict on if that goal has been achieved.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined is due for release on 5th February 2026 across Switch consoles, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Microsoft).</p>

            <p>Arknights Endfield has surpassed 35 million pre-registered players ahead of its release on the 22nd January.</p>
<p>This news comes alongside a new launch trailer for the game, which can be viewed below. These 35 million pre-registered players not only get to sign up for the game early, but have collectively earned a series of milestone-based rewards for the playerbase once the game releases.</p>
<p>These include in-game credits, a free five-star operator, and some gacha currency used to pull for in-game characters. The pre-launch community for Arknights Endfield also managed to pass a social media milestone previously, which means a five star weapon and additional gacha currency.</p>

<p>Arknights Endfield, for those who don't know, is a blend between a squad-based action RPG and a base/factory management system. You collect and enhance a gaggle of distinct characters to use in combat scenarios, while in the background you build and expand a growing hub of facilities to aid you as the game progresses. Think, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> meets Factorio for an over-generalised idea of what's on offer here.</p><p>It's been in development for a good while, being a spinoff from Hypergryph's 2019 game Arknights. Having first released a trailer for the game back in 2022, the game has been steadily gaining a wave of intrigued players thanks to ongoing beta tests and drip-fed trailers. The result of which being that staggering number of pre-registered players.</p>
<p>Is Arknights Endfield your cup of tea? Let us what you think below!</p>

            <p>That music which was reuploaded for Assassin's Creed: Black Flag was apparently just due to "technical issues", so stop reading too much into it, ok.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft set tongues wagging when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">reuploaded a sizable selection of sea shanties from Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> over on its YouTube music channel. Many assumed this was all because a remake of the studio's piratical Assassin's Creed adventure is on the cards.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, apparently an impending Black Flag remake - which these days feels like the world's worst kept shared secret - has absolutely nothing to do with it, or so Ubisoft claims. Rather, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx_qiROkA8vcnQk_a-1BH_gW4gTLnDetS0">studio has cited</a> "technical issues" as the reason for the shanties' sudden appearance on YouTube.</p>
<p>Here's Ubisoft's full statement: "Hi there music lovers! We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music."</p>
<p>Needless to say, though, many are unconvinced with the company's response. "Technical issues in the Animas that calls for a resync in Assassin's Creed Black Flag," reads one reply, while another adds: "yeah suuuuuuure." Another user is quite blunt, and has called this reasoning by Ubisoft "b******t".</p>

</figure>
<p>Now, like I have said, we are all basically just waiting for Ubisoft to confirm that yes, Black Flag is getting a remake. We all are 99.9 percent sure it is happening. Back in August of last year, voice actor Matt Ryan - who portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">claimed legal action was brought against him by Ubisoft</a> after cheekily hinting at its existence at a convention.</p>
<p>Then, just a couple of months ago in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">the company's financial reports stated an unannounced title was due to be released during the fourth quarter of this financial year</a>. That would be before April.</p>
<p>And, if <em>all that </em>wasn't enough to convince you this remake is real, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">a PEGI listing for Black Flag Resynced was spotted</a> in December. It really does seem to be a case of when, not if this remake is coming. But that music was <em>definitely </em>about technical issues…</p>

            <p>
EA has unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s first major expansion of 2026. It's called the Royalty &amp; Legacy Expansion Pack and promises to be bring familial dynasties, scandal, and intrigue when it launches for all platforms on 12th February.
</p>
<p>
Of course, things haven't been rosy in the world of The Sims of late; last year's news of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA's acquisition</a> by a group of investors - including Saudi Arabia's investment fund and Donald Trump's son-in-law - has seen pushback from high-profile Sims 4 content creators amid concerns the conservative and anti-LGBTQIA+ values of the company's new owners are significantly at odds with the game's traditionally inclusive community. It's caused enough of a ruckus that The Sims 4's development team has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-wants-you-to-know-its-values-are-unchanged-despite-ea-sale">repeatedly moved to insist it retains full creative control</a>, and that its "values of inclusivity [have] not changed."

<p>
It's in this volatile climate that Royalty &amp; Legacy - with its slightly muddled mix of familial dynasties, historical nods, and storybook whimsy - arrives. At the heart of it all is the expansion's new world of Ondarion, a coastal region split into three distinct neighbourhoods. There's the art-loving Dambele; Verdemar, where "heroic outlaws and cunning nobles" roam, plus the grand opulence of Bellacorde. And while each of these are ruled by their own dynasties, the throne of Ondarion as a whole is up for grabs.
</p><p>
Which is where the new Noble Career comes in. Sims on their quest for total supremacy can rise through the ranks - from Noble Newcomer to Kingdom Leader - by scheming, forging powerful alliances, completing Royal Duties, earning Favour in court through the choices they make, and more (not only in Ondarion, but across other worlds too). But the higher Sims climb in standing, the more likely they are to attract rivals, meaning the new Swordsmanship skill could come in handy. On top of that, Powershifts can occur over time, depending on players' actions.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
Elsewhere, you've got ballroom dancing, sword fighting tournaments, teleport-style secret passages for builders to exploit, and there's a new familial Dynasty System - giving players the opportunity to designate heirs and outcasts, to expel Sims, or to usurp family headship in a bid to maintain a dynasty's Prestige. That leads into the new Scandal System, which can impact Prestige, relationships, and careers as rumours of untoward behaviour spread. Sims can respond with denials, apologies, and more, and it's also possible to weaponise rumours against rivals in order to gain the upper hand.
</p>
<p>
Rounding out the expansion's feature list (as detailed in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/royalty-and-legacy-expansion-pack">EA's announcement</a>) are new building bits, Create-a-Sim additions, plus a new Backroom Lot, used to craft innocuous buildings by day that become rather more raucous at night.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4 Royalty &amp; Legacy will cost $39.99 (around £34.99) when it launches for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox on 12th February, and EA notes all purchases made between 15th January and 15th March this year will get a free upgrade to the Grand Bundle. This includes the expansion itself, plus the Regal Treasures Digital Content DLC (featuring A Crown of Leaves and Sparkles, the Enemies to Lovers Practice Dummy, and the Under the Stars Lantern), and two new kits: Tea Time Solarium and Silver Screen Style. Team Time Solarium is exactly what it sounds like - featuring glass walls, windows, and garden-inspired furniture - while Silver Screen Style is a fashion-focused DLC promising "dramatic gowns, sharp suits, bold accessories, and iconic outerwear".

            <p>Ace Combat 7, the brilliant flight sim combat game from Bandai Namco, has sold over 7,000,000 copies since releasing in January, 2019.</p>
<p>Announced on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AceCombatAmericas/posts/pfbid0VEYNcQBYWdbVAVUWUveoHHYvaLMwcktQQXmQbK8ZdCWu8ue9dHyohimfTvfgjv6Bl">official Ace Combat social media accounts</a>, the milestone came with a message of gratitude from director Kazutoki Kono. It reads: "We are deeply grateful that so many players have continued flying with us for so long. We look forward to meeting you again in the next skies."</p>
<p>In addition, a collection of free wallpapers were linked to Ace Combat fiends looking to relive their time in those skies from the comfort of their various devices. These are sourced from a wide variety of Ace Combat games too, so if you're like me you can decorate your phone with an Ace Combat 5 background. Rest in piece Chopper.</p>

<p>This milestone comes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-seven-year-wait-bandai-namcos-classic-aerial-combat-series-will-return-in-2026-with-ace-combat-8">as Ace Combat 8: Wings of Thieve is on the horizon</a>. Announced during The Game Awards 2025, this title is set to release on PC and consoles in 2026. It's also set to feature an "emotionally charged" narrative as well as multiplayer modes, so it's one to look out for.</p><p>Ian Higton took a look at Ace Combat 7's VR capabilities back when it first released back in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ace-combat-7-in-vr-is-phenomenal-if-you-have-the-stomach-for-it">and came away impressed, though somewhat disappointed in its limited scope</a>. He wrote: "VR implementation for the full Ace Combat 7 experience would have made it a PSVR system seller for sure but even so, if you're a VR enthusiast, I'd say this experience is worth the price of the full game."</p>

            <p>When provocative horror game Horses was banned from sale on Steam and the Epic Game Store late last year, it nearly led to the closure of acclaimed Italian studio Santa Ragione - denied, as it was, access to some of the world's largest paying game audiences. But amid the panicked delistings there was another company determined to sell Horses and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/following-controversial-bans-from-steam-and-epic-santa-ragiones-horses-has-sold-18k-copies-and-repaid-debts">throw Santa Ragione a lifeline</a>: Poland-based online store GOG.</p>
<p>It was a bold stand in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">a year of panicked delistings and removals of games deemed to contain adult content</a> - action seemingly pushed and enforced by powerful payment providers MasterCard and Visa. This censorious approach sought to outlaw grotty pornographic games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/queer-developers-speak-out-as-adult-games-remain-in-limbo-following-payment-processor-showdown-at-steam-and-itchio">but it caught all kinds of well-meaning games in its net</a>, including games like Horses. GOG would not only stand up to this action by selling Horses but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-offers-13-free-nsfw-games-as-it-launches-anti-censorship-campaign-freedomtobuygames">it launched an anti-censorship movement in response</a>.</p>

<p>GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski told me, reflecting on the decision in an interview, that it was a "matter of freedom" for him. "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on values - our own and also what we believe are the right values for the industry," he said. "We believe in creative freedom, because once a company, through their own terms of service, decides what's good and what's not good - what's acceptable; what can be sold and what cannot be sold - it's a slippery slope from that point onward.</p><p>"We obviously are a business and we do assess our risks," he added, "because we don't want to hurt the business, we don't want to hurt the employees, and we don't want to hurt the players by doing so. So we are also careful. But with Horses... We are a curated storefront so we are actually playing the games that we are selling. The game is obviously controversial but there's nothing there that should deem it couldn't be sold.</p>
<p>"That's the role of regulators and governments to decide - democratic governments - what's legal and what's not legal, not companies that hold - Visa and MasterCard together - probably 90-something-percent of the market, then just decide whether something can be sold or not. For me it's a matter of freedom."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We are a curated storefront so we are actually playing the games that we are selling"</em></blockquote>
<p>Michał Kiciński - the new owner of GOG - put it more succinctly when he said to me: "Curation is the privilege and prerogative of each platform. The difference here with Horses is that we've played the game and we thought it was very cool."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">GOG became an independent and private company at the end of December</a>, meaning it's no longer a part of Polish superstar game-maker CD Projekt, which GOG had been for its entire 17-year (more like 18 if you count internal development) history. Michał Kiciński owns the company now. Coincidentally, he was one of the people who originally launched GOG, and he was one of the founders of CD Projekt, so he knows the businesses well. Kiciński left CD Projekt in 2012 in need of a break but remained - and remains - a major shareholder.</p><p>This newfound independence and autonomy allows GOG to be bolder; Kiciński has already said "I'm not afraid of risk" in relation to the company's future. But beyond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">a possible move into indie game publishing</a> there aren't plans to change what GOG does and what people like it for. Primarily the business is built on reviving classic games, both old and modern, and preserving them for years to come. It's also eternally committed to offering games without any kind of DRM.</p>

<p>But GOG does also sell newer games - and big games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. However, it does this selectively - a form of curation it believes is another notable difference in today's overcrowded gaming world.</p>
<p>As Gołębiewski explained: "The area of specialisation for GOG is the classics and the modern classics, where we want to provide a superior experience to any other store or a platform out there. That's why [we have] the GOG Preservation Program and why we are working hard on the first-party software to make sure that games are playable and stay playable 20, 30 years from now. Apart from that, obviously we welcome any good game onto the platform, because we want our users to have as rich a catalogue as possible, with quality being the limiting factor."</p>
<p>"This is very important," Kiciński said, continuing the thought, "because the difference - the big difference - between Steam and GOG, for example, is that GOG is a very curated platform. Playability and fun-factor are the most important for us, no matter if the game is an old classic, new classic, or indie game with great fun-factor. That's the specialty of GOG: to deliver games with the great fun-factor and playability despite the age."</p><p>It's still early days in GOG's independent new era, and it's worth pointing out that while GOG is technically a competitor to Steam, Kiciński's business has around two percent of the market, he said, while Steam has something like 80 percent, so there's an enormous difference in size. But as Kiciński pointed out, "It's super difficult to defend such a big market share," and perhaps as players seek alternatives to Steam's overloaded catalogue, a few percentage points might creep elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Capcom's upcoming Resident Evil Requiem will be "an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date", complete with ... (checks notes) ... a cleaning zombie.</p>
<p>This is coming from the game's director, Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed previous series entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Nakanishi was talking during last night's Resident Evil broadcast, which gave us all another look at Requiem's gameplay, including how the sections between Grace and Leon differ. Grace's gameplay will have a much stronger slant on horror, while things will be more action-focused when we are in Leon's shoes.</p>
<p>Nakanishi again affirmed Leon - who is still a DSO agent after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">not a good choice for horror in the traditional sense</a>, because he isn't someone to flinch at simple things. "It may be a survival horror game, but I think we've made an experience that suits Leon," the director said, noting these sections will be more similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. Oh, and Requiem will "likely" push poor Leon to his limit, as if the poor chap hasn't already been through enough.</p><p>Nakanishi believes switching between Requiem's two leads will give players a "huge sense of catharsis" when the game is released next month. But, away from these two, last night's broadcast also gave us a look at Requiem's zombie enemies. These chaps will retain characteristics from when they were alive. What this means is in practice is one zombie who was a custodian before they were turned will still be found cleaning the building they're in. Personally, I would have hoped one benefit of becoming a zombie would be I would no longer have to scrub my oven and such, but, alas, this is not the case for Requiem's ghoulish foes.</p>
<p>You can check out the Resident Evil broadcast, including a look at how Leon's gunplay has been refined for Requiem, below.</p>

<p>For more, our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. So, that bodes well!</p>

            <p>The next game in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> series will be unveiled later this month.</p>
<p>The Life is Strange team has announced a livestream, which it will host via YouTube on 20th January, at 6pm for those of us in the UK. That's 10am PST / 1pm EST / 7pm CET for those in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>"Separate the real from the rumour... Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game," reads the official YouTube video description. You see, news of the upcoming livestream comes one week after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-mysterious-new-life-is-strange-game-has-just-been-rated-in-europe">PEGI listing revealed another Life is Strange game was in the works</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of this slip, it was disclosed that fan-favourites Chloe Price and Max Caulfield would feature in the next Life is Strange game, which will be known as Reunion.</p>
<p>"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time… Losing her is Max's greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus," reads the game's outline on the PEGI website.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amazon Games has announced that New World, its MMORPG first released in 2021, will shut down on the 31st January 2027. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">This comes a few months after the developer "gutted" a vast number of staff late last year</a>.</p>
<p>When those cuts were first announced, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world">it was revealed on the New World website</a> that its 10th season 'Nighthaven' would be its last. Now, it turns out that season will be extended until the servers are shut down. The game has been pulled from storefronts, so only those who already own the game can continue playing into next year.</p>
<p>The statement also features a farewell from the remaining New World team, which reads: "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we're honored that we were able to share so much with the community.</p>

<p>"It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."</p><p>In response to this news however, a potential sprinkle of hope from COO of Facepunch Alistair McFarlane. Known as the studio behind Rust, the UK-based developer has built itself a solid foundation in the tumultuous games industry. Solid enough, it seems, to allow McFarlane to offer an eye-watering amount for the ill-fated MMO.</p>
<p>"25m, final offer" McFarlane <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011890710468071708">posted on Twitter</a> in response to the news last night. He'd follow this up with "Games should never die", indicating this to be a genuine offer (Eurogamer has contacted Facepunch to confirm).</p>
<p>Another noteworthy figure in the world of buying video game rights also popped their head up, with <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011991595273572406">Simon Collins-Laflamme of Hypixel Games writing</a>: "If you need tips about buying cancelled games, lmk". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">Laflamme bought Hytale back from Riot Games last year</a>, releasing it this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">to monumental success</a>.</p>

            <p>I cannot begin to tell you how much I was looking forward to hoisting megaphone and bellowing insults at Chops from halfway across my island in Animal Crossing: New Horizon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> Edition, but the whole voice recognition thing is so flakey - so prone to drawing the attention of entirely the wrong villager - there's liable to be Honaloha-wide revolt if this goes on. I've already shoved the damn thing into storage, and with that out the way, I'm not sure there's enough left of note to warrant the upgrade, even at £4.19.</p>

<p>As you've no doubt already heard, New Horizons has been unexpectedly resurrected this week - unexpected in as much as most people had assumed 2021's 2.0 update would be the last, until Nintendo announced otherwise at the tail-end of last year. This week's refresh <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update">comes in two flavours</a>; a free content patch for everyone, and a paid update for those looking for some extra Switch 2 pizazz. And for your £4.19 you get, as well as that busted megaphone, mouse support, a multiplayer bump to 12 players, built-in GameChat support for voice and video, and a resolution boost - but not a framerate increase.</p>

<figcaption>Here's what you get in New Horizons' new update.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nODHyw3lgs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Which is to say, if you still have a lot of Animal Crossing-playing friends with enjoyable faces who've yet to discover they can do party chat on their phones, you'll probably find a use for the paid upgrade. For everyone else, though, the real action's in the free patch. So how's that panning out for me so far? The big addition, of course, is the introduction of a new on-island hotel. And while I still remain highly skeptical it's possible to build an eight bedroom resort complete with reception area and souvenir shop on a small wooden pier without it immediately collapsing into the sea, I'm willing to let it slide given I'm not a structural engineer.</p><p>And as the big new flagship feature in 3.0, it's... fine. If you've already got 2021's Happy Home Paradise expansion, though, you'll have pretty much seen and done it all before - each day a couple of new rooms open up and you're invited to let your inner interior designer run wild, sprucing them up with decor and furniture to match a given theme. Once you're done, you're awarded hotel currency to spend on souvenirs (paying employees with money they're only able to spend in their place of work is precisely the kind of bullshit dystopian capitalism you'd expect from Tom Nook, of course), and eventually a couple of off-island animal tourists will swing by for a fleeting visit to your island. Oh, and you can dictate the outfits they'll wear during their stay so everyone can spot the interlopers from a mile away.</p>



<p>That's it. And by rights, I should not be enjoying it this much, having done pretty much exactly the same thing umpteen times over in Happy Home Paradise, but nope - it turns out I'm still far too easily lulled into a state of enrapt serenity whenever I'm asked to match some wallpaper to a couple of chairs. It helps, of course, that it's all presented with typically lovable Animal Crossing flair - from the catchy muzaak in the hotel lobby to the three generations of kappa who run it all. But really, it's not the hotel but the smaller stuff in 3.0 that's been keeping me locked in so far, with Nintendo taking the opportunity to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-patch-notes-update">fix some of New Horizons' lingering irritations</a>.</p><p>The ability to craft multiple items at once is welcome, for instance - especially if, like me, your sudden design whims tend toward the dramatic (why, yes, I absolutely <em>do</em> need to replace all 50 of my green fence posts with black ones immediately, thank you). And similarly, the fact that crafting now pulls materials from storage and not just your personal inventory cuts down on a tonne of faff. And speaking of storage, the hoarders among us will delight at the increased inventory space - not that I've been able to take advantage of it yet, given Tom Nook is charging the equivalent of a large London house for a bigger wardrobe.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the new communal island-building feature, which lets a bunch of friends (or rather, paying Nintendo Online subscribers) work together to create and decorate a bespoke dreamspace is nice, if perhaps - depending on the number of Animal Crossing fans in your life - a little niche. Elsewhere, Resetti's new island clean-up business is handy but expensive, and the option to complete crafting requests to earn more hotel points is... well, it is. By far my favourite new feature, though (ignoring the endearingly silly Lego furniture and the Zelda/<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> unlocks I can't access because all my amiibo are up in the loft) is the button that lets you hop an inch off the floor. It's been suggested it's intended to make landscaping easier by centring you back on the building grid, but I've mostly been using it to vibrate adorably on the spot so far.</p><p>If any picture's building in your head from all this, it's probably - correctly - that New Horizon's 3.0 release and Switch 2 counterpart are far from essential updates. These likely aren't going to drag you back in for another couple of hundred hours; rather they're mostly nice-to-haves for the hardest of the hardcore and for those Switch 2 owners new to the whole thing. And four years after major development seemingly wrapped, that's probably both expected and fine - but whether it's fine to the tune of £4.19, only you can decide. What all this <em>has</em> done, though, is give me a nudge to stick my head in again, and you know what? It's lovely to be back, ticking off a few missing fish and kicking back for a few minutes each day - I'd genuinely forgotten how nice a place Animal Crossing is to be. Am I annoyed I can't reliably swear at Chops from halfway across my island? A little bit, maybe. But there's always the old-fashioned way.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 3.15pm:</strong> Aaaaand it's real. Lego has opened pre-orders for its Legend of Zelda: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>-themed set, known as The Final Battle.</p>
<p>"Enjoy a creative and nostalgic journey as you build this detailed Lego The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle model," reads the official blurb, with Lego calling it a "great display piece" for fans.</p>
<p>As leaked earlier, this upcoming set features Ganon's crumbling castle from the final moments of Ocarina of Time. Inside the rubble are three recovery hearts. Meanwhile, owners will be able to reveal Ganondorf "at the push of a button".</p>
<p>Alongside minifigures of the three key characters from the final battle - Link, Zelda and Ganondorf - this set also includes a brick-built figure of Ganon (that's the chap that is a boar-like beast) and a transparent build standing for the fairy Navi (she does not, from what I have read, wail "Hey! Listen!", but imagine if she did).</p><p>As for items included from the game, those who purchase this Ocarina of Time set will also get their hands on Link's the Master Sword, the Megaton Hammer, the Hylian Shield, two fabric capes and two swords for Ganon. The set contains 1003 pieces, and retails for £100 here in the UK.</p>
<p>You can check out images for Lego's The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time - The Final Battle model below.</p>



<p>If you fancy pre-ordering, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/ocarina-of-time-the-final-battle-77093">you can do so via Lego now</a>. The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 9.37am:</strong> The recently teased Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Lego set has leaked.</p>
<p>According to a Brick Tap source, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-legos-next-the-legend-of-zelda-set-will-be-based-on-ocarina-of-time">upcoming Zelda set</a> will be known as The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time, and depict, well, the final battle from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</p>
<p>On the box, we can see the chunky porcine Ganon standing tall and wielding his dual blades, while Link gets ready to strike down on the beast with his Master Sword. The titular Princess Zelda, meanwhile, is standing to one side, and has a Lego-fied beam of light emitting from her hands.</p>

<p>According to the leak, which was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1qe6y4h/zelda_77093_the_final_battle_ocarina_of_time/">shared on reddit</a> earlier this morning, Lego's The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time set will comprise 1003 pieces, and retail for £100 here in the UK.</p>
<p>Along with Link, Zelda and Ganondorf (as in, in his Gerudo chief form), the set will also include a Navi model, as well as - of course - a brick built model of the boar-like Ganon, which in personal opinion looks rather magnificent.</p><p>Should this leak be accurate, we can also expect to see the game's Megaton Hammer and a number of recovery hearts to also be included on the set's release. As for when that will be, the source said we are looking at a 1st March debut, which is actually quite soon.</p>

<p>This of course isn't Lego's only collaboration with Nintendo. Earlier this week, the two companies unveiled their previously announced Pokémon sets, which include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-unveiled-but-catching-em-all-will-cost-you">Pikachu and Poké Ball, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise and Eevee</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after these particular sets went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-really-want-those-pokemon-lego-kanto-region-badges-you-can-expect-to-pay-over-100-on-ebay-thanks-to-scalpers">resale sites such as eBay became awash with the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection</a>, which was only available via Lego as a free gift for those that pre-ordered the most expensive set from the collection, the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model.</p>

<p>The show itself is known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, and will see contestants living inside a vault set within a "high-stakes world", with those taking part competing for a "huge" cash prize.</p>

<p>"Set inside Vault-Tec's bomb-proof vaults, Fallout Shelter drops a diverse group of contestants into an immersive, high-stakes world inspired by the games' signature dark humor, retro-futurism, and post-apocalyptic survival storytelling," reads Fallout Shelter's official logline.</p>
<p>The show itself will present competitors with "a series of escalating challenges", as well as "strategic dilemmas" and some "moral crossroads" to navigate. I mean, of course! And, as this show is based on Fallout, these challenges and games will all have some kind of focus on the franchise's core SPECIAL attributes. That's strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck.</p>

<p>Those taking part will need to demonstrate "ingenuity, teamwork and resilience" to guarantee themselves not just safety, but power as well. Oh, and there is also that aforementioned cash prize at the end of it all (which after Christmas and a cascade of birthdays on this end, I wouldn't say no to right now).</p><p>Fallout Shelter will run for 10 episodes, <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/fallout-competition-show-fallout-shelter-amazon-1236632365/">Variety</a> reports, with <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting open now</a> for those over 21. Casting will close on 15th February. "Do you have what it takes to be the most SPECIAL?" the casting crew asks. Well, do you?</p>

<p>Fallout has seen quite a resurgence in popularity since Amazon's TV adaptation made its debut in 2024. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">games got a player boost with the arrival of season one</a>, a trend that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">continued with the current run of season two</a>. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming for Fallout's third season is currently expected to begin in May</a>. As for other potential Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>

            <p>Polish digital game-shop GOG has built a business out of restoring classic games - those built for a different era of computers that have been rendered no longer playable. It has been finding a way to bring old classics back since it began operating 17 years ago. But in that time things have changed. New games released during that period became modern classics in their own right and found their way onto GOG, and the company's remit slightly widened. And as time marches forward again, a new challenge in game preservation has emerged - the question of how we save or resurrect fallen multiplayer games.</p>
<p>Just this week, for example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">EA switched off the servers hosting BioWare's ill-fated multiplayer game Anthem</a>, and without the servers the game can't be accessed or played. It means that something BioWare spent several years making, and something some players spent several years playing, has now disappeared, blinked out of existence. Is this the sort of thing GOG might one day be able to restore?</p>
<p>I asked the company's managing director Maciej Gołębiewski this question in an interview, to which he replied, <strong>"</strong>Game preservation is a very complicated riddle. I'll just skim through the top-level riddles. There's the IP and ownership riddle, there is the technical aspect of it, and there's the third riddle of how to make the resurrection commercially viable, because no one can do it for goodwill because this is not how salaries are being paid.</p>
<p>"Resurrecting and bringing back multiplayer titles is something that's very complex," he added, "something that's very difficult, but it's very visibly becoming a matter of discussion among gamers, among regulators and publishers as well."</p>
<p>A large part of that conversation is being driven by the consumer-led movements <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">Stop Killing Games</a> and its European offshoot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-offshoot-confident-eu-petition-will-progress-to-legislative-phase-with-almost-half-of-signatures-now-verified">Stop Destroying Games</a>, which are petitioning governments and game-making companies in hope of establishing regulations to stop live service games like Anthem disappearing. Ubisoft's shutdown of co-operative driving game The Crew was the catalyst for the movement beginning.</p><p>"There is a broader discussion to be had within the industry of what does an end-of-life cycle look like in games - what is a fair end-of-life cycle for a game?" Gołębiewski said. "Should it just be buried and killed and no one can access it any more, and people who spent five or seven years working on it cannot really look at their creation any more because the service turned off? There is a very interesting and very complicated discussion that Stop Killing Games probably kick-started out of frustration.</p>
<blockquote><em>"At the same time, if we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games"</em></blockquote>
<p>"We want to make games live forever," he added. "At the same time, if we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games, because people will be scared of 'okay now I need to put up the funds to create it, promote it, and then upkeep it for 10 years, 20 years, because the regulator said so'. That might in turn cause there to be fewer cool games for gamers.</p>
<p>"I don't have the perfect answer yet," he said, "but it's good that the discussion is taking place."</p>
<p>There are glimpses of possible solutions in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">what games like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League did</a>. All active development and support was ceased for the game but an offline mode was added to allow people to continue to play on - and online co-op is still supported.</p><p>But Anthem being a purely multiplayer game makes it more complicated in that it has to be played with other people. One obvious solution would be to let players host their own servers, and in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-local-servers-existed-at-bioware">private servers were apparently supported and working for Anthem very close to its release</a>, we found out this week. Theoretically, then, it's possible, but it would require EA salvaging and restoring the code and handing it to the community, which is less likely to happen.</p>
<p>It's also worth bearing in mind what Gołębiewski said about making a game's resurrection commercially viable. EA didn't turn Anthem off because it was making money, after all. It shuttered the servers because there weren't enough people playing to warrant the server upkeep. Why would a game restoration service like GOG take that cost on at the risk of a similar outcome? Why also would a game restoration service like GOG attempt to resurrect a game I don't think anyone would consider a classic? Nevertheless, the point of discussion remains: what to do about live service games at the end of their lives?</p>
<p>GOG recently separated from CD Projekt, the company responsible for the Witcher and Cyberpunk games, which it has been a part of since its inception. The deal seems to have been mutually beneficial, enabling CD Projekt to focus on making games and GOG to be freed from that all-encompassing focus. Nothing major is going to change - GOG will still specialise in restoring and preserving games and offering them DRM-free - but there are some new ideas for the future, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">a foray into publishing indie games</a>.</p>

            <p>Amazon has released the first official image of Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ahead of the release of its Tomb Raider TV series.</p>
<p>The wardrobe check image, which you can see yourself below, shows Turner in an outfit very reminiscent of classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>. She's got the pistols, the shorts, everything you'd expect from a (hopefully) faithful adaptation of the video game series.</p>

<p>Set to release on Amazon Prime, the show hasn't got an official release date as of writing. We do, however, know about various casting decisions for the show ahead of a proper trailer release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Celia Imrie, Jason Isaacs, Sagourney Weaver and more have been confirmed for various roles</a> alongside the Game of Thrones star.</p><p>We also know that the show will inter-connect with the narrative present in the Tomb Raider games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-reinvent-the-franchise-and-interconnect-with-the-games">rather than being a standalone project or a continuation of the Angelina Jolie movies</a>. This tidbit comes from Story Kitchen, a production company working on the series.</p>

If you haven't already tried out the demo to see how it'll run on both platforms, then a new update from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> might get you even more hyped for the adventures of Cloud and co. on non-PlayStation and PC platforms. The publisher has announced that next Thursday, 22nd January, 2026, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch that will update existing versions of the game will all the bells and whistles coming to the new platform versions of the game. Per <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213">a tweet</a> from the company, this new patch introduces "Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up", and the option to "always hit for 9,999 damage". Boosters include the option to toggle HP full, MP full, Limit gauge full, and maximum damage dealt - all of which can be turned on and off individually or as a set.</p>
<p>If you wanted to blast through the story again to enjoy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">all the differences</a> from the original game before the launch of Part 3 (which, I imagine, we'll get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">an update about</a> sooner rather than later), this will make a replay pretty effortless. It remains to be seen whether these 'boosters' (as similar mechanics are called in older remasters in the Final Fantasy canon) will affect trophy unlocks on the PS5 version - if they don't, well, it'll make Platinum clean-ups easier for those of us that care about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>"I feel that the way people enjoy content has become more flexible these days, as we see with video streaming platforms, and that people also want the same thing from games, with options to tailor the experience based on the time they have and their levels of interest," said director Naoki Hamaguchi in a previous message about these updates. "I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p>
<p>"That’s exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pathologic-3-is-the-great-russian-novel-told-as-a-video-game-and-a-timely-critique-of-intellectualism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>
What would the great Russian novel look like as a video game? If Dostoyevsky or Gogol had lived to dabble in Unity, what would be the result? The answer might well be Pathologic 3; or, to be more precise, the series of Pathologic games, since their daunting individual thematic and narrative complexity is in part a consequence of how they stand in relation to one another.
</p>

<p>
The original Pathologic, released in 2005, told the story of a remote steppe town overcome by a mysterious plague, presented across twelve days from the points of view of three different playable characters: the Haruspex Artemy Burakh, the Bachelor Daniil Dankovsky, and the Changeling Clara. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> began life as a remake of the original, but grew into an expanded and refined retelling. As funds and time dwindled and the scope grew, however, it became the Haruspex's story only, although now roughly the length of the entire original.
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><p>Each new day starts with Dankovsky being interrogated by an inspector, with the rest of the game contextualised as Dankovsky's responses to his questions. It adds some necessary linear framing to a narrative structure that is otherwise non-linear.</p>

</figure>
<p>
More than six years later, here we are with Pathologic 3 and the Bachelor's story, which has itself become much more than a mere sequel to Pathologic 2. It is a retelling of a retelling, an oral tradition passed down through multiple gaming generations. And in that retelling, Dankovsky has evolved into a character study every bit as complex as Dostoyevsky's Raskolnikov or Ivan Turgenev's Bazarov - young men at odds with their prevailing social order, riddled with internal contradiction, acting decisively one moment and paralysed with apathy the next. Like his literary predecessors, Dankovsky is both timeless and timely: a critical look inside an intellectual at a moment when intellectualism has rarely had lower currency.
</p><p>
Dankovsky is the director of a medical research laboratory trying to learn how to stop death, drawn from the capital city to the remote town by rumours that one of its luminaries is immortal. When the plague breaks out, he is put in charge of containing it and finding a cure. It's a pressured, time-constrained role, effectively conveyed through a set of overlapping gameplay systems. Each day, you will examine and interview patients, occasionally search their homes for clues, and analyse samples to identify symptoms. Successfully diagnosing all the patients enables production of a temporary vaccine, which can be distributed through a town management layer. The goal is always to keep infection rates low enough to get to the next day.  
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Part muse, part empathetic foil to Dankovsky's intellectual detachment, Eva Yan can be spoken with every day at the Stillwater, Dankovsky's temporary headquarters. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The Bachelor reflects that there is a relationship between halting the plague and finding immortality, between stopping Death and deaths, the abstract and the concrete instantiations of it. It is an unusual bit of synthesis for a man who otherwise spends most of his time on the horns of a dilemma: his desire to discover immortality versus his sense of duty to stop the plague, his condescending dismissal of the town and its traditions against the slow realisation that it may be impossible to cure the plague without a holistic - medical, ethnographic, architectural - understanding of the town, his scientific pursuit of truth versus the political and social reality that constrains that truth, the vanity of academic recognition versus the quiet honourability of doing what is required, of being able to live with oneself. The Bachelor has been trained to dissect and analyse - as he himself observes, to see things in terms of the cells that constitute them - but he is up against something that may only be comprehensible as a complex, indivisible whole. What if the town is the primitive, unanalysable concept that provides the means of analysing the phenomena within it?
</p>
<p>
The internal struggle is familiar. Raskolnikov had convinced himself intellectually that he had the right to murder to elevate himself, but could not cope with it spiritually. Bazarov dismissed love as a relic incompatible with his nihilistic rejection of the old social order, but could not help falling in love. They are the struggles of intellectual detachment against the realities of life. Pathologic 3 channels these literary classics, especially by putting its town somewhere at the turn of the 20th century, but Dankovsky's character study has the benefit of the unique devices of the video game medium.
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Unlike Pathologic 2, which was open world, travel in Pathologic 3 is done between city areas via a map. It represents Dankovsky's division of, and comparative lack of engagement with, the town. (It also boosts performance.) | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Besides a traditional health bar, Pathologic 3 has just two meters: time, and a continuum between apathy and mania, which is affected by almost everything you do and which must be kept in balance if Dankovsky is to remain alive. While I am a little squeamish about the apparent gamification of mental health implied by these mechanics, they are undoubtedly effective in establishing a core premise: the Bachelor is a well-to-do big city intellectual who doesn't have to contend with trivialities like food or disease. Dankovsky's needs are so close to the self-realisation apex of Maslow's pyramidal hierarchy that he cannot even see its foundations. In gameplay terms, and in contrast to Pathologic 2, he does not get tired, hungry, or sick.
</p><p>
That all-consuming craving for intellectual fulfillment should be familiar to anyone who has ever been absorbed in a big project, when the only thing that seems to matter is that project. In that context, the idea of time as a resource should be equally familiar - if only I had more time, another day to investigate, a chance to revisit the false starts. Just so, in Pathologic 3 time is literally a resource: it can be spent to revisit any of the twelve days to remake key decisions or finish off incomplete tasks, in an effort to thread your way towards a desired ending. Aptly, time is usually collected by looking in a mirror and smashing it - an action that is supposed to represent a multiversal fracturing of different possible Bachelors, but also symbolises self-reflection and self-critique.
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Blue objects raise apathy when touched or kicked; red objects raise mania. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Appropriately, your play with time rarely works out quite the way you would like. The game does not simulate a full butterfly effect, of course, but nudging one thing tends to dislodge something else, create unintended consequences, spiral into a causal chain whose links become too difficult to isolate with any certainty, despite the game's helpful mind map UI. Instead, the overall effect is to communicate a sense of a man consumed by his work, dashing around in manic fits and starts to try to finish everything, prone to depression when things go against him, slowly losing momentum as the days go on and things slip increasingly out of his control.
</p>
<p>
Take a step back to reflect on how the apathy-mania meter works and you also start to suspect that Dankovsky is unwell. It's possible to stimulate apathy or mania by touching certain objects in the town, but often you are forced to use amphetamines and opioids to keep yourself balanced. In later days, it is pointed out repeatedly that Dankovsky has a reputation around town as a drug addict. Here, Pathologic 3 trades on established gaming conventions to lull you into a sense of denial: I can't be a drug addict, because I don't have buffs applied when I've taken drugs or debuffs when I suffer withdrawal, the way I might do, say, in Fallout. Yet the apathy-mania meter is dynamic, moving constantly, and the need to feed it with this or that stimulant is likewise a ceaseless struggle.
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The Polyhedron, the town's most overtly impossible object, is shelter for some of the town's children, who are a social order unto themselves. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Pathologic 3 also plays with its own tropes here. Fourth wall breaks and bends are a staple of the series, usually delivered through extensive, beautifully written dialogue. The games rely heavily on a Gogol-like sense of surrealism and defamiliarisation - of ordinary things given a tinge of the extraordinary or absurd, or the extraordinary presented as everyday - to put the player into a sense of permanent ambiguity. So when Pathologic 3 introduces one of its new dialogue mechanics, where the camera suddenly switches perspectives to Dankovsky's interlocutor and you see Dankovsky, it's tempting to view it as another fourth wall break. What if, however, these episodes are intended to be taken literally, as out-of-body experiences that are symptomatic of Dankovsky's general condition?
</p><p>
Dankovsky's individual apathy-mania meter mirrors a grander balancing act: keeping the infection rate low typically involves sanitary measures that raise disorder in the town, leading to a riot if not kept in check. Town management, therefore, is also a matter of weaving between the extremes of physical and social sickness. Sometimes, Dankovsky has to take a literal fight to the plague in infected regions. These nightmarish sequences involve shooting a monstrous physical manifestation of the plague, even as Dankovsky grapples with whether he is witnessing genuine phenomena in a town that doesn't comply with known natural laws, or slowly losing his sanity.
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Like Pathologic 2, Pathologic 3 runs on Unity. However, it has been rebuilt from the ground up, including modern lighting and more detailed models. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The picture that emerges, then, is of a conflicted, overly analytical, detached man, obsessed with his work to the point of sickness. It is a picture that feels sadly relevant in a time when the popular image of the intellectual, gnawed by a rising wave of populism, is somewhere between an ineffectual navel-gazer and a cold elitist. It is not the full story, however. Pathologic 3 reminds us that it is precisely Dankovsky's intellectualism that makes him an effective antidote to the plague. His training and research supply the faculties necessary to establish a hospital, to diagnose patients and develop daily vaccines to slow the plague's progress, to work out the appropriate quarantine and hygiene methods for the town - all nuances that are conveyed through their own gameplay systems. For all his arrogance, and the prejudice against the town's supernatural phenomena, it is ultimately the Bachelor's commitment to the scientific method that leaves the door open for him to consider them.
</p>
<p>
The parallels between Pathologic and the Covid pandemic are too obvious; in the case of Pathologic 2, which came out less than a year before the outbreak, they are uncanny. Nonetheless, Dankovsky's political trajectory in Pathologic 3 is instructive. The authorities are initially all too eager to rely on his scientific expertise and status, to put trust and power in his hands, until the social and economic necessities catch up to them and turn scientific fact into an inconvenient thorn of objectivity. And if scientific facts cannot be manipulated to fit their agendas, then perhaps Dankovsky, as the fallible mouthpiece for those facts, can be. In the later stages of the game, in the increasingly dogged attacks on Dankovsky's projects by an all-powerful special bureau, there is a sinister hint of an older breed of anti-intellectualism - the systematic persecution of allegedly bourgeois intelligentsia under the Soviet regime. The insinuation of a link between modern day populist anti-intellectualism and historic state-sanctioned persecution of thought may not be an explicit theme, but it is difficult to avoid drawing the parallel.
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Disease diagnosis has a similar feel to it as deduction in Return of the Obra Dinn. It's the source of some of Pathologic 3's greatest frustrations and satisfaction. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Then again, perhaps I am looking for a charitable reading of Dankovsky in Pathologic 3 because I am cut from the same cloth as he is. My upbringing and the training I received make me prone to even more elaborate bouts of over-analysis, so is it not natural that I would try to look on the Bachelor in a favourable light? When contextualised against Pathologic 2, in which the Haruspex solved the plague without the Bachelor's fancy expertise, that assessment feels even more tempting. Well, maybe so, but the main strength of Pathologic 3 is a protagonist that feels real. And, just as with any real person, the best way to judge whether I am right or wrong about Dankovsky is to meet him for yourself.

            <p>Over a thousand games from a single developer have been suddenly removed from the PlayStation store in what appears to be a massive move by Sony to shift shovelware games off the PS5 and PS5 store.</p>
<p>The developer in question was ThiGames, which prior to the wipe yesterday was the fourth highest ranked developer on the PlayStation Store in terms of quantity. <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">According to RobThanatos who first spotted the change</a>, all of ThiGames released games have been totally removed from the store. The only exception being trophies tied to these titles, which remain present to those who unlocked them.</p>
<p>As of writing, there has been no statement from either Sony or ThiGames as to why this widespread removal of games has happened. It is, however, worth noting that ThiGames is known for games of a particular quality. Take The Jumping Fries, in which you play fries and jump around. See also The Jumping Taco, The Jumping Hot Dog, The Jumping Soda, and The Jumping Taco TURBO. Eat your heart out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>

<p>As for why these games had a playerbase? Well, if you refer to the video above you'll find a full platinum trophy guide for The Jumping Taco TURBO. You may notice that the video is 95 seconds in length. That is because the trophy lists attached to these games are incredibly simple, in The Jumping Taco's case a collection of 'Jump x times' milestones. As such, these games (now removed) were valuable to those keen to inflate their PlayStation trophy collection.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-removes-slop-shovelware-ps5-games-following-investigation">This is not the first time Sony has removed shovelware games from its PS5 store</a>. Roughly a year ago, the company took action against Randomspin. That developer was suspected of using AI and/or recycled assets, and was quietly removed. It too was releasing a massive number of games within a relatively short period of time, much like ThiGames.</p>
<p>Would you be happy to see similar action taken by Sony on other developers on the PlayStation Store? Let us know below!</p>

<p>Found as the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbisoftMusic/videos">video uploads on the Ubisoft Music YouTube channel</a>, a collection of sailing bangers including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KhmjBzuXM4">Over the Hills and Far Away</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2IxTpgLQjo">Spanish Ladies</a> can be enjoyed in all their glory. A few comments have even been made by early birds, including one by Spriteking3944 who wrote: "Very subtle release Ubisoft".</p>
<p>What are they talking about? Well, the Black Flag remake is perhaps the most poorly kept secret in Ubisoft's repertoire as of writing. Back in August of last year, voice actor Matt Ryan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">claimed legal action was brought against him by Ubisoft</a> after cheekily hinting at its existence at a convention.</p>

<p>Then, last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">Ubisoft financial reports stated an unannounced title was due to release in the fourth quarter of this financial year</a>. If that wasn't enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">a PEGI listing for a Black Flag remake was spotted</a> in December, ahead of The Game Awards. This isn't even the first hint at a Black Flag remake this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">a Raid: Shadow Legends collaboration with Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed leading many to further expect its imminent reveal</a>.</p><p>These music tracks, which on their lonesome appear to be just a part of a continued archival process by Ubisoft for its music library, is yet more sponge on the ever-growing Black Flag remake layer cake. When we'll see it properly revealed, or whether we will at all, remains a mystery.</p>
<p>If you've not played Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Tom Bradwell noted: "Edward doesn't have the impish wit of fan favourite Ezio Auditore, against whom all Assassin's Creed protagonists are destined to be measured, but in the end he felt more rounded to me. The revelation, though, is the treasure of a game he stars in."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has released a new set of PC specs for its upcoming Bond origin game, 007 First Light. This is following "inconsistencies" in the previous versions, which were brought to its attention by the community.</p>
<p>According to the developer, these inconsistencies were due to "internal miscommunication", which resulted in previous versions of the game's PC specs being shared. IO has now conducted further testing, and made corrections to 007 First Light's PC specifications, including updated VRAM values, a reduction in the recommended RAM (it's gone from 32GB to 16GB) and the minimum CPU line "has been fixed".</p>
<p>The studio apologised for any confusion it caused with its earlier specifications, adding it will be sharing additional performance targets for 007 First Light closer to the game's launch in May.</p>

            <p>Earth Must Die, the new game by Dan Marshall's Size Five Game, has just been given a 27th January release date and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639780/Earth_Must_Die/">a Steam demo</a>.</p>
<p>Earth Must Die is the comedian-packed, point-and-click-style space comedy in which you play as the villain - a Ming the Merciless-style tyrant called VValak Lizardtongue - and where you have to decide "how much of a dick you're going to be". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/earth-must-die-is-a-comedian-packed-point-and-click-in-which-you-decide-how-much-of-a-dick-you-want-to-be">Those are the words of Dan Marshall</a>, by the way, who I talked to about the game when it was announced last year.</p>

<figure>

</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr0mqovgrHA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>Like many of Size Five Games, it plays in the classic point-and-click, adventure game way, but also like Marshall's previous games, there's a twist. In this case, it's a point-and-click game without an inventory and in which the main character doesn't want to pick anything up, because he thinks it's beneath him.</p><p>Arguably the most eye-catching feature of Earth Must Die, though, besides the bright cartoon artwork, is the list of actors voicing the game. Leading it are Joel Fry (Hizdahr in Game of Thrones, if you watched it), Ben Starr, Martha Howe-Douglas (co-creator of Ghosts), Alex Horne (Taskmaster), Mike Wozniak (Man Down, Taskmaster, Three Bean Salad podcast), Don Warrington (Rising Damp!), Matthew Holness (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace), Tamsin Greig (Black Books, Green Wing!), and Stevie Martin, Julie Nolke, Sophie Duker, Emma Fryer, Alasdair Beckett-King, Rosie Holt, Jon Blyth, Sam O'Leary, Tom Lawrinson, Sally Beaumont, David Montieth and Inel Tomlinson. See what I mean?</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough of a recommendation, consider Size Five Games' previous work: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lair-of-the-clockwork-god-review-platform-meets-adventure-with-hilarious-consequences">Lair of the Clockwork God, a relentlessly hilarious point-and-click game merged with a platformer</a> that I'm still sore I didn't give five stars to instead of four. "Bottomless wit and some inspired design choices make this genre mash-up a joy to play," I wrote at the time (2020).</p>
<p>Publisher No More Robots added during the release date announcement that Earth Must Die will be roughly an eight-hour game.</p>

            <p>A new job listing posted by MMO developer ArenaNet has reignited hopes about Guild Wars 3 being in development.</p>
<p><a href="https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/arenanet/jobs/7536965">The listing</a>, advertising a role for a senior writer / narrative designer, explicitly states this new employee would be working on an unannounced project,  though one aspect of the role would be editing: "the narrative of Guild Wars". This, alongside a stated desire for applicants with experience working on MMO and a familiarity with MMO narratives, has many Guild Wars fans excited.</p>
<p>It is true too that the existence of Guild Wars 3 has been whispered about for some time. Last year, <a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/news/guild-wars-3-confirmed-to-be-in-development-though-it-seems-its-still-in-its-early-stages-updated-2000130976">the game was mentioned explicitly in an NCSoft Shareholders meeting as an 'in-development project'</a>. At the time, ArenaNet stated: "the team's focus is on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a> development".</p>

<p>The job listing also requests a familiarity with Unreal Engine 5, indicating that the proprietary engine used in Guild Wars 2 (and the original Guild Wars) may be left by the wayside for this new ArenaNet project.</p>
<p>There has been some increased murmuring around Guild Wars as of late. Not only have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29720/Guild_Wars_Reforged/">Guild Wars: Reforged</a> and Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity been released recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpm2fBvrAbw">but an extensive documentary about Guild Wars</a> was created at the tail end of 2025 to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary.</p><p>It's true that the MMORPG space is in a bit of a weird spot right now, with older MMORPGs seeing a resurgence as new releases fail to entice genre fans. Guild Wars 2 itself has benefited from this, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1284210/charts/">seeing an all-time-peak of Steam players only two months ago</a>. Meanwhile the future of new MMORPGs looks somewhat sparse, save for whatever ArenaNet is working on and Riot Games' own MMO project.</p>

            <p>Amazon's live action God of War series has found its Kratos, and it's a name you may already recognise from the franchise.</p>
<p>Ryan Hurst has been cast as Kratos in the upcoming show from Sony Pictures Television and Amazon MGM Studios. Along with his live action credits, which include as Gerry Bertier in Remember the Titans and Opie Winston in Sons of Anarchy, Hurst also portrayed Thor in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, for which he scored himself a BAFTA nomination.</p>

<p>Sharing the news of Hurst's casting, game developer <a href="https://x.com/SonySantaMonica/status/2011529734682010108">Sony Santa Monica said</a>: "We're excited to see his take on Kratos as he joins the legendary ranks of T.C. Carson and Christopher Judge who have each shaped this character in unforgettable ways."</p>
<p>Speaking of Judge - who played Kratos in God of War 2018 and its sequel - the actor also sent his congratulations to Hurst. "You're gonna be great… BOI !!!" he <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/2011575459436454176">wrote on social media</a>, with an accompanying heart emoji. Of course, Judge's booming call to Kratos' son Atreus with a simple "Boy!" is one of God of War's most memorable lines.</p><p>As for the series, it will follow the path of Santa Monica's most recent Norse-based God of War games. "God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," <a href="https://press.amazonmgmstudios.com/us/en/press-release/ryan-hurst-tapped-to-play-kratos-in-prime-videos-i">reads the show's official logline</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series</a>. Toye's works include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">Amazon's acclaimed Fallout series</a>, and The Walking Dead. Meanwhile, in 2023, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for his work on Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.</p>
<p>The director joined showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on the upcoming series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of 2024</a>, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>. Now I just wonder who will play Atreus…</p>

            <p>I did not anticipate it'd take me an hour to start my first game of Hytale after loading it up, but you can thank its surprisingly involved character creator for that. Eventually,though - after fashioning a blonde 'tashed, barechested, leather-clad lothario who swings a little more 'porn star' than I was aiming for - I finally went in, and the positive impressions continued.</p>

<p>In case the drama has passed you by, Hytale's early access launch this week is something of a miracle. Last summer, after a decade of development, the ambitious RPG-styled Minecraft-a-like was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">cancelled by League of Legends studio Riot Games</a>, who'd bought its creator Hypixel some five years prior. It looked like there'd be no happy ending for Hytale, but the stars aligned, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">re-acquired the rights</a>, and here we are now, one day after its hugely successful (to the tune of almost 3m players) release.</p>
<p>It's a lovely victory in an industry that's felt a little short of good news in recent times, but with all that development chaos, my expectations for Hytale's earliest early access were pretty low - particularly after Collins-Laflamme's pre-launch warnings that the game, in its initial guise, wasn't "good yet". But it turns out Collins-Laflamme was perhaps being a little too modest, because this early version of Hytale, while certainly far from complete, <em>is</em> good, and in the few hours I've played, I (and my porn-tashed avatar) have been having a blast.</p>

<figcaption>Here's an official look at Hytale's robust creative tools.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavNidH3wnc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Admittedly, whatever Hytale might eventually become as development continues, it's hard to describe it as anything other than fantasy Minecraft right now. There are some obvious differentiators - a magic system, for instance, and an enjoyably flexible combat system built around varied weapons and attack styles - but the core experience it currently offers, at least from what I've seen so far, is a very familiar one. This is a game of exploration and survival, of building, resource gathering, and crafting, all in a vast, blocky sandbox world. And if you've even a modicum of Minecraft experience under your belt, you'll feel immediately, instinctively comfortable here (although, if you're anything like me, prepare to be unreasonably dazzled by the fact that smashing a tree trunk with your axe causes the whole thing to come down).</p>



<p>But honestly, that familiarity is <em>fine</em>. It's a tried and tested (and massively popular) formula, and already Hytale pulls it off extremely well. And while any major differentiating flourishes might still be some way off, what's here, crucially, is engaging and remarkably polished, all centred around some impressively robust tools. And if the success of a sandbox game is defined by the possibilities it affords, Hytale already feels well on the right path.</p><p>There's cooking and smelting and smithery; weapon crafting, furniture building, farming and animal husbandry, with progression through each nudging you further afield. And the worlds Hytale is currently capable of generating show plenty of promise. So far I've seen dust-swept deserts and rich green meadows; I've explored autumnal forests and sweeping coast lines. I've spelunked to peculiar depths where lava seeps and forest blooms, and portaled to stranger climes too. And scattered throughout, giving the world a welcome bit of extra texture, are ancient ruins, dilapidated mansions, crumbling farmhouses, mysterious temples, and more. Not all of it's particularly interesting after the initial thrill of discovery, mind, but it feels cohesive and coherent, nailing a certain whimsical fantasy appeal.</p>



<p>And as day turns to night and back again, as the fog rolls in and storm clouds erupt, the world also manages a pleasing sense of of dynamism, helped along by a pleasantly relaxing environmental soundscape (the chill music's pretty good too) and a decent menagerie of critters and foes. I've bashed skeleton warriors and giant spiders, been chased by bears and gollum-like guards. I've spotted frogs, startled fawns, spied foxes, sheep, chickens, snakes, rats, many of them meandering around with little 'uns. World-wise, if I've any complaint right now, it's a comparative one; the terrain is all rather same-y, managing none of the dramatic landscapes Minecraft's world generation does so well. Changes, though, are <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/the-future-of-world-generation">coming</a>.</p><p>There's plenty more planned too, of course (including a more structured Adventure mode with a proper story and quests) but, without those more significant differentiators, it may be a while before Hytale can properly escape Minecraft's shadow. Even so, this week's early access release feels like a splendid start; a flexible, well-featured - and already enjoyable - foundation with plenty of polish and attention to detail. And beyond what Hypixel is currently cooking up itself, the studio's offering substantial support for modding and other creative avenues as it looks to foster the sort of community that's served Minecraft so well. So yes, only a day in and Hytale shows lots of promise - and with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">next two years of funding already secured</a>, the once seemingly doomed game could be looking at a very bright future.</p>

<p>I am personally quite curious about The Exit 8, and given my new year's resolution (at least in terms of video games) is to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-new-year-2026-gaming-resolutions-i-want-to-see-how-close-i-can-get-to-100-percenting-the-game-in-24-hours">make sure I get my money's worth from my various subscriptions</a>, I am going to give this one a bash. If you haven't heard of it before, it's a walking simulator inspired by Japanese underground passageways. Now, I admit that doesn't sound great at first, but here's the thing: you are trapped in this seemingly endless passageway, and have to pay careful attention to your surroundings in order to find your way out.</p><p>Another one I am tempted to try is A Little to the Left, which I missed when it originally released back in 2022. It's a cosy puzzle game which sees you organise household items. While I gather it doesn't leave quite the same impression as Unpacking, I am more than happy to play something cosy while it is still ruddy freezing outside.</p>

        <p>"Having one single owner simplifies a lot of things."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Newly independent PC digital game shop GOG is interested in getting into publishing indie games - something it apparently couldn't do while part of CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>It's a notable change for a company that's focused primarily on restoring classic old games as well as selling some newer games - notably CD Projekt Red games - since its launch 17 years ago. But it's one of the areas Michał Kiciński, the company's new owner, told me this newly untethered company can now step into.</p>
<p>"I'm also co-owner of an indie game publishing company called Retrovibe," Kiciński said - Retrovibe being the publisher responsible for retro-styled games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/893680/Project_Warlock/">Project Warlock</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1183800/Shardpunk/">Shardpunk</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1640320/BIOTA/">BIOTA</a>. "So one of the directions which were not that much possible in the past is evolving GOG more into publishing business, and that's something we will certainly discuss.</p>
<p>"No decisions have been made yet," Kiciński added, "but this opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red as one group, because at CD Projekt Red, all publishing activities were connected with their own games, and they didn't want to spread attention into some other topics."</p><p>GOG had before now always been part of CD Projekt, the parent company of CD Projekt Red, but as the company evolved away from game distribution and more towards making its own games, CD Projekt Red grew to encompass the totality of what CD Projekt did and does. That's why GOG was put up for sale last year.</p>
<blockquote><em>"This opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red"</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seeing-red-the-story-of-cd-projekt">Kiciński was one of the founders of GOG, coincidentally, and a co-founder of CD Projekt</a>. But he hasn't worked at the company since 2012, since before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, remaining only as a major shareholder since.</p>
<p>Leaving the safety of CD Projekt Red's orbit might seem like a challenging thing to do, given the prestige of that company and the excitement surrounding its games. GOG leveraged those games with attractive price promotions and enjoyed an elevated position courtesy of its proximity to CD Projekt Red. But the gravitational pull of that burgeoning studio worked both ways.</p><p>"It's quite a common business situation when you have two entities of very different sizes in one group, and naturally, the attention and resources goes to the bigger part and the smaller part has <em>some</em> benefits but also has some difficulties in being a much smaller brother in such an environment," Kiciński said.</p>
<p>The upside for GOG, now that it's privately owned and entirely by Kiciński, is there are no investors to worry about, so decisions can be made quickly and perhaps be riskier as result. GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski noticed the opposite thing creep in during the past 10 years he's been there, as the company grew massively following the release of The Witcher 3.</p>
<p>"CDPR, since I've joined the company, grew so much and became a much more complex organisation, stretched across continents," Gołębiewski said. "GOG is a fairly small and nimble company. Having one single owner simplifies a lot of things in terms of potential decision making or risk appetite. A big company that's listed on a public stock exchange: it's probably a little bit more complicated or complex to execute risky stuff."</p>
<p>"That's a good point," Kiciński added. "I know from the other projects I'm involved in, the decision making process is super easy. I'm super accessible and decisions can be made fast, and also, I'm not afraid of risk as a private investor."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have a big appetite for the growth of GOG"</em></blockquote>
<p>Besides a possible move into publishing games, there aren't plans to dramatically change what GOG does. The founding principle of finding and restoring old games that no longer work remains a strong one, as does selling games with no DRM. And the close relationship with CD Projekt Red will continue, courtesy of a six-year deal that offers very favourable rates on GOG, I'm told.</p>
<p>It probably also helps that the two companies are neighbours, housed inside the same office complex, and that Kiciński is a major CD Projekt shareholder. The two companies might be separate but they're not entirely separated. Not yet.</p>
<p>But it's early days. The deal was only completed in mid-December and Kiciński wasn't sure it would go through until it did. There were rival bidders. So his first day back in the office today, 8th January when we spoke, marked the proper start of figuring out what's next.</p><p>"What we agreed already is that GOG can improve on what's doing right now," he said. "We also discussed that there is no need for any pivots or changes in philosophy or something like that. GOG has a very special place on the market, very unique values, very loyal customers, and we appreciate that, and we want to build up on that, not changing too much. So that's what was discussed. And we already started discussing the publishing activities possible with GOG.</p>
<p>"And that's it. Then we have a few weeks and months to work out the bigger strategy for the future. But for sure, we have a big appetite for the growth of GOG."</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">Developer Direct stream from Xbox</a> is happening next week, and with it we'll get a "deep dive" into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>. This is the previously announced next entry in the open-world driving series, which will take us to Japan. However, a surprise may have been spoiled early.</p>
<p>Via user <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925?s=20">XBOX INFINITE on X/Twitter</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/14/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leaks-in-fh5/">Xbox Era</a>), we've received what could be the first look at an in-game promotion of Forza Horizon 6 and its pre-order bonuses. When asked about the screenshot, the user claims they got the pop-up after exiting their garage in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The pop-up is placed on top of new art showcasing one of the stunning environments we can expect to visit during the next Horizon Festival. Pre-orders allegedly include an extra vehicle: "Pre-order now and get a pre-tuned and exclusive Ferrari J50 in Forza Horizon 6!"</p>
<p>There's also the promise of "over 550 real-world cars" at launch and the largest open-world in the series yet, with the Premium Edition adding Early Access (on 15th May, thus making the regular release date 19th May), VIP Membership, Welcome Pack, Car Pass, Time Attack Car Pack, and a post-launch Italian Passion Car Pack plus two Premium Expansions. It's all believable if you've been paying attention to past entries and their DLC offerings.</p><p>Xbox and Playground Games haven't confirmed or denied anything yet, but it wouldn't be the first time an in-game pop-up in previous games has revealed what's next in a series, so I'm personally leaning towards someone having pressed a button way too early. Oops.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 is currently set to release exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC (Xbox and Steam), but a PS5 port at some point is likely, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-ps5-port-tops-5-million-sales-securing-300m-in-additional-sales-for-xbox">its predecessor has already sold over 5m copies on Sony's console</a>.</p>

            <p>Japanese video game developer Cygames has released a new statement regarding its use of AI, after last week announcing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cygames-ai-studio-formed">intention to create an AI-focused subsidiary company</a>, which stirred up a certain amount of discourse.</p>
<p>Writing on social media platform X, the studio - which is known for a variety of popular games including Umamusume: Pretty Derby - apologised for the "concern" it had caused. It added its original announcement was a "simplified" one, which did not address "any of the current problems and social debates" around generative AI.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Cygames stated that art produced via generative AI is not used in its products, and all of its current games have been "crafted from the technical know-how and manual work" of its staff. It furthered that the studio "won't implement generative AI into [its] products without prior notice" to the community.</p>
<p>On the topic of its community, the studio said it holds those of us who love games - including creators and artists - "in the highest regard". Cygames intends to continue honouring free expression while striving to deliver "the best in entertainment", it closed, with another apology to its fans and supporters.</p>

<p>You, of course, don't need me to tell you how rampant the AI discourse in the industry is at the moment. Just this morning, we reported on Hazelight founder Josef Fares' thoughts about the technology, where the developer said he doesn't see AI "taking over", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-and-it-takes-two-director-josef-fares-doesnt-see-ai-taking-over-but-admits-who-knows-what-happens-in-the-future">nor does he see any issue with using AI as long as it isn't generative</a>. Meanwhile, a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">other Japanese studios such as Square Enix</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">Sega have expressed interest in AI use</a>.</p>
<p>As for Cygames, Umamusume: Pretty Derby <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">won the best mobile game award at last year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>

            <p>Right now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a> is one of the largest video game franchises around. Amazon's highly successful TV show only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">took the series popularity to the next level</a>. However, before Bethesda decided to take things in a different direction after acquiring the series from Black Isle Studios and Interplay Entertainment, the series wasn't nearly as famous. In fact, veteran narrator Ron Perlman has revealed his first payment for work on the games was hilariously meager.</p>
<p>"They invited me to do the very first Fallout back in the 90s, I think. They gave me 40 dollars and a sandwich," the actor revealed during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5iSCL4o61w">an appearance in The Joe Vulpis Podcast</a>. The renowned Hollywood actor was very specific about the sum of money offered, but we don't know for sure if that was <em>everything </em>or just his way of saying he was paid very little, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-was-always-seen-as-a-b-project-28-years-since-the-post-apocalyptic-rpg-launched-its-original-creators-reflect-on-a-long-legacy-starting-with-that-very-first-bomb/">the game had a notoriously difficult journey to completion and release</a> and was generally seen as a big risk for the original developers.</p>
<p>In the end, the RPG became a critical hit and sold enough copies to warrant a sequel which came out in October 1998, a year later. "A year and a half" after recording his part for Fallout 1, Perlman had already forgotten about the gig (or so he says, now, in 2026), so he was shocked to hear a sequel was happening because the original had gone "through the f***ing roof." Past that point, the actor's voice became an essential part of the Fallout series, and we can only assume that the remuneration got better as the franchise grew larger.</p>
<p>"I didn't see that coming," he concluded before moving on to discuss other voice acting roles. And if you're wondering whether he played any of the Fallout games, the answer is: no. It's all about dollars and sandwiches for him. His last credit on the series is 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> as the Speaker, so there are reasons to believe we'll be hearing him again in the future (whenever that might be, for the game series).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some fans are convinced Perlman has a surprise cameo in Fallout Season 2 based on <a href="https://x.com/FO4News/status/1998341465735307751?s=20">his presence at the premiere</a> and a suspicious deep voice in one of the trailers. We'll find out soon enough.</p>

            <p>Good news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' free 3.0 Switch update for all owners has been released earlier than we thought.</p>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons' highly anticipated 3.0 update was expected to be released for those here in the UK at 1am tomorrow, 15th January. However, many of us very excited folks at Eurogamer have discovered that the update is actually available to download now. Yes, you read that correctly. It is available <strong>now</strong>.</p>

<p>As I type, our wonderful Guides team is downloading the 3.0 update. I, alas, will have to wait for my lunch break, which thankfully isn't too far away. Anyway, I digress. Back to that update!</p>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 sees - among other things - the grand opening of a new Resort Hotel down on the pier, which is run by Kapp'n's family, as well as a new Reset Service, courtesy of Resetti, that'll offer a quick way to get a fresh start.</p><p>Something our Kelsey is quite excited about is the introduction of bulk crafting. In fact, there are a few things she is excited about, and Kelsey has created a handy guide detailing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/top-five-things-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update">the five things you need to check-out first in Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update</a>.</p>

            <p>We're only two weeks into 2026, but the new year hasn't been kind to Ubisoft employees. Right after the closure of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">Ubisoft Halifax</a> and layoffs at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-continues-new-wave-of-layoffs-as-55-jobs-are-expected-to-be-cut-at-massive-and-stockholm-offices">Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm</a>, roles are reportedly being cut at Ubisoft Abu Dhabi too.</p>
<p>Game industry news and analysis site <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ubisoft-laying-off-staff-at-abu-dhabi-studio">Game Developer</a> shared on 14th January several employees at the studio were posting on LinkedIn about cuts happening <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7400125428398485507-ZyjH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">as far back as December 2025</a>. A bit of digging reveals <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-kovacs-206b2316a_i-took-some-time-to-reflect-after-being-impacted-activity-7401147823175639040-t3WE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">similar posts</a> by more ex-employees, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zshafiq_opentowork-opentowork-ubisoft-activity-7416772579723665409-Xgp6?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADFAsRABhOsYZ5gi1rHJt8siTTjfHP2Sa-k">the latest</a> appearing on the site earlier this week. The full impact of the layoffs at the studio is unclear, but it seems it's not being shut down.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/locations/abu-dhabi">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a> was opened in 2011 and "serves as Ubisoft's Regional Hub for games development." The studio has worked on mobile games such as CSI: Hidden Crimes (pictured above) and the big free-to-play sandbox MMO <a href="https://www.growtopiagame.com/">Growtopia</a>.</p>
<p>The new wave of layoffs arrived shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">Ubisoft and Tencent formed the subsidiary Vantage Studios</a> to house the Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry franchises. It is widely assumed those are the safest Ubisoft properties moving forward, which explains why studios not directly involved with them are currently being hit the hardest.</p><p>Ubisoft's 2026 release schedule has yet to be defined even if we know new triple-A heavy hitters are in development as we speak. For now, we're expecting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remakes</a> to help boost those numbers, and we heard of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-definitive-edition">surprise "definitive edition" of the first Division game</a> earlier this week too.</p>

            <p>Josef Fares, known for his outspoken and often expletive laden thoughts (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/josef-fares-sweary-oscars-rant-hidden-in-it-takes-two">remember <em>that </em>Oscars rant</a>?), has now shared his opinion on one of the moment's hottest topics: AI.</p>
<p>AI really can't be escaped these days. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. It is fair to say that figure will likely be higher now.</p>

<p>But, what of Fares' studio Hazelight, which has released acclaimed games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> since its conception.</p>
<p>"We have been working with AI for a long time in game development," Fares said during a recent interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. The vocal developer added that if an AI tool is "helpful to get your vision out there", then he doesn't see "why we shouldn't look into it". However, when it comes to generative AI, he understands that's where people are less keen to see the technology adopted, and this controversial tool is where "the problem" is.</p><p>"It's really hard to answer. If you look at Midjourney, for instance, when it came out it was so impressive. And five years later… the bar hasn't gone up much," Fares explained. "Maybe this is the limit of it. You get someone generating a game concept and saying, 'oh look what might happen in five years?' But who knows? In five years, maybe it’s going to be like Midjourney… not much better."</p>
<p>When it all comes down to it, though, Fares stated there still needs to be "someone that has a vision or idea of what game it is", and therefore he doesn't  "see AI taking over". That said, he admitted it's also "really hard to answer", because: "Who knows what happens in the future?"</p>

<p>Elsewhere during his chat with The Game Business, Fares also shared his support for EA, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gets-more-than-they-deserve-says-split-fiction-director-josef-fares">the Split Fiction publisher gets "more shit than they deserve"</a>.</p>
<p>As for AI, last week a patent filed by Sony over a year ago resurfaced, revealing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-patented-an-ai-gaming-ghost-that-will-play-playstation-games-for-you-when-you-get-stuck">company has ideas for an AI 'ghost' that could assist players if they get stuck in a game</a>.</p>

            <p>Following a strong launch back in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6</a> unleashed a notable first season of content, which was expected to end around 20th January. However, following heated feedback, EA and Battlefield Studios are saying Season 2 will now arrive in February.</p>
<p>The meaty update on the state of the game and what's next <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2807960/view/497217247660478118?l=english">arrived on 13th January</a>, after the quiet Christmas break. The teams don't go into much depth about the "community feedback" that prompted the decision to delay season two until 17th February, but it reaffirms their vision as explained around the game's launch: Content won't be pushed out just to keep the live service going if more tinkering is needed.</p>

<p>The extension of season one will add almost an entire month to the battle pass completion time, and new content is coming to keep the faithful busy until 17th February. "The Season One extension update to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> and REDSEC will be released on 20th January, which will include new weekly challenges, a Bonus Path, and a continuation of the Season One Battle Pass until the start date of Season Two," the team said.</p>
<p>The 'Frostfire Bonus Path' will drop on 27th January, and add "new customisation rewards, including a Weapon Package and a Soldier Skin, as well as XP Boosts". This new path of the season one battle pass will only use regular weekly challenges for progression after criticism of past bonus challenges. Moreover, it can be worked on alongside the main path. And yes, owners of the premium pass will get extra cosmetics. Expect more details soon.</p><p>"Later this update, we'll be celebrating Valentine's Day: commit to your duo now, or forever hold your peace. We're also introducing another set of Daily Login Rewards and several Double XP Weekends throughout the update period," the latest post added. Events aren't slowing down, it seems.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 continues to enjoy success, but the (admittedly impatient) hardcore military shooter player base has been quite vocal about hit registration issues and the need for bigger maps even if Season One already delivered on that front. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> missing most of its shots, Battlefield is in a good position at the moment, but looking at how massive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders</a> is becoming, EA and Battlefield Studios could be on the clock to please the diehards before they decide to move on.</p>
<p>Needless to say, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vince-zampella-co-creator-of-call-of-duty-and-respawn-entertainment-has-died">Vince Zampella's recent passing</a> might have caused some chaos and confusion at Battlefield Studios, as he was the man tasked with leading the charge on Battlefield 6's development and the series' future after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">2042</a> nearly killed the franchise.</p>
<p>That's a job well done, I say.</p>

            <p>It looks like those on PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers can expect more blockbuster games to join the service next week.</p>
<p>According to the ever-reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850">Dealabs</a>, the following six games will be added for Extra and Premium subscribers from Tuesday, 20th January:</p>

<li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5/PS4)</li>

<li>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5)</li>

<p>A notable addition here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-january">which is also set to arrive on Xbox Game Pass on 20th January</a>. "Capcom's follow-up to its first-person Resi reinvention is a fantastic horror romp - for its first half, at least." reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Village review</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> is another good'un, in my humble opinion. But, don't just take my word for it. Eurogamer contributor Kaan Serin was also rather taken with it on its release, awarding it four out of five stars. "Violent stakes once again meet zany shenanigans in Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, the series' much-improved second RPG," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Eurogamer's Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth review</a>.</p>
<p>Should this leak prove accurate, the above games will be joining the likes of Need for Speed Unbound, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> and Core Keeper, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-january">which were added for all PS Plus members earlier this month</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> might be the online shooters of the moment, but that doesn't mean other recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> have gone under. In fact, NetEase's take on the property remains a strong alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> which has received tonnes of love since its late 2024 debut. Now, Deadpool is almost here, and his gameplay trailer packs a punch.</p>
<p>The 'Merc with a Mouth' was finally confirmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DY9eYEx6KQ">during last month's Game Awards</a>, after plenty of leaks and datamines. Marvel Rivals has been expanding at a much better pace than the aforementioned Blizzard-developed hero shooter ever did, typically dropping two heroes (or villains) per season into the roster, alongside new maps and modes. Traditionally, each hero has a single strict role (tank, DPS, or healer) as per the subgenre's conventions. However, Deadpool, much like in the comics and movies, writes his own rules… literally. You can check out Deadpool's trailer below.</p>

<p>Video games including Wade Wilson have acknowledged his fourth-wall-breaking abilities through dialogue and maybe a handful of zanier comic book moments. Gameplay-wise, he has always been represented as a goofy mercenary (who won't shut up) with access to lots of blades and guns. I mean, on a basic level, that's who he is. The Marvel Rivals team has taken the character's kit to the next level though.</p><p>My first impression is Wade could be a nightmare to properly balance after he arrives on 16th February. He can effortlessly swap between the Vanguard (tank), Duelist (DPS), and Strategist (healer) roles, and each kit comes with plenty of abilities that dish out incredible amounts of damage and notable buffs for his allies.</p>
<p>When NetEase first teased he'd be a flexible character, I certainly wasn't expecting him to whip out a comic book in the middle of a match and choose who he wants to be <em>inside </em>the game. That's the most Deadpool thing ever though.</p>
<p>Other highlights in the trailer include Deadpool taking selfies, his enemies being beaten up by comic book drawings on their screens, and a stylish MVP screen which also breaks the traditional boundaries of the game. I think it's safe to say this is the best adaptation of the character we've seen in a video game so far, and the fact it's all part of a fast-paced online shooter only makes it even more impressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w">Season 6 of Marvel Rivals</a> (dubbed 'Night at the Museum') also kicks off this Friday, 16th January, and on top of Deadpool's arrival, players are hoping for matchmaking improvements and more quality of life fixes and tweaks.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> last year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>

            <p>Somewhere in my head, I was expecting the worst. I've been playing Animal Crossing long enough across its various iterations to remember a time when villagers would wish violent ill on your existence if you displeased them enough, and when abandoning your town for just a few days would cause a weed outbreak serious enough to make a gardener sob. So part of me was anticipating chaos and disaster - rampant foliage, rioting villagers, blazing buildings, a wild-eyed Isabelle perched on a pile of furry corpses - when I logged back into New Horizons for the first time in four years this week. And as I fired up my old save and prepared to return to Honaloha, I was braced.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it was a bit of an anticlimax to log in and discover that - beyond a couple of bugs in my basement, a blinking mailbox, and a slightly unruly haircut - there were barely any signs four years had passed at all. Rather, I returned to a Honaloha almost exactly as I left it, eerily suspended in the reverie of an approaching Christmas - all twinkling trees and jaunty wreaths - circa 2021. At least Avery and Zucker were happy to see me.</p>

<figcaption>Here's what's coming in this week's 3.0 update.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nODHyw3lgs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Why am I back? That'll be in anticipation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update">Animal Crossing: New Horizons' imminent 3.0 update</a>, which includes a substantial fist of free new features - most notably a new hotel to manage - alongside a bunch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> enhancements and additions Nintendo is charging a fiver for. Plus, it's winter, the gaming calendar is quiet (albeit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-93-most-exciting-games-of-2026">not for long</a>), and the prospect of popping back to check in on my little, long-abandoned island - buoyed on by a mix of curiosity and faint nostalgia - was a surprisingly appealing one.</p>

<p>Famously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' arrival in 2020 coincided, fatefully, with the global coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lengthy lockdowns. For many, its cosy corner of virtual freedom - of serene beaches and peaceful meadows, of outdoor frolics and bustling community - served as an unexpected lifeline in those troubling times. A comforting escape, a place to congregate with friends; and I'm sure there'll be some people facing more complicated recollections should 3.0 be enough to tempt them back in.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For me, New Horizons doesn't have quite the same associations, so my return this week (the first since the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-happy-home-paradise-holiday-access-interiors-exteriors-remodel-move-new-horizons-8007">Happy Home Paradise expansion</a> briefly brought me back at the tail-end of 2021) has felt much less complicated, more like a visit to an old home after a long time away. And looking at everything now with fresh eyes, the once-familiar turned unfamiliar again, it's clear there's work to be done! I'm already annoyed by the needlessly convoluted footpaths I previously laid, and goodness knows what I was thinking with some of my decor choices. I've got stacks of abandoned furniture littering the ground, and worse, the repressed memories of Chops have all come flooding back - yes, the annoyingly little shit can still bloody do one.</p><p>I've barely been back in Honaloha for an hour and already I've got a lengthy to-do list forming in my brain. That flower bed by the lamppost needs to go, for starters, and that pretty Japanese arch, I now realise, does NOT mix well with my weird stonehenge. On the other side of the island, there's a picnic table blocking my Grecian plaza, and there's a bush I'm convinced would look better shifted over a square. And <em>of course</em> I'm still plotting Chops' downfall. What I'm saying is there's a lot to get sorted to make things tolerable for any kind of meaningful 3.0 return, and unexpectedly, it already feels like I'm on the cusp of getting sucked back in.</p>

</figure>
<p>Whether 3.0 <em>will</em> result in an extended return to Honaloha though, I'm not yet sure. New Horizons, with its glacial dripfeed of fundamental features, always felt a little too insubstantial to properly hook me (and I never quite got over its comparative lack of personality, with the villager sass of old smoothed over lest it offend), making for a fairly dull series return - and I doubt I would have stuck around for so long if it wasn't for the whole lockdown zeitgeist thing. So as intrigued as I am about hotel management, and as giddy as I am about getting more room to store the junk I left on the floor, I'm skeptical my interest will last long enough for those Christmas decorations to come out again. That, I suppose, might change if Nintendo has grander plans for New Horizons beyond 3.0, but right now, whatever the future holds, it's surprisingly nice to be back among old haunts and old friends. Stupid moustachioed pig aside.

            <p>Hazelight's outspoken studio founder Josef Fares believes EA has been painted to be the villain much more than other companies, stating: "There's not a publisher in the world that hasn't fucked up now and then."</p>
<p>Fares through his studio Hazelight has partnered with EA for all three of its games: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-way-out">A Way Out</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. Now, the director has said if Hazelight didn't have a good relationship with EA, then it quite simply would not work with the publisher any more.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of great people at EA," Fares said in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would">The Game Business</a>. "They know how we work. They respect it and they leave us be." He added he feels "EA is getting more shit than they deserve", remarking that "everybody's done something that's not good", namechecking Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony.</p>
<p>"But for some reason, EA has become this bad guy," the Hazelight head continued. "For us, it's a super good collaboration. I'm very open about [it]. If it was bad, I would've said that in this interview as well. But we have a great relationship."</p><p>Fares again reiterated this is not to say EA hasn't made its own share of mistakes, just like the rest of us. "All the people I am surrounded with at EA are gamers," Fares said. "They love games. It's not like I'm sitting with corporate people with suits. It's not like that."</p>
<p>Closing this train of thought, Fares stated in no uncertain terms: "And people should not worry, because Hazelight will do always what it wants."</p>
<p>But, why is it EA appears to be being 'villainised' at the moment? Well, at the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA shareholders approved</a> the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law"> proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms. Should the acquisition go through, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>This has left a bad taste in the mouth of many due to the country's notoriously poor human rights record, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators">resulted in public outcry and petitions from video game unions</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">human rights groups</a>. Over the weekend, EA said to its community that "the values of The Sims are unchanged", after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-creators-quit-ea-partnerships-amid-buyout-concerns">multiple high profile The Sims content creators "removed themselves" from the company's Creator Network</a>.</p>
<figure>

<p>As for Hazelight, its most recent release Split Fiction was met with wide praise on its debut last year. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">reads our five star review</a>.</p><p>In the first 48 hours of release, Split Fiction sold an impressive 1m units. By the end of its first week, the studio announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction had sold another 1m units</a>. Not simply content with these figures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">the game subsequently broke three world records</a>, becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Split Fiction film adaptation starring Sydney Sweeney was also announced to be in the works last year</a>, with Jon M Chu of Wicked fame set to direct.</p>

            <p>Styx: Blades of Greed is probably one of my most anticipated games this year, so I am pleased to let you know that there is now a demo available to try out.</p>
<p>This demo will give you the chance to play the first hour of Styx: Blades of Greed, which (I am 99 percent sure) will plop you down at The Wall. This is one of the areas I got to explore during a preview session with developer Cyanide last year.</p>

<p>While this Styx: Blades of Greed demo is only available to try out on Steam, the game itself will be launching across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, as well as PC via Steam and Epic Games Store. As for when, that would be 19th February, so in a little over a month's time.</p>
<p>Cyanide has said that demo save data will be transferable to the full version on Blades of Greed's release. If this all sounds good to you, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">check out the demo via Steam</a> now. </p>
<p>As well as this nugget of demo news, the studio has also released a new trailer for Styx: Blades of Greed, which hands narrative duties over to Styx himself. Here, the caustic goblin explains his love of Quartz (a powerful and precious substance), as well as showing off some of his new gear such as the glider.</p>
<p>You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Blades of Greed all kicks off after the events of Styx: Shards of Darkness, though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release.</p>
<p>Like I said already, I got to go hands-on with Styx: Blades of Greed last year, and while I wasn't very good at it (in fact, I was terrible), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-managed-to-impress-with-its-stealth-gameplay-despite-my-attempts-to-do-the-opposite">I had an absolute blast playing as the titular goblin and causing all sorts of chaos</a> for those that got in my way.</p>

            <p>Would you believe me if I told you Code Vein 2 is one of the most enjoyable Souls-like games I've played in years? That it not only improves upon systems and quirks present in the original game, but also offers something truly fresh in a genre packed with fierce competition? It's all true! After playing Bandai Namco's upcoming sequel for a few hours I can confidently say it's a bloody good time, and with enough depth that even the most hardened action game fans can sink their teeth into.</p>

<p>Code Vein 2, like its predecessor, throws you as the player into an gothic horror setting filled with gorgeous anime flair. This time around, you find yourself on the precipice of disaster, having to dive back through time to track down a variety of heroes tragically destined to play a part in a great catastrophe. As such it's your job to learn more about these figures, battling through hordes of horrific goons and daunting bosses as you go.</p>
<p>Like the original game, Code Vein 2 is a visual delight. A trip through a human settlement, underground urban sprawl, and the guts of buried machinery showed off the anime stylings, the world design flicking from dark and sketchy to wickedly vivid. When it comes to combat, ribbons of gold jettison off your powerful Jail attacks and combos erupt in brain-buzzing VFX. It's hard to take your eyes off Code Vein 2 when combat starts.</p>

<p>The character creator too is a fantastic first impression, offering much more than many of Code Vein 2's peers have managed. I was surprised by the sheer amount of alterations I could make to my character, the minute differences in colour and shape I could make to the smallest of features. For those unswayed by the joys of an hour-long design process, a rich spread of appealing defaults are of course provided. Regardless of what group of Code Vein 2 players you're in, from minute one to minute 500, it's a gorgeous treat.</p><p>But what about the action itself? Well, there is more to Code Vein 2 than extravagant presentation. Code Vein 2 is one of those special action games that allow you to revel in the cathartic feel of a solid blow. Each strike from a heavy weapon is a cocktail of visual / audio kickback that goes straight to your brain's pleasure boxes. The rapid combos of more dexterous arms trades one larger blow for a cavalcade of smaller ones, their sum the measure of bulkier counterparts.</p>
<p>Ranged weapons, too, manage to retain this gushing game feel. The result: every fight in Code Vein 2 feels exciting. During my stint with it I landed on the hammer weapon type, charging up massive attacks and letting them loose on foes. Sometimes this resulted in a quick death on their part, other times it left them stunned and open to a cinematic finisher. Great stuff, and the most apparent improvement on the original Code Vein which feels a tad sluggish in comparison.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>It's got crazy depth too, an all-around step-forward from its predecessor. At its heart you've got the same core, a typical Souls-like combat system with stamina and various stats that boost different weapon types. If you've played one, you've played them all. Though thanks to the aforementioned excellence at the Code Vein 2's roots even this base combat system is engaging.</p><p>However, it's the sheer amount of customisation available that makes Code Vein 2 stand apart from its peers. Ichor returns, a resource that allows you to activate special attacks (called formae), and I was presented with a vast list of these to play around with and swap out at my leisure. Your Jail attacks can be changed, as can your weapons. The way your character plays is determined by what's called a Blood Code, which act as general archetypes with their own quirks far more interesting than a boring: "strength +5" modifier.</p>
<p>One Blood Code I was allowed to mess around with in the preview was tied to the companion Josée Anjou. Usually, the only way to gain Ichor is through Jail attacks. The result is a combat loop in which you attack an enemy enough to pull off a Jail attack, gain a bunch of Ichor for special moves, then use them to further damage enemies, resulting in more opportunities to suck them dry. Nice, simple, and a solid foundation.</p>
<p>But with Josée's Blood Code, each regular attack provides some Ichor in return, allowing you to gain access to game-changing special attacks without having to rely on Jail attacks. The downside? Gaining beyond the maximum amount of Ichor damages you. This example totally turns Code Vein 2 on its head, and this is a game one assumes has dozens more like it. An inventive way to not only pay homage to different play styles someone may have, but a nice way to keep Code Vein 2 fresh.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>As for what hints of the story we were given during the preview, it certainly has a lot of potential! Hopping back and forth through time, getting to bond with a collective of diverse characters and then leaping forward to clash against their more monstrous forms. It allows those willing to invest themselves into the narrative to connect with a series of individual tragedies, though how well that manages to win-over people will obviously depend on how interesting these heroes of the past are.</p><p>Josée, to her credit, was rowdy and fiery but given time to open up in a more emotionally stimulating fashion, though the speed in which you learn about her familial nightmare was rather fast-paced. If the expectation is that, between continuous melee bouts with a horrific carnival of malformed dudes, I should be interested in the why of this bloody rampage. I do hope Josée is the bar and not an exception, though. Lou, your sidekick of sorts that enables your time-travelling adventure, is someone I saw precious little of during the preview.  Given that your personal relationship with them appears to be a cornerstone of the overarching tale of Code Vein 2, I'm left eager to see if their portrayal impresses in the full release.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>If there is one compliment I can give Code Vein 2 that may perk up the ears of Souls-like fans out there, it's this. Code Vein 2, unlike many of its contemporaries, appears to be going in its own original direction away from the font of inspiration the whole subgenre drinks from. It's doubling down on its strengths, on what won over a dedicated fan following when Code Vein released back in 2019. It is quite evidently climbing out of the Souls-like soup and setting itself apart with ample refinement and rich new ideas.</p>
<p>For those perhaps unfamiliar with the wider Souls-like space, allow me to present a more base descriptor. You can make a handsome guy with an eye-patch and beret in an exhaustive character creator, slap a gun in his hands, and set him loose in a world that's distinct from its peers. For that alone, Code Vein 2 should be worth at least a cursory glance from anyone even vaguely interested in action games.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> didn't cause a commotion when it launched last year, but it quietly became a compelling alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>'s offerings, which many felt were on the simpler (albeit extremely polished) side. Now, a little over a month since the native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version arrived digitally, we've got confirmation the physical release is coming in March.</p>
<p>Sega dropped the long-awaited news on 13th January, confirming the date you need to mark on the calendar is 26th March. The suggested retail price is $69.99 / £64.99, same as the digital version of CrossWorlds. Perhaps more convincing is the fact the complete base game will be on a regular cartridge versus a game-key card. Mind you, patches and content updates still need to be downloaded, but we know many of you will celebrate.</p>
<p>Though some developers have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">gone on to explain</a> game-key cards enable them to do true physical releases (better than codes in boxes for sure) while avoiding the "data streaming" limitations of the Switch carts, which are slower than Switch 2's internal SSD and microSD cards, there's been a vocal crusade against third-party releases that aren't 100 percent physical.</p>
<p>This has reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-dev-says-nintendo-has-cheaper-cartridges-coming-as-alternative-to-game-key-cards-then-backtracks-but-either-way-its-title-will-now-be-a-proper-physical-release">pushed Nintendo to look into alternatives</a>, but for now, you can lend and sell game-key cards without issue, as they're rather similar to PlayStation and Xbox discs that only come with part of the games on them. It's more of a distant future-proofing issue.</p><p>In any case, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds' sales should see another boost with this physical release, as many fans of the off-beat racing series were waiting for a Switch 2 release they could add to their physical collection. (It's me, I'm fans.)</p>
<p>Since its September 2025 release, the game has welcomed free crossover characters like Hatsune Miku (really), Joker from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-30th-anniversary-boxing-fitness-more-announcements">Persona</a>, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, and even NiGHTS from the underrated series of the same name. Paid content has included Pac-Man, Minecraft content, and even SpongeBob SquarePants. Up next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-mans-finally-making-a-comeback-but-his-first-big-game-in-years-is-still-a-while-away">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and Avatar (the Nickelodeon one) will be making a splash too.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">BioWare's multiplayer shooter Anthem was terminated this week</a> because EA no longer wanted to maintain servers for people to play the game on, and without them, no one can play the game. But the former executive producer of Anthem has revealed that BioWare had technology working, close to the game's release, that would enable us to host our own servers to play the game on.</p>
<p>Mark Darrah, who left BioWare in December 2020, revealed the information at the end of a three-and-a-half hour video discussing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwrCRdqZb8">"The Truth About What Happened on Anthem"</a>, which he posted on his YouTube channel. "Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months up to launch," he said. "I don't know that they still work but the code is there to be salvaged and recovered."</p>
<p>This in theory presents a possible lifeline and future for Anthem, and local server hosting is a crucial part of Darrah's even bolder plan for what could be done with Anthem now. His idea? To re-release the game as single-player and remove the multiplayer component entirely.</p>
<p>Darrah, an experienced executive producer, outlined a plan for doing this. You'd need a budget of about $10m, he said, and step one would be to bring the game up to date. This wouldn't be hard. Shift it to current-gen consoles and enable the top-end PC game effects, and lock it at 60 frames-per-second. Step two: local servers. Get rid of EA's need to host servers for the game. Step three: "Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling."</p>
<blockquote><em>"Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>Where players used to fill out groups in Anthem, you could instead have AI companions, as in other BioWare games. "And since this is BioWare," Darrah added, "go all the way into making them companions." You could use some existing characters for this and "promote" them, so to speak. "But I think you'll actually find there's a lower-friction route by making three-to-five new characters, with dialogue, with plot arcs, that are brand new to the series - that are people who'd go with you through the existing story of Anthem with their companion content," he said. "Writing those characters: not very difficult. Making those characters move with you: that's where a lot of the work is going to go."</p>
<p>What you'd have if you could do that is a game much more familiar to BioWare fans, Darrah said - people who potentially skipped Anthem because it was too looter-shooter for them. "What you've essentially re-engineered is a BioWare game," he said, "without romances, with a decent BioWare story, with companions, that can be played as a single-player game." You probably couldn't sell it for $70, he realises, but "for a pretty modest amount of work you could effectively create a brand new single-player game from what already exists for this game".</p>
<p>"Is EA going to do this?" he added. "Almost definitely not."</p>
<p>Darrah's full video covers a lot of ground, chronologically running through Anthem's development since conception in late 2011 or early 2012, through to release in 2019. It talks of the game's originating pitch as being a turning point in BioWare's history, and possibly the basis for all future live service problems to come. The video also highlights a project that crucially lacked a single unifying vision and identity - something ultimately born out in the finished game, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli pointed out in our Anthem review</a>.</p>

            <p>Before 2026 heats up, we've got several small and mid-sized game releases coming our way fast, but unexpected arrivals like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> could be making the coming weeks busier than initially anticipated.</p>
<p>Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has just unveiled a new 'combat deep dive' trailer (which you can watch below) and locked a February 18 launch for the game, which is now coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> too. As for the price tag, it's targeting $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99, with a Deluxe Edition adding "five additional missions, two new recruitable heroes, and three new technologies" at $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99.</p>

<p>Trapping the full experience behind the Deluxe Edition aside, this "story-driven survival strategy game" has been looking refreshing ever since it was first announced. Strategy games, narrative journeys, and survival experiences are all common nowadays, but it's stranger to see them all come together while using a famous sci-fi property to boot.</p><p>In many ways, Across the Unknown is taking cues from older Star Trek games that had players taking command of starships and entire crews, and that applies to the combat as seen in this trailer (surprisingly involved if you ask me). That said, the bigger scope and focus on what-if scenarios could set it apart from past strategy games set in the iconic universe.</p>
<p>Moreover, the full gameplay loop appears to be quite varied; players can expect scenes which are all about decision-making as well as exploration, management, research, and combat. For each section, <a href="https://www.gamexcite.de/">Gamexcite</a> has leaned on systems and mechanics which look familiar; hopefully, the final result will please trekkies and the more casual crowd alike.</p>
<p>Though the game seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo Switch 2's handheld mode given its chill and menu-heavy rhythm, don't forget it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S too. In fact, those platforms have received a demo you can check out before purchasing.</p>

            <p>Oh, Funko Pop. What have you done? Well, unless my eyes are deceiving me, I think you may have let slip a yet-to-be-aired and potentially pivotal plot point for the second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers (past and perhaps future) for Fallout season two below.</strong></p>

<p>Images of an <a href="https://x.com/AmusementTimeYT/status/2010966559385329789">all-new</a> <a href="https://x.com/FunkoPOPsNews/status/2010946498477928916">Funko Pop</a> based on Amazon's Fallout series have started making the <a href="https://pops.today/television/1915-caesar">rounds online</a>, and correct me if I am wrong, but they appear to show Macaulay Culkin's character Lacerta Legate as Caesar. That is to say, the head of the Fallout faction known as Caesar's Legion.</p>
<p>Caesar's Legion plays a not insignificant part in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, which large parts of the show's second season is based on.</p>
<p>In the show, we meet Caesar's Legion when naive and trusting vault dweller Lucy gets captured by the faction, and popped up on a crucifix to think about what she has done (which was answer a cry for help, damn this wasteland!). We also discover that the Legion is in the midst of a civil war, following the death of the faction's founder. There are now two members who are vying to be the heir, or the new Caesar.</p><p>However, neither of the two potential faction leaders look anything like the upcoming Caesar Funko Pop, which you can see below. Instead, this model looks a lot more like Culkin's high-ranking Lacerta Legate. So, I am going to hazard a guess that something is going to go down at some point during the series' next four episodes, and Lacerta Legate ends up as the man on top.</p>
<p>To compare to the games, in Fallout: New Vegas, players who follow the Legion questline all the way through the end can either cure Caesar of his illness, or kill him. If he dies, Lucius - the leader of the Praetorian Guard - takes over, at least until the finale.</p>
<p>So, do you hope Lacerta Legate becomes the leader of Caesar's Legion in the Fallout show?</p>

            <p>It's gone. In case you didn't know, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fond-anthem-farewells-begin-as-biowares-destiny-like-game-reaches-last-day-of-operation">servers for BioWare's multiplayer game Anthem have been switched off</a>, rendering this online game no longer playable. For all intents and purposes, Anthem no longer exists.</p>
<p>Rewind a week and I found myself in a second-hand trade-in shop eager to buy Anthem to experience its final moments myself. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">Anthem had been earmarked for closure for months</a>, since the summer of last year, when 12th January, 2026 felt like a long time away. But in that shop, the day was nearly upon us. I wanted a physical copy because it was the only way someone who didn't own Anthem could play, since downloads of the game had stopped being sold, and an EA Play subscription no longer granted access to it.</p>
<p>Anthem for £2 - a pittance. Price is a kind of brutal shorthand language in shops like this, used to represent whether games are wanted or not, and Anthem, clearly, was not. In a few days' time, though, it would be worth less, literally worthless, a game you could own but not play. But I wanted it, though I made the mistake of buying for Xbox One and forgetting my Xbox Series S didn't have a disc drive. I had to order another copy online, a brand new PlayStation copy, to rectify my mistake. And it's a bizarre feeling excitedly opening a shrink-wrapped game knowing it only has days of life left.</p>



<p>It's a jarring sense of disbelief that I felt everywhere in Anthem when I played it. Whatever you think of BioWare's ill-fated multiplayer experience, it's shot at doing a Destiny, you can't accuse it of being cheap. Boosting through the skies of the moody jungle world of Coda, filled with colossal architectural ruins, which are grasped at and dragged down by viney tendrils of nature, is a spectacle of face-filling pleasure. Diving from the skies down into the water, and then through it, makes it even better. This dramatic and enlarged playground BioWare has built around the game's foundational idea of flying is frequently stunning. There are gigantic pipes to fly through, waterfalls to race by, and brooding skies to soar towards. Everywhere, massiveness abounds.</p><p>It isn't all zoomed-out detail either, because in the other half of the game, the walking around part in Fort Tarsis, your base, the intricacies are all up close. This is 'the BioWare part of the game', which is where the studio tried to deliver the kind of story-rich, character-rich experience it is famed for. Here you find - or found - dialogue options and characters who you could have relationships, of sorts, with. There was elaborate animation and high-quality voice work, and it was gorgeous, a place that married high tech and low tech, a bit like Star Wars in the desert areas - a place of cobbled stone fortresses housing advanced mech-suit garages. See it in the day, see it in the night. It's a place dense with detail and alive with activity. Six years after release, Anthem is impressive to behold.</p>
<p>I saw a brilliant comment on the Anthem subreddit, which is awash with fond farewells at the moment, in which someone described the game as the "greatest What If game" there's ever been, and they're right. To play Anthem is - or was (I can't quite adjust to the past tense yet) - to imagine what could have been done. Whether it was walking around Tarsiss imagining a single-player, storied BioWare experience taking place there, or flying through the jungles and wondering how a single-player game would work there.</p>
<p>Even as a co-operative multiplayer experience like Destiny, Anthem had potential. There was a mismatch between the two halves of the game but the bones of an enjoyable co-operative multiplayer game there. There was fun to be had. It just hadn't come together enough yet. It needed work, like all live service games do - constant work. And there were plans to do this work, to do a 2.0 overhaul, but they were, like so much else about Anthem, abandoned.</p>



<p>The effort that was poured into Anthem was plain to see. Those long years of development and mountain of invested money: you could see it and feel it. It's a realisation that makes it all the harder to accept something like this just being switched off and discarded - wasted, in a sense. Even harder is reconciling that with the people still playing the game, the people who'd, judging by their high character levels and elaborate paint jobs, been the people who propped the game up and populated it - gave it the life it had. All their time and energy soon to be gone, their characters taken away from them. It doesn't seem fair.</p><p>Plenty returned for the end. A mix of morbid curiosity and last goodbyes and unfinished achievement business has brought them back. How many it's hard to tell, because for all Anthem was an online multiplayer game, it didn't have large social spaces to bring them together - the closest was a Launch Bay where 15 people could get together - but I found people to do missions with easily enough. The Launch Bay was also fairly well populated when I visited an instance of it. And it's there I'd see the endlessly changing parade of people peacocking in their hard-earned armour, some waving, others loitering, wanting to share in some way in this moment.</p>
<p>What makes me angry is EA BioWare didn't do more to celebrate them and see them off with a hearty wave and a thank you. The company <em>said </em>thank you when it announced it was closing the Anthem service, but people say a lot of things - it's the actions that count. The actions here were... nothing. The in-game store still insisted on charging for goods until the end; merchants still expected your coin for crafting components; and mechanically the game still dished out meagre experience for you to slowly level up with. Nothing changed; the grind remained intact until the end.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The Anthem shop, active until the end, no change to the prices offered there. I don't think it was possible to buy any of the purple currency any longer, by the way.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Someone looking after the game could have fiddled with the dials, if there was anyone looking after the game. End-times are perfect times for being silly and breaking the rules, for removing restrictions and letting players who supported you be rewarded with consequence-free doses of delirious generosity. Have a party. Let players leave with a smile. Go wild. But no. Abandoned in death as it was in life, Anthem slipped quietly into oblivion.</p><p>On some level, I understand it, because why draw more attention to something you'd rather move on from?  Anthem has been a ghost ship for years now. The 2.0 overhaul was scrapped in early 2021, which means nothing's really been happening in the game for five years now. Another way of looking at this closure could be that it was kept alive longer than it needed to be. But this moment does bring to the surface an increasingly important question which is what should happen to live service games in Anthem's position?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Anyone want a game?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Should we, as players, really expect a game service to run and run and run if no one is playing it? Should there be protections in place that we won't lose access to games we've bought, or characters we've potentially spent hundreds of hours investing in? How should we handle the end of these live service games? Could their care be given over to the community? There are the sorts of questions movements like Stop Killing Games are trying to address, and they're good questions that deserve proper answers. Who knows? Maybe this won't be the end for Anthem after all.</p>
<p>But for now it's an ending. For now, these copies of Anthem I bought to experience it as it blinked out of existence are effectively useless. They are games I can look at on a shelf but not do anything with. I can't resell them, I can't give them away. Their only value is to a collector. And who would collect this? Endings are powerful because they frame what came before, but Anthem frames a story BioWare would probably rather forget. It's a story of a misguided gamble that ruptured the studio in a way it would never recover from. Anthem changed BioWare, and would have done even if the game was very successful. It was a turning point. Perhaps, in BioWare's history, it's one of its most important games, and now it's gone forever. How long, I wonder, until we say the same about the studio.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions' closure last year</a> remains one of the hardest gut punches the Western games industry has seen recently. From iconic shooters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-fear-pc">FEAR</a> to the inventive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">Shadow of Mordor</a> &amp; Shadow of War, the studio always excelled, no matter the genre. Now, unearthed materials allegedly recovered from a discarded HDD used at the studio have revealed work done on a non-Arkham Batman game for Warner Bros.</p>
<p>MrTalida, a renowned "video game enthusiast and archivist," shared their findings <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social">via Bluesky</a> on 13th January. Moreover, an Internet Archive upload was made available for anyone curious about the unmade project. Needless to say, those files should only be accessed at your own risk.</p>
<p>According to the user, the materials go back as far as April 2009 and up to January 2010. It all seemingly belongs to a game that never came close to being anywhere near done. The info and videos mostly deal with isolated gameplay ideas, audio systems, concept art, and development schedules.</p>
<p>There are, however, fragments which present an aesthetic closer (if not the same) to Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. If we also take the time frame into account, we can theorize this could've been a tie-in of sorts, or at least a title which existed outside of the continuity started by Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Arkham Asylum</a> in 2009.</p><p>This isn't the first time we've seen footage of Monolith's cancelled Batman game. In 2024, more substantial clips of an advanced build of the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-game-that-became-shadow-of-mordor-footage-surfaces-online">popped up online</a>. However, this new batch of materials gives us a closer look at the studio's overall plans, as well as the iconic tank-like "tumbler" Batmobile from the Nolan movies.</p>
<p>Eventually, the project was scrapped and gave way to what became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, a refreshing take on the Lord of the Rings IP that borrowed more than a few tricks from Rocksteady's Batman playbook, so in the end, the studio's slightly different approach to the Dark Knight survived… kind of.</p>

            <p>French publisher Ubisoft is promising a nostalgic 2026, with remakes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> nearing completion, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-definitive-edition">the first Division game also getting a re-release</a> of sorts. For many of the developers at key studios, however, the year is off to an awful start.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">Ubisoft's Halifax Studio was promptly shuttered</a> only weeks after unionising. The true motives behind the closure were unclear, but we had reasons to question Ubisoft's short comments on the matter, especially after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">everything going on at Rockstar Games</a>. Some voices online pointed out the developers were maybe seeing a closure coming, and thus prepared to face it with better protections. Today, that theory seems stronger, as Ubisoft continued to take "additional steps" <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-to-offer-voluntary-redundancies-to-massive-entertainment-staff">following the "voluntary career transition program" offered last year</a> to Massive Entertainment staffers.</p>
<p>The new layoffs, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-laying-off-55-roles-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-as-cost-cutting-continues">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, have (at the time of writing) translated into 55 roles being cut across the Massive Entertainment and Stockholm teams. Massive's plans for the immediate future haven't changed; the studio will continue to work on the new content coming to The Division 2 this year, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-ubisoft-dev-says">the seemingly massive threequel</a> (and probably that "definitive edition" of the first game).</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-fire-and-ash-player-boost">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora received a stunning third expansion DLC</a>, probably marking the end of substantial support for that game. Last year also saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-pc-graphics-comparison">Star Wars Outlaws being (excellently) ported to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. With those games "out of the way" now, one can see, without downplaying the horrible human cost, why and how Ubisoft is streamlining operations at Massive as it faces uncertainty in spite of the big reorganisation around its core franchises through a subsidiary <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/es-es/article/7GvucOgSm41HwFaXt2ADX1/ubisoft-launches-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios">announced in October 2025</a>.</p><p>Before the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-announces-restructuring-proposal-for-redlynx-60-jobs-may-be-at-risk">RedLynx also faced aggressive restructuring</a>, so this awful news is just a continuation of a company-wide trend that might continue well into 2026. Outside the aforementioned remakes and re-releases, Ubisoft's next 12 months are looking a bit too quiet, so there could be a lot riding on those blasts from the past.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Lego fully unveiled its official Pokémon sets, which include the rather chonky Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model. This chap was notable not only for its size and price tag (it is retailing for £579.99), but the fact that if you pre-ordered it, you would also get your hands on the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection as a gift with purchase while stocks lasted.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chsnos.bsky.social/post/3mcabspu3rs2s">many soon took to social media</a> to say they would actually quite like to just buy the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection, please and thank you, rather than being made to shell out close to £600 (which is more than a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>) for a set they don't really want, just to get the freebie.</p>

<p>Now, and unsurprisingly, the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection is popping up on resale sites such as eBay. And while Lego itself said the set is worth roughly £25 here in the UK, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=pokemon+lego+kanto&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_sop=16">many of those listings already marked as sold have gone for over £100</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=lego+kanto&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_sop=16">similar story internationally</a> as well.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/page/lego-offers-promotions/latest-terms-and-conditions">Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection's terms and conditions</a>, the gift offer was only valid for the first 8500 pre-orders of the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set here in the UK. In the US, that number was for the first 21,840 pre-orders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while the set itself was available for pre-order yesterday when the collection was first announced, sales pages in the UK and internationally now simply state that the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set is "coming soon", and interested parties are currently no longer able to secure themselves a model ahead of release through Lego.</p><p>It should be noted here, that even though the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection is appearing for sale on the likes of eBay, the sellers will not yet have the set in their hands, as it is not due to be shipped until 27th February.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">Lego x Pokémon partnership was first teased back in March,</a> before getting fully revealed yesterday. As well as the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-unveiled-but-catching-em-all-will-cost-you">this collection also includes a Pikachu and Poké Ball set</a>, and a smaller, cheaper model of Eevee with posable features.</p>
<p>Other Nintendo-themed Lego sets also released so far include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">The Legend of Zelda's Great Deku Tree</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-taps-into-nostalgia-with-1980s-inspired-lego-game-boy-trailer">Lego Game Boy model</a> and the fiery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-big-bowser-lego-set">Lego Bowser</a>, to name a few.</p>

            <p>The new year is upon us! Actually it's been upon us for a couple weeks now, but listen: this is a very long list, so you'll understand if it took us a little while to pull together.</p>
<p>In what is now approaching an honest-to-goodness tradition, below we've put together our list of the many games we're most excited about for the year ahead. This, of course, isn't a comprehensive list of releases by design - for that we've got a dedicated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases">2026 video game release schedule</a>, assembled by our ever-dilligent guides team - but instead our curated selection of games we either expect or hope to be worth a proper look. (And yes, so many games come out each year now that a list of 80+ still counts as curated).</p>
<p>Naturally, we're bound to miss some and be happily surprised by plenty more as the year develops, and so if you've spotted a gem of your own that didn't make the cut, we'd love to hear it as ever. Otherwise, here's to another year of wonderful video games.</p>
<p>We've ordered the below chronologically in terms of release date, with a separate section at the end for the (many) as yet undated games due some time in 2026. Enjoy!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 13th January (Early Access)</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Hytale was first announced way back in 2015 as a hugely ambitious-looking spin-off from Minecraft, made by the co-founders of Hypixel, some of Minecraft's own most dedicated in-game creators. After a decade of development hell with the once-backing of Riot Games, expect a rough-around-the-edges - but very exciting - fresh start. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition</h3>

<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 15th January, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Years after the last major update, our patience has finally been rewarded. Cram up to 12 players into one session, yell out a Villager's name through the Megaphone Tool to locate them and enjoy an increased resolution as well as new mouse controls perfect for Custom Designs, all alongside extra free content - a nice way to kick off 2026! - <em>Marie P</em></p>

<p>Huge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> vibes from this one. A "raid shooter" made lots of former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> people. Colourful, slick, punchy - the action looks great. Is it a kind of MOBA? I'm not sure. Is it a hero shooter? I'm not sure. But I am certain it'll be worth a look. -<em>Bertie</em></p>

<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 29th January</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers of the rather lovely Furi and Haven are behind this one, a mountain climbing simulator-slash-survival game. A pure concept with some unexpected beauty, seemingly quite hardcore challenge, and above all gangly limb physics that look just delightfully awkward. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, watch out. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>After a stint in early access on the PC, Riot Game's fighting game is finally getting properly released. With an innovative 2v2 tag system, expertly constructed online infrastructure and features, and beloved characters brought lovingly from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>… It's one all fighting game fans must play. - <em>Connor M</em></p>
<h3>TR-49</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 21st January</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, iOS</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything Inkle is worth getting excited about, and I'm doubly excited for this World War 2-era codebreaking game because it's unusual and it reminds me a lot of Sam Barlow's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/her-story">Her Story</a>, in how it's an elaborate keyword-searching mystery. That game was great. Will this be?  - <em>Bertie P</em></p>
<h3>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date: 5th February</strong></li>
<li><strong>Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Dragon Quest 7 has always been considered something of a masterpiece by fans of the genre and series, but it is also doubtless a game with a complicated ownership of that title. That which makes it special - a unique episodic structure that sees the narrative play out through a series of enclosed vignettes rather than the usual overarching world-saving - is also something of a weakness. To be blunt, the original game is paced like molasses, and no matter how good it is, there's almost certainly too much of it.</p><p>In stems Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined. The reimagining is largely to the game's structure - where developers have been brave enough to take a scalpel to a classic in order to try to excise some of the bloat and give a classic some brevity instead. It's a delicate operation to perform, but if they succeed this could be something really special. <em>- Alex D</em></p>
<h3>Nioh 3</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>KOEI Tecmo</cite></span></figcaption>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 6th February</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PC</li>
</ul>
<p>I played Nioh 3 towards the end of last year, and I've not really been able to stop thinking about it since. All the hardcore action-RPG bells and whistles of the first two games, compounded by a solid 'open field' design philosophy, a dual set of loadouts (samurai and ninja) and more enemy variety? It's everything a Team Ninja sicko like me could ask for. I just hope you've got the patience to spend as much time menuing as you do in combat. - <em>Dom P</em></p>
<h3>Mewgenics</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Edmund McMillan / Tyler Glaiel</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 10th February</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>The duo of Edmund Mcmillen and Tyler Glaiel are bringing out a freakishly fun turn-based RPG with Mewgenics. Collect, breed, and clash with a host of nasty cats in a game lathered with crude humour that ties a stinky bow around the whole package. A deep delve for true cat lovers - <em>Connor M</em></p>
<h3>Romeo Is A Dead Man</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 11th February</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Grasshopper Manufacture has built a reputation for bold, bright, and bombastic action games and Romeo is a Dead Man looks no different. Gory and narratively ridiculous, Romeo looks to be a must play for those out there looking for something truly fresh in 2026 - <em>Connor M</em></p>
<h3>Mario Tennis Fever</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>

<li><strong>Release date: 12th February</strong></li>
<li><strong>Platforms: Switch 2</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While obviously I would like Camelot to be let out of the Sports mines to make a Golden Sun again, I do admit I always eagerly await their Mario Sports offerings. I felt 2018's Mario Tennis Aces was pretty sound, and it does appear that Fever is simply going to build on that game in smart ways, offering up more characters and options than any Mario Tennis title before. I really hope the Adventure Mode is RPG-like, and channels the all-time-great Mario Tennis Game Boy Color story mode. <em>- Alex D</em></p>
<h3>Reanimal</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Tarsier Studios/THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 13th February</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>Reanimal is being brought to us by the original developers of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2, promising us yet another eerie co-op adventure that follows two siblings as they face real horrors in an attempt to be reunited with their friends.</p><p>Despite the initial dark impressions you'll no doubt get from Reanimal's trailer, Tarsier Studios' prior Little Nightmares games - which look undeniably similar to Reanimal - also possess a lot of charm throughout them, mainly via their characters and their interactions with the beautiful but haunting worlds they find themselves in. This is one world I really can't wait to immerse myself in, especially after the sore disappointment that was Little Nightmares 3 (which I must mention was developed by Supermassive Games, rather than Tarsier Studios). - <em>Kelsey R</em></p>
<h3>Styx: Blades of Greed</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nacon</cite></span></figcaption>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 19th February</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you get when you cross a grumpy git of a goblin with stealthy infiltration? Styx: Blades of Greed, that's what. Blades of Greed is the the next entry in Cyanide Studio's Styx series, and takes place after the events of Shards of Darkness (though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release). I know I won't be any good at this game, I have never been the best at 'subtle', but dammit I am going to give it a bash anyway. It looks like a hoot! - <em>Victoria PK</em></p>
<h3>Tides of Tomorrow</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 24th February</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series S/X</li>
</ul>
<p>A fluorescent post-apocalyptic water world action adventure with a startlingly novel twist: multiplayer ghosts that affect your world. Exactly how they work is unclear, but following other people's progress has the ability to change your game. Looks good, sounds interesting, and has pedigree from the studio that made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/road-96-review-a-dazzling-web-of-encounters">narrative adventure Road 96</a>. - <em>Bertie P</em></p>
<h3>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</h3>

</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 27th February</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at this gloriously intricate city-builder coming out of Early Access this year. It's from Quite OK Games (back yourselves folks!), a new indie studio, and published by Future Friends, who we reckon have more than Quite OK Taste (they also handled Exo One, Europa, Clover Pit and Summerhouse). Looks smack bang in the taxing-yet-relaxing sweet spot of management sims. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Resident Evil 9 Requiem</h3>

<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Having bounced off Village having got just a couple of hours in around launch, I went back to it early last year and had a brilliant time. I also really enjoyed the Resident Evil 4 remake, even if it couldn't possibly have the same impact the original did way back in 2005. Add in the brilliant Resident Evil 7, the wonderful Resident Evil 2 and the perfectly decent Resident Evil 3 remakes, and Resi fans have been eating well for a long time. Leon being in Requiem has raised my anticipation level quite dramatically, and I can't wait to go back to Raccoon City. - <em>Tom O</em></p>
<h3>The Legend of Khiimori</h3>

<li><strong>Platforms:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The rule goes that every year must now have a semi-viral Horse Game. Last year we even got two - what a treat! - and this year we're declaring it to be The Legend of Khiimori, a game where you play as a 13th century Mongolian courier. Its mix of horse-management depth and the subtle beauty of a real place and moment in history looks to be a winner. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Pokémon Pokopia</h3>

<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 5th March</li>
<li><strong>Platform:</strong> Switch 2</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens when you bake Animal Crossing and Pokémon together? Well you get Pokémon Pokopia of course, with a side helping of 'that Ditto child certainly looks creepy'. We haven't had a properly strange Pokémon spin-off title in a while, but thankfully Pokopia looks like it will be filling that void just in time for Pokémon's 30th anniversary. - <em>Lottie L</em></p>
<h3>Fatal Frame 2 Remake</h3>

</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 12th March 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Survival horror series Fatal Frame (AKA Project Zero in Europe) has had a bit of a resurgence in recent years, thanks to remasters of 2008’s Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and 2014’s Maiden of Black Water. And while they’re entertaining enough entries, neither comes close to matching the impressive chills of 2003’s acclaimed Fatal Frame 2: The Crimson Butterfly. Tracking two twins as they become lost in an abandoned village where vengeful spirits roam, it's a phenomenal slice of survival horror, and a whole new generation of fans will finally get a chance to experience its masterful camera-snapping frights, courtesy of a full-scale remake arriving in March. The original’s an absolute classic, so here’s hoping the remake can do it justice - and perhaps even usher in a proper series revival - <em>Matt </em></p>
<h3>Monster Hunter Stories 3</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 13th March 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not the biggest fan of the Monster Hunter Stories series in general, however everything I've seen from the third entry in Capcom's spin-off RPG so far fills me with optimism. It looks a little more series, a sidestep away from some of the daft churn that defined the previous titles. It also introduces some darker themes, bigger monsters, and (it seems) more interesting mechanics than some of the arbitrary battle ideas that beefed out the previous two games. Capcom is on a roll at the moment, and I trust it with this. - <em>Dom P</em></p>
<h3>Coffee Talk: Tokyo</h3>

<li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>Coffee Talk Tokyo is the third installment in the visual novel series where you brew drinks while helping supernatural beings solve their problems. As the title reveals, this game has switched the previous Seattle setting for Tokyo - a change that will bring a host of characters inspired by Japanese folklore and mythology, such as kitsune and kappa, to your little coffee shop. - <em>Lottie L</em></p>
<h3>Replaced</h3>

<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 12th March</li>
<li><strong>Platforms: </strong>PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>After a number of delays, 2.5D retro-futuristic sci-fi platformer Replaced is now only a couple of months away from release, and oooh I am excited. Set in an alternative version of the 1980s, Replaced has all the trappings you would expect from the cyberpunk genre. A dystopian neon-lit setting? Check. A corrupt corporation? Check? Flying cars? You betcha! Developer Sad Cat has promised a blend of "cinematic exploration with fluid, free-flow action" on the game's release, which all sounds delicious. This is definitely one to keep an eye out for. - <em>Victoria PK</em></p>
<h3>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</h3>
<figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 12th March, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be John Carpenter's Toxic Commando, but it can also be yours in March if you like the sound of a bloodsoaked mis-mash of Left 4 Dead style zombie horde action and Spintire's mud-mushing driving mechanics. Toxic Commando is an unashamed, turn your brain off co-op shooter where up to four players enter small, swampy, sandbox maps to shoot, drive and explode hundreds of onscreen mutants into glorious fountains of body bits. The story may be comic book nonsense but the gameplay is solid, thrilling and it will absolutely cause loads of arguments between you and your friends as they drive off into the distance while you're left alone and surrounded by a mosh-pit's worth of sludge infected shamblers. - <em>Ian H</em></p>
<h3>Solasta 2</h3>
<figure>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 12th March (early access)</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>All the Solasta 2 comparisons are to Baldur's Gate 3, and it doesn't take long to see why. It's a faithful fantasy Dungeons &amp; Dragons game presented from an isometric kind of view. But this is not a copycat. Solasta 1 was well regarded in 2021, so there's a very solid foundation, and Solasta 2 ups the ambition with a new engine and a voice cast including Ben Starr, and Devora Wilde and Amelia Tyler from Baldur's Gate 3. It's also one of the first D&amp;D games to use the recently revised ruleset. This is an early access release so it's only a beginning, but this is one to watch. <em>- Bertie P</em></p>
<h3>Crimson Desert</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 19th March</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading the name might still make me think of red velvet cake before a video game (maybe a black forest gateaux?), but Crimson Desert looks set to make a big old splash when it finally lands next year. It's an open-world fantasy-medieval RPG with a dashing-if-generic protagonist called Kliff, and it has capital-G Graphics in abundance. It's bound to do well, and we're very keen to find out what new twists, if any, Black Desert Online developer Pearl Abyss might bring with it. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Fumi Games</cite></span></figcaption>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 19th March</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>A Geoff Keighley showcase favourite, Mouse: PI's distinctive definitely-not-Mickey classic cartoon style - mixed in with actual 3D spaces - is an immediate eye-catcher. It's also, despite the name, a first-person shooter rather than a detective point-and-click, I <em>really hope </em>I'm not the only one to have first assumed it to be. In motion it's strangely unncanny. Hopefully it turns out this mouse is the cat's meow, see! - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Screamer</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Milestone S.R.L.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 26th March</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>Look, I am not overly sold on this being great, but it's a new arcade racer from a series I loved way back when 3D graphics were taking off. The original is a proper PC classic that only real ones remember. New Screamer, with anime-stylings and a story centred on a big racing tournament, isn't really old Screamer in anything but name, but it does have a control/power-up system that might give it an edge. It's broadly similar to how the underappreciated Inertia Drift placed drift on the right stick, but also includes mechanics tied to gear changes, boosts, shields, and powerful attack barges. OK, this sounds great - I'm more in than I thought! - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<li><strong>Platforms: </strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox ROG Ally X, Xbox ROG Ally and Nintendo Switch 2</li>
</ul>
<p>007 First Light, coming from Hitman developer IO Interactive, is an origin story for James Bond, popping us into the shoes of an inexperienced and somewhat reckless MI6 agent. As you would expect from IO, the game promises some spectacularly opulent settings, along with gun fights, car chases, and - of course - gadgets. Soon, it'll be time to dust off your DJ, ready your Aston, and head to the nearest casino for a shaken martini (or two). <em>- Victoria PK</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> March</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, hear me out. Yes, the development of this game has been cursed. Yes, Bungie is a shadow of its former self. But with all the attention Arc Raiders has garnered since its barn-storming release last year, it looks like the extraction shooter genre has finally barged its way into the mainstream, and people may actually be willing to give this one a chance. Bungie has been, traditionally, best-in-class when it comes to gunplay and production value, so maybe - just maybe - Marathon can shake off its horrid pre-launch legacy and really make a splash in 2026. - <em>Dom P</em></p>

<li><strong>Release date:</strong> An as yet unspecified Thursday in March (Early Access)</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>The roguelike deck-building card game that birthed a genre. Slay the Spire 2 isn't going to reinvent the wheel but present a very similar experience with more variation. Presentationally, it's also been spruced up a bit, and there are major new features such as alternate acts to mix-up runs. Details are thin but the expectation is huge. - <em>Bertie P</em></p>

<p>You've heard of extraction shooters (hopefully), but how about extraction RPGs? The latest to come for the sort-of-new trend is Mistfall Hunter, a PvPvE dark fantasy job where you do action RPG things against other people and some gnarly eldritch monsters. There's potential - can it come together? - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Lana and Mui are returning later this year, in Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf, where players will once again be plopped into the series' picturesque 2D world. On its release, developer Wishfully promises another profound sci-fi story, but this time with more challenging puzzles to solve along with a deeper narrative to unravel. Planet of Lana 2 will also feature refined stealth mechanics, new underwater sections, and fresh abilities for Lana's sidekick Mui. Planet of Lana 2 essentially hopes to take everything that was praised on the original's release, and make it even better. <em>- Victoria PK</em></p>

<p>Strong Plague Tale and Kingdom Come overtones here. A historical action adventure based in Italy that follows a wandering knight who's on a quest to save someone who means a great deal to her.

<p>The original Tomodachi Life is a Nintendo 3DS game that has you managing your own island of Miis, and despite its simple nature, it possessed many hilarious and outright bizarre interactions which made it as beloved as it was, and still is. I was one of many who always hoped for a sequel or remaster of this game but after years of waiting, frankly never thought it would happen, yet here we are!</p><p>Once again, it looks like Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream will follow the same suit as its predecessor: you get to play God with an island of Miis, and will help shape their lives, looks, and relationships however you see fit. Even if Living the Dream brings nothing particularly new to the table, I am excited to ride the nostalgia train more than anything here (and play it on Switch 2 rather than my 3DS no less), but I do also hope same-sex relationships will finally be present in-game. - <em>Kelsey R</em></p>

<p>If it feels like you've played Tankrat before, it's probably because you have! Tankrat is a revamped and evolved version of Tankhead, an Epic exclusive game which launched at the end of 2024. Tankrat features epic tank on tank action across a variety of post-apocalyptic maps and it has a rather unique twist to accompany its mecha-Ghibli visuals - any tank you destroy can be salvaged for parts which can then be placed directly onto your own tank! As a lover of action shooters and roguelites, I thought Tankhead was excellent so I'm excited to see how Tankrat has evolved the game's already unique formula - <em>Ian H </em></p>

This is a publisher that has a pretty fabulously high batting average for when it steps outside of its franchise IP comfort zone to make something new. We got Dead Rising and Dragon's Dogma out of this sort of experimentation. Even when such games haven't been commercial hits, they're almost always interesting - like 2024's Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. I will always sit up and listen when Capcom says they have something new and unconventional that isn't another run-out of an established property.</p><p>Pragmata has Capcom at its experimental best written all over it, as far as I'm concerned - esoteric, strange, unique… a bit weird, probably rather wonderful. I've loved every hands-on opportunity I've had, and I can't wait to experience the final thing. <em>- Alex D</em></p>

<h3>Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred expansion</h3>

<p>For a game that you can play happily for hundreds of hours, with regular season updates, dozens of end-game modes and an almost overwhelming amount of #content, Diablo 4 still feels unfinished. Lord of Hatred promises a new campaign and classes, but the most exciting prospect is a fitting conclusion to a storyline that always seemed to stop just when it started to get interesting. - <em>Will J</em></p>

<p>One of my favourite games of the PS5 era, Returnal, finally gets a sequel this year. Except it's not actually a sequel but it might as well be a sequel because it's basically a sequel even though it's allegedly a new IP. That's right, Housemarque's third-person, bullet hell roguelike game Saros with its mysterious sci-fi horror narrative, moody visuals and epic audio design might sound identical to 2021's Returnal but in terms of storyline and characters, it's completely different. With Rahul Kohli in the leading role, Saros combines star power with Housemarque's signature rock-solid arcade action and I cannot wait to explore its worlds and uncover whatever mysteries lie within - whilst also doing a bunch of swears because it's really fricking hard, probably. - <em>Ian H</em></p>

<p>It's hard to think of a more fitting setting for a 'cosy' management game than a small town Japanese convenience store, or konbini. With key art referencing that one (in)famous Lawson that had to put up a screen to stop the flood of tourists looking to photograph it in front of Mt. Fuji, it's pretty clear what developer Nagai Industries is shooting for here. And fair enough, it looks like a gloriously tranquil game - one described, enticingly, as being about "the quiet beauty of everyday life". - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Half Sword is one of those games that seems to have been flittering about the social media algorithms for years, but never actually released. But anyway, if you've ever spotted two semi-naked medieval mannequins battering the absolute snot out of each other in a square pen, then you've seen Half Sword, a physics-based dueller that seems to be trying to solve the riddle of what happens when you cross Bennet Foddy with a slightly worrying amount of gore. But which could, Chivalry-style, turn out to be an absolute riot when played in teams. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>With The Sims 5 still seemingly forever away, enter a new wave of avatar-management life sim games, of which Paralives might be one of the most exciting. A perfectly pitched art style - sort of eerily realistic but also pastel-hued and cutesy too - an appropriately thorough character-creator and an intriguing Patreon-funded development model, before it even reaches Early Access this year, all add to the interest. And there's never been a better time for EA to have some proper competition. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>I'm a sucker for the Supermassive formula, the choose your own horror story which works surprisingly well as a social experience when played with other people in the room. Directive 8020 is a big step for the series. It's an upgrade visually, a move to more standalone settings for the games, and mechanically it's got a new 'turning point' system whereby you can go back and change pivotal decisions you made. There've been a few wobbles, Directive 8020 suffering a big delay last year, but here's hoping it's stabilised in the months since. - <em>Bertie P</em></p>

<p>Good vibes: the video game this one. Fancy going camper vanning in a sunny open world with a very friendly looking collie and a seemingly magically expansive amount of storage? Me too!

<p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder is probably my favourite 2D Mario game. No, it's not just recency bias - there's something about this wonderful little game (no pun intended) that just plastered a smile on my face from beginning to end. It's so playful. It's so musical. It's so knowing. Getting the chance to play it again, on better hardware, makes me more excited than most of the games on this list, to be honest. Even the obnoxious flowers yelling at me as I trample over them can't dull the shine of this beautiful little platformer. <em>- Dom P</em></p>

<p>If you like to look at incomprehensibly fast and complex action choreography and yell PHWOARRR, this is the game for you. I've played a bit of it, back at a Summer Game Fest of yore, and that combat is deeply impressive in person too. The boss fights are where it shines - if it can lace those together with equal intricacy, this'll be a winner. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Well then. GTA 6 is coming this year, and you can absolutely not count on that because who knows at this point whether Rockstar's latest release date (at the time of writing) will stick. Alleged union-busting has cast a shadow on the usual megahype-cycle, just as serious issues with crunch did back with Red Dead Redemption 2, but this game will be bigger than big, whenever it arrives, and we expect it to be spectacular. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>FromSoftware is, of course, having a bit of a multiplayer moment, and following last year's successful Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign, the studio is readying to release its intriguing The Duskbloods as a Switch 2 exclusive in 2026. Officially a "PvPvE title with online multiplayer", it sees up to eight players - cast as vampire-like Bloodsworn - battling each other and powerful enemies in a bid to claim the mysterious First Blood. It's a battle that unfolds across space and time, giving From license to mash together a chaotic assortment of styles creating a vibe that feels something like Bloodborne meets Sekiro meets Dark Souls, with dinosaurs and jetpacks thrown in. There's still plenty we don't know about The Duskbloods, but excitement is unquestionably (and understandably) high for this one - <em>Matt W</em></p>

<p>The Ghostrunner devs know how to make a game that feels good in the hands, all momentum and spectacle. Pushing you into a doomed European wasteland armed with a sabre, a pistol, and a handful of magic (think Dishonored or BioShock), One More Level has absolutely nailed the grimdark vibe I'd expect from Ghostrunner-goes-Napoleonic fantasy. It's hard, it's compelling, and it's janky in a way that's charming and interesting. I can't wait to see what monstrous bosses await in the trenches of a doomed France. - <em>Dom P</em></p>

<p>I was late to the Dave the Diver party, only playing it last year via PlayStaion Plus. But when I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. A sumptuous celebration of food, community, and the importance of balancing ecological responsibility and sustainability with keeping small, indie businesses alive, the game has such a sweet, pure heart. More of that, but set in a jungle and moving from sushi to a grill!? Count me in. A game that appeals to both my inner Bourdain and my inner Indiana Jones, what a treat. - <em>Dom P</em></p>

<p>Look, I really enjoyed Deadpool &amp; Wolverine - so much so that it was one of the most fun films I saw in 2024. Counter point: I don't love Insomniac's Spider-Man games. Counter counter point: I love the studio's Ratchet &amp; Clank games. Which brings us to Marvel's Wolverine, a game I might love or find a little dull.

<p>Control Resonant is the sequel to Remedy's hit 2019 game, Control. This time round you'll be playing as Dylan Faden as he searches for his sister Jesse, the original game's protagonist, after the Federal Bureau of Control fails to prevent a supernatural force from escaping their clutches.

<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the next game from Amy Hennig, a name you may recognise from PlayStation's Uncharted series. In the upcoming superhero romp, players will be able to assume the role of four central characters. Those characters? First, we have a young Steve Rogers, so yes, Captain America himself. Then, we have the World War 2 era's Black Panther, which is to say T'Challa's grandfather Azzuri. Joining these two iconic Marvel heroes are Gabriel Jones - a US soldier and member of the Howling Commandos - and Nanali, a Wakandan spy who is embedded in Occupied Paris.</p><p>We still haven't seen a <em>huge </em>amount from the game, though we have had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-details-and-first-look-at-wakanda-revealed-by-writer-amy-hennig">peek at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's take on Wakanda</a>, as well as a look at its<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game"> use of Epic's MetaHuman Creator</a>, which gives each character remarkable detail.

<p>I reckon recent Fire Emblem games have something of an on-off thing, at least for me. Discounting spin-offs and remakes, I reckon 2012's Awakening was a genre-defining masterpiece. Then 2015's Fates was an interesting evolution, but ultimately not really as good. Then 2019's Three Houses was, again, a genre-shaking and franchise-altering classic. But in 2023, Engage just couldn't ignite the same spark. And now, in 2026, we have Fortune's Weave. My hope, my dream, is for a return of that feeling Three Houses and Awakening gave me. If that's there, this could well be a GOTY contender for me. <em>- Alex D</em></p>

<p>Guess who's back, back again. Lara's back, tell your friends! 2026 is the Tomb Raider series' 30th anniversary, and to celebrate we are getting a from the ground up remake of the original 1996 game, known as Legacy of Atlantis. This chap has been developed in Unreal Engine 5, and promises fans old and new a game that will 'honour the spirit' of Lara's debut adventure. While those who have played the original will have a pretty decent idea of what lies ahead, developers Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog have said there will still be plenty of surprises to uncover on Legacy of Atlantis' release later this year. Personally, I absolutely cannot wait for this one! -<em> Victoria PK</em></p>

<p>I will not apologise for being a card-carrying Gears of War fan. I've loved or enjoyed every game in the series, and it's been an absolute age since we got Gears 5 (2019) and Hivebusters (2020). I am ready for a big comeback. A prequel set 14 years before the original game didn't please some, but I'm onboard with the idea of seeing Emergence Day play out alongside Marcus and Dom. It should be part of a big year for Xbox's key franchises, and its success may well determine what the future holds for the series. No pressure, then. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<p>One of the great real-time strategy series is back from the dead. The sadness at it being away from its home with Relic is mitigated somewhat, too, by the fact my first hands-on impressions with it were fantastic. DoW 4 is a booming, immensely satisfying take, at least from the one mission I've played many times over. Suitably dark and suitably camp, if it all comes together in the full game I expect the entirety of my free time to disappear into the Warp. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>A Witcher-like role-playing game made by people who made The Witcher games, including Witcher 3 director Konrad Tomaskiewicz. That heritage is plain to see. But there are differences. You are a part-human, part-vampire hero whose abilities change in the day and night; and there's a brave, open-ended approach to the game that The Witcher 3 didn't have. I get tremendously excited when people get an opportunity to rethink RPGs, and Rebel Wolves is doing this with Blood of Dawnwalker. Will it rival the series it heralds from? We'll see. - <em>Bertie P</em></p>

<p>It's the Untitled Goose Game devs' new thing! That alone should be enough. No? Alright fine: it's a game about some very odd Morph-from-UK-kids-TV-style bird characters who must all work together - in co-op! - to solve environmental and traversal puzzles, using proximity voice chat and scribbling on signs and more. This is one of those that's going to be tough to sell on the page, I'm realising at this very moment, but almost certainly a joy in the hands. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Mina the Hollower is the all-new IP from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games. Popping players into the shoes of Mina herself as she sets out to sort out some troubles on theTenebrous Isle, the game has been stylised as an homage to handheld games of the Game Boy Color era, with pixelated foes, a top-down perspective and (something vital for any Game Boy game) a glorious chiptune soundtrack.

<p>What if Stardew Valley was bleak as all sin? That's more or less it with Neverway, a life sim horror action RPG genre-magpie with very nice pixel art and very horrible sound design, if the trailer's anything to go by.

<p>Super-chewy pixelated tactical roguelike RPG anyone? That's Neath. It's a grid-based affair where positioning in combat - and manipulating enemy positioning in combat - is paramount.

And it's published by Kepler Interactive (Clair Obscur, Pacific Drive, Rematch, Ultros, several others on this list…) which as a publisher-collective has been on an absolute tear. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>While Galactic Racer doesn't seem to be a pod racing game, as per the classic game developed to tie into the racing sequence in Star Wars: Episode One, a new Star Wars racing game of any kind is a very exciting thing (I'd even be mildly interested in a new Super Bombad Racing, but very mildly), and this one could have the juice (Force?). In development at Fuse Games, the studio created by former Criterion leaders, the racing pedigree should hopefully shine through.

<p>It never fails to amaze me how influential Heroes 3 was and still is as a game. Olden Era is a newly made prequel to the turn-based strategy Heroes series, but it's clearly serving game number three.

</ul>
<p>Rumours abound that Starfield is getting a Cyberpunk 2077-style '2.0' update some time this year, and with the PS5 release still to come there's a nicely pre-aligned marketing beat sitting there ready to go if that were to happen. Bethesda is in a very interesting place at the moment, with the Oblivion remaster reigniting The Elder Scrolls excitement and Fallout riding a TV-boosted high. Starfield remains its albatross for now - can the legendary studio make it truly fun? - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Mixtape</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>I've played Mixtape and I will tell you right now, it is <em>funny</em>. Trailers, being trailers, have largely focused on the general overall vibe, but the brilliance in this one is going to be in all the little beats of attention to detail. Like any great coming-of-age story it'll be equal parts raw and awkward, goofy and sincere. It's a whip-smart narrative game. It's nostalgic and autumnal and bittersweet. It's very West Coast. It's from the team behind the cult favourite The Artful Escape. And it is, from what I've played, really very good. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Forza Horizon 6</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X/S (PS5 later)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a funny one for me. I'm a Forza Horizon fan, for sure, but my interest has waned a little as the series has gone on. I also really enjoyed Ubisoft's The Crew Motorfest, which sort of scratched that open-world racer itch, and I am not one of the vocal crowd that was calling for a game set in Japan. But, I think back to the Tokyo tracks in PGR4, the hours I spent time-trialing for medals, and the excitement builds. I do think FH6 will need to shake the formula up a bit rather than just offer what FH5 did in a new location, but if Playground Games can do that we might well get one of the best games of 2026. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>An exceptionally tranquil-looking game about building and hanging out on small rooftops amongst the clouds, High Above looks like a (re)treat. A lovely mix of architectural styles, textures and relentlessly tasteful colour palettes, plus plants and cats, has me absolutely sold. Lovely stuff. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series S/X</li>
</ul>
<p>I've got a soft spot for the Plague Tale series and this is a big departure. The story of Hugo and Amicia, brother and sister, is done. Resonance is the story of Sophia, the person you meet in Plague Tale: Requiem, but told 15 years beforehand. There's an intriguing-sounding dual timeline that flashes back to a Sophia of ancient times, and there's puzzling, buried treasure, curses, and more. I'm fascinated to see what the series feels like away from its original sibling duo. <em>- Bertie P</em></p>
<h3>Subnautica 2</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms: PC, Xbox Series X/S (EA)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Once upon a time, it was easy to get excited at the prospect of more Subnautica - the original underwater survival adventure is a gem; an enormously compelling blend of often terrifying exploration, scavenging and crafting, and propulsive sci-fi storytelling. Developer Unknown Worlds’ standalone expansion, Below Zero, didn’t quite reach the same dizzy heights (depths?) but the studio seemed to know where it had gone wrong when it hinted at a more back-to-basics approach - plus a few cooperative knobs - for Subnautica 2. The problem? The acrimonious legal battle between Unknown Worlds’ ousted leadership (including original Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland) and studio owner Krafton, which has gone some way to tainting enthusiasm for the project <em>- Matt</em></p>
<h3>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this might be the best 'power fantasy' pick of 2026. Miyamoto Musashi is a famed swordsman, and perhaps one of the most influential folk heroes of Japanese history. Capcom knows this, and isn't shy about making you feel that way in this game. With swordplay and motion-capture that felt best-in-class last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-one-of-those-rare-game-previews-that-made-me-think-ok-yeah-im-going-to-platinum-this-one">when I previewed it in the summer</a>, I think more time in the oven can really show off what Capcom can do in the RE Engine when the scope is narrowed down a bit and presented in a super cinematic way. I just hope there's enough to it to keep us all engaged for a full campaign.  - <em>Dom P</em></p>
<h3>Over the Hill</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Funselektor Labs</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the Hill - properly styled "over the hill" but we can't be having that - is the follow up from the equally-lowercased Art of Rally studio Funselektor. A mix of nice driving mechanics and even nicer atmosphere are added to this time by a focus on exploration and survival. If you never quite managed to fill up that "quit your job and drive a Defender across the world" piggy bank, this might at least take the edge off. - <em>- Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Nivalis</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>505 Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>You might remember a game called Cloudpunk from a couple years back, which had you drive (pilot?) a flying taxi around a quite breathtaking cyberpunk city of the future. Nivalis is the name of the city, and a smartly opportunistic follow-up from the developer that instead focuses on the narrative side of getting by, slice-of-life style, in a typically noiry, neon-rich voxel-style world. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Chronicles: Medieval</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Raw Power Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026 (Early Access)</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>A lavish medieval sandbox action-RPG, Chronicles: Medieval is a winner if we're going purely by back-of-box descriptions. Gameplay details are thin, and it's only coming to Early Access this year, but from the lone trailer it's certainly an eye-catcher, with promise of 'visceral large-scale battles' and bowl cuts galore. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Wanderburg</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Randwerk</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Something a bit different, this: castles! On wheels! Why didn't we think of this sooner?! It's from Randwerk, the developer-cooperative being a game called Abriss, which you might've spotted from back in 2023 as the one about big buildings falling over very impressively. (No really - it's great!). In this one a different kind of building looks to get destroyed in a different kind of way, but still. We love a dev with a signature. And in all seriousness, this looks pretty, silly, and kind of smart all in one. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>PlaySide</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-time strategy is a perfect fit for the army-based warmongering and political conquest of A Game of Thrones / A Song of Fire and Ice, and this looks like a glossy and satisfying realisation of this. Will the Winds of Winter, the next book in the series, ever be released? Who knows? But I can play this and pretend to be Tywin Lannister all the same. - <em>Bertie P</em></p>
<h3>At Fate's End</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Thunder Lotus</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>At Fate's End is the next from Thunder Lotus, developer of the excellent Spiritfarer. A lavish cutscene animation style and very snappy-looking combat are the big sellers here, alongside some good old sword-maiden pazzazz, in an action-adventure game which promises a no less "intimate" story than the studio's previous. Looks rad. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Fable</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing there's still a fair bit of uncertainty over Fable's 2026 release date, and to be honest until I see a date appear at the end of a new trailer I'm operating on the assumption this one might get bumped into 2027. I really hope not, though, as I love Fable. Playground Games knows how to make big hits, but this action adventure game will need to capture the magic of the original games and then some in order to make a big impact some 16 years after Lionhead released Fable 3. - <em>Tom O</em></p>
<h3>Earth Must Die</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> Q1 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>After strange dalliances in other realms - namely fast-paced stealth action in The Swindle, arcade football in Behold the Kickmen, and at least half a platform game in Lair of the Clockwork God - developer Size Five Games is properly returning to the point-and-click genre where it made its name in this year’s Earth Must Die. Or is it? This time around, the comedic point-and-clickery is hampered by an alien protagonist - specifically a “fascist dictator bellend” - who refuses to pick anything up. So, much of the time, you’ll be attempting to get things done by coercing other characters into doing your bidding. It sounds fascinating, looks great, and has an impressive Brit cast, including Alex Horne, Tamsin Greig, Matthew Holness, Stevie Martin, Sally Beaumont, and (inevitably) Ben Starr <em>- Matt</em></p>
<h3>Toem 2</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> Q1 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Developer Something We Made’s original Toem was a lovely thing; a charmingly quirky  handdrawn puzzle adventure with a photography twist. So word of a sequel was a very pleasant surprise - and it’ll finally be with us this year. As before, you're touring a whimsical world to snap pictures of strange phenomena, and by making friends and completing quests, you’ll upgrade your camera with tools like scissors for snipping stuff and a hammer for smashing things. On top of that, you’ve got expanded mobility options, a new artstyle that adapts the original’s striking black-and-white looks into more detailed 3D, and more, suggesting fans of the laidback original are in for a good time - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Denshattack!</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>What if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> but runaway trains? It’s easy to imagine that was the pitch for developer Undercoders’ eye-catching debut Denshattack. Its nods to Sega’s Dreamcast classic, from its striking cell-shaded aesthetic to its trick-based grinding action, are undeniable - even if it <em>does</em> swap inline skating for graffiti-strewn, gravity defying trains. As you rail-ride across a vibrant dystopian Japan, you'll ollie and kickflip to rack up points and win over rivals in a bid to thwart the sinister Miraidō corporation. It looks like an absolute riot, and that’s before we get to mechanical worms, roving castles, and magical mech girls - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Professor Layton and the World of Steam</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch 2, Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh how I’ve missed you Professor! It’s frankly been far too long an absence for developer Level-5’s esteemed puzzle solver and his sidekick Luke, but finally - well over a decade after the series’ prequel trilogy wrapped up with Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy - Hershel Layton and his magnificent hat are back. Sure, we’ve had spin-offs and crossovers since then, but this year’s Professor Layton and the World of Steam looks like a proper return to the wonderfully compelling world that started it all. Picking up after 2010’s Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, Luke and the Professor this time face a new mystery - and a whole bunch of new puzzles - in the American town of Steam Bison. I can’t wait - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Moves of the Diamond Hand</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026 (EA)</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Cosmo D might not be a name on everybody’s radar, but the musician and game designer has been releasing fascinating, richly atmospheric oddities for over a decade now. His most recent effort, 2022’s Betrayal at Club Low, took the exploratory narrative adventuring of his earlier games and infused it with table-top style dice rolling as players, in the role of a pizzaiolo-spy, attempted to infiltrate the titular club. And dice are back in this year’s Moves of the Diamond Hand - a noir RPG set to the backdrop of a “surreal dystopian jazz-drenched city”. Expect a return to the first-person exploration of Cosmo D’s earliest games, alongside deeper dicing, and a richer, grander narrative. All of which sounds fab - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Dosa Divas</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC and unspecified consoles</li>
</ul>
<p>Two years after impressing with its cooking-and-skating mash-up Thirsty Suitors, developer Outerloop Games is back with another high-energy culinary adventure in Dosa Divas. Officially a "spicy RPG", it sees players embarking on a chaotic road trip filled with evil corporate goons and communities in need of help as they attempt to bring down their sister’s fast-food empire. You’ll ride mechs, reconcile relationships, and battle enemies using a timing-based turn-based combat system reminiscent of Paper Mario, but with a flavour-matching twist. Consider me intrigued - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>There are No Ghosts at the Grand</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>Developer Friday Sundae’s There Are No Ghosts at The Grand is one of those games that feels like it’s somehow been designed specifically to cater to my interests. It's part musical, part home renovation sim, and part ghostbusting mystery adventure, that even squeezes in a malevolent talking cat. Amid all this, you’ve unexpectedly inherited a dilapidated hotel in the British seaside town of Kingswood-on-Sea, and have 30 days to do it up. By day, you’ll demolish rooms and redecorate them, or perhaps you’ll explore the town’s cobblestone streets, take a boat out to sea, or a scooter into the countryside in your search to uncover the hotel’s secrets. By night you’ll bust ghosts as something evil draws nearer, and throughout it all you’ll encounter songs, a cast of eccentrics, and a protagonist with motives so secret he’ll even try and hide them from the player. Frankly, it sounds brilliant - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Phasmophobia 1.0</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kinetic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve played Phasmophobia for a grand total of about 20 minutes in my lifetime, ten of which I spent hiding in the van. As much as I love horror, Kinetic Games’ co-operative ghost hunting adventure is just a little bit too intense for me. That said, I might finally be tempted back to brave its much-expanded haunts when it finally leaves early access and gets its eagerly awaited 1.0 launch later this year. Phasmophobia had a busy 2025 update-wise, and it sounds like the road to 1.0 will be all about finessing, with talk of map reworks, character model overhauls, and loads more. So much, in fact, that Kinetic has said 1.0 will almost be like “playing a new game”. Hopefully my nerves will hold up - <em>Matt</em></p>

            <p>No matter how you feel about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders</a>' use of AI for NPC voices, it's hard to deny the game has been a massive success that's "cracked open" the extraction shooter subgenre for casual players and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-games-performed-really-well-on-steam-last-year-shaking-the-dominance-of-the-same-old-live-service-games">even harpooned some older live service whales</a>. Now, it's hit a new milestone which positions it as one of the new online shooters to watch out for.</p>
<p>On 13th January, developer Embark Studios announced <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620?s=20">via its social channels</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has recruited over 12 million players to date. That means over 12m copies of the game sold, as the studio made a "premium entry" bet which has paid off big time. <a href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/arc-raiders-sold-over-12-4-million-units-in-just-ten-weeks/">GamesMarkt</a> shared a more specific number: 12.4m copies sold in just 10 weeks. Moreover, the game reached "960,000 concurrent players on all platforms in January 2026."</p>
<p>For Embark Studios, the most important fact might be that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">player retention has been notable</a>, with the game holding its ground against <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players">Battlefield 6's massive success</a> and capturing much of the attention that normally would've gone towards Call of Duty after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> was a disappointment that many longtime fans feared.</p>
<p>To celebrate, Embark Studios is gifting everyone "who logged in since launch till 23:59 CET, 13th Jan" a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool that will be added to their inventory upon logging into the game. The update is rolling out today.</p>

<p>We could also argue Arc Raiders is partially responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Steam setting a new concurrent users record earlier this month</a> as it's managed to comfortably sit among olden heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-update-wipes-nearly-2-billion-off-skin-market-value-by-making-fancy-knives-and-gloves-easier-to-get">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">DOTA 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>. That's no small feat.</p>
<p>With PlayStation and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Marathon</a> seeking to capture at least part of the same crowd's attention come March, more players being into PvPvE shooters after Arc Raiders could be a surprise blessing for the beleaguered game.</p>
<p>So, what's the next stop for this newborn franchise? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-sure-sounds-keen-to-make-an-arc-raiders-film">A movie, probably</a>.</p>

            <p>The dispute between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> studio Rockstar and over 30 of its former developers rages on, with those affected denied interim pay by a UK tribunal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 12th January, a judge ruled against making Rockstar to pay interim relief to its former developers, which the studio fired in October of last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">in a move called by many "union busting"</a>. Rockstar itself has claimed the affected staff were let go due to gross misconduct, but this didn't appease UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB). Soon after the dismissals, the organisation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a>, noting that all those affected were members of a union.</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-games-and-iwgb-clash-at-preliminary-hearing-for-fired-gta-6-workers">IWGB asked a judge to grant the fired developers interim relief</a>, which  is a method of financial support for people awaiting a full hearing. If the motion had been granted, the fired employees would have returned to Rockstar's payroll. However, it was not, though the union and its members remain undeterred in the fight for justice.</p>

<p>"We are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar's flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful," the IWGB said in a statement shared with Eurogamer.</p><p>It added "the judge stated in her ruling that: 'There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings'". The IWGB additionally said Rockstar had broken multiple procedural guidelines with its firing of the affected employees. This included the lack of disciplinary meetings, employees being unable to appeal "until six weeks later", and zero evidence of an investigation.</p>
<p>"Comments relied on by Rockstar's lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using a private union Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring'," the union said. It added the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">Discord members Rockstar claimed were journalists and competitors were in fact union officials and employees who had recently left the company</a>. The IWGB said those in the server were still bound by the same non-disclosure agreements as then-current employees.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the judge's decision to deny interim relief to the former Rockstar employees, the IWGB said it knew this was going to be a long shot, and had it been secured it would have been "unprecedented" for a group of this number. However, the union said this latest development does not mean that "Rockstar will not be found guilty of unfair dismissal" when the case goes to trial. IWGB president Alex Marshall stated the union is "more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar's calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful", despite the refusal for interim relief.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an anonymous former Rockstar employee said: "This decision to fail to award [interim relief] is a gut-punch to everyone legitimately engaged in trade union activities. The real world consequences of this are forcing valuable people to leave this country, upending their families and destroying their lives, and all because of the actions of a ruthless, uncaring employer's quest to crush a trade union." </p><p>They added they will "continue to fight" in order to clear their name, and the names of other affected employees. "This decision, while not in our favour, is not an exoneration of Rockstar's behaviour and actions. Merely a stumbling block on the road to justice," they closed.</p>
<p><strong>[UPDATE 11.43am]</strong> A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> has just shared a statement with Eurogamer regarding this week's rejection of interim relief, which you can read below:</p>
<p>“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union's application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar's position throughout.</p>
<p>"We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing."</p>

<p>In addition to the IWGB's legal case against Rockstar, over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">200 employees at Rockstar have signed a letter to management condemning the firing</a> of their fellow staff members.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">dismissals were also discussed in the UK Parliament last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK prime minister Keir Starmer has since called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning"</a>. The PM added that ministers would be looking further into the dismissals at Rockstar.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Much has been written about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a>'s handling of its lead female character, the culture war surrounding it, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/stellar-blade-cuts-unintentional-reference-to-racial-slur-3750534">developer Shift Up's several eyebrow-raising missteps</a> as the game broke through into mainstream consciousness. Regardless, the PS5 title was a big success and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">a sequel is now in development</a>. Before we even get a first look at it, however, a new storm appears to be brewing.</p>
<p>AI, generative or not, is the talk of town, and by town I mean the entire games industry. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Larian tries to toy with gen-AI while not using the tech for final assets</a> and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-cancerous-manor-lords-publisher-hooded-horse-wants-to-avoid-genai-like-the-plague">publishers like Hooded Horse unequivocally dunk on studios using it</a>, the debate refuses to go away. 2026 may be defined by the widespread adoption or rejection of AI tools, and hopefully, by people finally figuring out the difference between tools that have been around for a while and the controversial gen-AI. The well has already been poisoned, sadly.</p>
<p>Shift Up CEO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> director Hyung-tae Kim is bullish on the whole package, it seems. During a national briefing on South Korea's 2026 Economic Growth Strategy, the developer claimed it's "an essential tool for going up against large competitors like China on a global level". <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">Automaton</a> reported on (and translated) the news first shared by <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1770030">GameMeca</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who's been paying attention to the games industry for the last few years is well aware of China's increasingly large presence, with behemoths like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chinese-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-reaches-two-million-players-in-just-24-hours-of-global-release">Where Winds Meet</a> making waves and rising to compete against the Japanese and Western giants that have typically dominated the market. Meanwhile, South Korea has started to exit the MMO-oriented creative trends and begun to punch above its weight with triple-A projects. It comes as no surprise to see more and more developers in the country betting on AI (even if it's not of the <em>generative</em> kind) as its ambitions grow larger, too.</p><p>Kim "argues that widespread use of AI will not result in people losing their jobs, because competing with major industries like China and the US will require not only utilising all available manpower, but also making everyone proficient in AI". Press X to doubt, as immediately, he stated one person could "perform the work of 100 people" with the assistance of these tools.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the adoption of AI assistance into the general pipeline really will make games bigger, better, or more profitable for publishers, but either way, it seems like the conversation around this topic - and the consequences of its general usage - will not go away any time soon.</p>

            <p>Capcom has announced a Resident Evil showcase, which will give us all a closer look at what the team has in store for its upcoming release, Requiem.</p>
<p>The showcase itself will take place this Thursday, 15th January (that's our Lottie's birthday, if you want to send her a message :D). It will begin at 10pm UK time, which for those across the pond is 2pm PST / 3pm MST / 4pm CST / 5pm EST.</p>

<p>As for what we will see, Capcom has assured gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem. The showcase will run for roughly 12 minutes, <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/showcase/en-us/">the studio has said</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to be released across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a> on 27th February. Along with Grace Ashcroft  - who is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character that featured in spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-outbreak">Resident Evil Outbreak</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">fan favourite Leon Kennedy will also be returning for Requiem</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-leak-points-to-a-second-playable-character-and-it-isnt-leon">another potential returning face from the series that could show up</a>, if earlier store page leaks are to be believed (I won't spoil it here, don't worry).</p>
<p>So, will you be joining in for the Resident Evil Requiem showcase this Thursday?</p>

<p>Last year, Capcom assured its Resi fans the team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-pc-woes-like-monster-hunter-wilds-says-capcom">working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC</a>, after a multitude of technical issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. So, that bodes well!</p>

            <p>
We already knew Hytale was likely to have a major early access release this week, but developer Hypixel Studios has now revealed the long-awaited Minecraft-a-like has sold so many copies ahead of its launch that it's made enough money to fund the next two years of development.
</p>
<p>
Development of Hytale, an RPG-like Minecraft-style sandbox experience, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">began in 2015</a>, garnering plenty of attention - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games investing millions into the project before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>. But last year it seemed like Hytale's adventure might have reached an end after Riot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">made the decision to pull the plug</a>, forcing Hypixel to announce it would be "winding down" its operations as a result.

<p>
Somewhat miraculously, however, Hytale survived; Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced he'd <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year, and the whole dramatic saga appears to have created massively renewed interest in the project. Ahead of Hytale's early access launch on 13th January this week, Collins-Laflamme revealed Hypixel is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">expecting 1m players on release day</a> - and encouraged purchasers to download the game's launcher in advance (Hytale is only available for purchase via the studio's website during early access) to reduce server stress.
</p><p>
Now, Collins-Laflamme has explained what the massive number of pre-purchases means for Hytale's continued development. "Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases," he wrote <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614?s=20">on social media</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," he continued, "we are looking very strong for the future." That's clearly encouraging news, both for early adopters and for the studio as it works to fulfil Hytale's early promise.
</p>
<p>
Players wanting to get involved in Hytale's early access have three options, with Hypixel <a href="https://store.hytale.com/">currently selling</a> a $23.99 USD standard edition, a $41.99 Supporter Edition, and an $83.99 Founder's Edition on its site - with the latter two versions including a selection of additional cosmetic outfits and capes.

            <p>Peter Molyneux's Masters of Albion - which the game creator has said is the "culmination" of his life's work - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>Masters of Albion is coming from Molyneux and 22cans, and will arrive on 22nd April for PC via Steam. "Masters of Albion is a bold reimagining of the God Game genre, from the creator who defined it," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/">official Steam description</a>. "Revel in the freedom of true Godhood. In [Masters of Albion], there is no single solution, only your solution. Build whatever, wherever. Hire whoever, whenever. Kill or carry, crush or coax.</p>
<p>"You are the ultimate power."</p>

<p>Molyneux said Masters of Albion's forthcoming release owes "so much" to other games already out there, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>, Black &amp; White and Fable, which he famously also worked on.</p>
<p>"It's a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-is-the-culmination-of-my-lifes-work-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-has-a-release-date-and-a-new-trailer">the developer said</a> of Masters of Albion.</p>
<p>The game itself will allow players to command the world with ancient powers. You want to build it, you go for it. The world of Albion is, quite literally, in your hands.</p>
<p>You can check out the new launch date trailer for Masters of Albion below.</p>

<p>Masters of Albion was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">revealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>. Our former editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance">Tom Phillips spoke to Molyneux all about Masters of Albion ahead of its reveal</a>, where the developer said:</p>
<p>"I'm in my 60s now… My lifestyle is so awful. My life expectancy is probably measured in seconds rather than years. So if I'm going to design another game, it's got to <em>matter</em>."</p>

            <p>Gaming can't escape the shadow of global economic uncertainty, and things are going to get worse following <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/microsoft-xbox-prices-tariffs-macroeconomic-conditions.html">2025's price hikes</a> due to the memory shortages caused by the AI and data centre gold rush (which doesn't seem to be producing much gold just yet). What about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> following a strong summer launch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">but slow Christmas</a>? Will it be safe from the price hikes?</p>
<p>According to an interview for <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> (read and extracted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-monitoring-high-ram-prices-and-tariff-impacts-very-closely-president-shuntaro-furukawa-says/">VGC</a>), Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa isn't ready to sound the alarm yet, but he acknowledges things aren't looking too great at the moment.</p>
<p>"We procure from suppliers based on our medium- to long-term business plans, but the current memory market is very volatile… There is no immediate impact on earnings, but it is something we must monitor closely."</p>
<p>Furukawa also went on to explain Nintendo is trying to reduce the impact of the annoying RAM shortages and fluctuating tariffs (not limited to the United Sates) by "advancing component procurement over the medium to long term." Of course, at some point the company might run out of runway, which could lead to increased prices<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them"> in line with PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">Xbox's</a> unwelcome adjustments.</p><p>For now, Furukawa won't comment on potential price increases, only saying it's hypothetical talk until things get more difficult. He was more open about the impact of tariffs though: "While it's difficult to accurately gauge the future impact, our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost and pass them on to prices as much as possible, not just in the US."</p>
<p>For those unaware, consoles' profit margins have traditionally been lower than you'd expect, which is why they're especially susceptible to sudden shifts in the market conditions around tech components and tariffs. Even before the hiccups caused by the madness around AI services and infrastructure we've seen over the past few months, we'd been facing a tricky decade when it comes to resources used for hardware production, so these are rough waters we'll collectively have to learn to navigate in the future.</p>

            <p>A lot of you are gaming hard, it seems. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> has been on a steady growth trajectory for years now, with the Covid pandemic alone adding five million unique users only in 2020. On 1th January, Valve's platform crossed the 42 million barrier, setting a new record.</p>
<p>As reported and explained by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/">Wccftech</a>, the PC distribution platform has now more than doubled its concurrent user average since 2020, with new record peaks of activity becoming more and more common in recent years. The previous activity record was 41.6 million users in October 2025.</p>
<p>The full analysis solidifies the feeling that Steam (and PC gaming as a whole) has blown up in popularity in the post-pandemic era: "A quick data analysis reveals distinct growth phases during this period. Before the pandemic, the Steam platform was growing slowly, at a rate of +4.5 percent per year. The lockdown year obviously exploded the platform (as well as all other gaming platforms) with +31.5 percent in a single year, followed by a stabilisation phase and the current phase, which are both between 13.9 percent and 12.6 percent annual growth rate."</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">Last month also was Steam's highest-grossing yet</a>, partly thanks to recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-expeditions-one-in-ten">Arc Raiders</a> and viral indie sensations like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Peak</a>, on top of everything else. The quality of the more recent Steam sales has also been on the upswing, often countering the deep deals found on other storefronts.</p><p>Another reason behind this growth is the rising popularity of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a>, Valve's portable PC that's cracked open PC gaming for plenty of folks who wanted the benefits of Steam and other platforms without the technical hassles which typically come with gaming computers. Even with its technical limitations, it’s become the go-to "console" for plenty of more casual players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/">Epic Games Store has also seen plenty of growth</a> over six years, but as we expected, most users only show up for the free games given out each week, refusing to spend money on a platform that isn’t nearly as fleshed out as Valve’s beyond the games themselves.</p>

            <p>Lego has lifted the lid on its previously announced Pokémon sets, which include Pikachu and Poké Ball, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise and Eevee.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152">Pikachu and Poké Ball set</a> includes 2050 pieces, and retails for £179.99. This model of Pikachu can be displayed in either a battle stance or resting pose. Meanwhile, the Poké Ball can be displayed either opened or closed. In a nice homage for fans of the Pokémon series, the studs of the display base form a '25', which is a a nod to Pikachu's Pokédex number.</p>

This model includes the three posable Kanto partner Pokémon in their fierce and final evolution forms.

<p>The model's stands, meanwhile, are set on beach, jungle and volcano-themed bases, to represent each Pokémon type. Lego has also teased an Easter egg for users to find.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/eevee-72151">smaller build is Eevee</a>, with this model coming in at 587 pieces and retailing for £54.99. As with the other models, Eevee can be posed, with Lego saying users will be able to make it look as though the Pokémon is "on the move". You will also be able to move the model's ears, feet and legs. Eevee also has an articulated tail.</p>
<p>Again, Eevee's model features a hidden Easter egg, which Lego says highlights the Pokémon's "many evolutions".</p>
<p>These Lego sets are all available to pre-order now, and will be shipped on 27th February. Those that pre-order the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model will also receive the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/kanto-region-badge-collection-40892">Kanto Region Badge Collection set</a>, providing stocks last.</p>
