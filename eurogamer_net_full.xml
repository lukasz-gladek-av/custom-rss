            <p>Wildlight has deployed another update to its live-service hero shooter, Highguard, introducing a 5v5 limited-time mode that will only be available this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of the most recent update you'll also find a brand new base, Soul Well, wherein "Wardens can now experiment with this dark relic from a lost age" in both the 3v3 and 5v5 rotations. You can find out more in the teaser below:</p>

<p>To accommodate the bigger fireteams, lobbies have been updated to permit parties of five, and raids are now 10 lives instead of six. You should also expect slightly longer respawns during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused", and the Firing Range cannot support 5v5 at this time, so expect the option to be greyed out if your party has more than three players.</p>
<p>"As one of two major patches released during launch week, this update is emblematic of the Highguard team's dedication to creating a 'ready for live service' game, resulting in immediate action," the team said.</p>
<p>"Just this week, the team has squashed hundreds of bugs, improved performance across the board: yesterday’s update, Patch 1.0.4 introduced a variety of bug fixes, new video settings, and highly-requested features."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Here's the full patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard the feedback!</p>
<p>For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!</p>
<p>The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live. Grab 4 friends and jump into some hectic raids!</p>
<p>A few small tweaks for this mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6</li>
<li>Respawns are slightly longer during raids to allow generators to be planted/defused</li>
</ul>
<p>Dev note: As most of you know, we are working on optimizations across the game. Many are in this patch and 3v3 should see good improvements! But… adding 4 more players to the game is not going to improve performance, right? Please keep that in mind as you try 5v5!</p>
<p>Dev note 2: Firing Range does not support 5v5 at this time, so the Play button will be grayed out if your party is over 3.</p>
<h2>New Base - Soul Well</h2>
<p>Soul Well is a dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak.</p>
<p>This new base will be added to the rotation in all modes.</p>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>This patch contains several optimizations that touch on animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and other gameplay systems. These optimizations benefit console and PC, but every PC is different, so the exact speedup to overall framerate is dependent on GPU, CPU, and other factors.</p>
<h2>Quality of Life</h2>
<p>Enabled these visual settings on PC and consoles</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion blur toggle for PC and consoles</li>
<li>Anisotropic materials toggle for consoles (PC has this already)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one." Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-update-reduces-crashes-by-90-adds-crouch-toggle-option">Wildlight released an update</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer AdHoc Studio has issued a statement insisting it was not "trying to hide" a disclaimer about censored content on Switch, but did admit it had inadvertently put the notice in "the absolute worst spot" on the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship would be implemented as standard</a>. As we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-comments-on-dispatchs-switch-censorship">reported at the time</a>, this meant black boxes would conceal explcit graphics, and sex noises would be toned down.</p>
<p>AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release". Nintendo's own statement said: "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines".</p>

<p>Now, acknowledging it has been "quiet for the last few days not because we don't want to address this stuff, but because we've been trying to make sure we're being good partners with Nintendo", the studio has issued a statement.</p><p>"As Nintendo states, any game that's going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to 'meet [Nintendo's] established content and platform guidelines'. This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That's what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms," AdHoc wrote.</p>
<p>"We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved."</p>
<p>The statement adds that AdHoc "absolutely need[s] to take full ownership" of the placement of that disclaimer, and while it "didn't have complete control of the language" the disclaimer contained, it did have control of its placement.</p>
<p>"It was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled 'Disclaimer', instead of the 'About The Game' section. We didn't catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it."</p><p>The team takes ownership of this, writing: "This is 100 percent our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We've also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, AdHoc says it is "already working with Nintendo on a path forward", and while "can't make any specific promises just yet", it is "confident we'll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content", albeit in several weeks' time due to the console submission process.</p>
<p>"To our fans who were looking forward to playing the uncensored version on Switch, we're truly sorry. People have a right to be pissed," the statement concluded. "Lots of lessons learned here. Thanks for sticking with us. More soon."</p>
<p>Dispatch is already hugely successful, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a>, possibly with even more sex scenes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>.</p>

<p>Respawn didn't provide a specific reason as to why updates would be discontinued on Switch - although we can guess that it's something to do with the hardware given support continues on Switch 2 - but did say the discontinuation was part of the studio's goal to "continue to evolve Apex Legends' content and technical foundation" and "deliver a high quality experience".</p><p>"All players progress, purchases, and earnings are tied to their individual EA accounts," the team explained.

            <h2>31st January</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing. This week, I've been failing to be competent at a video game, again, Marie has been trying to please Mama, Victoria passes the time in an airport, and Dom is off on one about Nioh again.</p>
<p>And if you're looking for something else to read, or a reminder of what you once wrote, there's a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">What We've Been Playing archive</a> to delve into.</p>
<h2>Blue Prince, PS5</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Dogubomb/Raw Fury</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This might be my third (maybe fourth?) attempt to get into Blue Prince. This is the puzzle game that took home <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-our-game-of-the-year-is-so-much-more-than-just-a-brilliant-puzzler">Eurogamer's 2025 Game of the Year</a> award, so I felt I simply must give it another shot. A few hours on, am I now a Blue Princian, dedicated to spreading the word of the game's brilliance to all who will listen? Well, no. I think I know the problem now, though. I simply can't dedicate enough time to the game in one session, so I end up feeling completely clueless every time I play. I'm sure I'll get over the hump one day, but that day isn't today.</p>

<h2>Cooking Mama 2, 3DS XL</h2>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>My palms are clammy, my anxiety is high, my stress levels are beyond their natural limits, and fear envelopes my body as I submit my creation. 'Terrific, even better than Mama!'. Those words still bring me the same elation I felt all those years ago when I first played it, Mama liked my food. However, now that I'm a bit older, I realise just how condescending Cooking Mama is when you get something wrong and how stressful it is to try to meet her demanding standards. When the flames ignite in her eyes after tasting a dish I've messed up, I know I am done for. I'd like to point out that some tasks are trickier than others and easy to mess up. For example, grilling anything within the time frame to get bonus points is near enough impossible. Not only is there not enough space to grill that much Squid that quickly, but to keep the flames at the right temperature to cook requires constant attention.</p>
<p>I'm starting to understand why I like Overcooked so much, my training in high-stress virtual kitchen environments began with a seemingly nice Mama in her home kitchen.</p>
<p><em>-Marie</em></p>
<h2>Waiting and Words, mobile</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I spent a good chunk of time in airports this week, playing that ol' fashioned waiting game, and since my previous airport go to of Star Wars Hunters has shut down, to while away some time, I returned to the ever-faithful trinity of Wordle, Strands and Connections.</p><p>I have to say, I think I have my Wordle tactic pretty down pat now. I can usually guess the correct word in well under a minute (not a brag, I am sure many others can also). What I do is I always start with OUIJA, a very vowel heavy word, and then for my second guess pick a word with any of the correct letters from my first guess, but this time make sure I get an E in there as well. I usually end up with something like BEANS or PLUME for guess two. From there, it is then pretty straightforward to get the right answer.</p>
<p>Connections, though, <em>man </em>some of those are obtuse! On the plus side, at least Connections kept my brain occupied for slightly longer while I waited for my flight to board. Wait, what do you mean it's been delayed again?!</p>
<p><em>-Victoria</em></p>
<h2>Nioh 3 demo, PS5 Pro</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Koei Tecmo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s here, it’s finally here. A sizeable, full-fat introduction to one of my most anticipated games of 2026 is now available to download on PlayStation and PC, and it absolutely rules. It looks sumptuous, the variety of build-crafting available to you is out of this world, and flitting between bruiser samurai builds and rapid ninja builds laces the whole action-RPG experience with something diabolically compelling. I think this has the potential to go the whole hog, surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-2">Nioh 2</a> (which, for my money, was a near-perfect game) and helping the niche franchise eat further into mainstream consciousness. Give it a go, you’ve nothing to lose.</p>

            <p>17-year Bethesda Bruce Nesmith veteran has given his take on a future Elder Scrolls Morrowind Remakes, stating he doubts the company even has the source code any more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout">In an interview with PressboxUK</a>, Nesmith spoke at length about the company and various projects he worked on. Having left in 2021 during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>'s development, he offered a frank response when asked why Bethesda would be hesitant to remake the old but beloved RPG.</p>
<p>The problem with doing Morrowind is that I bet they don't have the original code," Nesmith said. "The game is so old. I don't know if the original source code exists anymore. If it does, can you even compile it? When you're looking at Oblivion, they still had the code. They could still compile it. Putting the code into the new version of the engine was a possibility."</p>

<p>He also raised concerns around how Morrowind has aged, doubting that audiences would even enjoy playing that game today. "The other thing I would say is go back and play Morrowind and tell me that's the game you want to play again. We all have these fond memories of things that were pivotal moments in our gaming fantasy histories that we absolutely move but you go back and play a 20 year old game and you will cringe.</p><p>"People even had cringe moments with the Oblivion remake but they forgave it because they're reliving something, they're enjoying the nostalgia. I worked on Oblivion. I'm even responsible for some of those cringe moments! The further back you go, the more that's going to be an issue. The reality of playing Morrowind would not stand the test of time, in my opinion."</p>
<p>Instead, Nesmith raises the point that time would be better spent making something new within the Morrowind setting. He told Pressbox: "Now if you were to completely remake Morrowind with the Skyrim engine, to try and rebuild it from the ground up, that's a whole other story, but that's an entire project. That's a whole four-year development cycle. Why not go and make something new?</p>
<p>"Let's revisit the lands of Morrowind and do a new story. You can include the giant crab palace and all of that stuff but make it new and avoid all the things that would not have survived the test of time."</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered, which released back in April of last year, proved exceptionally popular. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">It sold over four million copies in five days</a>, and received <a href="http://eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">numerous community mods</a> that both added some additional wackiness to the beloved RPG and smoothed off some of its rougher edges. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-asks-the-elder-scrolls-fans-to-suggest-oblivion-remastered-improvements-with-difficulty-scaling-among-top-ideas">Bethesda also went to the community for ideas to improve the game</a>, difficulty scaling one of the more popular among them.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">Eurogamer's Jim Trinca made a case for a Morrowind remake last year</a>, in which he argued: Morrowind is a special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly. I love it warts and all, as much as I love Oblivion warts and all, but I find the latter much easier to recommend for the simple fact that Oblivion is brilliant because of its quirks and foibles, whereas Morrowind is brilliant in spite of them.</p>

            <p>A tease has been made by Blizzard for something special for Classic World of Warcraft players. Meanwhile, the Classic World of Warcraft community is polling itself to find out what they'd want from some sort of 'Classic+'.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkFMkdZWxdk">In the 2026 State of Azeroth presentation</a>, hosted by executive producer Holly Longdale, went over everything in the pipeline across both retail (modern) and Classic World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>On the topic of Classic WoW, Longdale stated the following before being playfully cut off. She stated: "I can say with confidence that all Classic players across the globe have a lot to look forward to. I'm excited to announce…" before being cut off with "Holly No!".</p>

<p>This continues <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24247148/2025-blizzard-yearbook">a trend of recent hints</a> at something substantial coming to Classic World of Warcraft, which has been presumed by swathes of the audience to be some sort of expansion of content to Classic World of Warcraft. Dubbed 'Classic+' by the community, this would be a sort of Old School <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> style strand of WoW in which new updates can be produced in the Classic style.</p><p>This tease comes at an interesting time, as a community-run initiative called 'The Classic+ Project' recently was released. This project has manifested initially as a survey website and Discord server, prompting players to vote on what they'd like to see added and changed to Classic WoW.</p>
<p>Announced in a video by creator Joardee titled '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWq2SFSI3zY">What Exactly is Classic+</a>', this project was created to pull together sentiment by players directly at a time when Blizzard is keeping its cards to its chest.</p>
<p>So discussion around Classic + is really reaching somewhat of a crescendo. Will Blizzard finally announce some form of Classic +, and will this community project refine the wants of the masses into a solid list of wants? If there's any time to announce something official, it's Blizzcon later this year.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a statement regarding the recent censorship of AdHoc's Dispatch on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn there would be some censorship differences on Nintendo's platforms. In versions of the game as it appears on other platforms, there is an option for players to toggle censorship of  explicit content on or off. In the case of Nintendo, though, players were not given this choice, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship being implemented in Dispatch as standard</a>. This saw black boxes covering characters' exposed breasts and penises, while noises of sexual pleasure were toned down.</p>
<p>At this time, AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release".</p>

<p>Nintendo has now shared its own statement regarding the Dispatch discourse. "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines," a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">GoNintendo</a>.</p>
<p>"While we inform partners when their titles don't meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations."</p>
<p>When it first came to attention that Dispatch would be automatically censored on Switch consoles, many were keen to point out that other games which also featured displays of nudity had not been met with the same stipulations. Games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, in which players can customise their Vs genitalia and more, are not censored on Switch consoles in the way Dispatch has been.</p><p>That being said, a specific Japanese version of Cyberpunk 2077 was released separately from the game's standard version, which removed nudity and decapitations. Therefore, some have speculated Dispatch's censorship issues may have come down to AdHoc not wishing to create a separate release of the game for Japan only. Again, though, this is speculation.</p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Soon after its initial release last year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>

            <p>To celebrate the conclusion of the Fallout show's second season, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> has gone free-to-play for a limited time. It also gained a new $30 DLC pack featuring a camo from the series.</p>
<p>The free-to-play period, which has already started and will last until the 5th February for Xbox and PC players (and the 4th February on PlayStation). You'll have access to all the released updates for the game, giving a pretty substantial peek into what Fallout 76 has got going on.</p>
<p>For those jumping in that are super fans of the Amazon show, the NCR power armour is available too! You'll have to bust out the wallet for it though, as it's part of the new Mojave bundle. It contains the power armour, as well as the ranger power armour paint, NCR flag, New Vegas neon sign, Ad Victoriam super sledge, legion legate outfit, and player titles.</p>

<p>That bundle costs $30. Steam reviews for the bundle currently lie at Mostly Positive, but taking a look at the reviews themselves paint a mixed picture.<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CirillaFionaElenRiannon/recommended/4250650/"> Some have added a phrase from the show</a>: "Never underestimate the power of brand recognition", <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/moonlitfrappe/recommended/4250650/">while others</a> wish they could buy the NCR power armour on its lonesome: "Only bought it for the Ranger armor, should've been in the atomic shop/earned via quest. I'm tired of Fallout being the staple of microtransactions franchise for content."</p><p>Amazon recent went to great lengths to tempt stragglers in to watch the popular Fallout show recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-watch-the-first-season-of-amazons-excellent-fallout-adaptation-free-on-youtube-but-act-quickly-as-it-wont-be-there-for-long">by uploading season one to YouTube</a>, though only for a limited time. As for Fallout 76, it recently received its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout show themed Burning Springs update</a>.</p>

            <p>Some games arrive as a burst of sensation and pure delight: a handful of images and emotions and ideas that wordlessly create a mood. This is Mio: Memories in Orbit. This game is Mucha-like hair billowing in zero G. It's a cluster of pearls and twills of off-cut brass twisting around the chill reaches of outer space. It's the future, or perhaps the weird cybernetic past, inspired by Art Nouveau. It's warm metal forming stamens and petals and entire gardens. The whole thing's gorgeous and sad and filled with visual cleverness.</p>

<p>It's also a Metroidvania - and with it there comes a reminder that Metroidvanias are the most elegant of games. They have maps that reveal themselves in darting headlong stretches, while the greater structure slowly curls ever-outwards. Metroidvanias are about looking at a world that you thought you already knew, and learning to see the fresh potential that's been threaded through it.</p>
<p>Mio does all this stuff wonderfully. I'm still in the early game, but this is already a beautiful adventure. Cast as a tiny robot left to explore a huge, dormant spaceship, the game kicks off with platform gauntlets drawn in sharp lines of gold pen as you learn to jump and double-jump. Only when that's mastered does the wider world fade in with all its complex organic dereliction - but even now, shadows arrive as bursts of delicate cross-hatching. The idea remains that you're exploring a landscape that is in the process of being drawn into existence.</p>



<p>And what a landscape. Early stages allow you to scrabble through cable-strewn passages and then out, suddenly, across gaping bridges where huge machines sleep in the distance. An ice biome arrives, but rather than simply chilling you until you take damage and forcing you to duck falling icicles, you're more concerned with managing speed and inertia as the ground itself becomes a rippling ramp that allows you to launch yourself across vast distances and avoid toxic pits of spikes.</p>



<p>Enemies, meanwhile, are brass and lightbulbs, dashing and rolling and scuttling and lunging. An early power-up allows you to see their health bars, but even the simplest and most ridiculous of these foes can still end a promising run of exploration with a well-swung hammer. I've just encountered a sort of animatronic hummingbird, and I was so taken with watching it that I gave it ample time to peck me to pieces.</p>



<p>Coming post-<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, Mio feels like a reprieve and a revelation. Silksong is deeply wonderful, of course, but it's a pleasure to be exploring a place that's not quite so devoted to causing me harm. If anything, Mio replaces the thrilling pressure of constant game-ending threat with a different kind of panic. I move so far on a single life, and explore so many branching paths - leaving so many other paths unvisited - that I end up with that kind of spatial and memory-based anxiety only the most wide-reaching and intricate games can deliver. How will I ever find my way back here? How will I remember to follow up on everything I'm ignoring for the time being?</p><p>These are good problems to have when a game provides such an interesting set of spaces to explore, and when it gives you such pleasure in the light-footed way you move through them. I loved Silksong very much, but afterwards I did feel like I needed a break from Metroidvanias, just for a bit. Mio makes me realise that I was wrong.</p>

            <p>The Metal Gear Solid series has sold over 65.5m copies worldwide, according to a new business post by Konami.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://www.konami.com/corporate/en/business/digitalentertainment.html">published on the official Konami corporate website</a>, breaks down a selection of milestone achievements for its various IPs. The crowning achievement of this breakdown is the Metal Gear Series, which has surpassed 65.5m total worldwide sales. However, other big series from the Japanese games company have also taken centre stage alongside the stealth action series.</p>
<p>These include the Pawafuru Puroyakyu series, which has passed 26.3m sales, YuGiOh games at 32.5m, Momotaro Dentetsu at 19.9m, and Silent Hill which has made it past 14m sales. Of of these stats run up to the end of December 2025.</p>

<p>The page also includes some pretty eye-watering download stats for various mobile and console games. eFootball has apparently surpassed 950m total sales since 1995, and YuGiOh Duel Links is no slouch either, passing 150m downloads since its release in 2016.</p><p>As a page aimed at impressing investors, there are additional interesting tidbits included in paragraphs meant to sell Konami as a forward-thinking company. This includes a descriptor of Konami as "a leading company in esports", thanks to YuGiOh, eFootball, and Pawafuru Puroyakyu.</p>
<p>The company also claims it will: "continue to take on challenges of the latest innovation by utilizing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), fifth/sixth generation mobile communications (5G/6G), cloud technology, WEB3, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>, and VR/AR."</p>
<p><a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2026/en0129_cf84s6.pdf">Looking at Konami's latest quarterly report</a>, it certainly seems as though the company is doing well. It saw a 16.3 percent increase in income from its digital entertainment sector compared to last year, and a total revenue increase of 13.6 percent.</p>

            <p>The first script for an upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> film adaptation based on Hazelight's game of the same name has been penned.</p>
<p>It was first announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction, which sees two aspiring writers trapped in simulations of their own stories, was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> last year. At this time, sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Soon after, it was revealed that Euphoria and Eden actor Sydney Sweeney would star in the upcoming film, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would handle the script</a>. And, handle the script, they appear to have done.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezine</a>, Hazelight studio head Josef Fares said he had seen the first finalised script for the Split Fiction film. "I got the first version of the script today but you know, there's so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this 'I believe it when I see it'," Fares said (translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>).</p><p>Fares added he had chatted with a "hyped" Sweeney about the project, as well [<strong>NOTE:</strong> Eurogamer commenter @f53b3d06 has said this is a mistranslation by Dexerto. Rather than the actress being 'hyped' for the film, Fares instead said: "It's kind of a done deal that it will star... what's her name, the one that is so hyped/popular... Sydney Sweeney", as he struggled to recall her name at first]. "I've had a meeting with her and she seems super chill," Fares said of the actor.</p>
<p>But, while this may be the case, there is still no word on when we can expect filming for Split Fiction to actually kick off. It could be some time, given how busy Sweeney's schedule is. As well as Split Fiction, the actor is also attached to Colman Domingo's romantic drama Scandalous, which is set to shoot early this year, and a Gundam adaptation. On the other side of the camera, it has been reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">Sweeney is set to produce an adaptation of OutRun</a>. </p>

<p>Split Fiction isn't the only Hazelight game getting the film treatment. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

            <p>According to Walton Goggins, we can all expect something "profound" to happen in the Fallout season two finale next week.</p>
<p>Goggins, who plays The Ghoul/Cooper Howard in Amazon's Fallout adaptation, has said his character's motivations have always been about finding his family. Of course, over the course of two seasons, we have seen the highs and lows of Cooper Howard's family life with his wife Barb and daughter Janey via flashbacks. Meanwhile, in the present day, a now Ghoul-ified Cooper is still searching for his family, and has been for centuries.</p>

<p>So, will he find them in the final episode of Fallout season two? Well, that remains to be seen, though Goggins has teased something "profound" happening not just to The Ghoul, but to the sweeter than sweet vault dweller Lucy as well.</p>
<p>"I can tell you that in episode eight, without giving something away to your audience, something profound happens for both the Ghoul and Lucy that would also be my favourite, but we can't talk about that," he told <a href="https://ew.com/fallout-season-2-finale-cover-story-exclusive-11893674">EW</a> ahead of the Fallout finale.</p><p>Goggins added viewers will also learn more about what Cooper was doing at that birthday party, way back at the start of season one. "I mean, the whole first seven minutes of this experience in season one was about [Cooper being] a guy at a birthday party. Well, how did he get to that birthday party? What happened? It's all leading somewhere," the actor said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to Lucy MacLean actor Ella Purnell, the second season's finale will be a "conflicted, explosive and character-defining" cocktail for the naive and trusting vault dweller.</p>
<p>"You get to see Lucy be a real human with real human problems, and I think at times, because of her strength and her optimism, it doesn't always feel that way with her," Purnell explained. "But in this moment, and that maybe says a lot about what her choices and decisions are, she's flawed and she's actually just getting more and more human."</p>
<p>Ooh, curious!</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-latest-episode-delivers-another-cameo-for-fans-of-the-video-game-series">many weeks of chaos and cameos</a>, Fallout season two will wrap up on 3rd February. Meanwhile, the third season of Fallout is already being written, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming expected to kick off this May</a>. Ghoul blimey, and all that.</p>

            <p>Word on the internet is that Nintendo will be holding another reveals-based livestream next week, and it'll be a Partner Showcase no less.</p>
<p>According to various sources, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">including NatetheHate and GameXplain</a>, the showcase will be focused on third party studios publishing on Nintendo systems, with NatetheHate going one step further stating it'll be hosted on the 5th February.</p>
<p>While these are folks who have a history of calling these sorts of events right in the past, they are still rumours and should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Still, it's been some time since we had a Nintendo Partner Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">Back in July of last year</a>, games like Monster Hunter Stories, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler-2">Octopath Traveler 2</a>, and more were shown off in quite the jam-packed occasion. Leading into 2026, there are plenty of games lined-up for release that we've not actually seen much of yet, including 007: First Light, and The Duskbloods. That last one being especially silent as of late.</p><p>Looking at the reactions to these rumours, there's excitement yet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qqj4qr/natethehate_next_weeks_nintendo_direct_is_a/">but also hunger for a Nintendo Direct focused on first-party releases</a>. It's clear to see why, with a new Fire Emblem on the way as well as a new Mario Tennis, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is looking strong on that front too.</p>
<p>What do you reckon? Will we see a Partner Direct next week? If so, what do you want to see in it?</p>

            <p>A report from GDC has shed a rather sobering light on the state of things, revealing that one third of surveyed US workers within the industry were laid off in the last two years.</p>
<p>According to GDC's <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/2026-SOTI">2026 State of the Game Industry Report</a> - which included data provided by over 2300 respondents including developers, producers, marketers, executives and investors - 33 percent of respondents in the US had been laid off over the past 24 months.</p>
<p>Looking further afield to include other countries as well, 28 percent of those surveyed from within the industry reported they had been laid off in the same period, which is over a quarter of all respondents.</p>

<p>17 percent of those surveyed, meanwhile, stated they had been laid off in the past 12 months. "The total number of layoffs could be higher, though, as some may have experienced more than one layoff in the past two years," the report notes.</p><p>Almost half of the respondents - 48 percent - said they were still looking for employment after being laid off. Of those who were laid off one to two years ago, 36 percent said they still haven't found other games industry employment.</p>
<p>"Over 450 respondents reported experiencing an acquisition, closure, or merger in the past year. About 31 percent of those people also reported being laid off, though it's unclear how many were a direct result of said company changes," the report reads. "AAA and older indie respondents were more likely to report their companies were acquired, and newer indie studios were more likely to close."</p>
<p>In terms of professions within the industry, game designers reported the highest percentage of layoffs over the last 12 months, with 20 percent of those surveyed affected. This percentage includes those in narrative design.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, those working in business operations and services reported the lowest percentage of layoffs, with eight percent affected.</p>
<p>As to the reason why these layoffs happened, 43 percent cited company restructuring, while 32 percent said it was due to a project getting cancelled. Budget cuts and market conditions were also cited by 38 percent of respondents.</p>
<p>"Leadership failed to see that the Covid-era boom was not permanent, [and the] company went on an acquisition spree before being acquired," one respondent told GDC. "Now, money is a lot tighter because the goldfish with the money want returns yesterday so they can funnel it into the current fad (genAI)."</p><p>Another respondent, who was laid off less than 12 months ago, said: "Executives who have never actually worked as a dev are pulling up the boards on their ships, throwing people overboard, and expecting these scuttled ghost ships to keep making them infinite money."</p>
<p>Some respondents added their employers were working to retain their staff, "in spite of ongoing challenges".</p>

<p>Layoffs and closures remain an ongoing issue in 2026. Earlier this month, Ubisoft shocked everyone when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, back in 2024, Chris Dring wrote an in-depth feature about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">everything going on with layoffs in the video games industry</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The team over at Wildlight has released an update for its live-service hero shooter, Highguard.</p>
<p>This update adds a number of "highly" requested features from its community, including a new crouch toggle option, field of view sliders on console and - importantly - improved stability. According to the studio, crashes have been reduced by 90 percent thanks to this update.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Highguard below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Settings Improvements</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localised in languages other than English. Properly localised settings will be prepared for a future patch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Game Input Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to set Crouch to Hold or Toggle for all platforms.</li>
<li>Added the ability to set Aim Down Sights to Hold or Toggle for PC only (for now).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Toggling into ADS then tapping Sprint (shift on PC, left stick on controller) will swap your scope. This is disorienting on controller. PC players are recommended to rebind scope swap if using Toggle ADS. We will continue to look into adding this for console players who can’t rebind buttons yet, but we will need more time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Video Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.</li>
<li>Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.</li>
<li>Low shadow setting now also disables volumetric fog.</li>
<li>Added a new "View Distance Quality" setting that controls skeletal mesh LODs, which can be another useful control to tune GPU and CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players now have the ability to toggle the following features on or off, irrespective of other quality options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anisotropic Materials</li>
<li>Chromatic Aberration</li>
<li>Bloom</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Motion Blur and Depth of Field need more testing to disable safely. Look for these options very soon.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS users now have the ability to select a DLSS preset.<em> More presets and better descriptions are coming in the next patch.</em></li>
<li>Players can now select Off to disable Global Illumination entirely.</li>
<li>Resolved an engine bug which could inadvertently throttled laptop users to 60 FPS regardless of frame rate settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crash and Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>This patch resolves crashes that could occur in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a match on PS5 with an unexpected input state.</li>
<li>Loading into matches on machines with slower storage devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other bugs related to online user presence and matchmaking were also resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friends now appear online correctly after accepting requests, and Xbox presence updates properly. Major crash fixes have reduced crashes by 90 percent, significantly improving stability.</li>
<li>Friend status is fixed - players now appear online correctly and Xbox presence updates reliably. Our top crash issues are gone resulting in a 90 percent crash reduction.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>And that's your lot for now.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>Despite Amazon's live-action God of War series following the plot of Santa Monica's 2018 Norse epic, the cast so far has a very Ragnarök (and roll) feel to it.</p>

<p>Last night, it was announced that Severance actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson will portray the Norse God of Thunder, Thor. "A mountain of a man who has weathered many a battle in his time, but whose actions in a war fought long ago now haunt his waking hours," reads Thor's character description.</p>
<p>As in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, Amazon's live-action Thor is "now but a shadow of his former self", and has turned to alcohol in an attempt to drown out his demons. "Keeping his wife and children at arm's length has only deepened his isolation, but the power (and danger) of the God of Thunder is still there just beneath the surface," the <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/">description ends</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Thor, Homeland and Princess Bride actor Mandy Patinkin has been announced as the show's "most powerful Aesir god", Odin. "Odin, the All-Father, is not physically imposing or particularly god-like: but looks can be deceiving," reads his <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/mandy-patinkin-god-of-war-odin-1236644947/">God of War character description</a>, adding that Odin is a "patriarch who leads with an iron fist, and an unrivaled seeker of knowledge".</p><p>Odin - who is the father of Thor - is "paranoid, manipulative, and dangerous", and will serve as "a formidable antagonist" to God of War's lead, Kratos. The Aesir god will do "anything to try and prevent Ragnarök, the Norse end of days".</p>

<p>Ólafsson and Patinkin join an already impressive cast, which includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">Ryan Hurst as Kratos</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-casts-thors-wife-sif">Teresa Palmer as Phoebe/Sif</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ey-up-this-lad-from-emmerdale-is-playing-norse-god-heimdall-in-amazons-god-of-war-show-thats-norse-not-up-north">Max Parker as Heimdall</a>. Meanwhile, behind the camera, Amazon's God of War adaptation includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore</a>, who will serve as showrunner on the upcoming series, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">Emmy winning Shōgun director Frederick E.O. Toye</a>.</p><p>"God of War follows father and son Kratos and Atreus as they embark on a journey to spread the ashes of their wife and mother, Faye. Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," reads the show's official logline. I wonder when we will hear who will play Atreus…?</p>
<p>We still don't have a release window for the first season, however a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's delightfully quirky <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream has been given the full reveal treatment ahead of its Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> release on 16th April. And amid the fresh deluge of information, Nintendo has confirmed same-sex relationships and non-binary options, fulfilling its promise to be "more inclusive" following controversy around the game's 3DS predecessor.
</p>
<p>
When Tomodachi Life released for 3DS back in 2013, players disappointed at the absence of same-sex romances launched a social media campaign to encourage Nintendo to add them in a post-launch update. The company's initial response was dismissive, insisting Tomodachi Life was not a "real-life simulation" nor "trying to provide social commentary." Later, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-refuses-to-allow-same-sex-relationships-in-tomodachi-life">took a more conciliatory tone</a>, apologising and pledging that while it was unable to make such a "significant development change" to the 3DS version of Tomodachi Life, it would be "more inclusive" if another instalment ever came.

<p>
Over a decade later, Nintendo has made good on that promise. As revealed in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtYngxAs1k">30-minute-long Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct</a>, players can choose from three gender identities when creating their Miis in the new game - male, female, or non-binary - plus any combination of relationship preferences from the same list, effectively making it possible to create characters who're gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, asexual, or heterosexual. And because this is Tomodachi Life, you also get to pick facial features, body shape, personality, even the silly computer-synthesised voices they'll use.
</p>
<p>
And once your Miis are ready to descend on their new island home, it largely looks like business as usual. Rather than controlling Miis directly, you'll encourage their growth by feeding them, giving them gifts, and creating new neighbours for them to interact with and befriend. And you can help introduce those friends to other friends, acting as a sort of omnipotent matchmaker to create a network of not always blissful social bonds.
</p>

<p>
Some encounters might happen while you're away from the game - perhaps your Mii will meet someone they take a fancy to - and you can keep abreast of events via the island's News Channel. Elsewhere, you can buy your Miis outfits from the clothing store, food from the supermarket, apartment decor from the Renovation Centre, and more exotic items - a lion?? - from the market stall. There's also a photo studio if you want to take some daft snaps.
</p><p>
Tomodachi Life residents might also make requests for island improvements from time to take, and you can decorate its outdoor spaces with everything from fences and picnic benches to new houses and additional terrain, all purchased from the Island Design Centre. And if you want to have a little more impact on your Miis, you can bestow them with quirks and traits, or drop them down at points of interest, so they can, say, jiggle in a sprinkler. It all looks as delightfully ridiculous as its predecessor, and that's before we get to the Studio Workshop where you can doodle your residents a 2D pet, or customise food, clothing, the TV channels they watch, and more. And yes there's romance, awkward love triangles, and marriage. Even shared housing for up to nine Miis.
</p>
<p>
Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches for Switch and Switch 2 on 16th April, but there's currently no word on any Switch 2-specific enhancements.

            <p>Nintendo is introducing image sharing restrictions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>: Living the Dream in order to create experiences that are "welcoming and enjoyable for everyone".</p>
<p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">As seen on the Nintendo America website</a>, a statement laying out why these restrictions are in place have been included. They read as follows: "Nintendo aims to create experiences where players have the freedom to enjoy their Mii characters in their own way. In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, this freedom can sometimes lead to humorous, surprising, or unpredictable moments during gameplay.</p>
<p>"While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>

<p>"Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone.</p>
<p>"To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image sharing features. These limits help to make the worlds players create in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream remain fun and safe, and that the game can be enjoyed comfortably by all players.</p>
<p>"We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting. However, they reflect Nintendo's ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays."</p>
<p>As for the extent of these restrictions, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">Japanese Nintendo website</a> lays it out clearly: "The following features are unavailable: image transfer to smartphones, direct posting to social media, and automatic image uploads (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> only)." You can still share images via the Switch 2 Game Chat function.</p><p>The reaction to these restrictions are, as you can imagine, negative. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-restricting-image-sharing-features-for-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream.1419745/">Take Dal from ResetEra</a>, who described the decision as "wacky". Racoon, on the same ResetEra post covering the decision, stated their belief that Nintendo "killed the game", adding: "social media was going to shoot this into the stratosphere, instead they killed it". Another, Mullet2000, summed up their thoughts as such: "Nintendo gonna Nintendo".</p>
<p>It's clear that Nintendo is implementing such measures in order to prevent folks from sharing images from the game that could be considered a bit <em>naughty. </em>But given the funny, easily meme-able moments present in Tomodachi Life, it does feel a bit like throwing the baby out with the bath water.</p>

            <p>For those who have been hearing all about this little show called Fallout, but don't have an Amazon Prime account and therefore haven't been able to keep up with the various wasteland chaos, I have some good news for you:</p>
<p>Fallout season one is streaming for a limited time on YouTube.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The first two episodes of season one - The End and The Target - are available now via Amazon's Prime YouTube channel, with the remaining episodes then releasing steadily over the coming days.</p>
<p>Here is the premier schedule for Fallout season one on YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li>S1E1 - 28th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E2 - 28th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E3 - 29th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E4 - 29th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E5 - 30th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E6 - 30th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E7 - 31st January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E8 - 31st January, 6pm PT</li>
</ul>
<p>For those in the UK, 5pm PT is 1am the following day, and so of course 6pm PT is 2am.</p>
<p>This means, if this is your thing, you could probably squeeze episodes three and four into your morning routine before heading off to work tomorrow (though I am not sure Fallout gore and breakfast are the best combination, but who am I to say what works for you).</p>
<p>As per Prime's YouTube description, these episodes will expire on 11th February, at 11:59 pm PT. Will you be giving season one a watch?</p>

            <p>Several developers have come to the defence of Highguard, as its faces a continuous waves of negative criticism from masses of players and far-away spectators alike.</p>
<p>The game, which was much-anticipated following its end-of-show reveal at The Game Awards last year, spent a lengthy period of radio silence before ramping up the marketing last minute, resulting in a largely mysterious aura permeating around the game before it landed in player's hands.</p>
<p>When it eventually did release, the game was met by a substantial initial playerbase eager to check it out, but also hampered by matchmaking issues. Over time, it fell <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">to around a still respectable 10-20k concurrent player count</a>, all the while many continued to criticise it.</p>

<p>"No game is perfect on day one (ours certainly wasn't)," wrote 1047 Games on social media, the developer behind Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. "If you see potential, share feedback. It helps make the game better, and that's something we should all be rooting for. There's room for tons of great games. Wishing you success on Highguard, @WildlightEnt."</p><p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-controversial-marketing-campaign-splitgate-2-fails-to-find-an-audience-despite-two-official-launches">is no stranger to harsh criticism themselves</a>, after taking the leap from a niche but beloved Splitgate to a more controversial sequel. However, the team at 1047 Games is continuing to improve and add more experiences to the game, perhaps showing a similar path Highguard may take.</p>
<p>Thomas Puha, communications director at Remedy, also weighed in to provide some support. <a href="https://x.com/RiotRMD/status/2016431155524809143?s=20">Puha wrote</a>: "Tired of seeing headlines of how many players Highguard has lost. Like, sure, you can argue that's putting facts out there, but I cant escape the feeling there's just this "celebration" of a game doing badly and just putting out negative headlines for the sake of it. Shouldn't us game devs even try?"</p>
<p>Then comes Michael Douse, director of publishing at Larian, who followed on from Puhu's statement with their own thoughts. "I remember standing on stage at DICE *trying* to see eye to eye with an executive audience who didn't - couldn't - figure out what they should be making, or even trying. It is funny in a way that the closer we all got to the audience, the further the industry got from understanding what it should be making. Caught in the crossfire of uncertainty are mistakes &amp; the faces behind them.</p>
<p>"But while they aren't the cause of the mistakes, they are in fact the reason for any successes. It is easy to celebrate failure because there's security in feeling right, but I hope everyone finds enough to cling onto to the break that cycle of cynicism. Game development runs on optimism in contrast with economics. If the optimism &amp; enthusiasm disappears at the same rate as the economics shrink, it's gonna get messy.</p>
<p>"Thankfully there are hyper engaged audiences and low-cost opportunities all over the place. It's just getting much harder to cut through the noise."</p>
<p>Where the line between fair criticism and dog-pilling lies is at the core of this ongoing debate surrounding Highguard, as well as a perceived culture of negativity surrounding the games industry. Do these developers have a point? Let us know what you think.</p>

            <p>As I type, Cairn protagonist Aava is squished awkwardly against a rock, hands twisted back into cracks, legs shoved into improbable spaces. I've been inching my way up this particular cliff face for some time; carefully scrutinising its contours and surveying the possible paths ahead in the desperate hope I'm not heading toward some insurmountable impasse. It's slow, stressful, and surprisingly exhausting. But I also know the moment I finally drag myself up onto the nearing precipice - when the craggy rock surface I've been staring at for the past half hour suddenly explodes out into another stunning vista and I can finally exhale - it'll all be worth it.</p>

<p>Plenty of games - from Resident Evil, with its steadily mounting anxiety, to the gut-gripping tension of Dark Souls - know the power of a well-placed pause. It's a chance for release and a reset before the cycle begins anew, and a space to inhabit with contrast - elation, triumph, relief - creating a richer emotional experience overall. But there's something about the way Cairn deploys its pauses, works them into its very soul, that's particularly tickling my brain. It helps, of course, that Cairn is beautiful; a seamless world of meticulously framed vistas and dizzyingly vertiginous drops, presented in an art style reminiscent of a Moebius comic strip. Here, aside from the occasional sprinkling of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X9y8foSPXg">gorgeous synthpop</a>, the only sounds are of nature; of wind sweeping across grassy plateaus and waters spilling to unseen depths, all as the blush of dawn slowly slides into a star-swirled night.</p>

<p>Amid it all is Aava, a professional climber who - for reasons you soon suspect might be a little more personal than 'because it's there' - is about to begin her ascent of the perilous Mount Kami. There's a wisp of story here, as the friends and lovers she's left back home call in from time to time (Cairn's beautifully naturalistic voice acting is a real boon), and there's a broader sense of intrigue as developer The Game Bakers (Furi, Haven) seeds the faintest sense of near-future calamity across its landscape and hints at something deadlier than the elements on Kami. And it combines to create an unusual hybrid of climbing, exploration, and survival.</p><p>Kami is vast; a seemingly endless wilderness of jagged rocks, buffeting winds, driving rain, and other natural forces you'll need to adapt to and overcome. The Game Bakers calls Cairn a "realistic climbing simulation" and, to a degree, that's fair. You'll scrutinise rock formations, identifying the routes most likely to support your balance and weight as you ascend each cliff face; you'll manage your stamina and gamble your limited pitons when the risk of falling feels too great. And as days turn to nights, you'll need to be diligent about maintaining your health, hunger, thirst, and warmth in order to survive the deleterious effects of the terrain.</p>



<p>You'll pick herbs and swig water from natural springs; you'll find supplies by raiding bear boxes and abandoned vending machines; you'll gather hints and terrain maps from occasional corpses; and whenever the opportunity to set up camp arises, you can save, cook, or rest until the weather turns more favourable again (and if all this is making you anxious, different difficulty options enable you to dial up or down the survival).</p><p>So far so sim-like, but Cairn's climbing - built around a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/qwop">QWOP</a>-like system of individual limb movement that frequently leaves Aava contorting impossibly; arms twisted, legs over ears, bum in the air - does rather undermine its sense of realism. And honestly, the jury's still out on Cairn's climbing as far as I'm concerned. Each new plateau presents a fresh rock face to parse, seeking out routes of varying difficulties, after which you can start your careful ascent, inching upward limb by limb. You'll place a hand securely into a crack, pull up a leg and jam it against a protrusion. That might give you enough reach to grasp a distant overhang, to shift your weight ready to start the cycle over again. This way, climbing becomes a series of small, interesting choices, driven by observation, intuition, and - occassionally - blind hope.</p>



<p>And when it works, there's an enormously satisfying rhythm to it all, as you scurry spider-like across each rock face, slowly building momentum. But often, too, Cairn feels like it's fighting against you, and the result can be frustrating. Chiefly that's down to its automatic limb selection, which chooses the limb you're able to move next based on factors including weight distribution. It's <em>supposed</em> to be helpful but frequently feels unintuitive and unpredictable in a way that can make forward planning difficult. There's a manual selection option, but it's slow and fussy, and the whole thing - particularly when tight paths cause Aava's limbs to be obscured by her body - can be infuriating in situations where rapid readjustment is required.</p><p>Quite often, I've found myself absolutely despising Cairn, exhausted by forces that seem resistant to control, but then the wilderness momentarily relents, bringing an enormous sense of reward. As you might imagine, all this makes for an intensely fraught climb, but somehow this works in a game about unwavering determination, about facing impossible odds on the path toward a seemingly insurmountable goal. And Cairn absolutely understands the healing power of a pause. As I make a final desperate scramble to the precipice above and pull myself onto solid ground once more, the frustration gives way to triumph, and all is forgiven - the red mist dissipating amid the gentle winds and endless beauty of Mount Kami. And soon I'm ready to start over, to continue my impossible ascent; leg over my head, bum in the air.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has shared an update on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was initially announced back in 2021</a>. In May of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, stating "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time". </p>
<p>Then, last year, Barone assured his fans that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">he is "committed to not working on Stardew Valley" until he's "done with Haunted Chocolatier"</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/haunted-chocolatier-will-have-a-larger-world-than-stardew-valley-creator-confirms">Barone revealed that "the world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley"</a>, but otherwise word on the anticipated release has been somewhat slim.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>That has changed now, though, thanks to a new <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">Haunted Chocolatier blog post</a>. Here, the solo developer said he had "been very productive lately", and Haunted Chocolatier is indeed alive and well. While he did admit it is "taking a while" to get everything finished, he said there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>"I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons," Barone wrote, before going to on "debunk a few myths and false assumptions" he had seen making the rounds.</p>
<p>First off, he assured everyone he will not be abandoning Haunted Chocolatier. He added even if he did decide to move on from his next game, he wouldn't be adding any unused content to Stardew Valley, as they "are separate games".</p><p>"It doesn't even make sense from a technical perspective, as Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it's not the same 'engine' as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley," he explained. He furthered that when he is working on Stardew Valley, he is "not thinking" about Haunted Chocolatier, and "vice versa". This means he would "wouldn't 'test something out' in Stardew Valley" for Haunted Chocolatier. </p>
<p>Speaking of Stardew Valley, he is also working on a new update with "additional ideas for how to improve it", so there is something else to look forward to.</p>
<p>Finally, Barone addressed Haunted Chocolatier's release date. We still don't have one, alas, but Barone doesn't sound too concerned about that really. "The bottom line is, I don’t want to give a release date," he explained.</p>
<p>"The game will come out when it's done."</p>

<p>Back in January last year, Barone revealed that, as of December 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>

            <p>Another veteran actor from the Fallout video game world has popped up in the latest Fallout TV episode on Amazon.</p>

<p>Season two of Fallout is starting to wrap up, with this series' penultimate episode airing yesterday. Again, we joined Lucy, Maximus, Hank, The Ghoul and more to find out what is going on with that powerful and coveted cold fusion tech (among other plot points, such as the bombshell Steph is not American, but Canadian - those vault dwellers were shook!).</p>
<p>But, back to cold fusion. During a flashback in episode seven, which is known as The Handoff, Cooper Howard is told he can meet with the President of the United States, and give the cold fusion technology to the most powerful man in the world. Howard trusts that the president will do the right thing, and so does indeed hand over the technology with not as much hesitation as I personally would have expected, but that is maybe a conversation for another day.</p><p>The reason we are here today is because of who played the US President in the Fallout TV show. And, it was none other than Clancy Brown, who voiced Rhombus, the head knight of the Lost Hills chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel in the original Fallout.</p>
<p>This is another nice little Easter egg from the Fallout TV show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-twos-latest-episode-has-a-super-easter-egg-cameo-for-fans">which last week also featured a familiar face from the games</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-moves-forward-last-two-episodes">second season of Fallout will conclude next week</a>, on 3rd February. There are still plenty of loose ends to tidy up, though I don't suspect we will get satisfying answers to many of them, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">what with series three on the cards</a> to mop up some unanswered questions.</p>
<p>The third season of Fallout is already being written, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming is expected to kick off this May</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has finally, after months of speculation, acknowledged its rumoured Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake. How has it done this, I hear you ask? Well, by sharing a meme from Grand Theft Auto, obviously.</p>

<p>The official Assassin's Creed social media account was responding to another post, which had shared images of a supposed Edward Kenway figurine releasing with Ubisoft's Black Flag Remake. "A guy on Vinted is selling a brand new Edward Kenway figurine and claims it’s releasing this year," this particular post read, with some accompanying images of the statue itself.</p>
<p>To this, Ubisoft replied with the classic meme from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</a>, showing the game's protagonist CJ walking off while muttering in exasperation:</p>
<p>"Ah sh*t, here we go again."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>via X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for the statue, its base shows logos for Ubisoft and PureArts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-leaks">this reported Black Flag remake statue</a> is just one of the many pieces of evidence we have that Ubisoft is gearing up to rerelease its piratical Assassin's Creed adventure.</p><p>In addition to this merchandise, we also have the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">rather suspicious reuploading of the Black Flag sea shanties on YouTube</a> (though, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">developer did try and pass this off as "technical issues"</a>). Then, back in August of last year, voice actor Matt Ryan - who portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">claimed legal action was brought against him by Ubisoft</a> after cheekily hinting at its existence at a convention. Oh, and we also have that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">PEGI listing for Black Flag Resynced which was spotted</a> in December.</p>
<p>At one point, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">speculated Ubisoft would release its Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake by this April</a>. However, earlier this month Ubisoft announced it had closed two studios and cancelled six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games</a>. One of these delayed games is believed to be the Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake.</p>

            <p>Comcept, the studio behind Mighty No.9, has shut down for good. This corporate dissolution was announced via Kanpo, the Japanese business newspaper-of-record earlier today.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2010 by Mega Man lead  Keiji Inafune, was eventually merged into Level 5 Comcept in 2017.</p>
<p>Years later in 2024, Level 5 Comcept was taken over entirely by Level 5 following Inafune's departure from the company, becoming part of Level 5's Osaka office. This final destruction of the Comcept brand today marks a true death for the ill-fated studio.</p>

<p>Despite its illustrious pedigree, Comcept was best known for the poorly-received Mighty No.9, which was funded via Kickstarter in 2013. Upon release, critics and fans alike had issues with its gameplay, narrative, technical performance, and lack of content among other things. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mighty-no-9-review">You can read Eurogamer's review of Mighty No.9</a> for a blast from the past.</p><p>This news does spit on the foolish hopes of those still betting on receiving their Mighty No.9 3DS copies, for some reason. This was a Kickstarter stretch goal that was reached, but never actually produced despite over $4m in funding. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1ht1lk7/the_dream_is_dead_preorders_of_mighty_no_9_for/">Pre-orders for 3DS copies of Mighty No.9 were canceled last year</a> so the chances of actually receiving this were close to nil. If you were praying for a miracle though, put your hands down.</p>
<p>Comcept wasn't all bad. As part of Level 5 Comcept, the studio created Recore, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/recore-review">which received middling reviews too</a>. Ah well, rest in piece Comcept.</p>

            <p>Keeley Hawes - known for the likes of Spooks, Bodyguard, Line of Duty, Ashes to Ashes and many, <em>many </em>more - has been spotted on the set of Amazon's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to her extensive film and television career, Hawes voiced Lara Croft for over a decade, with mainline entries Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as spin-offs Lara Croft: Guardian of the Light, Temple of Osiris and Reloaded, all featuring her crisp English accent and grunts of exertion.</p>

<p>Now, Hawes looks primed (pun intended) to star in Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider series, with many speculating she will play Lara's mother, Lady Amelia Croft. While at the time of writing nothing has been officially announced by Amazon, if this does prove to be the case it would be a rather charming little Easter egg for series fans.</p>
<p>In Hawes' Tomb Raider Underworld, Lara is searching for her mother, who following a plane crash many years prior was supposedly sent to Helhiem, an afterlife location in Norse mythology. Having her now play Lara's mother would feel rather like a touching passing of the torch.</p>
<p>As for how her character looks in the show, British tabloid <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/38027622/keeley-hawes-amazon-prime-lara-croft/">The Sun</a> took a photo of Hawes on the Tomb Raider set, where she was being flanked by two figures in dark clothing and masks (see below).</p>

<p>Other cast members confirmed for Amazon's Tomb Raider include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sophie-turners-lara-croft-is-so-unashamedly-capable-tomb-raider-actor-says">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas, Martin Bobb-Semple as Zip, Bill Paterson as Winston and Celia Imrie as Francine</a> (that is to say, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, who is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne").</p>
<p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner.</p>

            <p>Bloober team has teased something mysterious on a brand-new website, leading the horror-enthusiasts on the internet scratching their heads.</p>
<p>The website, <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">which you can see yourself here</a>, doesn't contain much. It has a countdown to Valentines Day, a jumbled URL, a rose that bleeds when you hover your mouse cursor over it, an audio reading of the William Blake Poem 'The Sick Rose', and the following words: "Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.”</p>
<p>This has spurred speculation in a variety of directions. First, following a common interpretation of William Blake poem and its commentary on the corruption of innocence and beauty. This, as well as Bloober's prior work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, has led some to believe this is a Silent Hill 1 Remake. The plot of that game, focusing on both Cheryl and the beauty of childbirth itself being corrupted / tarnished by the nasty Dahlia, could be applicable.</p>

</figure>
<p>Another theory is quite a simple one.<a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/2006515753176953244"> In a social media post</a> released by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> alongside this website, this phrase is written: "RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd". Taking the capital letters from that, you can spell the word Cronos, which some are taking as a hint that whatever will be announced in February will be a DLC for Bloober's latest game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, some have seen the rose and have immediately gone to Rule of Rose, the legendary and quite controversial horror game released back in 2006 was at the heart of a moral panic across Europe, and totally cancelled in the UK. Now, what governmental bodies assumed was an obscene experience was actually just a pretty okay horror game that has since grown to have a cult following.</p>
<p>Looking behind the curtain a bit, we know that Bloober Team is working on something dubbed "Project F" thanks to a business blog it posted last year. That's being created under the Broken Mirror Games brand, but aside from that we know sweet little about it. There's also Project M, also scheduled for a reveal some time this year.</p>
<p>So those are the three main theories: Silent Hill 1 Remake, Cronos DLC, and Rule of Rose Remake. It could, of course, be something totally different. Maybe a selection of spooky Valentines Day cards. Who knows. We'll have to wait until next month (or someone exceptionally smart) to learn the truth of it!</p>

            <p>
Another month means another batch of games for PlayStation Plus and, as we ready for the hopefully marginally warmer embrace of February, Sony has revealed what's coming next for all subscribers.
</p>
<p>
In total, PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium tier members get four games as part the service's usual monthly additions in February, and they'll all be available from Tuesday 3rd February until Monday 2nd March:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subnautica: Below Zero (PS5)</li>
<li>Undisputed (PS5)</li>
<li>Ultros (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown (PS4)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's a pretty good selection, then! Survival fans can brave the chilly depths and frozen wastes of planet 4546B in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a>, and there's boxing to be done in Undisputed. Ultros, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ultros-review">wonderfully trippy, time-looping sci-fi Metroidvania</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> should tickle the aeronautical fancy of wannabe pilots.
</p><p>
Of course, new PlayStation Plus monthly additions also means departures, and subscribers have until Monday 2nd February to add <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-january">January's titles</a> to their libraries. These, if you don't already know, are Need For Speed Unbound, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, and Core Keeper.

            <p>AdHoc's brilliant superhero workplace comedy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, is gearing up for its debut on Switch later today, however there will be some censorship differences on Nintendo's consoles.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Dispatch includes a number of instances where players can see human (or, well, super-human) anatomy such as penises and breasts throughout its various chapters. Meanwhile, there are certain noises that suggest sexual pleasure. </p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In other versions of the game as it appears on other platforms, there is an option for players to have toggle censorship of this content on or off, however on the Switch version of the title, players will not have that same choice: explicit content censorship is implemented as standard, and the option has been removed from the game.</p>
<p>"Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually," AdHoc said in a statement shared with Eurogamer, ahead of Dispatch's Switch release. The studio assured, though, that the censorship on Nintendo's consoles does not affect Dispatch's overall narrative experience or gameplay.</p>
<p>"We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release," the developer stated. </p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Soon after its initial release last year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie recently sat down with AdHoc studio co-founders Nick Herman and Pierre Shorette to discuss the team's episodic superhero comedy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">which includes the story of a cut Dispatch Kpop character</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game</a> is a beat-em-up we've repeatedly gone back to over the years, always wishing there was a bit more meat and fluidity to it. Thankfully, developer (and publisher) Tribute Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/15-years-later-scott-pilgrim-ex-proves-that-torontos-most-problematic-bass-player-has-what-it-takes-to-become-beat-em-up-royalty-in-2025">seem to be delivering exactly that with Scott Pilgrim EX</a>.</p>
<p>Following the release in late 2025 of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>, the experienced, retro-inspired <a href="https://tributegames.com/">developer</a> will be dropping this follow-up of sorts to the 2010 classic on 3rd March, 2026. To celebrate the announcement, an all-new, stylish trailer has been shared, and it comes with two more additions to the character roster:</p> <figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Scott Pilgrim EX - Out March 3rd, 2026 - Matthew Patel and Robot-01 Join the Lineup!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV1izGXgJFQ?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iV1izGXgJFQ?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iV1izGXgJFQ?autoplay=1" title="Scott Pilgrim EX - Out March 3rd, 2026 - Matthew Patel and Robot-01 Join the Lineup!">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV1izGXgJFQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>League of Evil Exes' Matthew Patel and Robot-01, a creation of the Katayanagi Twins, are joining the fight. The former mixes fire and "ritualistic showmanship" as seen in other Scott Pilgrim stories while summoning his "demon hipsters" before going for a grand finale with burning finishing moves. As for the robotic addition, it can fly and deliver precise blows with melee attacks and long-range weapons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/scott-pilgrim-ex">Scott Pilgrim EX</a> isn't a direct sequel to previous Scott Pilgrim stories, or at least that's what creator Bryan Lee O'Malley <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ScottPilgrim/comments/1lbjf5n/scott_pilgrim_ex_is_not_a_direct_sequel_to_any/">said last year</a> when asked by confused fans. Regardless, we're betting having previous knowledge of the property helps, as the new adventure starts when the members of the Sex Bob-omb band are kidnapped "as the city (of Toronto) is terrorized by demons, vegans, and robots." Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers, plus five allies, lead the effort to save the musicians and the city, with "one final ally" being revealed ahead of launch. Place your bets now.</p>
<p>While physical editions have been teased to come soon, Scott Pilgrim EX will welcome fighters with a digital version only on 3rd March. It'll be hitting PC (Steam), PS4/5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Many fans rushed to scream Leon S. Kennedy had aged like fine wine when he showed up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">December 2025 trailer</a>. That's a sentiment most of us can agree with, and it appears we also have to thank Capcom's female developers for their attention to detail.</p>
<p>At least that's what Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi revealed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">during a chat with Automaton</a>: "We've spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon's visuals. Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck."</p>
<p>With Requiem's story being set around 20 years after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4</a>, Leon is now comfortably sporting an authentic dad/uncle look that makes him a true veteran who's seen too many horrors for a single lifetime. Regardless, he's back for more action alongside Grace Ashcroft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">with the latter favouring a tenser survival horror gameplay loop</a>.</p>
<p>Leon's design wasn't locked early on, either. Nakanishi revealed it actually changed over the course of making the game: "Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone's heart throb." It sure sounds like they were thinking about the thirstiest fans during the entire process.</p><p>The employees' suggestions went beyond Leon's look as well, with Nakanishi also stating "every staff member had their own interpretation of Leon’s 30-year-long history." Considering Resident Evil's storied journey over so many entries, it comes as no surprise developers that have also grown up with the series had heated feedback for the top creatives. "After many discussions, we were able to settle on something that clicked for us. When players see this Leon in the game, hopefully they will be able to find their own interpretation of him as well," the director added.</p>
<p>Fans won't have to wait long now to spend as much time as they want with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiems-director-on-why-re9-wont-suffer-the-same-multi-protagonist-woes-as-re6-and-why-its-more-like-sushi">Leon and Grace</a>; Resident Evil Requiem will infect PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-wanted-mouse-support-in-resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-but-it-confused-the-gameplay">even Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 27th February, 2026.</p>

            <p>Embark Studios has confirmed that both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and the Finals have been hit by DDoS attacks, claiming they were both "extensive" and "co-ordinated".</p>
<p>These problems first started in the early hours of the morning, with reports of mass instability impacting both games. While initially some stability was brought back to the servers, this soon deteriorated again as the DDos attacks continued.</p>
<p>In an update posted on the official Arc Raiders Discord server a few hours ago, community manager Ossen wrote: "Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing."</p>

</figure>
<p>This effort to resolve the connectivity problems coincided with work on a hotfix targeting unintended changes with the recent major update, which altered the fire rate of some weapons, led to some earned cosmetics going missing, and more.</p>
<p>In the last hour, Ossen updated Arc Raiders players on the DDos issue, stating: "We are noticing that servers are recovering." Whether the DDoS attacks have concluded, or Embark has resolved the issue entirely, remains unclear.</p>
<p>This attack comes only a day following<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you"> the release of a new solo vs squad game mode, as well as a Bird City map condition</a>. It's worth noting that even with this ongoing DDoS attack, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">SteamDB still tracks well over 100,000 players still in-game</a>.</p>

            <p>The games industry is in a very weird place right now due to both internal and external factors. Perhaps the most pressing one is the <a href="https://za.ign.com/steam-machine/223581/video/how-ram-shortages-are-making-tech-more-expensive-boring-ces-2026">rising cost of key hardware components</a> due to AI and data centre speculation. Therefore, next-gen hardware delays could be on the table as Sony and Microsoft look to maximize PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, respectively, while waiting markets to settle.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/high-likelihood-ps6-will-launch-after-2028-according-to-new-analyst-forecast-as-sony-focuses-on-extending-ps5-lifecycle">IGN</a>, we're now hearing from David Gibson, senior analyst at MST, who focuses on tech and gaming companies. He published a <a href="https://www.sandstoneinsightsjapan.com/post/sony-group-6758%EF%BC%89%EF%BC%8D%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0%E9%83%A8%E9%96%80%E3%81%AE%E5%A5%BD%E8%AA%BF%E3%81%8C%E7%AC%AC3%E5%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E6%9C%9F%E3%82%92%E7%89%BD%E5%BC%95%E3%80%81%E4%BB%8A%E5%BE%8C%E3%81%95%E3%82%89%E3%81%AA%E3%82%8B%E4%B8%8A%E6%98%87%E4%BD%99%E5%9C%B0%E3%81%82%E3%82%8A">report for Sandstone Insights Japan</a> on 16th of this month that commented on Sony's recent financial performance and what might be next for the tech giant.</p>
<p>The good news (for Sony) is that earnings for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending February 2026 are expected to exceed previous forecasts. First- and third-party games continue to drive growth, and it appears PSN subscriptions remain strong, too. Per IGN's report, "Q3 sales are predicted to total around 1.8 trillion yen (approx. $11.6 billion), with operating income at 160 billion yen (approx. $1 billion)."</p>
<p>Good numbers around PS5 hardware and software only makes the case for a delay of PS6 even more convincing. "Sony expects the PS5 lifecycle to be longer than that of previous console generations," Gibson stated, before adding it's likely the PS6's launch won't occur until after 2028. Industry figures <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/gaming-industry/a-ps6-launch-in-2028-feels-right-according-to-former-playstation-boss-citing-increasingly-long-console-generations">had been predicting a 2028 release</a> last year. This would already make the PS5 generation longer than PS4's seven-year exclusive run (though the hardware is still being supported). If a market-induced does occur, PS5 will spend even more time being Sony's top-dog console.</p><p>Recent moves by the company suggest that might indeed be the case, with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-cheaper-japanese-language-only-ps5-just-for-japan">Japan-only, cheaper PS5 model launching last November</a> and deep discounts happening globally for Black Friday 2025. Via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/sonys-sending-messages-to-ps4-players-encouraging-them-to-upgrade-to-ps5">Push Square</a>, we're also seeing reports of PS4 users being targeted by Sony with aimed messages that encourage making the jump to PS5.</p>
<p>Gibson, however, also thinks Sony is now focusing on retaining existing PS5 users over boosting console sales (even if those <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466830/ps5-best-seller-as-sales-remain-flat-yoy-europe-hardware-estimates-for-december-2025/">remain strong</a>). At the time of writing, price hikes haven't been announced in answer to memory shortage woes, but the analyst admits "Sony might pass future cost increases onto consumers" even if there's no short-term danger. This would line up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-the-switch-2-getting-more-expensive-soon-nintendo-says-theres-no-immediate-impact-but-will-keep-an-eye-on-volatile-memory-market">Nintendo's current stance</a> on the matter. Therefore, solid growth well into 2026 is likely for Sony and Nintendo. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/in-not-remotely-shocking-news-xbox-has-reportedly-suffered-its-worst-year-on-record-for-console-sales">Xbox sales in 2025 were lackluster</a>, so there are doubts around Microsoft's consoles' performance moving forward.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> has just received a massive new update called The Toxic Tangle, which is adding a new Garden biome, new enemies, and a rideable ladybug with a gun mounted on it. Obviously!</p>
<p>The Toxic Tangle update is the first major update to the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-is-celebrating-its-release-with-a-chance-to-win-a-10-foot-fluffy-ant-you-can-use-to-frighten-a-child">since its Early Access release back in 2025</a>. The Garden, overgrown with vines and towering structures, is a messy new addition that players are now able to explore. It's also littered with new enemies and resources to collect, so you'll need to keep an eye out as you venture between the pumpkins.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will also let people ride a new Ladybug Buddy, which should help you navigate through this new landscape. It's packing a mounted water cannon on its back which you can use to fend off all manner of creepy crawlies, and is itself a tough creature to take down.</p>

<p><a href="https://grounded2.obsidian.net/news/update-0-3">The official blog post announcing the update</a> has also teased the return of both the Masked Stranger and the Snake Colossus, which you'll have to track down with an updated mutation system allowing you to further customise your ability to build or fight in Grounded 2.</p>
<p>The team at Obsidian also stated it's working on Playgrounds mode, a fan-favourite from the original game.</p>
<p>If you've not played Grounded 2, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-early-access-review">Eurogamer's review of its Early Access release</a>. In it, Robert Purchase wrote: "The ant-sized thrills of Grounded return in a sequel which lays exciting foundations for the future. There's work to do but, already, an exciting adventure to have.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A lot has transpired during this first month of 2026, but Ubisoft can't escape the news cycle with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">layoffs, studio closures, project cancellations</a> (including the long-in-development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-actor-reacts-to-cancellation">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">countless hints</a> the still-unannounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake is coming sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>A new week, a new leak or finding on Edward Kenway's return being a real, impending thing. Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-an-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-just-leaked-via-vinted">IGN</a>, we've learned an all-new statue of the iconic pirate-turned-assassin was spotted on 27th January. While the figure itself doesn't say anything about it pertaining to the Resynced remake we've been hearing about for months now, it joins other promotional materials and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/es-es/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/28oWzWFPvQgskv6cgLGBMG/the-division-2-x-assassins-creed-collaboration">big collaborations</a> that are highlighting Kenway in recent times.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>⚠️ LEAK BLACK FLAG REMAKE ?</p><p>Un gars sur Vinted vend une toute nouvelle figurine de Edward Kenway et prétend qu'elle sortirait cette année. </p><p>En sachant que le remake de Black Flag était censé sortir dans moins de 2 mois, serait-ce la figurine officielle du jeu ? <a href="https://t.co/ctVWiavA6c">pic.twitter.com/ctVWiavA6c</a></p></div>— j0nathan (@xj0nathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The statue itself is pretty cool, with Kenway sitting on a treasure chest full of gold coins and leaning back against a ship's wheel, pistol and iconic cutlass in each hand. The titular Black Flag is also present, with both the traditional pirate skull and the Assassin's Creed sigil that so many longtime fans love mixed together.</p>
<p>The figure's origins are unknown, and its appearance is a bit baffling; it popped up via the clothing resale app Vinted. Leakers like <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan">j0nathan</a> are sure this isn't a previously released statue, and the listing states the 35cm-tall statue won't be officially out until later in 2026. IGN's report states "a detailed close-up of the statue's base shows logos for Ubisoft and PureArts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026."</p><p>This would line up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">PureArts' teases last summer</a> that "something" was happening with Black Flag in the near future. At this point, and following so many hints across very different brands and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">even Ubisoft drumming up excitement</a> for the fourth mainline Assassin's Creed, it's mostly safe to theorize a release was maybe planned for early 2026 before the delays and reorganization that were announced last week.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake now out of the picture and Ubisoft going more selective with its output moving forward, more expectations are being placed on this next major Assassin's Creed release, so let's hope it's all smooth sailing once Kenway and his crew go out into the seas again.</p>

            <p>It's no secret <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' optimisation, especially in its PC version, has been a bit cheeks even if updates have slowly tried to bite through its many technical issues. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">has been good fun</a> otherwise, but even at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/monster-hunter-wilds-sells-11-million-in-just-under-a-year-but-may-lack-worlds-momentum">11m copies sold</a>, its momentum slowed quite a bit following a huge launch.</p>
<p>January is now almost over and the game's first anniversary is near. True to its word, the Monster Hunter developer has now deployed a Steam-exclusive patch which marks the second chapter in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-finally-gets-pc-optimisation-roadmap-to-coincide-with-title-update-4-but-players-still-arent-really-happy">performance improvements roadmap</a> set in late 2025 by Capcom.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?l=english">patch notes</a> for Ver.1.040.03.01 were shared on 28th January alongside the big update, which also targets the <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained">unintended FPS drops in the Base Camp and Grand Hub</a> oddly tied to unclaimed content <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">discovered by a Reddit user</a> a couple of weeks ago. "To further improve stability and performance across all platforms, additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.041 update on February 18," the post added.</p>
<p>The major additions and changes target the CPU/GPU load, with shader processes outside the initial one now reduced to lower CPU load during normal play, improved streaming of textures to reduce VRAM usage, and a reworked High Resolution Texture Pack (optional download) which uses less VRAM and takes up less space.</p><p>Players will now also find a chunky CPU tab if they go to the crowded Options menu, with extra non-graphical settings tied to CPU load now available; these include frame skips and limited numbers of smaller creatures, among other things. They might not make much of a difference for beefy builds, but those with slower CPUs could claw some performance back.</p>

<p>Graphic settings have also gained a few new categories and extra quality levels. Moreover, the typically heavy Volumetric Fog setting has received three lower options and renamed its "High" setting to "Highest" in case you don't need top-notch fog rendering.</p>
<p>In my own post-patch experience, performance has seen improvements across the board even if RE Engine's limitations when it comes to open levels (something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> also suffered from) are still there. Two particularly taxing locations, the main camp located at the Windward Plains and the more watery Scarlet Forest area, have seen a welcome bump of up to 20 FPS on average. Mind you, my PC rig isn't a low-tier one, but without using the Frame Generation option (on top of DLSS), those zones usually were sub-60 FPS. Now they're well above that mark and much higher with the FG x2 boost enabled. Overall, the game seems more stable and less stuttery to boot.</p><p>On the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/">Steam forums</a>, the early sentiment is positive so far, with players reporting FPS gains and a less hiccup-y experience overall. A few users are even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/729154531022090103/">pushing for more positive reviews</a> following the update (the game currently sits at Mixed), but it'll take a while before the community's thoughts coalesce. On the other hand, some veterans are remaining unimpressed by the tweaks.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this is just the second phase of Capcom's ongoing efforts to improve the game's health ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">rumoured Switch 2 port</a> and a potential large expansion which adds to the game's free endgame content updates, which appear to be done now. Hunters on consoles needn't download this PC-only patch.</p>

            <p>Eman Ayaz, the actor believed to be playing Farah in the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, has said she found out - like the rest of us - that the project had been cancelled online.</p>
<p>"Last week I experienced the most devastating moment of my career," <a href="https://x.com/emanayazz/status/2015623611680210980">Eman Ayaz said in a video shared on X</a>. Her brother messaged her asking if she was okay, which prompted a puzzled response, so he sent her a link to the news and then she realised what was going on. "And that's where I read it has been shelved forever," Ayaz said. "I was just in total shock."</p>

<p>Ayaz, 26 years old, does not name the project she was involved in, for NDA reasons. Nor does she mention Ubisoft or Prince of Persia or Sands of Time. But the timelines match up - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced it was cancelling the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake last week</a> - and Ayaz has allegedly retweeted Prince of Persia content on her X account before, though I can't find these tweets - perhaps they have been deleted. That's what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qnj46j/after_prince_of_persia_sands_of_time_remake/">people on Reddit seem to suggest</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We were all really looking forward to it being released this year"</em></blockquote>
<p>In her video, Ayaz said this project was "life-changing" for her, because there aren't many big roles for Canadian Pakistanis, who tend to be "unplaceable" from a casting point of view. She said she landed the job three years ago after a "rigorous" audition process and was planning to use its release to springboard a move to the US. This was her stepping-stone moment but now it's not to be.</p>
<p>"I have dedicated the last three years of my life to this project," Ayaz said; she even went as far as acting with a broken foot, apparently. "And I've waited and waited for the day it was finally going to be released and I could finally talk about it." She filmed marketing material recently, she said, within the past couple of months. "We were all really looking forward to it being released this year, so it felt like emotional whiplash to find this out in such a random way."</p>

<p>Because the project has been cancelled, Ayaz can't apparently publicly attach her name to it. "It's just as if it never existed," she said, "which is a hard thing to wrap your head around when it's been your life for so long. This project existed, even if the world never got to see it."</p><p>Ubisoft announced the Sands of Time remake cancellation last week as part of major restructuring at the company, closing two studios, cancelling six projects, and delaying several other games. The Sands of Time remake was the only cancelled game named, and the blanket reason given for the cancellations was the games "do not meet the new enhanced quality [and] more selective portfolio prioritisation criteria". The Sands of Time project had been struggling for a while, however, having been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">announced in 2020</a> and suffering multiple delays since then.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years">restructuring knocked a third off of Ubisoft's share price</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-worker-unions-reportedly-vote-to-strike-as-publisher-proposes-200-voluntary-redundancies">strikes are expected in France, where Ubisoft is headquartered</a>, in response to a voluntary redundancy initiative.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> has never been short on explosive tools of destruction, but the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/27/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-premium-warbond-drops-february-3/">Siege Breakers update</a>, new warbond included, aims to take things to the next level. Moreover, a terrifying old threat from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-review">first Helldivers</a> could be back soon.</p>
<p>Via the official PlayStation Blog (as shared above) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/509603414731131980?l=english">Steam</a>, PlayStation and Arrowhead Studios have announced the full scope of this next content update set to arrive on 3rd February. As always, it's partially defined by a new premium warbond packed with new weapons and cosmetics. This pass can be obtained with Super Credits which you either buy or slowly amass by completing certain objectives in the game.</p>
<p>The SA-7 Headfirst and SA-8 RAM armour sets are prominently featured in the trailer, which you can watch below, but it's the new primary weapon and the three new stratagems which steal the show.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9E9-iGwK_4">
</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9E9-iGwK_4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>The "shotgun-like" LAS-16 Trident makes a return with six beams now blasting the enemies of Super Earth apart. On the stratagem front, the CQC-20 Breaching Hammer will no doubt become a new favourite, as it can just smash the old-fashioned way or go big and loud with an explosive charge that makes me fear for my fellow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a>' lives.</p><p>Heavy weapons also get a boost through the GL-28 Grenade Launcher and EAT-411 Leveller stratagems. The former is self-explanatory and can fire a "non-stop" barrage of nades, but the latter is a next-level rocket launcher with a high-yield missile. Defence isn't being left behind either, as the throwable G/SH-39 Shield generates a shield that deflects heavy projectiles while you do your thing or catch your breath.</p>

</figure>
<p>"Emotes, patterns, and more" are part of the new warbond as well, but it's the trailer's final seconds that unnerve us, as a new massive threat might be on the horizon: Helldivers 1's cyborgs. Whether they'll be treated as a totally separate faction or as part of the Automaton horde remains to be seen, but most veterans on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/">Helldivers subreddit</a> seem to agree on what's coming next for Super Earth's forces.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-reduced-installation-size">heavily reducing the game's install size</a> following substantial player complaints, it appears that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-just-learned-there-is-a-helldivers-2-rogue-lite-mode-prototype-at-arrowhead-and-now-i-really-want-to-try-it-out">development of new content</a> is once again full steam ahead. Moreover, the live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Helldivers movie</a> is gaining momentum fast.</p>

            <p>
The Competition Appeal Tribunal has ruled a £656m market rigging lawsuit filed against Valve by digital rights campaigners can proceed, meaning 14m Steam users in the UK could receive compensation.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit was originally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-being-sued-for-656m-in-uk-amid-accusations-of-market-rigging-through-steam">filed by digital rights activist Vicki Shotbolt in June 2024</a>, accusing Valve of rigging the PC games market and deliberately "shutting out" competition through Steam. Shotbolt had argued Valve imposed price parity clauses on publishers and developers, preventing them from selling titles at cheaper prices on rival platforms - limiting consumer choice and harming competition in turn.
</p>
<p>
Shotbolt's suit further alleged Valve's decision to prohibit consumers from purchasing DLC for their Steam games on rival platforms also restricted market competition, which, when combined with an "excessive commission of up to 30 percent" caused "inflated prices on its Steam". As such, it asserted UK consumers are paying too much for purchasing PC games and DLC.
</p>
<p>
In response, Valve had argued the case should not be certified to proceed toward a trial, but (as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">per the BBC</a>) the Competition Appeal Tribunal has now ruled otherwise. "A hearing to consider the PCR's application for a collective proceedings order ("CPO") took place on 14 October 2025," a notice in the tribunal's website explained. "On 26 January 2026, the Tribunal issued its judgment granting the CPO application ([2026] CAT 4)." Eurogamer has approached Valve for comment on the ruling.
</p><p>
Shotbolt's lawsuit is being handled by legal firm Milberg London LLP, which specialises in group action cases against large companies (the firm was also behind a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">2022 filing against Sony</a>, which was similarly accused of abusing its market power). The collective action claim argues 14m people in the UK have been overcharged for PC games as a result of Valve's actions, and is seeking compensation of between £22 and £44 for each one.

            <p>Embark Studios has announced a new game mode for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> that should prove exciting for those of you out there who are a little <em>too</em> good at the extraction shooter.</p>
<p>Solo vs Squads allows bold raiders to queue up on their lonesome against full squads of three players. You have to be at least raider level 40 to do so, but the XP rewards for venturing into such a perilous playlist is a 20 percent XP boost at the end of the round.</p>
<p>In addition, a new project is coming to the game. The trophy display pushes players to hunt down progressively tougher groups of Arc to progress, and will be able to build increasingly fancy trophy cases to mark their progress.</p>

<p>There are also seven new quests, two new types of epic augments, and the Bird City map condition on Buried City. This condition will add more bird traps and ziplines to the map, as well as treasures hidden inside searchable chimneys.</p><p>This January update marks the first milestone established in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shares-early-2026-roadmap-escalation-content-updates">the early 2026 roadmap released yesterday by Embark</a>. In February, we're set to get heaps of new stuff too, including the next expedition window, a new Arc threat, a new Raider Deck, and more. So it's safe to say that Arc Raiders is keeping up the update momentum <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">following its successful holiday period over December</a>.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders review</a>! In it, Rick Lane writes: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>

            <p>One of 2025's strangest announcements from Nintendo was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-nintendo-classics-announced-for-switch-1-and-2-at-nintendo-direct">the return of the Virtual Boy</a>, a hardware (and software) failure that's been reappraised over the years. Many gamers have a soft spot for it, however, so its inclusion in Nintendo Switch Online's offerings probably was an easy decision to make as the video game giant looked to spice the subscription up. Now we have access to the full roster of games available at launch and teases of more to come.</p>
<p>Via the Nintendo Today app and later YouTube (watch the video below), Nintendo released a new trailer that runs for almost four minutes and details the games coming on 17th February, other classics arriving at a later date, and even two previously unreleased titles.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVvaCe4esCQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>Teleroboxer, Galactic Pinball, RED ALARM, GOLF, Virtual Boy Wario Land, 3-D TETRIS, and The Mansion of Innsmouth lead the red charge next month, with Mario Clash, Mario's Tennis, Jack Bros, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/space-invaders">Space Invaders</a> Virtual Collection, Virtual Bowling, Vertical Force, and V-Tetris coming later. Features like different rendering colours besides red, customisable controls, and rewind are part of the rollout plans too.</p><p>The two previously unreleased games are Zero Racers, a cancelled 3D F-Zero instalment originally meant to launch in 1996, and D-Hopper (originally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Hopper">Dragon Hopper</a>), a top-down action-adventure game that was completed but also shelved in 1996 due to Virtual Boy's commercial failure.</p>
<p>Though many have expressed disdain for Nintendo's second attempt at making the Virtual Boy happen, it appears nostalgia might make this whole endeavour a success. In any case, it's refreshing to see a major publisher actually make an effort to preserve old games which weren't financially successful.</p>
<p>If you want to check these out for yourself, you'll need, on top of a Nintendo Switch system (it doesn't matter which), a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Virtual-Boy-Nintendo-Classics-2915432.html?srsltid=AfmBOorpQ1V1e0QdEiTVPr1ZOHHD7khSuB-iyn2aiwPvKp8Q0oDEtMFX">plus one of the two accessories</a> set to launch on 17th February: the Virtual Boy replica or the cheaper cardboard model, both of which work alongside the hybrid consoles to create the original 3D effects. At the time of writing, there are no plans to make these re-releases available in 2D.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a> will be four years old later this year, and despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-end-of-splatoon-3-regular-updates">Nintendo ending regular update plans</a> in late 2024 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-raiders-announced-for-switch-2-plus-a-chonky-splatoon-3-update-incoming">Splatoon Raiders</a> being deep into development, we're still getting new content and gameplay patches.</p>
<p>Last summer's 10.0.0 update enhanced the game with new weapon kits, an extra map, and plenty of tweaks and smaller additions. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> owners got a resolution increase and rock-solid framerates. Ahead of Raiders, it felt like the perfect farewell to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and a way to solidify its continued online domination on Switch consoles until a fourth game hits, as it sounds like the spinoff's priorities are PvE-oriented.</p>
<p>Today, 27th January, we've been surprised by yet another major patch coming to Splatoon 3 as soon as this week. The meta-shaking <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html">11.0.0 update</a> drops on 29th January, so plan your weekend accordingly.</p>
<p>The "meta-shaking" bit isn't a joke or an exaggeration. While it doesn't add new content to the jumbo-sized threequel, it changes and expands the gameplay significantly with tweaks and even an all-new mechanic: Flow Aura.</p>
<p>"Inklings and Octolings who splat multiple opponents in quick succession will enter a new state called Flow Aura," the official post explains. This multi-frag boost of sorts goes on for longer than 30 seconds if you splat more opponents and/or assist teammates. During this period, ink bursts around the player and speed, resistance, and "intensify actions" receive enhancements. This will no doubt encourage more aggressive play styles across the board, perhaps in an attempt by the devs to minimize the impact of campers and cheap opportunist strategies, further pushing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> into the classical "arena shooter" space.</p><p>A notable change has hit the Stealth Jump gear ability, which "allows players to jump to their teammates without the opposing team necessarily seeing where they will land." It's having its massive attack potential offset, as the developers have increased the flight time for this type of respawn jump.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Last but not least, health bars will now be shown above damaged players, but not when they're behind cover or diving into ink. While this has been a common bit of most online team-based shooters for years, Splatoon only indicated the damage sustained by other players with the amount of ink covering them. Coupled with smaller hit boxes for Inklings and Octolings when in "swim form" (as well as adjustments to weapons' own hit boxes), combat encounters might change in a big way come Thursday. Getting behind cover and swimming away from danger will be more important than ever before.</p>

More updates for Splatoon 3 might also arrive in the near future, since a native Switch 2 version with further improvements <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">may be arriving soon</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has had a remarkably strong early access start, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-boss-calls-early-release-the-most-challenging-but-rewarding-experience">despite a number of development hiccups</a> and it broadly not being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">that different to genre-leader Minecraft</a>, so it comes as no surprise modders are already hard at work on all sorts of additions and tweaks.</p>
<p>Last week, we were blown away by one modder who managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-modder-puts-minecraft-and-doom-inside-the-world-map">get Minecraft running inside Hytale's world map</a>. Now, we've come across another young developer who might have cracked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-style storms inside the new blocky sensation. User <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper">dattadeveloper</a> shared his creation via X/Twitter on 26th January:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Alongside the announcement, he also shared a link to <a href="https://builtbybit.com/resources/worldborder-api-included.91496/">download</a> his WorldBorder mod with an API. It's standalone and can be easily thrown into other projects. Border colours are fully customisable and it includes "multiple border shapes" as well as plenty of options to adjust it to each modder or player's needs. For something that's just come out, it's a very notable effort already.</p>
<p>The modder later shared <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper/status/2016014515716989014?s=20">other video examples</a> of WorldBorder in action and its possibilities. It's all impressive, and dattadeveloper appears to be ready to open the floodgates and start collaborating with other modders and event organisers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> veterans may remember how battle royale modes inspired by The Hunger Games popped off more than a decade ago, so we're getting a strong sensation of déjà vu here as Hytale positions itself as the minimal refresh the subgenre needed. Still, it'll take much more to dethrone Xbox and Mojang's behemoth, so we're curious to see how everything unfolds over the course of 2026.</p><p>For now, dattadeveloper <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper/status/2016014522025132531?s=20">is already experimenting</a> with his own take on Hunger Games-like modes, so it's just a matter of time before large community efforts around such competitive game modes begin to take shape thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-hytale-mods">Hytale mods</a> like this one.</p>

            <p>Red Hook Studios has announced that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> board game, which was being manufactured and shipped out by Mythic Games, can no longer be produced. This leaves those without their orders out of luck.</p>
<p>On the Darkest Dungeon social media account, the development team provided a lengthy apologetic statement to fans, explaining the situation and writing that Mythic Game's inability to produce these products as "disappointing".</p>
<p>The full statement reads: "As many of you know, the financial situation at Mythic Games has been strained for the past several years. We have been keeping an eye on the situation, hoping for the best. Unfortunately, at this point, Mythic Games is no longer able to manufacture or deliver the Darkest Dungeon board game.</p>

<p>"We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the Darkest Dungeon name. We won't mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many Darkest Dungeon fans.</p><p>"Recently, we were contacted by an ex-Mythic employee who asked for our blessing to distribute the project files to all backers. While we at Red Hook don't own or control the board game files themselves, we were happy to give our permission for our copyrighted material within those files to be distributed to backers for non-commercial use.</p>
<p>"All backers should have now received an email from the board game campaign which outlines the situation. This email also contains a link to all game files, including files of the rules, 3D models and more, for you to download.</p>
<p>"We understand that nothing can replace the experience of receiving the full boardgame. Unfortunately, Red Hook has neither the board game manufacturing expertise nor have we had the ability to divert funds of the scale required to remove whatever obstacles Mythic has faced without endangering our own operations.</p>
<p>"We only hope that this final gesture can be a silver lining in an otherwise disappointing situation. NOTE: If you are a backer, and are having trouble finding this email, please search your inbox and spam folders for a message from the following address: darkestdungeonrescuefiles@gmail.com"</p><p>The Darkest Dungeon board game, which was a Kickstarter campaign launched in October 2021, attracted 28,842 backers and a total of $5,657,479. However, Mythic Games underwent significant financial turmoil in recent years, eventually <a href="https://www.lbr.lu/mjrcs-web-front/consult-company/B200926">was condemned to compulsory liquidation in late 2025</a>. The Darkest Dungeon board game wasn't the only product impacted by this, with similar problems hitting the Anastyr and Monsterpocalypse board games.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><strong>Update: 14:15pm GMT, 28th January</strong>: </p><p>The Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo (Video Game Worker's Union) has called for an employee strike in February, confirming previous reports.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stjv.fr/post/3mdiakqixmj2m">It has published a statement announcing the strikes officialy</a>, alongside the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>"As we now learn of management’s decisions through the press, Mr Guillemot slips within a long, placatory email on the group’s reorganisation that he intends to turn back on remote work - mere months after agreements on the topic went in effect!
</p>
<p>With management being stubbornly entrenched in its authoritarian ways, we are calling Ubisoft employees across France to join this strike, along with the 5 unions present within the company.
</p>
<p>We’re calling for a HALT to management’s obsession with penny-pinching and worsening our working conditions. It’s time for a real « accountability » from company executives, starting from the top!
</p>
<p>Without the workers, and generous public funding, Ubisoft would never have been able to grow this much. WE are Ubisoft, and WE are shutting it down February 10th to 12th!
</p></blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Original article: 11:53am GMT, 27th January</strong>: French unions representing workers at Ubisoft have reportedly voted unanimously in favour of strike action following the company's recent dramatic "reset" and in response to a voluntary redundancy proposal that could see as many as 200 Paris HQ employees lose their jobs.
</p><p>
Last week, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">announced</a> a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", resulting in the cancellation of six games - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">troubled Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> - as well as delays for seven other titles, the closure of its Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, and a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Ubisoft is proposing a voluntary round of redundancies as it seeks to further reduce operating costs. The move - which is being organised under the voluntary Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process, wherein employees can collectively negotiate the mutually agreed termination of a permanent contract - could result in as many as 200 jobs cut at Ubisoft's Paris headquarters. That's reportedly around 18 percent of the company's Paris HQ workforce, said to number approximately 1100 employees in total.
</p>
<p>
"In line with last week's announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives," a Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">confirmed in a statement provided to IGN</a>, "Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France."
</p>
<p>
"At this stage, this remains a proposal, and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached with employee representatives and validated by French authorities," the spokesperson continued. "The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."
</p><p>
In response to the companys's voluntary redundancy proposal, as per French financial publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033">Les Echos</a>, unions representing Ubisoft workers - specifically, Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses du jeu vidéo (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, la CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps écologique - have unanimously agreed to strike. The strike is due to run from 10th-12th February, and will reportedly see unions coordinating with their international counterparts in a bid to expand the scope of the action.
</p>
<p>
Following word of Ubisoft's latest "reset", the company's share price <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years">plummeted 34 percent</a>, resulting in its lowest share price in 15 years.

<p>Players were hoping for meatier post-launch support than what Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai teased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/kirby-air-riders-dev-team-disbanding-soon-game-updates-also-ending">with his no DLC comments</a> back in October. Moreover, he said post-launch development on Kirby Air Riders would end soon as the development team planned to disband.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">the 1.3.0 patch</a> is such a pleasant surprise. It dropped on 26th January and added several big new features to the game, with GameShare, a Grand Prix mode, and online matchmaking for two local players being the biggest additions.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gameshare/">GameShare feature</a> has been a strange one so far, with the game giant and some third-party developers adding it to some multiplayer-oriented games and skipping others. It essentially allows Switch 2 owners to "share" their game with other Switch systems close by or via GameChat (though there are restrictions for Switch 1 players who are limited to local GameShare). Casual racers are typically go-to games for local play, so Kirby Air Riders getting this extra is a welcome addition.</p><p>The Grand Prix mode is exactly what you think it is, but a bit of a bigger deal for Kirby Air Riders, since the game's regular racers are characterized by how blazing fast they are. A longer "match" that chains a bunch of them together is a great way to allow players to go sweatier and develop rivalries with random racers. Similarly, online play is also gaining a boost by allowing two local players to queue up for quick matches; hopefully, other online modes will be supported at a later date.</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">patch notes</a> are rather substantial and include many balance adjustments and fixes, with the market, customisation, and the central-show City Trial mode receiving the most love after the aforementioned additions.</p>

            <p>Highguard launched last night on Steam, and quickly had an influx of players saddle up to try out the biggest topic in games right now. It turns out, the game proved quite popular on its first day, nearly reaching 100,000 concurrent players during its launch day.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">As seen on SteamDB</a>, Highguard reached 97,249 players at around 7pm GMT. It then steadily decreased as the night went on. Whether or not the game will see similar peaks throughout the week, or will even hit a new peak record this weekend, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game has also received an influx of negative Steam reviews. Currently Mostly Negative, many have criticised the map size and the 3v3 game format. Now, it's still early days, and maybe Highguard will get its hooks into a solid community in the coming days, but for now it's looking a little rough.</p>

<p>Highguard has been <em>the</em> topic of discussion as of late due to a very hands-off approach to marketing. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">Since its reveal at The Game Awards</a>, where it took the final headline spot at the event, the official social media accounts were radio silent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-shows-signs-of-life-less-than-one-week-away-from-launch">until a few days ahead of launch</a>. That, and an early reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">of the Highguard trophy list</a> were all people really had to go on.</p>
<p>Can Highguard live up to expectations and prove doubters wrong, or is this the beginning of a very rocky road for Wildlight? Let us know what you think below.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-streaming-ratings-down">Fallout Season 2</a> has been great fun so far, and it seems folks continue to tune in to find out what's next for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus. Its ratings are positioning it as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">one of Prime Video's biggest seasons of TV ever</a>. Now, we've received word straight from Amazon MGM Studios that episodes 7 and 8 will drop a bit earlier to accommodate East and West Coast viewers.</p>
<p>The second season's last two episodes now premiere globally on Prime Video Tuesday, 27th January, at 6pmPT/9pmET. Next week, the Season 2 finale will be on the platform at the same time on Tuesday, 3rd February. That's a six-hour change to allow all American viewers to catch the episodes before bed time. As for us Europeans, these are still dropping in the middle of the night, which is, uh, not ideal.</p>
<p>To celebrate the news and the start of this season's final stretch, Amazon also shared a new poster featuring most of the show's key players, a menacing Deathclaw, and an all-new suit of NCR-inspired power armour that will surely get diehard fans talking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">Work on Season 3 is already underway</a> after an early renewal in late 2025, with Amazon, Kilter Films, and game developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> all interested in keeping the hit show going and moving as fast as possible. We've yet to see where the lead characters end up at the end of Season 2, which could determine the third season's central setting. The key plot threads (so far) suggest a return to the LA area at some point, but meanwhile, the show could explore more iconic regions of the post-Great War United States as first introduced in the RPG games.</p><p>We know for sure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">Bethesda will be acknowledging the show's world-shaking events</a> one way or another when Fallout 5 becomes a tangible reality, but with rumours of <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/bethesdas-todd-howard-says-we-are-doing-other-things-with-fallout-that-we-havent-announced-and-therell-come-a-time-for-that/">more projects being in development</a> (inside or outside Bethesda's core studio), chances are the Fallout universe will see a lot of changes and additions in the coming years.</p>
<p>For now, the live-action show is leading the creative charge by essentially acting as a sequel to all previous games in the franchise, and that thankfully isn't stopping it from being its own thing. Can we get more video game adaptations like this one, please?</p>

            <p>I do love a Soulslike, but I'm a bit of a purist at heart - if you don't give me the exact combination of forlorn ambience, intricate world design, lore excavation, and precision combat developer FromSoftware so consistently delivers, I’m probably going to struggle to care. So, having completely overlooked Bandai Namco's anime-hued Soulslike Code Vein when it released back in 2019, its sequel was well off my radar. Until, that is, dark forces (Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Orry) conspired to nudge it into my orbit. And having now played a good few hours of Code Vein 2 over this last week, I'm both surprised and delighted to discover I'm having a lovely time.</p>

<p>I should probably preface all this by saying if you're already well-accustomed to the original Code Vein, there's likely only so much you'll find useful here in my wide-eyed discovery of its sequel - which, for all I know, might be almost exactly the same. But for similarly placed newcomers, the immediate good news is no real familiarity with the first instalment is necessary at all. Code Vein 2 is a bit of a clean slate with its new cast and a new post-apocalyptic world, but <em>do</em> prepare to be quickly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of terminology (Revenants! Formae! Haze! Blood Codes!) thrown your way in the first few hours. Luckily, the Soulslike fundamentals are familiar enough that I found it easy to muddle through.</p>

<p>After being resurrected and hugged into the past by a big-eyed anime girl with a gaping chest-hole (don't ask), you're quickly dropped into combat as you begin your quest to thwart a resurging calamity sealed some 100 years prior. And Code Vein 2 builds its action from a core of light attacks, heavy attacks, dodges, and parries that won't need much explanation if you've any experience with the genre. Similarly, you'll be immediately at home with its bonfires (or Mistles as they're known here), where you'll rest and recover your faculties, resetting the world's enemies as you do. And then there's Haze - a special currency farmed from enemies, used to level up and purchase items, which you'll drop on death and need to reclaim.</p><p>So far so Soulslike, but it's the direction Namco Bandai takes from there that gives Code Vein 2 its distinctive flavour. Tonally, for instance, it's all <em>very</em> anime, crammed with cut-scene-heavy plot and enthusiastic companion chatter. Throw in some fab music, including a classic guitar-wailing battle theme, and you've got a surprisingly peppy, if rather straight-faced, apocalypse. And its open world feels equally removed from the gothic grimdark favoured by other Soulslike games - a vast, verdant island of sci-fi prefabs, crumbling ruins, dilapidated mansions, hot springs where you can acquire recipes after a spot of relaxing nude-y time, and even desolate cities sinking into oceans beneath Xenoblade-like bright blue skies. It makes for some striking sights, even if performance isn't great on a bogstandard PS5.</p>



<p>But as refreshing as all this periphery stuff is, it's the way Code Vein 2 expands on its basic combat that's properly pulled me in. Early on, you're introduced to companions you can temporarily assimilate or fight alongside. They'll offer their immortality to boost your health bar, do damage to enemies that heals over time if you don't join the fray; they'll lend you special skills if your bond is strong enough, and they'll resurrect you during battle whenever their cooldown expires. But there's plenty more to think about besides. Weapons - scythes, big swords, battle axe, and the like - come with distinctive movesets, but can be further augmented with flashy abilities known as Formae; there's a rapid-fire longbow to keep up the offensive as you weave around, and a drain mechanic used to replenish the Ichor powering your skills - which can do real damage when combined with a stagger. And that's just for starters.</p>



<p>It's a tight loop of interconnected battle mechanisms that, once you start to get your head round it all, builds toward a flashy, fluid, and enjoyably frenzied combat pace I'm finding enormously satisfying. You might need to shake off your Soulsian muscle memory first, mind - unvarnished combat feels sluggish in a way I assume is deliberate, so as to push you toward Code Vein 2's expanded toolkit and spirited mess of blistering combos; but a couple of hours in, with a few upgrades and new weapons in hand, there's evidentally significant flexibility for those wanting to explore different playstyles. And that's without the numerous other modifiers (Burdens! Bequeathed Formae!) I'm only just getting to grips with.</p><p>Obviously, it's still early days, but I'm slowly starting to find my rhythm. And Code Vein 2's combat is working in tandem with a snappy quest-based progression system, some pacily compact dungeon design, and a so-far relatively forgiving difficulty curve that gives it a breezily propulsive sense of momentum. Oh, and while I'm rattling through the good stuff, its photo mode and character creator are great too - whether you're making green-haired anime girls, or chiselled muscle boys with sparkling smiles and abs spilling out over their skimpy bath towels. And it's got motorbikes! Does all this mean I'm ready to toss my Soulslike prejudices aside? Probably not entirely, but in carving its own distinctive path, Code Vein 2 has won me over.</p>

            <p>Autumn 2026 could be the definitive release window for Xbox and Playground Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-2024">Fable</a>, which last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">confirmed</a> its journey to PS5 on top of Xbox Series X/S and PC. Years after its original announcement, it's had its ups and downs, but the powers that be appear to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-xbox-and-playground-making-the-right-move-sticking-so-closely-to-fables-history">a solid grasp on what they want to achieve with it</a>. Now, we also know it'd been a dream project for the developer for a while.</p>
<p>"The first conversations we had about doing something other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> and building a second team go right the way back to the year after we shipped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-3">Forza Horizon 3</a>," said Playground general manager Ralph Fulton during <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/why-playground-games-ambitious-open-world-fable-reboot-is-a-fresh-start-for-the-series-this-has-to-be-playgrounds-fable/">an interview for GamesRadar</a>. It was in 2016 that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-3-review">Forza Horizon 3</a> was released and cemented the open-world driving series as a modern behemoth.</p>
<p>"It was the best Forza Horizon we'd made. The team really hit its stride – the game was really high-quality, it landed with a wide audience. We felt great about that," Fulton added. Around that time, conversations started at the studio about building a second team which maybe could take on something different: "The conversation around building a second team and doing something else, doing something different, was really about wanting to challenge ourselves – to learn and grow as developers." As we all know, the Forza Horizon series has become essential to the studio, especially after Xbox bought it, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-shows-off-largest-ever-map-as-microsoft-confirms-a-may-release">its sixth entry</a> could help offset any possible disappointment with the Fable reboot.</p>
<p>Still, we're generally optimistic about the ambitious RPG, especially after the franchise was left for dead following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-acknowledges-missteps-in-its-handling-of-lionhead-studios">Lionhead Studios' closure in 2016</a>. A lot of what's made Forza Horizon special over the years seems to be on full display on Playground's Albion. Fulton admits the veteran devs "felt our transferable skills were, in a genre sense, open-world game design, open-world technology, and open-world streaming," which helped the studio narrow down what it could do outside of driving sandboxes.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Fulton went on to explain how the technology had to be modified and optimized to fit an open-world RPG and how passionate the entire team is about Fable and its legacy. But funnily enough, he doesn't exactly remember who first brought the famous IP up as a real possibility: "I don't remember who mentioned [Fable], but as soon as I heard the word I was sold."</p><p>As underlined by the trailers released so far and the in-studio videos we've received over the past few years, Playground wants to make its own version of Fable instead of Fable 4 under a different, simpler name: "We're not Lionhead, we're a different studio with different people and a different culture. It would be inauthentic for us to try and just make Fable 4."</p>
<p>From the focus on sitcom-inspired comedy to leaning more on a fairytale-like aesthetic, it's safe to say this extremely British take on Fable has a voice of its own. The question now is whether it'll live up to most players' terribly high expectations after six years of teases and development hiccups.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has teased a selection of big reveals starting the 29th January, which will cover almost its entire repertoire of games, including World of Warcraft, Diablo, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>In a short but fancy video laden with nostalgic props and retro PC set-ups, a history of big Blizzard moments are panned over. The purpose being to celebrate 35 years of Blizzard history, with four days dedicated to the next chapter of select games.</p>

<figcaption>You can watch this Blizzard 35 teaser here.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYsAssECbR4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>In the description of the teaser we can see the following game-specific showcases:</p>
<ul>
<li>World of Warcraft: 29th January 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm GMT / 6pm CEST</li>
<li>Overwatch: 4th February 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CEST</li>
<li>Hearthstone: 9th February 9:30am PT / 12:30pm ET / 5:30pm GMT / 6:30pm CEST</li>
<li>Diablo: 11th February 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm GMT / 11pm CEST</li>
</ul>
<p>What's interesting is the teaser itself ends with a selection of logos placed under the words' Blizzard 35', including games not included in that list. This includes the logos of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heroes-of-the-storm">Heroes of the Storm</a>, and Starcraft.</p>
<p>Starcraft itself is an interested absence from the list of showcase days, especially given the recent reports of <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661">an in-development Starcraft shooter</a>. However, how far through development this project is, or if it's even made it past the R&amp;D stage, has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>It's certainly a big year for Blizzard in terms of releases and major updates. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft is getting its Midnight expansion soon</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> Lord of Hatred update. But who knows? Maybe even bigger surprises are around the corner. World of Warcraft: Classic fans have been begging for an expanded version of the original MMO, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/did-blizzard-just-drop-another-hint-for-classic-379737">which is an idea the developers haven't crossed out</a>.</p>

            <p>As Nintendo's first-party offerings begin to fully focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-still-a-switch-game-coming-out-in-2026">one more major release still targeting its predecessor</a> in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream. With January 2026 now on its way out, the company has set a new Nintendo Direct for this Thursday.</p>
<p>The news arrived on 26th January via the Nintendo Today app, which has slowly but steadily become the video game giant's go-to news channel besides the Direct Streams. This all-new exclusive presentation Direct will start at 6am PT on 29th January (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mddedbks4k2w">Wario64</a>). The length of the presentation wasn't specified, but considering we don't know much about the sequel's ins and outs, we'd like to believe it's a meaty one.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dvo1V7DWYsA">surprise reveal</a> in March 2025, the game reappeared last September, teasing a spring 2026 release window which feels way more solid now that a game-specific Direct has been locked. You can watch the previous trailer below:</p>

<p>While the looks at the game released so far give us a good sense of its goofy, cheerful, and relaxed tone, we've been wondering whether there's more to the central gameplay loop than in past entries (with the original one being a Japan exclusive). Many players are expecting a cozy life sim, yet based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a> (3DS), we doubt Nintendo aims to deliver another chill experience that overlaps with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-doing-nothing-at-all">Switch 2 upgrade</a> or the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>.</p><p>In the previous games, the focus was on fostering relationships between Mii characters living on an island and helping them with everyday problems. Living the Dream appears to be a bit bigger and more ambitious with its pitch, but the scope and depth of its creative tools haven't been explained yet.</p>
<p>In any case, this week's Direct should clear up any doubts and potentially set a price tag and a definitive release date. Will a native Switch 2 version happen? That's another question up in the air we'd like answered. Come back on Thursday and we'll give you the rundown.</p>

            <p>The UK Court of Appeals has ruled that MMO currency can be treated as property, and the stealing of such currency can be deemed criminal theft.</p>
<p>This comes following a verdict against a former Jagex developer who allegedly accessed nearly 70 player accounts to harvest large quantities of gold, selling this in-game currency for Bitcoin. Jagex claims the total value of gold taken amounts to £543,123, based on the rate that in-game Bonds can be bought for with gold. These bonds can be exchanged for an in-game subscription, which otherwise must be bought with real-world money.</p>
<p>The original verdict on this case, which went the way of the defence, deemed that: "gold pieces were not rivalrous and were more akin to pure information," and therefore could not be stolen. Taking this gold was not deemed theft as, per the 1968 Theft Act, something stealable is: "money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property. As they believed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> gold more akin to pure information, there was no legal basis for it to be a stealable good.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the Court of Appeals, and as can be seen in <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2026/4">R v Andrew Lakeman [2026]</a>, Lord Justice Popplewell, His Honour Judge Mayo DL and Mr Justice Soole believed this previous verdict did not "bear analysis". Basically, they disagreed.</p><p>As seen in the conclusion (the full document is very interesting to read for those eager to dig through the minutia) it was deemed that RuneScape gold does fall under the "intangible property" portion of the Theft definition. Section 85 reads:</p>
<p>"They are properly described as something which can be stolen as a matter of normal use of language. They do not fall within any of the established exceptions. They are not 'pure knowledge': functionally they exist as identifiable assets distinct from the code which gives rise to them and outside the minds of people. There is no good policy reason for excepting them from the category of property which can be stolen.</p>
<p>"On the contrary, they are assets which have an ascertainable monetary value and which may be traded for that value both in the game and outside the game. Within the rules of the game they represent money’s worth as the product of purchase of a bond. Outside the game they are regularly traded for money’s worth. They are capable of being subject to dishonest dealing which deprives their possessor of their use and value. It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if such dishonest dealing did not amount to the offence of theft."</p>
<p>This not only brings to a close a chapter in Jagex's ongoing battle against one of its former employees, but also raises some interesting questions about the legal future of video game currencies. If stealing in-game gold is considered theft as a legal precedent, then what does this mean for other UK-based hackers for other games? If in-game items have value and are not just packets of valueless data, does this throw a curveball into the 'are loot boxes gambling' debate within UK institutions? This court case may very well be the gift that keeps on giving over the next few years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiems-director-on-why-re9-wont-suffer-the-same-multi-protagonist-woes-as-re6-and-why-its-more-like-sushi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>"Imagine there's no such thing as Sushi," Resident Evil: Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi asked me to ponder. It's a strange request, but it comes at the end of an animated chat with a clearly very thoughtful creator. I nod along - imagining a terrible world, as far as I'm concerned. But what does this analogy have to do with Resident Evil?</p>
<p>When Leon's inclusion as a playable character in the ninth main-line Resident Evil game was announced, the general response was that of rejoicing. People have missed this character and his specific style of despatching the undead, after all. But buried in this announcement was also a subtle undercurrent of dread - and not of the kind that Resident Evil sets out to deliberately evoke. It is this dread that talk of sushi is intended to expel.</p>
<p>The trepidation of some fans is fair enough, I suppose. For series fans memories loom large of the last time that Capcom tried to craft a multi-protagonist numbered Resident Evil title where different protagonists resembled different 'styles' of gameplay: 2012's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a>, arguably the most controversial game in the franchise. With recent hands-ons and through chats like the one with me, however, Nakanishi and team are especially keen to underline one point: this is not Resident Evil 6.</p>

<p>"If sushi hadn't been invented yet, a fish lover would just want to eat sashimi, raw fish. A rice lover would just want rice," Nakanishi continues.</p>
<p>"Then some guy goes 'I've made this thing, it's called sushi. It's raw fish on rice.' Imagine how you'd feel if you were someone who loved eating rice - like 'what are you putting raw fish on my rice for?!' Or if you're a sashimi person, you're like 'just give me sashimi. Why are you ruining my fish with rice?!'</p>
<p>"We're the 'inventors of sushi' here," the director's analogy concludes. "Even if you think you want one style, the 'flavor' of this game comes from the combination of the two styles."</p>
<p>From what I've played of Resident Evil 9, I certainly can go along with this analogy. I'd actually go a step further, though. With four playable leads, the sixth entry had double the heavy lifting to do of Requiem. Further, much of its experience is defined by leveraging of the genres and tropes that had become popular during the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 console generation. It's difficult to look at Chris' campaign, for instance, without seeing in it the slew of brown-tinted third-person shooters of that era.</p><p>Essentially, bits of Resident Evil 6 were pure 'Resident Evil' - while other parts of it were distinctly other. This is where it fell flat. Requiem, though, is designed to be a pure expression of the series - even if it features different <em>flavours</em> of biohazard action. When I express this thinking - that RE6 was different, disparate types of game bolted together, but that RE9 is more like two different versions of Resident Evil bolted together, he eagerly claps and gives a thumbs up.</p>

<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> - those games have essentially offered us a template for the two characters. Our shorthand is that Grace is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> style, and Leon is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> style," Nakanishi notes.</p>
<p>The director also admits that the recent showcase stream focused a lot on Leon performing cool finishing moves and moving, in a sense, like he does in the over-the-top action of the RE CG movies.</p>
<p>"We realize that has given some players an impression that will be the entirety of the Leon experience in the game. That is not the case. Leon has exploration scenes, he has horrific scenes, he has backtracking."</p>
<p>For all the action, Leon will still be upgrading weapons, playing inventory tetris, and managing his attache case. All this comes alongside the idea that his sections will still be fundamentally different to Grace's thanks to his level of experience.</p>
<p>"The idea is that, by combining them together, they are more than the sum of their parts."</p>
<p>"We're the guy who invented sushi, here. We're saying: trust us, take it. Dare to take a leap with us and eat this new product called sushi," Nakanishi laughs.</p>
<p>And, well - he's right, isn't he? Unlikely combinations can often be delicious. From several hours with a clearly close-to-final build, it's abundantly clear that Requiem is no RE6. In fact, I think it might just continue this series' incredible run - as fitting a 30th anniversary gift as any.</p>

            <p>Resident Evil 9 (aka Requiem) is all about the swings. After three hours with a clearly more-or-less final build of the game, one rather gets the impression that the entire game has been built around the idea of a pendulum swinging back and forth. Exhilarating highs and stomach-churning lows (of the good sort). What surprised me the most about the hands-on, however, is how <em>quickly </em>Requiem sets that ticking and tocking cadence.</p>
<p>You could be forgiven for thinking that when I talk about this back-and-forth, I'm strictly talking about the interplay between new protagonist Grace and returning badass Leon. There is, after all, an ebb and flow between the two. At one point, the game makes a cutscene-bound statement when Leon swings into action and essentially one-shots a beast that'd previously appeared invincible as it terrorised Grace.</p>
<p>The two represent the different 'lanes' of Resident Evil. Grace's gameplay defaults to first-person, plays similarly to RE7, and is meant to also evoke the classic horror of the earlier entries. Grace scrabbles around zones for keys to dig deeper into semi open-ended environments, having to carefully use scarce resources to survive. Leon channels RE4, defaulting to third-person with more linear all-out action. With Grace, I'm constantly saving my game at typewriters as I make slow and steady progress. As Leon, when I happen across a typewriter I'd previously used as Grace, he can't even use it - I expect he doesn't <em>need</em> to save, because his sections at least in this hands-on appear relatively linear and thus easily checkpointed.</p>
<p>It goes on. Leon has a parry, Grace does not. Leon gets more readily plied with powerful weapons; as Grace, you're lucky to find ammo for your pop-gun pistol. So yes, there is a to-and-fro there. But honestly, I'm not really talking about that.</p>

<p>Grace's play is sort of the heart of this hands-on, as while the Grace/Leon split seems likely to be something like 50/50 in terms of <em>content volume</em>, by dint of how they play Leon tears through the same amount of environment as Grace in half the time. That was certainly the tale of the demo, which broadly speaking was made up of three sections: Leon arriving at the Rhodes Hill hospital in a brief action set piece, Grace exploring the hospital while desperately scrambling for the resources necessary to stay alive, and then later Leon tearing through the same areas you'd explored as Grace in an action-packed rerun.</p><p>The better part of two hours of the three-hour hands-on was the Grace section. The Rhodes Hill medical facility is a pretty classic Resident Evil zone - semi-open, with keycarded doors, locked boxes, and plenty of zombified enemies to either engage or avoid. The objectives have you criss-crossing from one wing of the hospital to another in search of items required to escape - all while a creepy Jigsaw-esque evil doctor watches via CCTV and periodically intervenes in person, with the zombie situation gradually escalating over time too.</p>
<p>It's here where I was most impressed by the pendulum, that back-and-forth that Requiem director Kōshi Nakanishi <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet">had previously told</a> me was built on the foundation of a "graph of tension and release". As Grace I was perpetually scrabbling around in the dirt for anything I could cling to as help - but it <em>swings</em>. Hard. One minute I'd have my back against the wall, barely any health, real-life heavy breathing in a state of panic as I cower in a side room and pray that an enemy has either lost me or is unwilling to enter the room I'm in. Tick; the pendulum swoops. Next, after a bit of scouring the map with that 'you're almost dead' red tint at the edges of the screen, I find <em>stuff</em>. Some herbs, some bullets. Tock; I'm back in the game, baby.</p>
<p>This didn't just happen once over 90 minutes of Grace; it happened over-and-over again, at a speed and ferocity that just didn't occur with Resident Evil 7 or 8. It is as the director suggested to me months ago - the glorious satisfaction that comes with a pattern of tension and release. The zones, the combat, the objectives, and the way enemies act are all built to needle at that.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Speaking of enemies, it's here where perhaps Resident Evil 9 offers its most interesting twist so far. It's a simple one that has been explored in countless zombie media over the years: that zombies might retain some of their human traits post-transformation.</p><p>In RE9 this manifests as zombies with habits, or fine motor skills beyond just shambling around. Some are sensitive to light, and you can mess with them by flicking light switches in the corridors - they'll then dutifully shamble to the switch and desperately paw at it to turn the lights off, making a great way to lure and separate groups. You can also stun these guys by blaring your flashlight right into their face.</p>
<p>You're in a hospital, so there's a couple of guys who were clearly in for eye procedures and have another problem - they can't see, blinded by medical blindfolds. These zombies thrash particularly violently, but luckily they're only attracted by noise. In other cases, the life hangover is simpler. A maid continues to clean after death, paying little attention to you unless you disturb her. An undead cook continues to butcher meat in his kitchen, making sloppy use of a giant knife - and if you're not careful, Grace will be the next on his slab. Singers continue to warble in their zombified state, and can emit ear-splitting screeches if they spot you.</p>
<p>There's also 'Chunks', which basically means, er, fat zombies. Zombies with a lot of timber on them, meaning ordinance grazes off and does little damage. A posh name for very scary bullet sinks, basically. And worst of all there are 'Blister Heads', which is the name RE9 gives to a previously-downed zombie that after some time reanimates, rising again with its head bloated up into a terrible bulbous mass. I hated (complimentary) this in particular; you'd go into a room where you'd previously cleared it out to nab an item or use something in the environment and then hear the sound of a previously-despatched enemy rising again behind you. Cue swearing.</p>
<p>As this Grace section progresses the hospital is split into distinct east and west wings, with a 'safe zone' atrium between them. You'll travel back and forth gathering items and keys in order to unravel the mysteries of the hospital, including characters and events I won't talk about here and a handy room where you can trade pilfered coins for upgrades to Grace's durability and skill set. Eventually, you'll end up in a situation where there's powerful enemies on both wings. These aren't quite full-blown stalker enemies, for they are killable, but more like mid-boss level foes that are better run from. There's a sense of nonlinearity to all this too - the guy next to me at the hands-on tackles the objectives in a completely different order to me and makes his life more miserable as a result, as one of his actions spawned in a hugely powerful enemy probably thirty minutes before I did the same - which was neat to see.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Capcom</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's these foes that begin to justify Grace's nuclear options. First, there's a powerful pistol bequeathed from Leon that'll blow most (but not all) enemies away. You only have one bullet for this, and crafting more is expensive as hell. You're best to save it for a real messy situation. A little more cheaply, though, you can craft injectors. These make zombies outright explode; I craft one of these and sneak up on the toughest enemy stalking the hospital's west wing and stick him with it - <em>boom</em>. That saved me a shed load of bullets and a lot of sneaking, and as a bonus someone who exploded into bits can't rise again as a Blister Head. Phew.</p><p>You can sense from these descriptions, I imagine, how those swings come about. Your back against the wall, chased by a gang of zombies. But then you scrabble together some crafting materials or ammo and the game flips on its head. Once you're in, RE9 is full of delightful little details that enhance, exploit, or even just acknowledge your dread. One of my favourite details: if you press to reload while your ammo is already full, Grace nervously pulls the gun's slide back to check if a bullet is definitely in the chamber and ready to go. As somebody who compulsively presses reload every time I enter a scary-looking room in a game like this, I loved this detail: my nervous compulsions became Grace's nervous compulsions.</p>
<p>Fast forward a little while, then, and it's back to Leon. If Grace's section is full of little swings, this is the <em>big</em> swing. Leon is completely different, as indicated by everything right down to a different HUD. Or, indeed, by the fact that his section faces off with a one-on-one showdown against one of the enemies that Grace had just found nigh-impossible to kill. After that, Leon finds himself spat out into the same area you'd just been exploring as Grace - but with one other small notable wrinkle.</p>
<p>Because Leon visits this area after Grace, whatever you'd got up to as her remains. If you'd lured zombies to different rooms from where they'd naturally spawn, they remain there. Found a box of bullets or a herb and didn't pick it up? It's there for Leon. Killed a big enemy? You cleared the path for our boy. Didn't? It's his problem now - but he has a shotgun.</p>

<p>Resident Evil 9's directors do tell me that this isn't going to be the only pattern the game follows. Leon won't always be tracing Grace's steps - and he won't always be pure action. Leon will have to juggle upgrades, puzzles, inventory Tetris (except he has a huge attache case and not Grace's meagre storage), and proper existential horror more suitable for the sort of character Leon is. But seeing this interplay between the two halves of Requiem in the section offered in this demo is a most curious little tidbit. Like the non-linearity of certain objectives, it whiffs of exciting strategies for getting through, and for sequence breaks and speed runs. And anything that enables those things is a huge boon for player agency in general.</p><p>As for Leon himself? Well, playing as him slaps. Like Grace's section, it perhaps shouldn't come as a surprise. If you liked the RE4 Remake, what is presented here is an elevated version of that. While the recent trailer footage focused on awesome-looking finishing moves and the like, in practice moment-to-moment Leon is much less prescribed. Like the best bits of RE4, you have latitude of choice in terms of how to approach combat situations, and pulling off some of those most cinematic moves happens to be quite tricky.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is: it's not survival horror as Grace and pure action as Leon. There is clearly more to both. We'll need to see the final game to truly understand that balance - But what I see here is not a game lacking in identity because it is doing multiple things. Rather, I see a game supremely comfortable in its place in the series - bringing together the best of Resident Evil. After I play, Requiem director Nakanishi tells me this is also how they've viewed the project internally - with the remakes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 4 as 'north star' templates - bringing the two distinct styles of Resident Evil together in order to create something <em>more</em> focused on the series' strengths - not jumbled, not less.</p>
<p>All told, this final hands-on can consider mission accomplished: I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in. I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing.</p>

            <p>Stop Killing Games has been fighting the good fight <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">since 2024</a> in answer to publishers like Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">shutting down The Crew</a> and other online-only games and cutting access to them. In 2025, the European Citizens' Initiative launched by the group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">was blasted</a> by several major publishers as such a move would be "prohibitively expensive." Now, the initiative has flown past its goal and cleared almost 1.3m verified signatures.</p>
<p>A new post on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1qluxts/stop_killing_games_final_count_of_verified/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">r/StopKillingGames</a> by director general Moritz Katzner (hat tip to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/we-have-cleared-the-requirement-stop-killing-games-eu-initiative-has-almost-1-3-million-verified-signatures-clearing-it-for-the-next-phase-thats-expected-to-take-place-next-month/">GamesRadar</a>) has revealed "things are moving quite fast right now." The plan was to "reveal everything through a video" and with a new website and reworked Discord, but the team has ultimately decided to drop the final count early. After removing signatures that weren't valid (something that worried many supporters), the initiative still cleared almost 1.3m valid ones, which is well past the 1m goal set.</p>
<p>Germany leads the pack with 233,180 signatures, with France (145,299), Poland (143,826), and Spain (121,616) also showing high levels of support. The announcement arrived along with a video by Stop Killing Games creator Ross Scott (aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Accursed_Farms">Accursed Farms</a>):</p>

<p>"We have cleared the requirement, and the next phase will be officially submitting them to the EU Commission in Brussels, probably some time late February." He also added, much like in the previously shared Reddit post, that more news is coming soon as momentum is maintained.</p><p>As a reminder, this initiative doesn't seek to obtain ownership, intellectual rights, or monetisation rights after the games stop being supported, and it's not a direct shot against the entirely different problem of game preservation either. Instead, <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home/disabled">Stop Killing Games' main goal</a> is to "prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher."</p>
<p>A good recent example of a major game being turned off by the publisher and essentially "disappearing" is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-can-run-on-private-servers-youtube-video-reveals">that of Anthem</a>, BioWare's failed looter shooter. On the opposite side, we have the much-maligned Avengers video game that released in 2020 to middling reviews. After its (surprisingly lengthy) post-launch support was done, the game was dropped by the publisher and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-avengers-receives-hulking-discount-ahead-of-delisting">stopped being sold</a> due to the core licence expiring, but it's remained in a fully playable state regardless thanks to its peer-to-peer online system.</p>

            <p>Progress on the third chapter of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-are-making-great-progress-confirms-director">has been steady and smooth</a> so far, with the game having already reached a "playable" state <a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/">according to game director Naoki Hamaguchi</a>. Now, we've received an update on its (still secret) title and what engine the team is using.</p>
<p>The news came via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-officially-has-a-title/1100-6537603/">GameSpot's latest interview</a> with the director, which was shared on 23rd January, right as Final Fantasy 7 Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">arrived on Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2</a> with excellent ports. Without getting into actual spoilers, the "Remake" label of these games goes beyond the traditional use of the word, as there's a meta narrative which has gradually reshaped the direction of the overall trilogy.</p>
<p>As a result, fan expectations since Rebirth's release was that Part 3's title would be in line with the previous two. No word on what the final name is yet, but Hamaguchi has now said "the title has been locked" following creative director (and OG FF7 veteran) Tetsuya Nomura making the final decision recently.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit which explains the threequel's fast-moving development comes from Hamaguchi confirming they've ultimately decided to use Unreal Engine 4 over UE5 after making "a lot of modifications to fit our needs." As impressive as UE5 can be when used properly, it's also led to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/unreal-engine-5-has-been-a-disappointment">several high-profile disappointments</a>, so it's not surprising to see one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s key teams playing things safe in the last stretch of this hugely ambitious trilogy. "It’s more beneficial to have something we’re already familiar with and have customized to fit our needs," he added.</p><p>This should also help with getting Rebirth and the as-yet-untitled third chapter running on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> following Remake's remarkable looks and stable performance. At this moment, the team has "gotten [Rebirth] to function" on Nintendo's still-infant hybrid console, but a release date won't be locked until more optimizations are done.</p>
<p>It's all quite impressive considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> launched less than two years ago and "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">almost no documentation</a>" remains from the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>'s development, but in the age of the average AAA project taking around half a decade to finish (if we're lucky), Hamaguchi's team seems to have cracked the code with this daring three-part effort.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and Deck Nine lifted the lid on the next series entry, Life is Strange: Reunion. Reunion is billed as the "thrilling finale to the Max and Chloe saga", which began over 10 years ago with the eponymous Life is Strange.</p>

<p>Since Life is Strange's original story from 2015, the character of Chloe has appeared twice more: once in 2017's prequel Before the Storm, and again in Reunion, which is set to debut later this year. However, unlike the original, Chloe in these two games is voiced not by Burch, but by Rhianna DeVries.</p>
<p>Now, speaking with Eurogamer following Reunion's reveal, Burch says she doesn't "know a lot about this project", but regardless, Max and Chloe's characters still mean a great deal to her, and there is no doubt that they always will.</p>
<p>"I wasn't asked to reprise my role as Chloe, so I'm learning about Reunion at the same time as the fans," Burch tells me, before adding she is "grateful people still care so much about these characters".</p>
<p>Closing, Burch says: "Max and Chloe will always have a special place in my heart."</p>

<p>As well as Life is Strange, Burch has also lent her talents to a myriad of other projects across games, films and TV. This includes Borderlands' Tiny Tina, The Last of Us Part 2's Mel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-developer-replacing-all-actors-with-robots-not-going-to-happen-says-aloy-voice-actress">Aloy in PlayStation's Horizon series</a>, and many more. In addition, Burch is the creator of the YouTube series I'm Happy You're Here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ashly-burch-gets-into-bed-with-puppets-to-talk-about-mental-health">which she describes as "like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, but for adults"</a>, about the many mental health hurdles we face today.</p>
<p>As for the Life is Strange series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-reunion-will-be-the-thrilling-finale-to-the-max-and-chloe-saga-coming-march">Reunion is set to arrive on 26th March</a>, across Xbox Series X/S, PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Work on Banjo: Recompiled, a PC port of the iconic N64 platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, had been <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-decompilation-project-for-banjo-kazooie-is-now-100-complete.968472/">advancing in the background</a> for a while now, but no one was expecting a shadow drop. That's happened now, and we're impressed by the full list of features.</p>
<p>Wiseguy, a modder who'd already worked (alongside a team) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIp7C2ro2T8">Zelda 64: Recompiled</a>, an adaptation for PC of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>, shared the trailer on 24th January via his own YouTube channel:</p>

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0906Cz-59eU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>The nearly-four-minute look at the ambitious port isn't just a gameplay reel, as custom scenes and text boxes in the style of the classic game tell both veterans and curious newcomers about all the new features (and even a few surprises) added to this <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>-based version of the game.</p><p>In humorous and colourful fashion, we're told about high framerate support (60, 120, and "whatever FPS you want") and even adjustments for ultrawide monitors. Moreover, the custom options menu is full of settings for general, graphics, controls, and more. It really achieves the feeling of an official port or traditional remaster, alternative control schemes included.</p>
<p>The most surprising reveal comes with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom">Doom</a>-themed puzzle that confirms full mod and custom level support. New content will supposedly be easy to make and throw into Banjo: Recompiled for those with the right tools and knowledge, so expect more on that front fast. "We're getting one step closer to a community made Banjo-Threeie," one comment under the trailer says. Looking at <a href="https://www.slipseer.com/index.php?resources/quake-brutalist-jam-iii.549/">other ambitious projects</a> born out of preservation efforts, that's entirely possible.</p>
<p>Banjo: Recompiled also works out of the box on Windows, Linux (also SteamOS), and Mac. You can grab it <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp">here</a>, but you'll need a "copy of the North American 1.0 version of the game" that's been previously dumped from a cart you own, as the port loads the assets from the original game release.</p>

            <p><strong>Update: 10:15pm, 26th January</strong>. Eurogamer understands that the initial description of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> as the best-selling Blizzard game of all time was written in error, and that the LinkedIn bio was refering to the previously-established fact that it was Blizzard's <em>fastest</em> game ever.</p>
<p>The source LinkedIn bio has been updated to reflect this, and likewise the mention of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as being the "best selling game in CoD history" has also been removed.
</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original article: 11:28am, 26th January</strong>. Diablo 4 may be the best selling Blizzard game of all time, according to the LinkedIn profile of an Activision Blizzard employee.</p>
<p>Lauren Ashling Hill, Activision Blizzard's communications lead for Northern Europe, states as much in her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-ashling-hill-4a194837/">LinkedIn bio</a>. It describes Diablo 4 as "the best selling Blizzard game of all time". This bio also describes Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as "the best selling game in CoD history".</p><p>We already knew that Diablo 4 was the fastest selling Blizzard game of all time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-says-diablo-4-is-its-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time">as this fact was announced by Blizzard itself back in 2023</a>. Within a few days after its early access release, the game racked up over 10,000 years of play time according to Blizzard, an eye-watering figure for the series and studio.</p>

<p>Since then, Diablo 4 has undergone plenty of quality-of-life changes and gained multiple expansions, including the most recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Vessel of Hatred major content update</a>. Later this April, its Lord of Hatred expansion is set to launch adding a new class, a new region, and other goodies.</p>
<p>It should be no surprise that Diablo 4 is selling boat-loads, given the series' history of high player demand. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a> was certainly no slouch when it came to bringing home the bacon, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/8/5/5972671/diablo-3-activision-blizzard-pc-sales/">selling at least 20m copies back in 2014</a>.
</p>
<p>Midway through last year, the Diablo 4 team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-diablo-team-forms-union-seeking-protection-in-wake-of-microsoft-layoffs">looked to unionise following widespread layoffs across Microsoft's gaming division</a>, which did impact various staff within Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-12-months-since-microsoft-purchased-activision-blizzard-so-whats-changed">thanks to the company being acquired by Microsoft back in late 2023</a>.</p>

            <p>Filming for Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> is currently underway in the UK.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, footage of Alien and Avatar actress Sigourney Weaver on location in London started making the rounds. Now, I will be the first to admit this new footage doesn't tell us a <em>great </em>deal, with the images and videos circulating merely showing Weaver standing on the roadside in the Big Smoke, but as a massive Tomb Raider fan, I am excited nonetheless.</p>

<p>Weaver will play Evelyn Wallis in the Tomb Raider series, with her character described as "a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's talents". Even from just the short clip of the actress on set, which you can see below, Weaver is definitely giving off villain vibes. There is something about the sharp collar and business attire that screams 'I am scheming'.</p>
<p>For those who have seen the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikanders-tomb-raider-film-from-2018-just-made-it-onto-netflixs-top-10-ahead-of-series-30th-anniversary-this-year">Tomb Raider film with Alica Vikander from 2018</a>, I am getting the same vibe from Weaver's character as that of  Kristin Scott Thomas' Anna. You can see how Weaver looks as Evelyn Wallis below.</p>

<p>As well as Weaver, other confirmed cast members include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas, Martin Bobb-Semple as Zip, Bill Paterson as Winston and Celia Imrie as Francine</a> (that is to say, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, who is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne").</p><p>Meanwhile, Sophie Turner will play Lara Croft. Earlier this year, we got a look at Turner's Lara, with her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2026-lara-croft-seems-to-be-returning-to-what-made-90s-tomb-raider-great-and-as-a-lifelong-fan-i-couldnt-be-more-excited">ensemble from the classic Tomb Raider games from the 90s serving as inspiration</a>. More recently, the actress has said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sophie-turners-lara-croft-is-so-unashamedly-capable-tomb-raider-actor-says">her take on Lara will be "so unashamedly capable"</a>.</p>
<p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer. We don't have a release date for the show yet.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 26/1/2026:</strong> Embark Studios <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2015107332271706495?s=20">has announced</a> the Headwinds update drops tomorrow, 27th January.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' narrative ambitions have been limited so far, with Embark Studios' extraction shooter first looking to ease players into its post-apocalyptic world. After the winter-themed Cold Snap event, however, it appears the developers are putting the pedal to the metal with an "impending escalation" that will happen over the next four months.</p>
<p>The studio locked and <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">shared</a> an early 2026 roadmap on 23rd January. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">talking earlier this month</a> about how the team could "escalate the experience" in surprising ways, it seems that's happening as soon as February. In fact, the four-month roadmap that begins later this month (an update should drop this week) and ends in April is aptly titled Escalation. Things are about to get more dangerous topside.</p>
<figure>

<p>"The increased ARC presence continues to trouble Shani as the Rustbelt grows more overwhelmed, but no one holds all the pieces," the last post teases. Answers won't be coming this month, as the next content update, dubbed Headwinds, focuses on adding a new matchmaking option for high-level players looking for extra excitement, a new map condition, and a new player project to work on.</p><p>Things will start getting spicier in February with Shrouded Sky. Map conditions and player projects will be recurring additions, but next month, a new Arc threat, expedition, and raider deck (battle pass) are arriving. No details yet on what's going to happen on the live narrative front, but things will continue to ramp up in March's Flashpoint update with yet another map condition and an all-new Arc menace.</p>
<p>The grand finale of this first multi-part chapter in Arc Raiders' post-launch is set to arrive in April (unless delays happen) through Riven Tides. An entire new map will open up, and a previously unseen type of huge Arc will join the war. Hopefully, diehards looking for tough endgame content will have a harder time trying to take the new giants down.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">Arc Raiders crossing the 12m copies sold mark</a> earlier this month, expectations around the premium extraction shooter are sky-high. So far, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">player numbers</a> are holding up and steady, and we're of the opinion its success could even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">help Bungie's Marathon</a> come March, as more players are now eager to jump into the still-infant shooter subgenre.</p>

            <p>It has been less than three months since Nintendo and Koei Tecmo released its chaotic but oh-so-satisfying Zelda hack-and-slash spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, but the game seems to be doing pretty well for the two companies.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Koei Tecmo announced that Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment - which made its frantic debut in November of last year -  has already sold over 1m copies worldwide on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> platform.</p>

<p>These sales figures for Nintendo's latest crossover with the Warriors series, which also includes Legend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> spin-off Age of Calamity, were shared in <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir6_20260126e.pdf">Koei Tecmo's third quarter financial results</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/2015717491931271426?s=20">Genki</a>).</p>
<p>While Koei Tecmo only published Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment in Japan, a note within its third quarter financial results confirms this latest number is for global sales (see image below).</p>

<p>Since its initial launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-free-update-adds-more-weapons-and-enemies-to-the-chaos">updates for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment have added additional weapons</a>, as well as new Vicious enemies. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex took Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment out for a spin</a> ahead of its release last year, calling it the series' "richest offering yet".</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo-related news, just yesterday we got another look at the company's upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-2026">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>. Here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-unveils-new-characters-that-do-not-disappoint">we got our first look at Yoshi as well as a very feisty Birdo</a>.</p>

            <p>Old School <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>, the ancient MMO <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/with-a-new-record-240-000-players-online-old-school-runescape-is-roughly-8x-bigger-than-its-sister-mmo-and-would-be-the-fourth-biggest-game-on-all-of-steam-if-not-for-a-technicality/">that's still proving to be incredibly popular all these years later</a>, is getting its fourth raid later this year: The Fractured Archive.</p>
<p>Revealed during the Winter Summit event over the weekend, The Fractured Archive is described as the game's "toughest one yet", and will allow between 2-8 players to take on a new collection of bosses deep underground. It will also be soloable, but doing so will prove quite daunting.</p>
<p>Set to release in late 2026, The Fractured Archive will require the completion of the Tears of Guthix quest. Initially, if your entire party dies against a boss the raid will reset, which should add an additional layer of difficulty to the shindig. Eventually, this will shift to a different system, where wipes incur penalties to the loot you get at the raid's conclusion.</p>

<p>That's not all announced during the summit. The game is getting a new limited-time League called Demonic Pacts. In this, players will be able to modify their usual journey over eight weeks. Through completing certain tasks, powerful pacts can be unlocked that flip the typical rules of the game on their head, and help you to collect unique rewards.</p><p>Finally, there's a new bovine-based boss that could be added to the game incredibly soon depending on whether the community approves it in upcoming polls. Aiming to be a new early game challenge, a Bull fight has been created in a Game Jam session and would bring with it a new quest, a bottomless milk bucket, cow slippers, and a cow pet if given the go-ahead by Old School RuneScape players.</p>
<p>Indeed it seems like there's a lot going on in this British MMO, which maintains a strong community all these years later. If you're curious as to why, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/old-school-runescape-interview-why-people-still-playing-25-years-later">you can read Eurogamer's interview with its developers here</a>.</p>

<p>The Japanese release, however, pencilled in for 24th April, has not been moved.</p>
<p>"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will move from April 3, 2026, to April 1, 2026 in the US and many additional markets globally, and will be released on April 24, 2026, in Japan, with select territories releasing throughout April," Nintendo announced, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-brought-forward-in-global-alignment/">VGC</a>.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-unveils-new-characters-that-do-not-disappoint">Nintendo unveiled a new trailer showcasing the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, giving us our first look at the previously-leaked Yoshi and Birdo.</p>
<p>The two-minute preview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-super-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-direct-coming-this-sunday">which debuted overnight,</a> was introduced by Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, and sees Mario and Luigi pull up to investigate a "troubled pipe". We also get our first peek at Yoshi and Birdo.</p>
<p>As well as the usual gaggle of characters, the upcoming animated sequel will also see Bowser Junior and Rosalina joining the chaos, the latter of which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">is being voiced by long-time Nintendo fan</a>, Brie Larson.</p>
<p>Animation studio Illumination's first movie adaptation, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, proved to be a huge hit when it released in 2023, grossing over $1bn worldwide.</p>

            <p>A familiar face is on its way to Resident Evil Survival Unit, one that will no doubt delight Albert Wesker (if you know, you know): Rebecca Chambers.</p>
<p>Described as "a chemistry expert who flew through university at a young age", the Legendary character Rebecca brings her sharp intellect and specialism to the team, including a raft of exploration and field skills to help you out.</p>

<p>Here's what Rebecca has to offer, with the '?' denoting a value that scales based on the character's level:</p>

</figure>
<blockquote><p><strong>Exploration:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lv.?: First Aid Spray: uses a healing medical spray on a single ally, recovering HP equal to ?% of Rebecca's Attack.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Molotov Cocktail: Every 20 seconds, lobs a Molotov cocktail. When the Molotov cocktail lands, it sets the area on fire for 10 seconds, dealing damage equal to ?% of Attach per second to any enemies within the area. Enemies affected by the flames are burned, taking damage equal to ?% of Attack per second for five seconds.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Herbal Mix: Every 12 seconds, Rebecca mixes herbs, recovering HP equal to ?% of Rebecca's Attack for all allies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Field:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lv.?: Combat Medical Expertise: Increases the attack of the deployed squad by ?% and Defense by ?%.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Stimulant: When deployed Allied squad attacks, there is a 25% chance to deal ?% increased damage.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Anesthetic: When deployed Allied squad attacks, there is a 40% chance to take ?% reduced damage.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The team did not confirm specifically when Chambers would be reporting for duty, but she's apparently "headed your way soon".</p>
<p>Capcom reckons Resident Evil: Survival Unit offers "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-survival-unit-stars-a-bunch-of-your-favourites-including-leon-jill-claire-and-the-real-mvp-barry-burton">a fresh, mobile-first gameplay experience</a> that diverges from the traditional survival horror format of the main series". It has already been downloaded over a million times.</p>

            <p>An unannounced Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition has popped up on the Australian Classification Board.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition">The Australian government has rated it a 'G'</a> - the equivalent to the UK's 'U' - for its "very mild impact" violence. It's reportedly coming to both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch, with Atari listed as both the developer and publisher.</p>

<p>Rumour has it Ubisoft is also working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rayman-legends">Rayman Legends</a> remake, although it's now unclear if those plans have been scuppered by Ubisoft's "reset" in which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a>, including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. The news wiped<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years"> over a third off its share price</a>.</p><p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, towards the end of last year, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-series-returns-to-life-on-its-30th-anniversary-but-dont-expect-a-new-game-soon">and provided a little teaser of what's to come</a>. In a video posted on the official Rayman X account, which had been dormant for years prior to the announcement, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Gounon also announced Ubisoft will be sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews, concept art, and more.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has wiped over a third off its share price after announcing a "reset" would close down two studios and cancel six games.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-shares-plummet-to-lowest-price-in-over-14-years-amid-its-recently-announced-restructuring-centered-on-cancellations-layoffs-and-generative-ai/">PC Gamer</a>), the stock price had progressively declined since the pandemic, but on Thursday - the day after its announcement - it plummeted another 34 percent. It's the lowest share price the company has had since 2011, when it reported losses in the multi-millions, and closed at just €4.06. Just seven days prior, the share price was €6.89.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a> - including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake - last week as part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games. Described as a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", the publisher/developer said the cuts come as it struggles to compete in a "persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape".</p>
<p>As well as the six cancellations, Ubisoft has also confirmed it is delaying seven unspecified games "to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met" and to "maximise long-term value creation". Though not confirmed, it's widely believed that this includes the unannounced but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">much-rumoured Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>.</p>
<p>All this has led Ubisoft to revise its guidance for the full financial year, saying it now expects net bookings of around €1.5bn - a reduction of €330m.</p>
<p>As Matt reported for us at the time, the restructuring will now see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", respectively focused on "scaling and extending" its biggest properties (including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six); on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences (The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell); on live experiences (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones); on immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes (Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil), and on casual and family games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">Former Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté is reportedly suing Ubisoft following a surprise and suspicious departure from the company last year</a>.</p>

            <p>Dataminers believe they've found evidence that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has changed the ending to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3.</p>
<p>Though the game isn't even out yet, some dataminers claim to have discovered the full script hidden in the playable demo, suggesting the ending has been revised.</p>
<p><strong>The report that follows contains HUGE spoilers for Yakuza 3, so only proceed if you're happy to be spoiled!</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the original Yakuza 3, the game's main antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, plummets to his death, taking fellow bad guy Andre Richardson with him, and setting up the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-4">Yakuza 4</a>. Now, however, if the claims are true, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qk5rws/yakuza_3_kiwami_script_leak/">Mine miraculously survives the fall</a> and joins the Daidoji, with a considerable knock-on effect on the rest of the franchise. Dark Ties, a spin-off game bundled in with Yakuza Kiwami 3, is a prequel starring Mine (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-ending-leaked/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"The ending for Dark Ties has been leaked and has massively retconed the end of the game to the point where it rectons something in Yakuza 4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qm2kzp/comment/o1ivapa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one player. Another said they had "definite proof" regarding the amended conclusion, writing: "I was sceptic first, but after having datamined the demo myself with a datamining tool and exploring the auth file (for anyone trying themselves -&gt; par decomp. -&gt; data and db.bis.en-&gt; Auth file), I found the proof for the new end."</p>
<p>Back in September, though, the studio said there "won't be any major changes to the story", but did suggest we'd get to learn more about the motivations behind why certain characters behave the way that they do.</p>
<p>The silver lining, I guess, is that we don't have long to wait to find out if this is just a troll kicking up trouble or that the game's conclusion really has changed: Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is set to release for PC, PS5, Xbox Series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and last-gen consoles on 12th February, 2026.</p>
<p>This latest furore comes on top of pressure from fans to remove Teruyuki Kagawa, who portrays Goh Hamazaki, from the cast after he <a href="https://kbizoom.com/roppongi-class-teruyuki-kagawa-admits-sexual-harassment-of-a-female-club-employee/">admitted</a> to sexual misconduct and forcibly touched a woman without consent in 2019.</p>
<p>Last weekend, we learned<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-3-remastered-will-not-be-available-to-buy-as-a-standalone-game-after-yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-releases-next-month"> Yakuza 3 Remastered will no longer be available as a standalone purchase after Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties releases next month</a>. While people who already own the game will "still be able to continue playing it", "those new to the series who wish to experience the original version" will only be able to play it if they buy the whole Yakua Complete Series bundle.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has unveiled a new trailer showcasing the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie, giving us our first look at Yoshi and, I'm delighted to report, Birdo.</p>
<p>The two-minute preview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-super-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-direct-coming-this-sunday">which debuted overnight,</a> was introduced by Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, and sees Mario and Luigi - seemingly cosplaying as Dune characters - pull up in the Tostarena Kingdom to address a "troubled pipe". Complete with the score we all know so well, the brothers enter what appears to be an ancient temple and meet a very familiar face.</p>
<p>You can check it out below:</p>

<p>We also get to see Baby Mario and Luigi, Peach, Toad, Birdo, and catch Luigi ribbeting in a Frog Suit.</p>
<p>"After the first trailer was released, people were asking, is Yoshi not going to be in the movie?" Miyamoto explained. "Of course he's in it! For over 30 years, Yoshi has been a significant part of Mario's adventure.</p>
<p>"When we began developing Super Mario World, Yoshi was created from the idea of wanting to run around while on a small dinosaur. Mr. Kondo added percussion to the background music, and Yoshi - who's fun to use for running, jumping, stomping, eating things, and laying eggs - was born.</p>
<p>"Even after evolving into 3D, Yoshi has continued to play an active role across different games."</p>
<p>Illumination's Chris Meledandri also confirmed that animation has now been "fully completed", and the movie has moved into post-production, with teams now focused on music and sound design, which includes a 70-piece orchestra.</p>
<p>Along with Mario and Luigi, the upcoming animated sequel will also see Bowser Junior and Rosalina joining the chaos, the latter of which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">is being voiced by long-time Nintendo fan</a>, Brie Larson.</p>

            <p>Can you believe it's been over a decade and a half since the last proper Fable? That's a long wait for anything, but in the world of video games, it's a lifetime - from technological advancements to audience expectations, things have changed a lot since 2010! Which, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">this week's big Fable 2026 reveal</a>, has led to some enthused discussion here at Eurogamer about whether the classic series should really look quite so familiar some 16 years on. Yup, it's the return of The Big Question, in which we dive into a topical thing generating some chatter here in the figurative EG office and then throw it over to you...</p>
<p>Fable's long-awaited reboot marks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> studio Playground Games' first foray into the action-RPG genre. And while it's officially a "new beginning" for original developer Lionhead's beloved series, it still centred on Albion - a whimsical fantasy world of brave adventurers, exotic British accents, and the kinds of magical creatures who'd rather kill you than spend any time getting to know you at all. But unlike earlier games in the series, Albion is this time a proper, seamless open-world.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a peek at the new Fable.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5qWGaqzk98" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond that, it's all very familiar, promising a mix of humour, action, drama, moral dilemmas, and - of course - chickens. And the series' famed reactivity is back too, with player choices (as they dance merrily across the good-evil spectrum) impacting everything from the landscape to the way the population responds. But as lovely as the whole thing unquestionably looks, and as reassuring as it is to see the bulk of Fable's 'be the hero you want to be' essence survive the passing of time (minus, it seems, the old mechanic of your actions altering your appearance), our Bertie - troublemaker that he is - has found himself wishing for a little bit <em>more</em>.</p><p>"I'm excited to see Fable again - and a Fable with possibly the best thatched roofs I've ever seen! - but I'm not as excited as I thought I'd be, "he explains. "Fable, to me, was always a series accompanied by eccentric ambition. Each instalment wasn't only about presenting a fairytale world full of 'oi!'s, 'wanker!'s, and other Britishisms, but about re-evaluating role-playing games - questioning them and asking them what more they could do. That's what Fable represented to me. Some of the ways it did this are laughable now - that acorn promise is infamous - but it was still indicative of how Lionhead approached the series."</p>
<p>"But Fable, the reboot, seems more like an homage to the series rather than a progressive instalment in it," Bertie reckons. "It's a game that screams trepidation to me. It's assurance after assurance that the series is in good hands, that Playground understands Fable. And credit where credit's due: all the bullet-point features of Fable were there in the showcase, all the eccentric trimmings, and very handsome it looked too. But watching that presentation also felt like looking back in time and seeing a game from the past. Yes, that was Fable I saw, but it was Fable from 15 or 20 years ago. In which ways was it boldly pushing RPGs on?"</p>

<p>Victoria, though, thinks new-Fable's adherence to the past is absolutely the right call. "I flirted with the originals at a friends' house," she explains, "and though I've never completed any of them myself, I'm still looking forward to Playground Games' reboot. Leaning into the nostalgia and matching what everyone loved about the series the first time around, rather than trying to come out with something totally leftfield, is a smart move because - and please don't hate me for saying this - I just don't think the Fable brand is a strong enough pull without it."</p><p>As for me (as much as I'm permitted to have an opinion here in my vague role as disembodied ringmaster), it's not the stuff that's the <em>same</em> I've been thinking about, but everything else - I'm just hopeful we'll finally get an overarching Fable adventure that feels like it's had as much attention lavished on it as its simmy, reactive core.
</p>
<p>Fable 1 felt awash with conspicuous dead-ends, awkwardly truncated quest lines, undercooked mechanics, and even explicit teases toward an entire dragon-slaying additional act that never showed up. Until, that is, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-lost-chapters">Fable: The Lost Chapters</a> arrived a few years later with all the missing bits restored. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-iii">Fable 3</a>, I seem to recall, with its grand promise of royal assent and ultimate power, fizzled out in deeply unsatisfactory fashion, rushing through its third act in a series of playable bullet points before lunging to a credit roll. Give me all the fun, familiar bits of Fable we saw in this week's showcase - the choice-and-consequence, the simmy stuff, the silly humour - but pair it with a fully fleshed out adventure with room to breathe and I'll be thrilled. And, given the reboot's now near-decade of development, my hopes are high. But what do I know? As those charming Albionions loved to remind, I'm just a chicken-chaser.</p>

<p>Which just leaves Tom, Eurogamer's self-styled 'biggest Xbox fan' - and he's more than happy with what he saw. "I don't know what this lot are on about - worriers, the lot of them!" he exclaims (before quietly acknowledging this particular Big Question was his idea). "I watched the Fable showcase and immediately just wanted to play it. I'm having a bit of a gaming lull at the moment, unable to really find the enthusiasm for anything in my massive backlog, and I felt something lift as I took in what Playground Games has created. I appreciate this new Fable isn't going to be all things to everyone, but it's jumped to the top of my most anticipated list - which is saying a lot given I love Forza Horizon, and number 6 is looking splendid."</p><p>So that's us all Fabled out for the time being, and now it's over to you. Based on this week's first proper look at Playground Games' long-awaited Fable reboot, are you delighted to see so much of the old series back, or, like Bertie, were you hoping for something more radical a decade and a half on? <em>Or</em> perhaps this is your very first Fable and, unbound by nostalgia, you're just excited to experience it all. Let's have a chin-wag below!</p>

            <p>Highguard is set to pull back the curtain with an "in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio" on 26th January, which also just so happens to be the same day the free-to-play live-service hero shooter is expected to launch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qR9Xbzt5t0">"official launch showcase"</a> will reportedly include a "full gameplay deep dive", plus plans for the game's inaugural year and "much more", which is just as well, as we have heard extraordinarily little about the all-new PvP raid shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">since its announcement trailer</a> at last month's The Game Awards, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite buying time to showcase the game at The Game Awards (or maybe because of it?), developer Wildlight Entertainment has shared very little since, which means we're just a few days off from release with just a 180-second reveal trailer to show for it. If it wasn't for the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-shows-signs-of-life-less-than-one-week-away-from-launch">Steam activity has picked up in recent days</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">PS5 trophy list</a> has popped up, you'd be forgiven for thinking it had been delayed.</p><p>Hailing from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, Highguard is a PvP raid shooter which will see players "ride, fight, and raid as Wardens". That is to say, "arcane gunslingers" who have been sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Hopefully we'll find out more when the showcase goes live at 6pm UK time on Monday, 26th January.</p>
<p>As for that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">PlayStation 5 trophy list for Highguard</a>? There'll be 33 PS5 trophies in total, including Plunderer, which is awarded when a player opens and acquires loot from at least 15 chests in a single match, and Animal Control for eliminating 20 enemy mounts.</p>

            <p>Despite the death threats he faced when first deciding to bring Konami's horror franchise to the big screen, director of the third Silent Hill movie, Return to Silent Hill, would be open to adapting a further game for the big screen.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/features/return-to-silent-hill-director-death-threats-game-fans-1236638923/">Variety</a>, director Christophe Gans said that whilst critics panned 2006's Silent Hill adaptation, "the reputation of the movie has grown", giving him a new audience in the "2.0 generation of Silent Hill lovers" that he hopes to tap into for this new adaptation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>

<p>"If I have the opportunity, we'll come back to Silent Hill once more," he said. "I'm not looking at Silent Hill only as a great video game. I'm looking at it as a piece of modern art. It has something really edgy and experimental. I will adapt another chapter because there are some that are extremely good, something very different from the first film, and now Return to Silent Hill. I like this world, and I can see that plenty of people are thinking I'm doing a pretty good job."</p>
<p>Gans also revealed that when he announced interest in adapting the series for 2006's Silent Hill, he received "plenty" of death threats.</p>
<p>"It was a big challenge to adapt correctly and respectfully a game which is considered a classic," Gans added. "We know that the people who love video games are very passionate. I remember when I did the first film, I received plenty of death threats. People were saying, 'If you mess up this one, we are going to find you.' So I came onto the first film with great responsibility, and certainly even more with the second one. At the same time, it was important for me to imagine a movie that people who are not playing games can be interested in."</p><p>Return to Silent Hill is part of a resurgence of Konami's horror franchise, following the success of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. Unfortunately, it's not faring much better than its panned predecessor, Silent Hill Revelation: at the time of writing, it's sitting at 31 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/return-to-silent-hill/">Metacritic</a> (and a 4.4 user score), and 15 on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (30% user score). Admittedly, it's only the end of January, but that makes it the worst-reviewed movie of the year to date on both Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/movie/?releaseYearMin=2025&amp;releaseYearMax=2026&amp;page=20">one of the worst released over the last 12 months</a>.</p>
<p>By comparison, Silent Hill: Revelation has a Metacritic score of 16 (4.5 from users).</p>

            <p>Bethesda is working to "address some of the topics that appeared" after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> update released earlier this week.</p>
<p>The update was supposed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-gets-another-hefty-patch-complete-with-ghoulish-fixes-and-quest-improvements">address a number of issues across quests, localisation, armour, and more</a>. However, the team has already had to disable the Weekly Raid Challenge due to reports that "the challenge was automatically completing, which resulted in rewards not being obtainable".</p>
<p>The developer says it is now "looking into" your reports and is using community feedback to identify a list of topics that "we plan to address in an update that is currently planned for release during the first week of February".</p>

<p>Here's the full list of changes known so far:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Build Menu appearing empty due to a skin applied to the C.A.M.P. Module.</li>
<li>The “New” category of the Pip-Boy acting erratically.</li>
<li>Grunt and Head Hunts only providing 1-Star enemies.</li>
<li>C.A.M.P. items that were purchased with Gold Bullion not appearing</li>
<li>Cryo Status effects and damage not applying to enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're continuing to investigate reports on other topics such as, Armor resistances not applying unless re-equipped and players feeling “squishier” when fighting enemies in the Burring Springs region.</p>
<p>There were a couple of changes that went undocumented in our release notes on Tuesday. We wanted to highlight these changes to make sure everyone knows that they were intended.</p>
<ul>
<li>New 4-Star Legendary Mod “Charged” has been added to items awarded in the Gleaming Depths raid.</li>
<li>This Melee only mod charges up the weapon with primary attacks. You can release this explosive charge with a power attack.</li>
<li>Dom Pedro has received two new mods. Reflex Sight and a Long Barrel mod. These mods are available for all owners of the weapon.</li>
<li>Known Issue: The Weekly Raid Challenge has been temporarily disabled due to reports that the challenge was automatically completing which resulted in rewards not being obtainable.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Beyond that mention of the first week of February, as yet there's no firm commitment to a release date.</p>
<p>As Victoria reminded us in the week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">Fallout games are seeing resurgence of late</a>, thanks to the season two debut of Amazon's Fallout TV series. Picking up after the events of season one, we have all been reunited with Lucy, The Ghoul and Maximus, as they continue to make their way through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p>Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>. Filming for the third season of Fallout <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">is expected to begin this May</a>.</p>

            <p>Arknights Endfield is the latest big release in the world of gacha games and, believe it or not, it appears to be a genuinely invigorating experience. What makes it so special? Well, for me it comes down to three major merits: the style, the action, and a base-building component that separates it from its peers.</p>

<p>Lets start with the style of Arknights Endfield because, I've got to say, it immediately grabbed me. It's a sci-fi action game which itself isn't too unique within the subgenre, but it has this practical neo-futurism aesthetic that makes each character - playable and otherwise - pretty darn fashionable.</p>
<p>High-end street wear blends with refined, boutique weaponry in a  slick space-age setting. It's a joy to look around, to navigate the world and just take it all in. I can safely say that Arknights Endfield is one of the most gorgeous games among its peers, just on aesthetics alone. It doesn't require a monster rig to play either, running just fine on my somewhat decent PC.</p>

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Here's the release date for Arknights Endfield!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ00ggFb8A0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>When you get into the actual combat portions of the game, you're gradually introduced to a proper celebration of squad-focused melee action. The way it works itself is basic enough; a standard attack string, a special move, and an ultimate attack. But with four characters attached to your team at any one time, the way each party member switches from fighting autonomously to jumping in performs combo attacks upon specific triggers.</p><p>Arknights Endfield nails the feeling that you're controlling a squad working in tandem, rather than four separate individuals you have to micromanage. As you progress through the game, unlocking more characters opens up a stimulating team management experience, in which you can mix and match squadmates based on their class type and elemental modifiers.</p>
<p>While that's all well and good, this game's particular quirk that firmly sets it apart from its ilk is a base construction and management system. If you've ever had a taste for Factorio or some similar style of base management, this could be the action game for you. Figuring out the perfect position for specific buildings, connecting them all together to create these hubs of manufacturing is like a whole other enticing game bolted onto this one. The way you can go out for a mission, and have a bustling construction project pumping away in the background, then heading back to receive heaps of new useful materials was where Arknights Endfield clicked for me.
</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The game just has a killer look to it. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If I were to compare it to other big hitters out there, your <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a>, I'd easily place it up alongside those titles in terms of quality. It's obviously early days, things can go better or worse, but in terms of first impressions I think the developers at Hyperglyph have done a truly solid job here.
</p><p>Now, this is a gacha game, which means the best weapons and characters <em>are </em>locked behind banners that can be bought with in-game and real-world currency. This game does feel a little stingy for a release-day gacha, with the chances of you getting your hands on all of the limited-run characters without busting out the wallet seeming quite unlikely.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, not having access to all this stuff didn't feel too bad in terms of progressing through the game, but it's still a factor worth considering for those looking to invest a lot of time into a brand-new release. It comes with the territory certainly, but if you're not used to this kind of monetisation system it's worth keeping in mind before you jump in.</p>
<p>At launch, Arknights Endfield feels like a really solid release, with room to build momentum leading in 2026. All three of its best aspects work in tandem to create a game that's worth playing for anyone with a hunger for a new action title.</p>
<p>Arknights Endfield is available on PC, PS5, and Mobile platforms.</p>

<p>My husband and I started watching Better Call Saul recently (late to the party, I know). After watching the first handful of episodes and morphing into that Leonardo DiCaprio pointing meme for all the Breaking Bad cameos, there was still one face I couldn't quite place: the Salamanca drug cartel's Nacho Varga. There was something about him that was so familiar, but I couldn't think of any other shows I had seen the actor in. It was bugging me. And then, it hit me. He's only ruddy Vaas from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Far Cry 3</a>!!</p><p>I excitedly turned to my husband. "I know where I know him from!" I cried triumphantly, before hurriedly googling Vaas to show him. "That's great..." my husband smiled in polite acknowledgement, turning his attention right back to Better Call Saul. But, I wasn't done. "No seriously," I prodded him, "Michael Mando is <em>so </em>good in Far Cry. Well, his character is terrible but <em>he </em>is so<em> </em>good. Vaas is easily one of the best baddies out there."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh," came my husband's nonchalant reply. This lack of enthusiasm and appreciation from the man I have vowed to love and care for in sickness and in health, for the rest of our days, did not sit well with me. So I came up with a plan. "I will show you how good he is," I proclaimed.</p>
<p>And that's how I find myself replaying Far Cry 3.</p>

<p>I dusted off my 3DS XL last weekend and while I had forgotten some of the games I owned for it, I could never forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a>. My home was in a state when I logged back in and the majority of the ground was covered in weeds, but not everything had been worsened by time.</p><p>I had left Bells in my account at the Post Office, with my last save file marked as 2021, and the Bells hadn't idly sat there for the last five years. I'd earned 99,999 Bells in interest by ignoring my game entirely!</p>
<p>There's something nice about returning to an old game to find a shiny reward waiting for you.</p>

<h2>Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<p>The 3.0 update to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> has seen me finally return to the game, only to find that I couldn't even access the updated content because my measly island - which I unfortunately reset a few months ago assuming no more updates were coming - was not yet three stars.</p><p>So, my evenings this week have seen me time-traveling back and forth without a single hint of shame in an attempt to get a three-star island. Then, rather than visiting the Resort Hotel that I reinstalled the game for, I spent my time terraforming. I hate terraforming with a passion, but once you have a vision for your New Horizons island, there's no going back. I'll probably be at this for the next month. Wish me luck.</p>

<h2>Old School RuneScape, PC and Mobile</h2>
<p>My saga playing Old School <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> continues. This time, with a twist of slight public humiliation. That or paranoia.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the game on my phone so I can take it on the go and do basic repetitive content during dead minutes commuting or walking around the shops. It turns out, Old School RuneScape is a pretty solid choice during workouts, especially if you're on the treadmill.</p><p>Except! Except when someone takes the treadmill next to you and peeks at what you're playing. Some lady - no shade to her I'm sure she's a very normal and well adjusted person - looked over briefly at what was on my phone and saw RuneScape. I saw her do this. She didn't say anything, but <em>I </em>saw that <em>she </em>saw.</p>
<p>She, clearly able to power-walk for longer than the five minutes she was there, got off the treadmill. Maybe she was just warming up or warming down, maybe she wasn't feeling the treadmill. Or maybe she saw my unkempt hair and tight shirt, my big ol' beard and RuneScape playing on the phone and thought: nah.</p>
<p>Or perhaps she saw I was grinding mining in Motherlode Mine in prospectors instead of Varrock Armour 4, and was disgusted in my lack of optimisation.</p>
<p>Either way, I'm level 77 mining now.</p>

<p>I can't remember if I came up with this thought or if I stole it from someone else, and that I'm even suggesting the latter probably means that I did, in fact, pinch it. But something I've been thinking a lot about recently - and it's a pertinent topic given the general rampage of gen-AI - is recognising thought in things. Human thought.</p><p>Konstantinos Dimopoulos! That's who said it. He's a game designer and "urbanist", which is the best job title, and I spoke to him a year or so back for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-is-qualified-to-make-a-world-in-search-of-the-magic-of-maps">an article about making maps</a>, which was really an article about creating game worlds. He advises game-makers about city design, both in terms of making them feel realistic and in playing well. There's a whole science to it. But the thing that struck me when we talked was how every aspect of a city was designed or thought about by someone, that it didn't just come to be. Someone had leant against their fancy architectural drawing table, twiddling on some tweed, and thought about how we'd experience something. And that in turn meant that whenever I went in the world, wherever I sat or walked, there would be layers of thought around me. Ooh it gives me shivers thinking about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tr-49-review">TR-49 is like this, Inkle's new game</a>. There's an obvious thematic link there because the strange archival computer you use in the game was designed by characters who left their imprint upon it, and their story is an important part of the point of the game. But there's a hidden link, too, in the game's code. It's this idea that a developer has walked my path through the game before me, or at least considered I might walk it, and therefore has put things there for me to enjoy. Everything I find in the game, then, every little clue and fragment of an archive, has been placed by someone for a specific reason - to elicit a reaction, to impart a clue, to tell a story. What the reason is, I have to work out - I've made it a little game for myself. A game within a game. Guess what the creator meant. Try it, you might be pleasantly surprised.</p>

            <p>The creator of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> VR mod, as well as a variety of other R.E.A.L VR mods, has taken his works down from Patreon after receiving another DMCA strike. This time, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> developer 505 Games.</p>
<p>Luke Ross, the creator of many VR mods for games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> and others, issued a post on his Patreon explaining the situation to his supporters.</p>
<p>It reads: "DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they 'believe' their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like -- and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process."</p>

<p>The post continues: "In light of the above facts, I'm being forced to take immediate action. I'm making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims."

"And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time." Ross also stated his Patreon account is at risk of termination due to repeated DMCA strikes, resulting in his decision to strip his account of all of his VR mods."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-removed-by-cd-projekt-after-its-creator-wouldnt-release-it-for-free">This comes following a previous DMCA strike from CD Projekt Red</a>, which claimed Ross' Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod broke its fan works guidelines and as such was a breach of its intellectual property. Ross kicked back at the claim, but nonetheless took the mod down. He then felt he was being punished by pirates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-creator-says-hes-being-punished-by-pirates-after-mod-take-down">who were sharing around his work without contributing to his Patreon account to "punish" him</a>, according to Ross.</p>

            <p>
If you're one of the 200K+ people who've already excitedly wish-listed Vampire Survivors' much-anticipated deck-building spin-off Vampire Crawlers, there's some good news to carry you into the weekend: a demo is arriving for Steam and Xbox Game Pass on 23rd February.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Crawlers was officially unveiled last November, with developer Poncle describing it as "hopefully the first of a series of spin-offs" set in the Vampire Survivors universe. The idea, it said at the time, was to take some of the "accidental" core pillars of the mega-popular original - that its "accessibility, immediacy, affordability, replayability, lightheartedness, and tons of flashy stuff" - and apply them to different genres.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Here's an energetic little peek at Vampire Crawlers in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ael4oMaKQM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
And thus, Vampire Crawlers - a "turbo turn‑based, card‑driven BLOBBER with rogue-lite elements". It is, says Poncle, a game about building "busted" deck and exploring familiar dungeons (albeit this time with "functioning walls"), with Vampire Crawlers designed to work both as a slower, more tactical experience, and as a speedier game. "You don't have to pause for animations to complete before triggering your next move," the studio explains. "The game intelligently stacks and executes your ability inputs with precision, allowing you to play at your own chaotic pace. "
</p>
<p>
"Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards," it adds. "Headbutt chests for customisation gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game."
</p>
<p>
Vampire Crawlers doesn't yet have a release date, but it's scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Switch, PC, iOS, and Android sometime this year. Impatient sorts, however, can get a taste of its deck-building dungeon-crawling more imminently, with a demo coming to Xbox Game Pass and PC (the latter arriving as part of Steam's latest Next Fest) on 23rd February. 
</p><p>
And for more immediate gratification, today sees the release of Poncle's first Let's Explore Vampire Crawlers video series, showing off some of the gameplay and features players can expect from the full game when it arrives. More videos, the studio says, will follow. Surely there's only one question that needs answering though: will we get any vampires this time?

            <p>Big Hops is a 3D platform game about a frog, but it’s also a 3D platform game about 3D platform games. This seems almost inevitable when it comes to this most nostalgic of video game genres. But what marks Big Hops out, I think, is the sheer enthusiasm with which it explores the genre’s past, along with the invention and imagination with which it brings a panoramically broad range of influences together.</p>

<p>To put it another way, here is a wonderful blend of movement abilities and creative environments, enlivened by excellent memory and taste. When it comes to the abilities, the most striking is probably your frog’s tongue, which can latch on to levers to pull them and fruit to collect them, but which can also be used to swing you between grapple points when you’re high in the sky. There’s something of Insomniac’s Spider-Man to this, but there’s even more of Tomb Raider back in the Core and early Crystal Dynamics days: you position yourself, control your momentum and direction, and then close your eyes and jump. It’s thrilling.</p>



<p>Tomb Raider is perhaps the most striking influence on the game’s first few hours, in fact, a part of the game that I’m currently working through. The cartoon art might suggest platformers like Mario, and there’s of course plenty of that in the DNA, but the levels are huge and filled with puzzles, traversal and traversal puzzles. Within twenty minutes of learning how to jump and latch on to things with your tongue you’ll be scaling sheer walls and activating pop-out ledges. You’ll be using a variety of different jump mechanics - a float, a roll-jump, a squeeze-down high-jump - to navigate spaces that initially seem just out of reach. It’s the kind of game where you pick a point on the horizon and work out how best to get there, and that surprised me.</p><p>Exploration of large complex spaces brings Zelda-like components to the fore, with a stamina gauge that allows you to climb in limited bursts, but the game that I was really put in mind of again and again wasn’t a Nintendo joint but something older and weirder. In fact, it was a game made by Lara Croft’s creator, Toby Gard. It sometimes feels like Galleon is almost forgotten now - it was massively hyped and massively delayed back in the day, and when it arrived as an Xbox exclusive it looked rather odd and asked a lot of its players. But it was a fantastic, genre-evolving thing, a real work of passion and thought, and it offered a wide range of movement options through large, complicated spaces. <em>It asked a lot of its players</em>, which is high praise, and I feel like a great deal of its spirit is here, too, in this colourful game about moving a frog through familiar platforming biomes.</p>



<p>Playing Big Hops if you’re of a certain age is a slightly uncanny experience, actually, because every few minutes memories of a deep cut will suddenly return with that peculiar vividness you get from involuntarily latching on to something you haven’t thought about in years. There’s a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grow-home">Grow Home</a> in some of the plant-based tools you can deploy around the world to grow vines and place launch pads. There’s something of Mario Galaxy in sequences where the levels float in space and the platforms start to curve or become spherical. But as soon as you’re working out where you’ve seen something before, you’re marvelling at how elegantly it’s been repurposed, reworked and deployed. Big Hops has much more than just good taste.</p><p>I don’t know if you’ve ever had the experience of looking through someone’s record collection and realising that you’re getting a sense of who they are as a person. Big Hops feels a bit like that, I reckon. You’re flipping through all these lovely reference points, and yet a distinct portrait still emerges. Big Hops is willing to use everything it’s seen in platformers of the last thirty years, then, but it emerges, somehow, as entirely its own thing. It’s pretty great, all told.</p>

            <p>Pokémon developer Game Freak is working with multiple partner companies on its upcoming release, Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>During last night's Xbox Developer Direct, Game Freak gave us all another look at Beast of Reincarnation, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan. In Beast of Reincarnation, players take the role of Emma the Sealer, who along with her canine companion Koo will need to confront the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation all looks really rather promising, with many noting it was quite different and larger than Game Freak's other games outside of Pokémon. So, did the studio have to increase its numbers for the upcoming release? Well, not exactly. Rather, it has called in the help from a number of outside companies and fellow developers to get things going.</p>
<p>"The team is quite large, as you can imagine, but I will note that it's not all folks internally here at Game Freak," Beast of Reincarnation's game director told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>"We managed to seek out a lot of partner companies to work with us, companies, studios that are able to realise the vision of this game in the way that we wanted to make it, so we're lucky to have a lot of people working on it externally as well."</p><p>A PR further clarified with the publication that Game Freak's internal team working on Beast of Reincarnation is actually "relatively small". However, that team is made up of those in core direction and management roles, and who are leading the project.</p>

            <p>
Following its slam-dunk first season, Amazon's TV adaption of Fallout has, according to reports earlier this year, faced a bit of a sophomore slump in terms of viewership. But despite an apparent dip in popularity, Amazon has now revealed enough people are still tuning into the show that it's officially Prime Video's sixth biggest season of all time.
</p>
<p>
Back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-streaming-ratings-down">in January</a>, media valuation and data analytics company Nielsen reported that between 15th and 21st December, Fallout's season two premiere and eight earlier season one episodes managed to accumulate a combined 794m viewing minutes. That's a big number, but also well below the 2.9bn viewing minutes season one's eight episodes attracted in its opening week in April 2024. Further raising questions about Fallout's second season success is the fact Amazon - which was quick to talk up some impressive figures first time around - has been keeping quiet about the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
That, though, has now changed. While Amazon is still not talking specific viewership numbers, it's shared some comparative information giving at least some indication of just how well Fallout season two (which is being released weekly unlike season one, and which is yet to air its final two episodes) has so far done. As <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/fallout-season-2-viewership-update-explained-amazon-1236692296/">reported by Deadline</a>, Amazon is calling Fallout's latest instalment the top-performing season on Prime Video since Reacher Season 3, which debuted back in February 2025.
</p>
<p>
It's also being described as Prime Video's sixth biggest season of all time. That, if you're wondering, puts it behind the series' debut season, the first two seasons of Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and Reacher's second and third seasons. And if we're purely talking Prime Video's most successful <em>returning</em> seasons, Fallout Season 2 comes in at fourth place.
</p><p>
"We are thrilled with the Fallout S2 reception from audiences and critics globally," Peter Friedlander, Amazon MGM Studios' head of global TV, said to Deadline. "After its first four weeks, Fallout S2 already ranks as the sixth most watched season ever on Prime Video and is even higher rated on Rotten Tomatoes than S1. More than half of the season's audience to-date has come from outside the US, and we're excited for even more viewers to discover the show as we continue to release new episodes over the weeks ahead."
</p>
<p>
Regardless of season two's success, Amazon has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">committed to a third season</a>, with production due to start on 1st May, 2026. And whatever happens beyond that, it's clear the company continues to have confidence in the Fallout property. It's already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-newly-announced-fallout-reality-show-will-plop-competitors-inside-a-vault-to-find-out-just-how-special-they-are">announced a reality show based on the Fallout games</a> that'll see contestants living inside a real-life Vault. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, as it's known, will run for 10 episodes when it eventually airs on Prime Video.

            <p>Ubisoft has confirmed Beyond Good and Evil 2 - which it first announced almost two decades ago - remains a priority for the studio, and "fits with [its] strategy of focusing on Open World Adventures".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft left many in shock when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>

<p>One game to survive, though, was Beyond Good and Evil 2, which was first announced in its original form back in 2008, and last seen (at least publicly) during E3 2017 with an open-world slant. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, a Ubisoft spokesperson has said:</p>
<p>"Beyond Good and Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on Open World Adventures."</p>
<p>The studio's spokesperson added that within this market, "the fantasy genre is underserved". Therefore, Ubisoft has a "unique proposition" with its  Beyond Good and Evil sequel.</p>

</figure>
<p>It has not been an easy path for Beyond Good and Evil 2, though there has been some movement in recent years. In 2024, the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">got a new creative director</a>, with original creator Michel Ancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2s-troubled-development-due-to-passionate-managers-not-getting-along-says-creator-michel-ancel">saying the troubled development came down to "passionate managers" not getting along</a>.</p><p>Last year, meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unbelievably-17-years-after-its-original-announcement-ubisoft-appears-to-still-be-hiring-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2">job listing looking for a technical sound designer specifically for Beyond Good and Evil 2 was shared by Ubisoft</a>. At this time, we also got an updated description of what Beyond Good and Evil 2 will actually be:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Beyond Good and Evil 2 is an action-adventure open world game set in a captivating space opera universe and the direct prequel to the 2003 cult classic. Based on a breakthrough technology driven by the proprietary Voyager engine, Beyond Good and Evil 2 aims to offer a seamless experience of exploration and space piracy across a solar system full of exotic locations, colorful characters and mysteries to uncover, solo or with friends. So, if you are ready for an adventure like no other, come join forces with us to build System 3!"</p></blockquote>

<p>As for elsewhere at Ubisoft, this week's cancellations included the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">was only a few months from its planned release</a>. </p>
<p>While the team behind the remake has since called Sands of Time's cancellation "deeply disappointing" for fans and the development team, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">does not mean Ubisoft is "stepping away" from the Prince of Persia franchise for good</a>.</p>

            <p>Digital online PC game store GOG has acknowledged that it "damaged the trust our users have in us" when it abruptly removed the <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">acclaimed horror game Devotion</a> from sale just over five years ago.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski reflected on the decision after facing scrutiny for a comment he made - "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values" - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">an interview on Eurogamer</a> last week. That remark was made in relation to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">Horses, the provocative indie horror game</a> that GOG would sell when other storefronts Steam and Epic would not. But the comments contradicted the stance GOG took with Devotion in late 2020.</p>
<p>To recap: Devotion is a short, smart, 1980s-set Taiwanese-made horror game - "a genre landmark", we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devotion-review">our Devotion review</a> - initially released in early 2019 but pulled from sale after an outcry over the inclusion of unflattering references to China's president Xi Jinping. This had dramatic consequences in China - developer Red Candle's Weibo social media account was closed - and the game was yanked from sale on Steam.</p>

<p>Red Candle insisted the offending asset was only ever a placeholder. It apologised at length for it, and removed it, so things seemed to settle enough for a prospective re-release. This is where GOG comes in. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-under-fire-for-dramatic-u-turn-on-devotion-gog-release">GOG announced it would sell the game but then on the same day reversed the decision</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817?s=20">stating</a>: "After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store." Was it standing for the right values then?</p><p>Maciej Gołębiewski today said: "That situation remains difficult to reflect on. At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game to be released responsibly. In hindsight, we acknowledge that this decision - and the way we communicated it - understandably damaged the trust our users have in us.</p>
<blockquote><em>"When I say that we're ready to take a stand on the right values, I don't mean that we won't make mistakes"</em></blockquote>
<p>"But it's also important for us to be transparent," he added. "Keeping a global digital storefront operating means navigating legal, operational, and commercial realities that don't always allow for ideal outcomes. In 2020, we chose a path we believed was best for GOG, even though it came at a cost to our credibility."</p>
<p>The situation with Horses he said was different. That game was played by multiple GOG employees who agreed that it didn't pose any "legal, political, or operational risk to our business or partners". "There was no other concern driving this decision," Gołębiewski remarked, "just a straightforward evaluation of the game itself."</p><p>"When I say that we're ready to take a stand on the right values," he continued, "I don't mean that we won't make mistakes, or that every decision will be easy, or that we'll never face trade-offs. I do mean that with every given opportunity, we're striving to be clearer, more consistent, and more willing to stand behind our choices (including explaining them openly when they're being questioned)."</p>

<p>Gołębiewski's willingness to discuss the matter I believe shows a renewed push by GOG to be seen as open and approachable following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">its recent independence</a> - when it separated from the mothership CD Projekt, which it had always been a part of. GOG was under CD Projekt ownership when the Devotion situation occurred, so did that heap additional pressure on? CDP is a publicly traded company answerable to investors and had far bigger concerns to deal with at the time, such as righting the rocky launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>As a private company now, GOG is answerable only to new owner Michal Kiciński, who, coincidentally, was one of the original founders of CD Projekt <em>and</em> one of the people who launched GOG - Kiciński remains a major shareholder at CD Projekt but he hasn't actively worked there since 2012. Under his ownership, GOG is now autonomous and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">he's apparently not afraid of taking a risk</a>. Nothing major is set to change, but the company is looking into the possibility of branching into indie game publishing. A new era has begun.</p>

            <p>Sophie Turner is set to star as Lara Croft in the upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> from Amazon, and it sounds like beyond just costume aesthetics, the globe-trotting heroine will also be leaning into the character's more confident 90s personality as well.</p>
<p>In conversation with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-21/sophie-turner-steal">Los Angeles Times</a>, Turner said Amazon's Tomb Raider adaptation will not simply portray Lara as a "sex bombshell".</p>

<p>Rather, the show is about Lara "and her story and what drives her". It is not about how "hot she is in the games and the movies", Turner said, though she did acknowledge this is something "so many people also love about" the character as well.</p>
<p>"But I really want to show the other side," the Game of Thrones alum continued, calling Amazon's version of Lara Croft "so unashamedly capable".</p>
<p>"She is not a woman who hides her strengths at all," Turner closed. All I can say to that is, excellent!</p>
<p>Filming for the series - which along with Turner also stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Celia Imrie, Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver and Martin Bobb-Semple</a> - began earlier this week. Weaver previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>.</p>

Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p><p>For more, I recently shared my thoughts on why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2026-lara-croft-seems-to-be-returning-to-what-made-90s-tomb-raider-great-and-as-a-lifelong-fan-i-couldnt-be-more-excited">I believe 2026 is going to be a very good year for fellow Tomb Raider fans like myself</a>. Yep, I got a whole Lara love for Tomb Raider, and I don't care who knows it. </p>

            <p>The CWA-backed United Video Games union has written to the US Federal Trade Commission in opposition to the proposed acquisition of EA by private investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and various investment firms.</p>
<p>The letter, published on Action Network, lays out the case against the acquisition, stating that EA is not "a struggling company", and any jobs lost as a result of the sale would be: " a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors pockets -- not to strengthen the company."</p>
<p>They conclude the letter with a call for members of the US public to sign an accompanying petition, and to a request to members of the Federal Trade Commission who could potentially halt the deal, writing: "We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom."</p>

<p>Last December,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal"> EA shareholders approved the proposed deal for private investors to buy the company</a>. This left only US institutions like the Federal Trade Commission able to slow the deal down or block it. If approved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">EA will be almost entirely owned by the government wealth fund of Saudi Arabia</a>, a country that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">has been criticised due to its history of human rights violations</a>.</p><p>How likely is it that the US would block such a deal? Well, while some members of the government have criticised the deal, the Financial Times reported it will likely face little pushback <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">due to the involvement of the current president's Son-in-Law Jared Kushner</a>.</p>

            <p>Imagine sitting down with EA Sports FC and discovering your diddy little soccer-man doesn't want to kick the ball, or firing up your favourite FPS and finding your avatar's developed an aversion to guns. And what if Mario suddenly said no more turtles near his bottom? Chaos would ensue! But that's pretty much where we find ourselves in Earth Must Die; a point-and-click sci-fi comedy adventure from acclaimed studio Size Five Games that doesn't even bother with an inventory because its protagonist - VValak Lizardtongue, Grand Shepherd of the Tyrythian Empire - refuses to touch anything.</p>

<p>It's a novel design choice and one that immediately sets Earth Must Die apart, introducing an interesting dynamic to its more familiar point-and-click rhythms. Early on, for instance, amid a chaotic rebel incursion, VValak must engineer his ascent to the Tyrythian throne - not through force but by talking his twin older brothers into murdering each other. As protagonists go, he's just deliciously awful. But 300 years on, his tyrannical reign is not going well; Tyryth's reserves of Fabriconium are so low the planet can't even repel mosquitos. And, with a certain blue-green planet now on his radar, there's worse to come. VValak must find a solution, which, given his insistence on that whole 'no touching' thing, means a lot of indirect manipulation.</p>

<p>Pretty much every obstacle VValak faces in Earth Must Die can be solved through conversational coercion. Rather than spending your time hoovering up endless miscellanea with unknown purpose (as you might ordinarily do in these kinds of games), you'll charm, threaten, and trick characters - or, occassionally, voice-activated appliances - into doing your bidding, perhaps by craftily deploying information cunningly extracted elsewhere. And if you ever reach a conversational impasse, you'll find even more new avenues to explore and exploit by consulting the extensive lore database stored within VValak's gold-teated childhood nursing bot, Milky. Earth Must Die doesn't entirely jettison the genre's familiar conventions - you'll still spend your time plodding and clicking around the world looking for environmental hotspots that <em>someone</em> will need to interact with - but this is very much a dialogue-first kind of game.</p><p>Which would be a disaster if the writing was rubbish, but Size Five - the studio behind the acclaimed likes of Lair of the Clockwork God and Time Gentlemen, Please - has fine form when it comes to comedic point-and-click adventures. And Earth Must Die carries on that tradition, delivering a very British slice of absurd menace that's part dystopian satire, part Carry On film. There's a hint of Terry Pratchett, perhaps, in its elaborately whimsical world-building - browse Milky's Milkipedia, for instance, and you'll unearth lengthy entries on everything from Tyryth's powerful Orgymakers Guild to a species capable of turning into the thing most likely to amuse passersby to distract them from killing it. There's a touch of Douglas Adams too, especially in its vision of a bureaucracy stunted future (Earth Must Die's entire first act revolves around an increasingly convoluted attempt to push a button). And there's a sly intelligence beneath its frequent dick jokes and silly flights of fancy as it squeezes in some pointed observations about power - you're playing a fascist dictator after all.</p>



<p>It's good stuff, but it's not just the writing that sells Earth Must Die's whimsical dystopia; it looks and sounds great too. Those wonderfully kinetic backdrops and expressive animations are packed with character - a little bit classic LucasArts, a little bit Adult Swim - and its attention-grabbing cast list (crammed with contemporary British comedy talent including Matthew Holness, Tamsin Greig, Alex Horne, and Mike Wozniakis) is a real coup. It doesn't always work - the switch from professional voice actors to comedians with limited acting experience can be jarring - but the bulk of the enthusiastic cast acquits itself well. Plebs and Game of Thrones actor Joel Fry has a particularly tough task keeping on top of Earth Must Die's freewheeling script, but his VValak (sounding eerily like What We Do in the Shadows' Nandor) is enormous fun.</p><p>All of which might suggest an unequivocal slam dunk, but five hours in, I'm not completely sold. Chiefly, that's down to the puzzles, and the sometimes elusive logic that drives them. For the first few hours, it's all pretty straightforward - so much so, I was starting to suspect that in stripping away so many familiar point-and-click conventions, Size Five maybe hadn't left itself enough to play around with in order to keep things interesting. But after a certain point, there's a sudden swing in the other direction, and its increasingly elaborate puzzle chains become noticably cleverer and far more creative (here's looking at you, gory teleportation incident and subsequent orgy infiltration). But it also feels - and I'm still not sure if it's because I'm just not locked onto its wavelength, or if it's down to more specific design fumbles - like there are just a few too many information gaps and moments of unintuitive sequencing, leaving me blindly fumbling, trial-and-error style, my way through.</p>



<p>But it says a lot about the sheer quality elsewhere in Earth Must Die that, between the pockets of frustration, I'm still enjoying muddling forward. It's fun to be bad, and it's funny to play a villain struggling to suppress his villainous urges in the name of desperate, exasperated diplomacy. But more than anything, it's fun to surrender to Size Five's bawdy tangle of unpredictable satire and silliness - I've seen pulsating orifices here amid the nano-sized police states and shadowy string-pullers you wouldn't believe! And, honestly, how can I stay mad at a game when it includes bugs who vibrate so violently during their sexy mating rituals they've been harnessed into world-destroying bombs? Just remember: no touching.</p>

            <p>A new major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> suddenly dropped, bringing six new characters that will join the roster gradually, a new game mode, and various quality-of-life tweaks to the popular MOBA.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable addition in this update, dubbed Old Gods New Blood, is a faster-paced game mode called Street Brawl. A quick 4v4 alternative, the shopping system is streamlined down to a random selection each round. In addition resources are equalised across all players, with farming disabled.</p>
<p>The patrons have been given a proper redesign too, as do their minions, finally giving each team's endboss the makeover they've been sorely lacking. They are the Hidden King and the Archmother, two polar opposites with their own thematic arena.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then there's the six new characters. These are Silver, Rem, Graves, Apollo, Celeste, and Venator. Two of them will release per-week, with the first two hitting the game starting the 26th January. Players can vote to determine the release order, with votes earned by playing the game.</p><p>Once the heroes are out, a priority token system will be rolled out to help Deadlock players get an opportunity to try these newcomers out. There are also going to be in-game sprays for each newcomer available, so you can promote your vote in live matches. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>As for those quality-of-life changes, there are some absolute scorchers coming. A revamped post-game screen is on the way, alongside an adjustment to how the MVP is determined. More detailed post-game stats screens will help break down your performance, and UI overhauls are aiming to improve visibility and ease of play.</p>
<p>There's also a massive rework to the in-game settings, and ongoing map updates. You can read <a href="https://www.playdeadlock.com/oldgods">a full breakdown of all the changes and additions on the Deadlock website</a>.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the Deadlock community anticipated some big news would be dropping overnight, <a href="https://x.com/IntelDeadlock/status/2014435973485002770">thanks to a surge in activity at local pizza spots by the Valve office</a>. Much like the pentagon, it seems when the pizzas are rolling fresh and fast near Valve, something's afoot.</p>

            <p>
You can always count on Pyschonauts studio Double Fine to do something unexpected, and hot off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/keeper-review">last year's magical lighthouse adventure Keeper</a>, the team has unveiled its latest oddity, Kiln: a pottery themed party brawler making its way to Xbox Series X/S, PC, Game Pass, and PS5 this "spring".
</p>
<p>
In Kiln, players - in the role of a tiny spirit - must first create a pot from scratch before they're able to inhabit it, using an "easy and accessible" control scheme to quickly mold a lump of clay into the pot of their dreams. The idea is the shape and size of the pot they create will impact their abilities in the team-based multiplayer portion of the game.

<p>
In order to keep things balanced, though, pots sizes are limited to one of three weight classes: little pots are fast, while big pots are slow, with medium pots sitting somewhere in between. Additionally, Kiln features eight available shapes - including bottles, cups, and bowls - each with a unique special move, basic attack, and air attack. Cylinders, for instance, can slam the ground hammer-style, while plates can trick-shot and ricochet off enemies. And on top of those basic building blocks, pots can be personalised with glazes, patterns, stickers, and handles before going in the oven.
</p><p>
From there, it's off to The Wedge, which serves as a social hub for players between matches - and when it's time for battle to commence, participants can choose between a variety of modes and obstacle-strewn maps, the latter all inspired by ancient Greek or ancient Egyptian gods. At launch, Quench mode will be the focus, challenging two teams of four to jostle across the play space and put out their opponent's kiln while protecting their own. That's where pot size becomes relevant again, given a pot's capacity determines how much water they can hold - although, as <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">explained over on Xbox Wire</a>, greater capacity is balanced by less health.
</p>
<p>
And once a battle is over and a victor has been secured, it's back to The Wedge, where players can use their winnings to purchase the likes of trinkets and stickers to decorate their pots from the in-game store.
</p>
<p>
If that's got your curiosity piqued, you'll be able to fire up Kiln when it launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (including Steam), and Game Pass this "spring".

            <p>A release window for Fable has just been announced at the Xbox Developer Direct.</p>
<p>Following a new gameplay deep dive, it was revealed Fable will be releasing in Autumn 2026 on the Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>
<p>In addition, Playground Games presented a bunch of info about its first open world RPG. Apparently being packed with not only British humour, but also chickens and more, you start off in Fable as a child and the first hero in Albion in a generation.</p>
<p>Tragedy strikes as the village is turned to stone (including your nan), thus kicking off your adventure. Multiple regions in Fable were briefly shown off, including Bowerstone! This classic Fable city is returning in ample size, which is very exciting.</p>

<p>Strength, Skill, and Will returns at the core of the combat system, including a variety of weapon types that'll let you engage in fights the way you desire. Ranged and magic attacks are back too, filling distinct purposes in clashes with a range of new and returning enemy types.</p><p>Yes, you can marry people and have kids too, just like in the older games. You can buy houses and businesses too and horde your wealth. This is powered by what Playground is dubbing the Living Population system. There are more than 1,000 of them, they can all be spoken and interacted with, and their lives are impacted by your actions.</p>
<p>This ties into a reputation system, as well as a morality system too. Instead of a black-and-white morality system, this new Fable appears to be taking a more complicated approach to the actions you take. So if you're rich and buy lots of stuff, some folks will dig that and others certainly won't.</p>
<p>You can also kill Dave, played by Richard Ayoade, after he turns into a giant. His corpse will stick around in the world permanently, and will bring down house prices in the area. His sister also won't like you!</p>

            <p>It's a big day for Xbox fans, with Microsoft finally offering a closer look at some of its most anticipated titles, courtesy of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-2026-everything-announced">first Developer Direct of the year.</a> And that began with a fresh peek at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, bringing word of a 19th May release date on PC and Xbox, with a PS5 launch coming later this year.</p>
<p>For this latest entry in the world-hopping racing series, developer Playground Games is shifting the action to Japan, with the studio calling Forza Horizon 6's open-world map  the "largest" it's created for the series so far. It's said to reflect the country's diversity with areas both rural and urban, modern and traditional. It's also described as being "full of verticality", featuring roads inspired by the likes of C1 Loop, Gingko Avenue, and mountain passes including Mount Haruna and Bandai-Azuma.</p>

<p>It also features <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>'s "biggest urban area yet", with Tokyo City said to be five times larger than anything seen in the series so far. It also includes multiple districts, each with their own identity. And as players explore the world, they'll be able to collect cars, houses, landmarks, and mascots, all tracked in their Adventure Journal.</p><p>In terms of progression, players start Forza Horizon 6 as tourists who, after passing qualifiers, will slowly rise through the ranks by completing races in faster cars and unlocking new wristbands. In order to move up, they'll need to participate in "spectacular" events, including classic showcase events and "thrilling" new Rush obstacles courses. And once they've finally unlocked their gold wristband, they'll gain access to Legend Island, featuring exclusive events, tracks, and areas to explore.</p>
<p>Playground says Forza Horizon 6 will feature over 550 cars at launch - ranging from classic cars to the series' latest cover vehicle, the GR GT - bringing new body kits, new Forza Aero, and the ability to paint liveries on windows. The studio also says it's better balanced its roster across all performance classes, from D to the new R Class, which is designed for track-focused cars. There's also talk of better vehicle audio and improvements to how cars are affected by the world - including new cosmetic tire wear.</p>
<p>Cars, once acquired, can be stored in Forza Horizon 6's new customisable garages (available at every player house), which can be freely decorated and have space for multiple cars. This latest game also marks the debut of The Estate, a huge mountain valley expanse where players can freely build and decorate their own abode - which is permanent and visitable by friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of pals, players can now attend open-world car meets, where they're able to show off cars and characters, download tunes and liveries, or buy copies of any car they see. And from here, they can set out to explore the world with others, playing street races or new nighttime Touge battles, which see players racing down mountain passes. Other new social events include Horizon Time Attack Circuits - accessed seamlessly as part of the world, with no loading or matchmaking.</p>

<p>And that's almost everything announced so far, with Playground wrapping things with a few words on accessibility features, all of which will be carried over from previous games. That's on top of a few new additions, including a customisable high-contrast mode, a proximity radar, and auto-drive for those wanting to sit back and soak up the sights without touching the wheel.</p>
<p>So to recap: Forza Horizon 6 launches 19th May on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass, with a Playstation 5 release due later this year.</p>

            <p>Beast of Reincarnation got a new gameplay presentation at the Xbox Developer Direct, as well as a Summer 2026 release window</p>
<p>The game focuses on Emma and Koo, in a post-apocalyptic 4026 Japan in which a mysterious Blight has taken over much of the world. Emma, being able to absorb this Blight inside herself, plays an important role in defeating the Beast of Reincarnation. Very exciting!</p>
<p>The game shows dynamic movement, powered through the main character Emma's vine hair that can be used to propel her upwards and build makeshift bridges. This is a core part of the plant theme of Beast of Reincarnation, with flora making up much of not only the setting, but being a gameplay focus too. There are also Malefacts, creatures fused from plants and animals.</p>

<p>There is not only Blighted plant life standing in your way, but Golems! These are mechanical bodies which humans transferred their souls into.</p>
<p>The game also features a spin on the typical real-time action RPG with Blooming Arts, which slows down the gameplay and allows you to perform a selection of special attacks. This, as shown in the presentation, allows for a large variety of gameplay styles.</p>
<p>The game can be wishlisted now, and will be available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.

            <p>The Xbox Developer Direct has returned for 2026! While Microsoft kindly gave us all an early heads up on some of the games appearing - Fable (finally!), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> and Beast of Reincarnation. The showcase has given us an excellent look at the gameplay for each game and the new features you can expect to enjoy in returning titles like Forza Horizon 6. Like any good showcase, there was a nice surprise too!</p>
<p>Whether you missed the showcase or simply looking for a refresh, you'll find all of the games featured in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026 down below.</p>

<h2>Forza Horizon 6</h2>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 raced into the first spot during this Developer Direct! It's the latest installment in this long running race game series. This time you'll take to the beautiful roads of Japan; driving through locations like Tokyo, Hokkaido and Mount Fuji. Just to avoid being too distracted by the lovely scenery! You wouldn't want to lose the race... But don't worry too much, you'll be able to explore Japan outside of the Horizon festival.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 will be an open world racer, so you'll be able to enjoy some freedom and watch as the weather changes to match the season. You'll begin your journey as a tourist in Japan, but quickly find yourself absorbed into the world of racing where you'll have to earn wristbands to progress through the ranks. Eventually you'll unlock Legend Island where you'll find events, new tracks and special areas to evolve. There's also going to be over 550 cars - both new and old - for you to collect at launch!</p><p>The trailer below not only gives you a great look at the gameplay in Forza Horizon 6, but it also takes an in-depth look at how the developers recreated Japan. The highlight of their creation looks to be Tokyo - also called the biggest map ever created for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> game. We also got a look at some of the new accessibility features, the multiplayer building tool and the new car meets.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 will be released on <strong>19th May 2026</strong> on Xbox Series X / S. It will be available on Game Pass and Xbox Play Anywhere from Day One. It will be released on PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>

<h2>Beast of Reincarnation</h2>
<p>When you hear the name 'Game Freak' you wouldn't be amiss of instantly thinking about Pokémon, but don't box them in! Beast of Reincarnation sees the developers try something new (even if it still involves having a beastly companion).</p>
<p>Set in a post-apocalyptic Japan, Beast of Reincarnation follows Emma and her canine friend, Koo. Together they must traverse the dangerous landscape overcome with the Blight - parasitic plants - and deal with any foe who crosses their path. Emma also has some nifty plant manipulation powers which I wouldn't be surprised are helpful both inside and outside of combat. </p><p>The trailer gave us an excellent look at how these powers, and plants themselves, are going to play a part in the game. Emma has vinelike powers she can use to traverse the world and Koo also has his own set of powers too! We also got a look at some of the new creatures Game Freak have created for the game. Known as Malefacts, they're a mixture of plantlife and animals. Emma is sure to encounter many of these, including the dangerous Nushi and mechanical Golems, on her quest to defeat the Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>Beast of Reincarnation will be released in <strong>Summer 2026</strong> on Xbox Series X / S, PC and PlayStation 5. It will be available on Game Pass and Xbox Play Anywhere from Day One.</p>

<h2>Kiln</h2>
<p>Kiln is an upcoming team-based multiplayer brawler from Double Fine. As the name suggests, Kiln is all about creating clay warriors using a magical pottery wheel to bring your team victory. These pots can range from heavy tanks to speedy little jugs who cut through the enemy lines. You can even mould these pots during battle, allowing you to adapt to your foe's tactics. Though, if you have a little accident when crafting your pot, you might end up with an abomination.</p><p>Originally one of Double Fine's game prototypes, Kiln looks like it will be a delightful and colourful game to enjoy with your friends. It aims to mix the art of creation with the joy of smashing whole bunch of clay pots. Like a lot of pot smashing! (Anyone else remember that one house in Hyrule Castle Town in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>?) Maybe I'll try recreating this in real life with my Mum's jug collection… (I won't. I'll get in too much trouble.)</p>
<p>The trailer showcased different aspect of the gameplay - from creating your pot to some of the different game modes. The pottery wheel promises to remember the different shapes you create, which will make crafting your pots even easier! You can also add handles and sprouts, which could lead to some very creative designs. We even got a look at some of the different stages with some inspired by Greek mythology.</p>
<p>Kiln will be released in <strong>Spring 2026</strong> on Xbox Series X / S, PC and PlayStation 5. It will be available on Game Pass and Xbox Play Anywhere from Day One. Though, if this has caught your artistic eye, there will be a beta before launch.</p>

<h2>Fable</h2>
<p>It's been nearly 14 years since the last game in the Fable series was released (on the Xbox 360 Kinect of all things). For a while it seemed like there wouldn't be another game in the series, especially after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-legends">Fable Legends</a> was cancelled, but 2020 actually brought some good news when a new Fable game was confirmed. Six years later and we're finally on the cusp of the game's release.</p><p>In Fable you'll return to the magical world of Albion where every choice has a consequence and the potential to send your life down a different track. The series' British humour also looks to be alive and well (whether you want it to be or not).</p>
<p>As is Fable tradition, you'll begin your adventure as a child in a lovely village but danger lurks behind every corner... When the residents of your village are turned to stone, it will be time to head out into the wilds of an open world Albion. Eventually you'll find yourself joining the Hero's Guild, but it's also time to head north to the city of Bloodstone. </p>
<p>The game aims to keep true to the original combat mechanics, while also bringing new aspects to both the melee and magic combat. If you're a Fable fan, you'll find yourself fighting some old faces alongside new ones! Though it's not all about combat - you can get a job, buy a house (all of the houses), buy a business and get married. You might be a little stuck for choices when it comes to the last one, because there's 1,000 NPCs appartently and what they think of you depends on your choices.</p>
<p>On the morality system, this Fable takes a more grey approach. All of your actions will have an impact on your reputation and NPCs will have different opinions on your choices. Someone might love you for your wealth, but others might hate you! Certain choices will also have a longterm impact on Albion and yourself.</p>
<p>Fable will be released in <strong>Autumn 2026</strong> on Xbox Series X / S, PC and PlayStation 5. It will be available on Game Pass and Xbox Play Anywhere from Day One.</p>

            <p>
Veteran Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe, perhaps best known for his work overseeing the long-running <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> series, is reportedly retiring after almost four decades with the company.
</p>
<p>
Tanabe joined Nintendo in 1987, serving as director and course designer on Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic - the game retooled into Super Mario Bros. 2 for release in the west. Since then, Tanabe has been involved in almost every major Nintendo franchise, from The Legend of Zelda to Donkey Kong.

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's Metroid Prime 4 review in video form.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTb-cC6Sw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
2002 saw Tanabe helping steer the Metroid series toward its three-dimensional debut as co-producer on Metroid Prime, and he's continued to serve as producer on the series in the years since, overseeing the likes of Metroid Prime 2, Metroid Prime 3, and Metroid Prime: Federation Force. That's alongside producer work on many other series, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, Kirby, and WarioWare.
</p><p>
But it appears Tanabe's time with Nintendo is now at an end following the release of last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/">reported by VGC</a>, Tanabe announced his retirement in an interview with Japanese magazine Nintendo Dream, uploaded to Chinese social media platform Weibo. "I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward," he explained (via machine translation), adding "It's been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo."
</p>
<p>
Tanabe also revealed a sequel to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "still uncertain" but expressed his hope that developer Retro Studios and Risa Tabata - who served as assistant producer on last year's game, and who'll reportedly succeed Tanabe - "will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close." We've asked Nintendo for comment.
</p>
<p>
Metroid Prime 4 did, of course, have a long and troubled history, initially being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch">announced in 2017</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-development-rebooted-from-scratch">all work at Bandai Namco Studios was scrapped</a> and shifted to previous Metroid Prime developer Retro Studios. When it finally launched for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> last December, it was to a mixed reception. "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through," Eurogamer's Alex Donladson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">wrote in his three star review</a>, "but this game could and should have been so much more."

            <p>Valve has announced that Steam will feature 22 themed fests in 2026, coming in at around a different video game festival promotion every 2.4 weeks.</p>
<p>This announcement came via a <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/2014075322300510352">personable video posted on Steam''s official Twitter account</a>, in which examples including detective-fest, board game fest, tower defence fest, and deck-builder fest were mentioned among many others.</p>
<p>These 22 will come alongside the three Next fests in February, June, and October. There will also of course be the four seasonal sales events in 2026 as there were years prior. In total, you're looking at 29 total Steam promotions in the 344 days.</p>

<p>Steam fests have proven themselves to be powerful marketing tools in the right hands, with various AAA and indie developers using it to their advantage in promoting games along specific genres of thematic lines. The Next Fests, which put a spotlight on upcoming releases, has proven <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/channelling-the-spirit-of-inscryption-my-favourite-steam-next-fest-game-is-a-game-within-a-game-and-its-brilliant">a fantastic way of discovering cool games you may otherwise have missed</a>.</p><p>Steam itself is continuing its reign as the most popular PC games platform however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">recently passing the 42m concurrent user milestone earlier this month</a>. It has also been no stranger to some controversy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/however-you-frame-it-valves-ham-fisted-ban-of-an-indie-darling-is-another-blow-for-free-expression-in-video-games-and-this-will-always-be-a-tragedy">banning indie darling Horses from its store</a> and amending <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-amends-ai-disclosure-policy-but-still-stresses-players-need-to-be-informed-if-genai-is-used">its AI disclaimer so that AI-powered tools must no longer be declared</a>.</p>

      <p>Kiln details</p>
    <p>I am enamoured, so googled Kiln. Here is what Double Fine's site says about it:</p>
<blockquote>"Kiln is a multiplayer, team-based brawler by Derek Brand with a focus on creating unique player sculpted characters featuring crazy physics-based animation and destruction. In Kiln you play as a Mountain Spirit, supernatural beings forever at war on the summit. You'll use an ancient pottery wheel to create warrior golems called Vessels, inhabiting them and enabling you to interact with the physical realm to do battle. Created during the match, extremely diverse character shapes and sizes are possible each exhibiting unique attributes and controls that leverage the possibilities in procedural animation."</blockquote>
<p>This is from 2017, though, so maybe this will get updated after this evening's trailer.</p>

      <p>Fable comes to Xbox, PlayStation and PC this autumn</p>
    <p>We got another look at Fable this evening, and while we don't have a release date yet, we do have a release window: Autumn 2026.</p>
<p>It will be coming to Xbox and PC. Oh, and let's not forget what we were all wondering... yep, it'll be coming to PlayStation as well!</p>

      <p>So, what did you all think?</p><p>
    Xbox has wrapped its Developer Direct, but I will still be here for a little longer with the liveblog. So, what did you think? Anything you were surprised about with any of those games? Were you hoping for more? What is for supper? Let us know!

            <p>Creepy archive-searching deduction game TR-49 has had the best launch of any of Inkle's many games, the studio revealed today, meaning it sold better than games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavens-vault-review-a-rich-web-of-possibility">Heaven's Vault</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a>, which took longer and far more resources to make.</p>
<p>"TR-49 is our best launch, ever, in 14 years," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jon.inkle.co/post/3mcyz4wpwtk2r">Jon Ingold, the creator of TR-49 and co-founder of Inkle, wrote</a>. "I admit I'm surprised!</p>
<p>TR-49 was made quickly, in nine months, he said, mostly as an experiment to learn open-source game-making engine Godot. It was also "an excuse to play with some actors", he added, highlighting the game's performative side that Inkle's text-based games usually feature only lightly. TR-49 is partly an audio drama.</p>
<p>"One thing I think IS cool," Ingold continued: "it's a 'one-sitting' game. 4 hours; $7. No commitment required." And one huge upside of that is "people SEE THE END!", Ingold wrote. "This is huge for me, personally."</p>
<p>It's a success that may affect the studio's future output, though it's worth pointing out that Inkle has done short games before. Overboard! and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/expelled-an-overboard-game-review">Expelled!</a> are both short, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">A Highland Song</a> isn't what I'd call long. Nevertherless, I'm sure Inkle is considering using this one-sitting approach again.</p>
<p>"If we're going to make that a sustainable model we might need to be able to make things a little bit quicker, but I love the basic concept of 'compact games'," Ingold said.</p>
<p>TR-49 is a game about searching an archive in a strange machine, looking for things that don't exist in the outside world any more. It's a code-related deduction game, really, as you search around looking for clues for codes that will reveal hidden secrets within. It's really good. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tr-49-review">I gave TR-49 four stars in my Eurogamer review</a>.</p>

            <p>Arknights: Endfield, a new gacha action game released today, has temporarily halted PayPal transactions after multiple players were charged real money for in-game purchases they didn't make.</p>
<p>Some users quickly took to online community hubs like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/">the Arknight Endfield Reddit</a> show payments made on their PayPal accounts which they didn't authorise. Some screenshots include payments made in various global currencies, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjijsy/random_paypal_account_linked_to_my_account_i_just/">with some claiming that other player's Paypals were being registered to their fresh account</a>. The exact cause of this bug has not been confirmed as of writing by the developer Hyperglyph.</p>
<p>One user, Impossible Clover 818, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/did_anyone_get_refunded_for_the_paypal_nonsense/">created a post</a> on the Endfield Reddit titled: 'Did anyone get refunded for the PayPal nonsense yet? My whole balance got wiped'. They claim that £1,200 was "wiped" from their Paypal account, and less than an hour ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/comment/o11d2pt/?context=3">had been prompted to provide real-world identification</a> to access the account, due to 'suspicious activity'.</p>

<p>In a statement made <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888">on the official Arknights Endfield social media account</a>, a statement explains that Hyperglyph is aware of the problem, and that it affects "a small number of purchases" made via PayPal, and that was an "inconsistency between the order and item delivery". It then asks impacted players to contact the company via email, and to provide their account server and ID for a refund.</p>
<p>The statement goes on to assert that all refunds are expected to be resolved "within four hours". Given it was posted 15-minutes ago as of writing, this should hopefully be resolved in short order.</p>
<p>When contacted for comment prior to this social media post, a representative of Hyperglyph provided the following to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to sincerely apologize to everyone affected by the PayPal payment issue that occurred shortly after launch. We understand how upsetting and concerning this kind of situation can be, especially when it involves purchases and personal payment details.</p>
<p>Here's what we want to clearly share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>All affected PayPal purchases will be fully refunded. We've already begun processing refunds for impacted orders.</li>
<li>We do not store players' payment information. Payment details are handled directly by PayPal and are not saved in our systems.</li>
<li>This issue only affected some players on certain platforms when using PayPal. As soon as we became aware of the problem, we disabled PayPal payments within roughly two hours of launch to prevent any further impact.</li>
