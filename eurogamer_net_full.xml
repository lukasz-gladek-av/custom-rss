            <p>Resident Evil Requiem is likely now the biggest Resident Evil game in the franchise's history, sporting a concurrent player count on Steam high enough to rival even multiplayer games.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, single-player Resident Evil Requiem has an all-time concurrent peak of 344,214 players on Steam alone, over double that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>, and three times that of predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a>, on the other hand, has a Steam peak of 74,227 players, Resident Evil 3 a peak of 60,293, and Resident Evil 7, 20,449.</p>
<p>That 344,214 player peak is also bigger than the all-time Steam concurrent records of multiplayer games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> (316,750), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> (313,593), and Monster Hunter: World (334,684).</p>
<p>Of course, concurrent peaks do not reflect players jumping into the action on other platforms – or even via other PC stores like Epic Games Store – so cannot be taken in isolation, but it's typically a good indication of popularity. It also shows that Capcom has sold at least 344,214 copies in Requiem's debut weekend.</p><p>As spoilers popped all over the Internet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-issues-resident-evil-requiem-plea-as-leaks-become-a-flood">prompting Capcom to acknowledge the situation</a> ahead of the final weekend before the game's launch, Resident Evil 2 director Hideki Kamiya had some choice words for the leakers, suggesting "they are cursed to never play the game again."</p>
<p>"Is Requiem uneven? Absolutely. Does it eventually, slightly, run out of steam? I think that's a fair criticism, too. But carried away on a wave of increasing nostalgia, I didn't especially care," Matt wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-review">5/5 Eurogamer Resident Evil Requiem review</a>.</p>

            <p>Bungie is continuing to respond to your feedback during Marathon's Server Slam event, paying particular attention to your thoughts on the UI, PC performance, and those pesky weasel error codes.</p>
<p>The Server Slam – scheduled to close tomorrow, Monday 2nd March, 6pm UK time – is not only giving players the chance to try before they buy, but it's also helping Bungie stamp out bugs and server issues ahead of its full launch next week on 5th March.</p>
<p>"As we continue through your third full day on Tau Ceti, we wanted to once again share some of the primary discussion topics we've seen pop up - and, share some ways you can provide us intel if you haven't had a chance to just yet," the team explained, before thanking players "for taking the time" to share their feedback and "ensure that the launch goes as smoothly as possible".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Here's the full update:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI feedback:</strong> We are continuing to gather your posts and will keep iterating post‑launch (which, we’ll keep you posted on with regard to any future timelines once they’re available). Add your thoughts in the UI thread on our Discord so we can track them all in one place: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1476673733358915778">https://discord.com/channels/1303855380845301861/1476673733358915778</a></li>
<li><strong>PC performance:</strong> We are reviewing reports of high CPU use, low GPU utilisation, FPS ceilings ~80–100, and some stuttering. If you’re running into any of these issues (or another one we didn’t mention), please feel free to mosey on over to our Help Forum and let us know! Details on your system specs or links to short video clips are super helpful:<a href="http://bung.ie/marathonsupport"> http://bung.ie/marathonsupport</a></li>
<li><strong>PvP frequency:</strong> As we continue to keep an ear to the ground on this one, we’re further investigating total player density on non-beginner maps to cover all of our bases. If you've got any feedback - be it on Perimeter (Beginner), Perimeter, or Dire Marsh - we want to hear it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Movement and heat generation:</strong> As the test continues on, we’ve seen continued discussions about heat generation, momentum, and overall movement feedback. Make sure to take a chance and let us know your thoughts!</li>
<li><strong>Med and ammo economy: </strong>These two items have been a regular feedback item, and we’re thankful to see your reports. Discussions about stack sizes, the efficacy of green-tier med items, and more opportunities for ammo to drop have been primary topics – but, our ears remain open. Keep sharing your experiences and please let us know what you brought into any runs where you feel like you’re running dry.</li>
<li><strong>Weasel error codes:</strong> Over the last day we’ve seen a number of Weasel error codes, which are caused by a disruption of your network connection to Marathon servers. We have several investigations under way and will report back with updates. In some cases, this may be caused by issues with your home Internet connection, or with your Internet provider. If you have made changes that have resolved this issue for you, please let us know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Marathon's Server Slam kicked off just before the weekend, and attracted a healthy number of players on Steam. The game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/">brought in a peak of 143,621 concurrent players, solely on the PC platform</a>, with a Steam peak of around 76K players on Saturday (28th February).</p>

            <p>Patricia Summersett, the voice of Princess Zelda in four Legend of Zelda games – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, and Hyrule Warriors spin-offs Age of Calamity and Age of Imprisonment – can "write in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a> Hylian".</p>
<p>Casually dropping the information into conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-zelda-turns-40-voice-actress-patricia-summersett-reveals-hopes-for-the-future-and-clarifies-her-thoughts-on-link-and-zeldas-gorgeous-relationship">IGN</a>, Summersett said she taught herself how to write using the Hylian alphabet "over coffee" while recording Breath of the Wild.</p>

<p>"It's something I did early on when I was recording [Breath of the Wild] and I was just starting to look through [series companion book] Hyrule Historia at the different versions of the languages from all the previous games," she said.</p><p>"Obviously, Breath of the Wild wasn't out yet, so I didn't know what would be in that game. But I saw Twilight Princess Hylian, and it's so beautiful. I thought I could probably learn those characters, which is essentially just the alphabet, and started practising that over coffee. So now I can kind of write fluently and use it all the time."</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Summersett revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/link-and-zelda-are-in-a-relationship-voice-actress-says">she'd interpreted Link and Zelda's friendship as "being in a relationship"</a>, before clarifying she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tears-of-the-kingdom-voice-actress-backtracks-after-stating-link-and-zelda-were-in-a-relationship">did not mean to imply</a> they were a romantic couple. A few months after that, Nintendo said it was "up to the player's imagination" to interpret the relationship.</p>
<p>Asked to comment once again on the issue, Summersett was cautious, saying: "I have to be so careful when I answer that question. Let me formulate this... I have all sorts of personal theories about what this might be, but I think there's something beautiful in the way that it's left ambiguous, it's left in a kind of — if there are romantic undertones, it's left in an unrequited state. </p>
<p>"There's obviously a deep friendship and a protectorship between the two of them. It's a gorgeous relationship and it continues to evolve and be left open in so many iterations of this."</p>
<p>As for the live-action movie? Summersett said she thinks we're "going to see a strong Zelda. I'm sure you're going to see a powerful lead character in Zelda. And Link I have no idea, is he going to speak? They certainly haven't alluded to the fact that he does, yet".</p><p>Filming for that aforementioned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-the-project-begins-production-it-looks-like-the-legend-of-zelda-film-is-following-in-lord-of-the-rings-esteemed-footsteps">Nintendo's Legend of Zelda adaptation began last November in New Zealand</a>, and is expected to run until April next year. The film is due to release on 7th May, 2027. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Link and Princess Zelda will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason</a>, respectively, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-action-adaptation-of-the-legend-of-zelda-will-stream-on-netflix">is coming to Netflix after its "theatrical and home entertainment release periods"</a>.</p>

            <p>Sitting at my desk and racking my brain for something, <em>anything</em> to say about Pokémon for its thirtieth anniversary, I found myself inexplicably struggling. What do you say about a series like this? With Zelda, there's easy lines to trace about it as both reflection and architect of many an era's trends. I could write about the anniversary of Final Fantasy in about a hundred different ways. I even had easy words for NFL Blitz. But Pokémon... What do you say?</p>
<p>Part of it, I suppose, is the <em>breadth</em> of it all. Video games, yes, but trading cards, endless toys, TV shows, movies, and more resilient (and yes, sometimes, more deranged) online communities than just about any other franchise. Plucking out one thing to talk about is difficult. But then again... perhaps that is my clue. The thunderbolt of inspiration hits: <em>that</em> is what it is all about.</p>
<p>When I think about my greatest memories of Pokémon, I realise, it has always first and foremost been a powerful inter-generational experience.</p>

<figcaption>Happy birtday Pokémon!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYsxq0zstOs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In early 1999, when my mum brought home an early import copy of Pokémon Blue from a trip abroad, Pokémon was indeed just another video game, experienced the way this only child always did: as a solitary experience that I'd then excitedly chatter about with friends at school. I was early to the Pokémon train in the UK by a few months, having asked for and received a US copy after reading about how it was the next big thing in the hallowed pages of ONM or some other precious tome. But then, quickly, it became more than a game: Poke-mania was coming.</p><p>The thing about the all-encompassing madness that followed, where it felt for a brief couple of summers that Pokémon had truly totally taken over the world, is that even non-gamers couldn't miss it. For me, that meant a greater chance that it was something I could truly connect with other people in my life over - and that was what happened. My grandfather became a Pokemaniac.</p>
<p>He wouldn't know what to do with a Game Boy - but he loved the rest. Newly retired, he was looking for hobbies and he found it in Pokémon, especially the trading card game. He had an affinity for the creatures themselves, which again speaks to the strength and charm of the Pokémon themselves. He would've bounced off a game like Magic: The Gathering - but as a nature lover, he adored the fantastical creatures that in this era were more or less all rooted in real-life nature. Like good hobbies do, it began to infect other things he did. He was a painter, and occasionally he'd insert Pokémon into his landscapes. Occasionally, he'd draw new Pokémon ideas of his own.</p>
<blockquote>Pokémon is bigger than it has ever been now, famously the 'biggest entertainment franchise' on the planet. But there was something about those early summers where it didn't just feel big - it felt like it was everything.</blockquote>
<p>For me, the memories just stack up. We watched the TCG trainer video VHS to learn the rules, and then spent countless hours sitting around the dining table of cramped static caravans on half terms and summer holidays with play mats and cards splayed across them. We had two or three decks each, constantly tweaking and upgrading them, and we kept a running count of who had won the most games. He lived outside the video game world, so whenever there was an update on the new Pokémon coming forth in the second generation, I'd fold over the page in the gaming magazine with the info as a bookmark and then take it for him to peruse. I think we saw the first movie three times in the cinema, in part to get more copies of the promotional cards - and then one day he returned home with a dodgy bootleg VHS that I practically wore out.</p>
<p>I can't quite do justice to what those summers felt like. If you're young enough to not have <em>been there</em> at that time, understand this: Pokémon is bigger than it has ever been now, famously the 'biggest entertainment franchise' on the planet. But there was something about those early summers where it didn't just feel big - it felt like it was <em>everything</em>.</p><p>The great big livestreamed and international Pokémon Championship Competition events we have now are glorious for instance - but to me they pale in comparison to the simple belt-and-braces TCG tour that got ran in the UK in (I think) the year 2000, where a touring rabble of hired guns travelled on behalf of Pokémon's makers, erecting tents on beaches and in public squares to create would-be Pokémon Gyms. We actually travelled specifically to go to some of these - we both crafted custom decks to take on each of the themed Gym Leaders, and I think ended up with three or four Gym Badges a piece.</p>
<p>Go to a comic convention today and you'll find stands of professional companies selling oodles of merch and running buy/sell/trade operations with cards - but another fond memory I have is how for a few summers pretty much any local car boot sale was totally taken over by Pokémon. You'd go not just to thrift for NES and Master System games (though I did plenty of that too), but specifically to trade and pad out your collection. I was always a little ahead of him collection-wise, but I quite vividly remember negotiating a trade for the final card granddad needed for his Fossil expansion set to be complete. We were particularly proud to have collated two complete sets of the first three expansions.</p>
<p>I think all these memories are all the more arresting to me because of how organic it was back then - a cottage industry springing up around a surprise hit. It's all established now, and that's wonderful, but I'll forever pine for those days. To an eleven year old, this stuff felt like I was <em>in</em> the game, rather than part of some broader 'activation' for the biggest brand in the universe.</p>
<blockquote>What is incredible is that Pokémon is still as magic as it ever was - and that inter-generational joy is still there.</blockquote>
<p>But I digress. That was the better part of thirty years ago. What is incredible is that Pokémon is still as magic as it ever was - and that inter-generational joy is still there. My granddad is gone now, sadly - at his funeral, talking through a list of all the hobbies we shared as part of his eulogy, Pokémon was mentioned. But I'm the old man now, albeit twenty-some years younger than he was at that time. Like I was to him, I now have a little deputy following me around - and Pokémon's barrier-crossing continues, reverberating down my bloodline. Of all the things we share an interest in - like Mario, Sonic, music, and arcades - the hobby and interest we are most enthusiastic about <em>together </em>is... well, no, sorry. It's Lego. Fair enough. I've wrecked my flow there. But after Lego? It's Pokémon.</p>
<p>I see those same patterns repeating, and I find it joyous. She covets cards and plushies. If she sees a Pikachu in a shop, she shouts out that it's Pikachu and gravitates straight towards it. To her, Ash Ketchum is a nobody bum - she's all about new protagonists Liko and Roy, which makes me shake my head in disgust even if I respect it. The cycle has begun anew.</p><p>My heart swells thinking of this, and pondering that lineage. When she's old enough to be trusted to not wreck them, I will outright <em>give</em> her granddad's card collection, and I can't wait for that. But what's most interesting to me as a critic is how this has also returned <em>me</em> to the franchise. My fandom perhaps waned in the face of too many TCG releases to keep up with and a barrage of games with head-scratching quality control issues. But I now have an unassailable reason to return to the franchise - and I have done.</p>
<p>In my mind I think of this as the Doctor Who cycle - young fans rotate 'out' of the series, then return in adulthood and introduce their own children. We've never seen a more aggressively successful example of this, in truth, than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>'s 2016 zenith, as millennials almost got run over en masse trying to catch 'em all.</p>
<p>It's true, I think, that any old series can accomplish this sort of sentiment. How many Star Wars fans were raised in this way? But I think series' that can do it on this scale, with such brilliance, and also doing so while making it all look so <em>effortless</em> - they are impeccably rare. Pokémon is one such series - and that, I suppose, is why it's the biggest entertainment IP on the planet, or whatever corporate nonsense term we're deploying to talk about it today. I've got a better word for it though: magic.</p>

            <p>A level designer laid off from Highguard developer Wildlight believes the free-to-play shooter's difficulties stem from having "leaned too far into the competitive scene".</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the "really big spotlight" placed on the game following its reveal at The Game Awards additionally added pressure, senior level designer Alex Graner talked candidly on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3wuWRHLZeY">Quad Damage podcast</a> about the "constantly evolv[ing]" game, suggesting that his "biggest fear [came] when [the studio] decided to go full-in on 3v3".</p>

<p>"I can only speak to my side of it as a level designer, but when I joined [Wildlight], it was trying to figure out this new, ambitious game, and this team is always pushing the boundaries," he said, as transcribed by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/highguard/too-sweaty">PCGN</a>. "You don't strive to create something that doesn't work out, but it happens, unfortunately. Throughout development, we really leaned into the competitive side of it, and that was always one of my biggest fears as a player.</p><p>"3v3 duos is always the sweatiest version of anything like battle royale, objective modes, wingman, you know it, you name it," he added. "It requires such a high intensity of communication with your team, and team play, that it doesn't leave much room for casualness. I think that was the biggest thing that turned a lot of players off Highguard."</p>
<p>Graner said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> came just as battle royales were a "kind of an up-and-coming mode" and was "really easy to understand after you played one game", which is why it was so successful. Conversely, Highguard was a little more complex.</p>
<p>"Highguard has all these different rules and stages, it's like, 'Oh, you want to loot, now we've got to chase this objective, now we have to plant this objective, now it's overtime… It has all these rules, which I think works at a really high level, but when players are first coming in it's a lot to grasp," he admitted.</p>
<p>"On top of all that, because it was 3v3, that kind of game just requires high-skill movement and shooting, which is already a pretty high [bar to] entry as well. So if you just have a few bad games or your teammates aren't sticking together, you're just going to get rolled, and it's very hard to 1v2 in our game.</p>
<p>"It's all designed to be a team-based shooter. I think that was the biggest thing. People just kind of turned it off because they didn't have the team."</p>
<p>Just yesterday (27th February), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-pulled-highguards-funding-two-weeks-after-launch">a new report alleged that Tencent pulled funding from developer Wildlight just two weeks after the game's launch</a>. Staff were called to an all-hands meeting, and then told that there would be layoffs as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> had pulled funding as Highguard had seemingly failed to meet whatever metrics Tencent had for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildlight publicly confirmed layoffs a day later</a> but wouldn't specify numbers, and it insisted "a core group of developers" remained to work on the game. It's thought fewer than 20 people remain at Wildlight today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-funded-by-tencent">Tencent's role in Highguard's development</a> was, curiously, kept quiet. It wasn't until several days after the layoffs that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-funded-by-tencent">Game File confirmed Tencent's involvement</a>. The reason for the secrecy around the company's involvement is unclear.</p>

<p>"It's massive. It's so big," he said (thanks,<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-dlc-is-freaking-huge-says-director-its-basically-like-a-sequel/"> GR+</a>). "I know it's been a while since we've shipped the main game and you're waiting for the DLC, but just know that it's freaking huge. It's basically a sequel. That's what it feels like. It's just ginormous. I love that."</p>
<p>As for what's coming in that update? Well, Martin was a little more coy about that, but we did learn that the DLC is "nothing like" the main game, and could boast a spear-like weapon.</p>
<p>"The DLC is nothing like this," Martin said as he played the main game on the stream. "I can't say too much, I'm just going to say that what I've been playing… I haven't been playing like this."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-biggest-launch-in-id-software-history">Doom: The Dark Ages was the "biggest launch" in id Software's history</a>, with three million players making their way into the fiery pits of hell since the game's release. To put that into more context, Bethesda says Doom: The Dark Ages reached this number seven times faster than Doom Eternal.</p><p>"As a parent, the game I'm most concerned about these days is probably something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>. By contrast, Doom feels like an entirely known and understood entity. Let's savour it," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Eurogamer's Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>. "Here's a slice of pure gaming charisma that has come to us, unfrazzled, from a more innocent time."</p>

            <p>Just days after Sony decided to close remake masters Bluepoint Games, a new report claims that wasn't PlayStation itself that stonewalled the idea of a Bloodborne remake by Bluepoint, but developer FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">Sony shut down the studio last week</a>, impacting around 70 employees. At the time, a spokesperson said the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<p>Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>, after Bluepoint released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5 in 2020. It was always hoped that Bluepoint would, at some point, be instructed to do the same for Bloodborne.</p><p>Now, a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure">Bloomberg</a> claims that Bluepoint did, in fact, approach FromSoft in early 2025, pitching a remake of the 2015 game. It's said that "the studio was told that the numbers made sense, but FromSoftware didn't want it to happen".</p>
<p>Interestingly, former president of Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">Shuhei Yoshida posited the same this time last year</a>, saying: "Bloodborne is one of the most popular asks on my Twitter/X. And the people wonder why we haven't really done anything... it should be easy, right?</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it."</p>
<p>After this rejection, Bluepoint allegedly pitched an updated version of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> remake to Sony, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> spin-off, but these ideas were also turned down, with Bloomberg suggesting that other studios were "concerned about dedicating significant resources to another team's project".</p><p>Bloodborne has long been considered one of the greatest games ever made. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-review">We gave it an Essential, writing</a>: " it will be a painfully long time until I play anything else that matches up to Bloodborne's breadth of vision, generosity of content, and - yes - genius".</p>

            <p><em>A special, long-form extract from <a href="https://on.games/pages/pokemon">ON Games Volume 2</a>, which we're featuring as part of our celebration of Pokémon's 30th anniversary.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>You've probably heard about the Mew that was hiding under a truck.</p>
<p>A secret, 151st Pokémon planted in Pokémon Red, Blue and Green, finding it required a brief, yet impetuous journey outside of regular bounds. Head south from Vermilion City, then surf just to the east of the short jetty which usually leads to a cruise ship, the SS Anne, soon bound for another undefined voyage around the world. There, beyond the ship, lies a small, apparently innocent patch of land. To reach that little bank, you'd need to blag your way past a ticket inspector - through glitch or other crafty workaround - and borrow a friend's Pokémon; one that can use Surf before it's properly allowed. Make the short hop across the harbour waters then and on the bank, parked conveniently just out of view from any legitimately reachable part of the world, you'll find a single, abandoned truck. The only model of a truck, curiously, that's been placed anywhere in the game. And under that mysterious truck, if you push it to one side with a Pokémon that knows the move Strength, you'll find a Poké Ball. And inside that Poké Ball will be Mew.</p>
<p>There was, of course, no Mew hiding under that truck. But like so many great stories, the hard facts mean little next to a tale well told. Mew's absence did little to stop the truck story from billowing outwards, engulfing the school yards of Japan, then North America and the rest of the world, eventually becoming the most widely spread playground legend of the modern age. If you were a kid in the 90s, your feet firmly planted at the epicentre of Pokémania, you knew about the Mew and that truck.</p><p>Like millions of other people now reckoning with their early-to-mid 30s - this story is more universal than it'll ever be personal - a vastly outsized chunk of my childhood was defined by this one rumour. Armed with my dad's original Game Boy (on which he had hitherto stoically chipped away at Tetris, and only Tetris), my copies of both Red and Blue, a Link Cable, and nary a friend with whom to actually trade, reader, I was obsessed. I tried everything to reach that cursed patch of land.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for seven-year-old Chris, I wasn't much of a whizz at discovering glitches - and crucially, nobody in my particular playground actually knew the ticket inspector workaround. "Trying everything," in my case, mostly boiled down to repeatedly talking to the same, stubborn NPC, bumping into the same few fencing tiles blocking the path, or just wistfully looking out towards the same passing rolls of the sea beyond, where my truck remained unmoved, my Mew forever undiscovered.</p>
<p>Instead, the mystery itself had to be sufficient. And it was, just as it was for those millions of other seven-year-olds at the time. Mew, even in its absence, was the beginning of a lifelong personal connection, one made to a series of games that always felt, for reasons I could never quite pin down, like it was somehow bigger, more real, than whatever it was showing in the few dozen 8bit pixels on screen.</p>
<blockquote>"Sometimes the unsettled, unsolved mystery is more captivating than the one with an answer."</blockquote>
<p>Here's the good bit, though: as time went on and my obsession evolved, from living the mystery to something closer to knowing it, I learned there was no Mew under the truck - but there was a secret, 151st Pokémon hiding somewhere in the game. And it was indeed Mew. The mythical, undiscovered Pokémon otherwise referenced only in whispers and scribbles, dotted across secret laboratories and tattered research notebooks in the games' more sinister corners. The Pokémon that many had assumed must, surely, exist somewhere, if only by virtue of there being a real and very much catchable Mewtwo. It's just that rather than some intentional, hidden Easter egg buried by developer Game Freak, a treasure just waiting to be unearthed on that little patch of land, the real Mew wasn't meant to be found at all. Its discovery, and the subsequent rumours that turned Pokémon's initially middling Japanese sales into a global mega-phenomenon, all happened entirely by accident.</p><p>Or at least that's how most remember it. Mew's story is one of gaming's great fables, a blend of mystery and mythology, pure happenstance and genuine, ingenious intent. It's the perfect example, I always felt, of this series at its very best. Ephemeral and strange, a game played on-screen and off, along a map's edge, your feet astride real and virtual worlds, overlooking the unknown.</p>
<p>It's also the perfect example of something I've come to feel, as I've grown up - or some might argue as the games themselves have been purposefully aged down - to be missing from the series' modern entries. The great, multi-level dungeons of old, which once led to mythical and legendary Pokémon of their own, have been flattened in place of linear paths. Arcane mechanics have in time turned mundane, their hidden intricacies all solved, or simplified, or explained. A handful of impish young developers have, inevitably, evolved their way into a corporation that spans the world, with brand values and bottom lines, and which now handles the largest entertainment franchise of all time. I thought I'd go in search of the true origins to these old myths and mysteries here, maybe reminisce a little, pay homage to a series' distant, gilded past. But much the same as Mew's story, in doing so I realised the old myths are really just the half of it.</p>

<p>The original story of Mew, and Pokémon's subsequent viral explosion, goes something like this:</p>
<p>With just a short time to go before Pokémon Red and Green's initial Japanese launch, and their code locked after a desperate final round of debugging, Shigeki Morimoto, a programmer known for, among other things, a slightly mischievous spirit, took it upon himself to make one final, unauthorised addition. Removing the debugger freed up 300 bytes of space on the cartridge, he'd realised - just enough space for one more, very small, 151st Pokémon.</p><p>He decided it should be Mew - Game Freak had already referred to it in the game by name, if only in hushed and mysterious tones, but never intended to actually include it, so it made for a nice bit of fun for the team - then quickly whipped up a simple design and snuck it in, much to Nintendo's apparent ire on its discovery later on (that debugging phase, it was later revealed, was then Nintendo's most expensive of all time). Inevitably, introducing new code right after the debugging was finished also introduced, you guessed it, a new bug: a glitch that allowed players to find and capture a Mew that was never meant to be found.</p>
<p>That glitch actually happens in an entirely different part of the games, under circumstances far less enticing than the tall tales of mysterious trucks and dodging guards. But soon enough the rumours swirled, and an era's great snowball began to roll. "The monthly sales we'd had up to then began to be equalled by weekly sales," said Pokémon Company president Tsunekazu Ishihara in the years after, "before increasing to become three, then four times larger". Eventually, the games topped Japanese sales charts - but not until over a year after their initial release.</p>
<p>The real story is a little more complicated. The runaway success caused by the inclusion of Mew was partially an accident - but it also wasn't really an accident at all. The decision to include Mew wasn't just Morimoto's, for instance. It was actually the decision of the whole Game Freak team, led in particular by Ken Sugimori, the series' legendary artist and designer, and Satoshi Tajiri, its fabled and now highly reclusive co-creator.</p>
<p>As a pair of teenagers in the mid 80s, Sugimori and Tajiri were arcade gaming fanatics, their obsession taking hold with one arcade game in particular, over which they originally met and bonded: Xevious. A game which achieved a kind of viral success of its own in the arcade scene, thanks to a strikingly familiar set of circumstances. A series of urban legends spread by fans about secret appearances of strange sprites, complex methods for finding Easter eggs, and characters and places that may or may not have been real. The credit for that nugget of development history, and indeed countless others, must go to a man called Kyle Tarpley, known to the internet as Dr Lava, and the loose network of fellow researchers, dataminers, translators and archivists with whom he works.</p>
<p>"My job is very, very tedious," he tells me, as we begin to lay out his methods. "I don't think there are very many people at all, especially YouTubers, who are willing to do that amount of tedium."</p>
<p>What Tarpley is referring to here, with what I soon discover is a kind of signature curmudgeonly charm, is the lengthy process of finding, cataloguing, translating, refining, and editing together of material he goes through for his videos, which began as contributions to a channel of his own, Dr Lava's Lost Pokémon, before he landed a full-time gig as a writer-researcher for a larger team. "I don't even know why my boss pays me to do this," he half jokes. "It'd be a lot more beneficial to crank shit out. Fortunately, he's willing to pay me to do it the slow way."</p>
<blockquote>"There's so many books and magazine interviews and everything else. There's just thousands and thousands of pages, still untranslated, only in Japanese..."</blockquote>
<p>An American living in China with his family, Tarpley skirts the border between dry wit and ever-so-slight cynicism in that lovably Gen X way, talking with a subtle, but unmistakable, Arkansan drawl. It's the voice and tone of a man who might have spent his life on something admirably futile - tracking down escaped alligators, maybe, or playing sheriff to a small town with one persistent drunk. Instead, his talk of smoking guns and great hunts here refers to old development anecdotes and snippets of normally throwaway conversational detail, as he pores over thousands of pages of Japanese magazine and book interviews in search of untold secrets about Pokémon.</p>
<p>His method is, on paper, simple enough - albeit far from quick or easy. Through connections in Japan, or research of his own, he'll find out about some conversation had somewhere by some designer on one of the early Pokémon games. He tracks down the original source material - say, an untranslated Japanese book on illustrative design, featuring a chat with Ken Sugimori (and plenty of other gems, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> director Tetsuya Nomura) - then scans it, page by page. He runs those pages through DeepL, a more accurate machine translator than Google, then works his way through them looking for leads, cataloguing the extracts into files divided up by game. Once he finds a good one, he then sends that section off to be professionally translated, before searching through his many thousands of files for any similar references and working it all together into a narrative - if one ever emerges - to then finally convert into a video script.</p><p>Tarpley's tried this in the past for a few series - Mario, Zelda - but Pokémon, he says, is different. Where those other games might garner a few thousand views, an equivalent video on Pokémon would do an order of magnitude more, scaling into the hundreds of thousands and beyond. He puts it down to the series' longevity and the unprecedented amount of money it's made in part, but also the fans themselves. "There's something I just can't put my finger on that gives it that special sauce," he tells me. That brings in a particular kind of obsessive. And a particular kind of person - early 30s, tinged with nostalgia, we know the sort - that can't quite leave their childhood behind.</p>
<p>"For people in my line of work," he explains, "it's the perfect franchise". There's a huge fan base, yes, but "they care about even the smallest stuff". Together with a "virtually a bottomless well" of unused material to mine, Dr Lava's videos are sheer magnetism to a viewer like me - obsessive, millennial, ever so slightly stuck in the past. "There's so many books and magazine interviews and everything else. There's just thousands and thousands of pages, still untranslated, only in Japanese." The result is pure alchemy. You could translate barely a handful of pages, he says, "and just have gold, gold, gold, gold".</p>
<p>One of those particularly bountiful sources - "so much gold" - comes in the form of a book by Tajiri himself, called A Catcher in Pac-Land, effectively a memoir of his teenage years spent across the many arcades of 80s Japan. It's home to a gem of an anecdote, which Tarpley kindly relays.</p>
<p>A young Tajiri, obsessed with the urban myth-fuelled shoot 'em up Xevious, began to spread some rumours of his own about hidden secrets in the game - until that game's creator, Masanobu Endō, a legend amongst Tajiri and his friends, turned up at the local arcade himself to debunk them. Tajiri was lambasted by his peers. "In one fell swoop, I went from being a missionary to being a con man," he wrote. "I was criticised and stoned. When I went to an arcade, even people who had been my friends pointed fingers at me." That's until Endō returned, as though magnanimously descending from on high, to declare Tajiri a good kid at heart, after which his fellow Xevious fanatics ultimately allowed him to return.</p><p>Later on, in a roundtable interview with Sugimori and Endō himself that Tarpley again directs me towards (one that's also quite possibly Tajiri's last known public appearance, in 2016) Tajiri admitted he might've been embellishing just a little. He and Endō were actually quite regularly in touch, for starters, while Endō recalls he really enjoyed encouraging the weird rumours as well. For him this was all part of a plan; he'd intentionally cultivated a sense of mystery with Xevious, believing it to be far more fun that way, and also a clever means of spreading the word.</p>
<p>Crucially, that interview is another source that emphasises Tajiri and Sugimori's overt desire to do the same - to recreate the playground mythology of Xevious, and its viral success, with a secret-filled game of their own. "I think it was important that Endō-san left the mystery vague. That's why, even when people ask me various questions about Pokémon, I try not to answer too clearly," said Sugimori. "The fact that you can enjoy it more deeply by leaving it vague is something I learned from my experience with Xevious, and hold dear."</p>
<p>Tajiri, with admittedly a little question-loading from the interviewer, put it even more directly: "Without Xevious, there would be no Pokémon!"</p>

<figcaption>One of Tarpley's early videos, on Gen 1's 'cut content', that sparked a career in Pokémon archeology.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHHmvOVqsIQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Tarpley and his network of researchers and historians - unabashed fanatics themselves - pieced this together, along with extracts from other interviews and memoirs, to paint something closer to a true picture of Mew's story. The Game Freak team, including the impish Morimoto, had actually thought they might release Mew someday, it turns out, and so having the special Pokémon in the code made for a nice option in the future if they ever decided how. In the end it came via a competition giveaway, post-truck rumour, in CoroCoro magazine. More than 78,000 people entered in Japan for a chance at just 20 authentic, numbered Mews, each delivered via Link Cable by Morimoto himself. I learn this, and try not to unravel at the thought of how many of those 20 priceless cartridges may have since been lost to time.</p><p>Likewise, that strange truck also has an origin story of its own. One cult datamining collective known as Helix Chamber discovered a lost city in some old prototype files, just south-east of Vermillion City - exactly where the truck could be found. What can be seen, in that half-built town? Two buildings. A Pokémon Center. And a single truck. It was simply left in the game by accident. Or perhaps because its very location - inaccessible, out of sight - meant the developers thought they could afford to just leave it there, safe in the assumption nobody would see it anyway.</p>
<p>For close-watching Pokémon fans, the irony isn't lost: with Xevious, a leftover asset was the cause of one of its most infamous rumours - about a secret, Vietnam-era F-4 Phantom fighter jet the player could apparently summon in the otherwise entirely futuristic sci-fi shooter. Now, a game inspired by that same sense of mystery and viral myth had taken off into the stratosphere with a playground rumour of its own - all accidentally spawned by another rogue object in the code. It may have all come together by pure chance, but the circumstances around it - the scrawled notes about this mysterious, mythical Pokémon, the lifelong beliefs of Tajiri and Sugimori that some questions are best left unanswered - are proof enough to Tarpley: it was a happy accident, to borrow a phrase. One intentionally cultivated and allowed to grow.</p>
<blockquote>"In the age of the Internet, is it even possible? Not like it was."</blockquote>
<p>I wonder aloud about whether these kinds of mysteries are even possible any more. If Pokémon could ever re-capture the magic, if its mythology can continue to grow, when datamining in particular - somewhat poetically, the practice that makes so much of this kind of archeology possible - has become so prevalent, the fanbase so rabid and well-attuned, that it's just impossible to bury any secrets in a Pokémon game today. Or, in other words, if Tarpley's "near infinite" well of material will one day prove finite. He pauses for a long time.</p>
<p>"I guess, no." He offers his reasons. For one, with the newest games, the modern churn of everyday news means there's an incentive to bleed each contemporary interview dry. "Every little snippet that comes out is going to be on the front page of Nintendo Life or Eurogamer." The other is a bit of a half-truth: "There aren't really magazines any more." Or, he clarifies, at least not the same volume of magazines that operate in the traditional way: "There's just not thousands of pages of untranslated material, that no one else has, that I can bring to life." Dataminers, meanwhile, have become faster and more prolific - full game data, right down to the finest points of Pokémon locations, spawn rates, and damage stats that could only be uncovered with access to the game's code now appear on hugely popular sites such as Serebii or Bulbapedia within hours of a new game's release.</p><p>All that's compounded by another problem: a Game Freak that has, as the series grew into a behemoth - its die-hard fans into a more demanding horde, and its developers more wary of controversy - simply become more buttoned-up and withdrawn. That's something I can attest to: between 2016 and 2019, I had three interviews with series boss Junichi Masuda at Eurogamer. There have been no more since. The result, as Tarpley puts it: "There's just not a pile of gold waiting to be dug up."</p>
<p>The classic games and the many pages of untold history surrounding them will continue to be a gold mine, no doubt. But for Tarpley and his questing peers, that's largely the sum of it. Pokémon's period of myth and mystery has come to its natural end. "In the age of the internet, is it even possible?" he asks himself. "Not like it was."</p>

<p>A man who goes only by his online moniker disagrees. Tahk0 ('taco') is a familiar face to any internet-enabled Pokéfan, a west-coast American in his early-to-mid 30s, he regularly sports a varsity jacket and a signature floppy, Fall Out Boy fringe that feels straight from the emo-skater era of the mid 2000s. He's a professional pixel artist by trade (inspired by 8bit Pokémon) though like his real name he keeps the games he's worked on strictly confidential. He's known for a particular obsession with Pikachu.</p><p>I look at him, in front of a tastefully lit version of the classic content creator Kallax wall, filled with yolk-hued Pokémon memorabilia, and I see the nearly 50 million millennials who grew up playing Pokémon Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow in 1996 and beyond. And I see myself. On the surface, he is exactly the kind of person Tarpley is referring to when he talks about the 90s kids who refused to leave this one part of their childhood behind. But beneath the surface, he's a man leading a quiet revolution.</p>
<p>"I do agree that, yeah, that era is over," he says, of the time when Game Freak could hide a secret Pokémon in the game's code. "But through researching that, you realise how that stuff got - I wouldn't say ruined," he catches himself, "because I feel like this is just a natural progression of human society". For Tahk0, datamining, 24-hour coverage, and the instant global spread of information that the internet provides have instead simply forced Pokémon's developers to adapt. "'Ruining it' puts this negative spin on it," he says. "It was always going to happen. That's just where society was headed - you can't put the genie back in the bottle, so why complain about it?"</p>
<p>Much the same as with Dr Lava, I set up a conversation with Tahk0 because of a YouTube video. The difference this time is that Tahk0 is not a YouTuber, nor really a 'content creator' or anything of the sort. The video that drew me to him is called 'There's more story in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> than you realize,' and only he made it, in his words, "because - I don't know why - people only listen to you if it's in video form". And he has some things he'd really like Pokémon fans to hear.</p>
<blockquote>"The essence of Pokémon is outside of Pokémon... that's why Pokémon is successful... it's that it's bigger than the game. From the beginning, it's bigger than the game."</blockquote>
<p>Beneath the typical lore-hunter surface, Tahk0's video is really a plea to think about games differently. "Let's meet games halfway," he says at one point, before pointing viewers towards a side project, a private group he calls the Lore Library.</p>
<p>(A pause here for a confession: I think lore, particularly game lore, is sort of bobbins. A lot of proper nouns got together, and so the universe was born, etc. This lore, thankfully, isn't like that lore - if anything 'lore' is a bit of a misnomer.)</p><p>Tahk0's Lore Library, he explains, is actually more like a book club. Every Sunday, he gathers its few dozen members to simultaneously watch either a game playthrough, a film, or an episode of TV, the group regularly pausing to take notes, capture screenshots or make observations, before everyone then discusses what they've watched. And rather than offering authoritative, outright declarations, they talk about how they've interpreted it, or what they think it might mean. "What is the emotion that I'm supposed to feel right now?" As Tahk0 puts it: "What are they trying to convey?" Everyone is actively encouraged to start on the ground floor.</p>
<p>"The fun part is they want to learn, and are open to not knowing things," Tahk0 says of its members. "I feel like that's a really important aspect - to be comfortable not being the expert." Altogether, it strikes me as an uncommonly literary way of thinking about games - this is really a close reading group, a weekly English literature seminar. And it's of particular importance, Tahk0 argues, for truly understanding Pokémon.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Legends: Arceus video begins with a simple analogy: the Pokémon games, in particular the most recent ones, have their overt stories about saving the world - standard Pokémon story fare - but also a kind of secondary layer of storytelling. Moments, he says, that are more like a collection of "puzzle pieces" than they are typical overt game narratives. In it, he links together clues from incredibly minute details - unexplained objects in the corner of a room you might never visit; specific Pokédex entries and the tone in which they're written, even inferred NPC accents based purely on a few lines of unvoiced dialogue, and how that links them to a specific place at a specific time - all left, intentionally he insists, by Game Freak for players to seek out and to put together themselves.</p>

<p>This, it should be emphasised, is not a commonly held belief amongst Pokémon fans. After tweeting his thoughts about Pokémon having always had this kind of implied storytelling, right back to the Game Boy days, Tahk0 describes receiving an almighty social media dunking. "I had developers and well-known influencers - all people I thought were cool! - making fun of me. And I'm like, 'I swear I'm not making this up!'"</p><p>For Tahk0, the mistake Pokémon fans are making is to think of games either too dismissively, or too functionally. In 'Marvel Cinematic Universe, hard-coded, everything's connected' terms. "Maybe a good example I've seen," he offers: every once in a while, a social media algorithm will surface a Spongebob Squarepants superfan onto his timeline. "They're like: 'These are the superpowers of Spongebob that he is able to do. He's able to rip his arms off and then grow another one, and if you power-scaled him versus other characters...'" Tahk0 laughs. "I'm like: 'Well, I don't think that's the point. I think it was a joke!'"</p>
<p>The point of all Tahk0's work, meanwhile, is to get people to "not be so literal about Pokémon," and in doing so get a little closer to what he sees as the real meaning of the series itself. "The only people willing to talk about Pokémon are the people that would take it the most literally - but it's more: what is this doing to me, in my life? That is the point of Pokémon." It's a strange way to put it, I think, but as we talk more I begin to understand. The best explanation, in fact, comes back to his answer to my opening question.</p>
<p>I set out my stall: Pokémon's success, I reckon, owes more to its many in-game myths and real-world urban legends than most people realise. But before I can get to the real crux of it - the worry that this age of mythmaking might be over - Tahk0 goes one further. "I think they're completely inseparable," he says. "I think they're the same thing."</p>
<p>"The essence of Pokémon is outside of Pokémon, right?" I do my best to go along, half following. "That's what I mean by saying it's inseparable. It's that, whether it's a playground rumour or actually part of the game, you're always having that discussion in a group setting, in a way. Whether it's directly, or even if you're reading about it in a magazine and not talking out loud. I really think that's probably why Pokémon is successful, if I had to guess - it's that it's bigger than the game. From the beginning, it's bigger than the game."</p>

<p>"Pokémon is an idea that was inspired by the Game Boy's hardware," declared Ken Sugimori in a now ancient interview, translated by one of Kyle Tarpley's peers, another anonymous archivist who goes only by GlitterBerri. The designer relays a conversation with his old friend: "Tajiri said, "Wouldn't it be interesting if we could use the Game Boy Link Cables, up until now only used by players to compete against each other, to trade something?""</p><p>Tahk0 is familiar with the interview. Excitedly, he cites the reference to the Link Cables in Pokémon's inception, then jumps over to the concept of shiny Pokémon, the ultra-rare, alternative colour versions once the source of playground myths of their own, then the story behind Pikachu. It's a good one: a programmer loved the design so much, the tale goes, that he hid it in Viridian Forest, giving it an ultra-low chance of appearing, so as to grant a sense of scarcity and, therefore, a kind of special status. The result was arguably the most beloved, and subsequently ubiquitous, creature design of all time. One experiment claimed around 50 percent more American millennials recognised a picture of Pikachu than they did a photograph of former US president Joe Biden. Eventually we end up at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, the elephant in the room of any conversation about Pokémon and viral success.</p>
<p>"It's not an accident," Tahk0 says, that Pokémon went mega-viral again, even if it took 20-odd years for that second lightning strike to land. "I don't think it's an accident that it's happened more than once in the lifespan of Pokémon, because I think that is the point of Pokémon.</p>
<p>"It bums me out that people don't get this," he says. "Pokémon is a community thing. It's a multiplayer game." Whenever hardcore fans push back on the idea - "I don't play Pokémon to play with people, blah blah blah" - he wants to respond: "We're doing it right now! The fact that you're talking to me is the interaction!" Call it "multiplayer lore discussion," he jokes, if that helps convey it in the right language.</p>
<blockquote>"Pokémania is the closest thing to a fictional thing being real I've probably ever experienced. Where everybody everywhere is enjoying this thing together, at the exact same time, for a long time... that feeling is probably the thing I've been chasing forever..."</blockquote>
<p>The point is this: Pokémon's layer of narrative mystery has always been there. And it has always been inseparable from the games themselves - and by virtue of that, from Tajiri and Sugimori's goal of bringing people together and getting them talking about their wild rumours, new theories, and pieced-together ideas, just as in their own halcyon days in arcades across Japan. As times have changed, Game Freak has simply adapted to the new landscape. "It's the realisation that you can't datamine the connections between pieces," Tahk0 says, that's led them to lean into the practice of narrative 'puzzle pieces' - what those Eng Lit students might call suspended meaning - that he argues to be so much more prevalent in the games of today than people think.</p>
<p>As our conversation goes on, Tahk0 throws more and more evidence onto the pile. A spot of contextual storytelling around Farfetch'd, in the very first games, that implies the people of Kanto had eaten them almost to extinction. A long-rumoured connection between Cubone and Kangaskhan, given weight by a leaked copy of the games' pre-release beta. A hole in the ground in the first games given meaning only by a digital trading card added to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> in late 2024. An observation - much to my surprise - that every single main series Pokémon game has featured one unexplained human ghost, often in the form of a mysterious young girl. Even a piecing-together of breadcrumbs that links the story of the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> - much derided by many, including this writer, as an incomprehensible jumble of childish parables - to the tragic childhood of its game director, via disparate references to trauma and family. "After you see it this way," he says, "it changes everything".</p><p>I remain curious as to why Takh0 puts so much energy into this, publishing too infrequently to make any real profit, and all in his spare time. "Real life gets a little bit more interesting if you see it through the lens of what people are interested in," he tells me. "Pokémon is just the Trojan horse. Really, the thing I've always been interested in is fictional things being real." I wonder what he means, and he returns to the original, myth-fuelled craze of the 90s.</p>
<p>"Pokémania is like, the closest thing to a fictional thing being real I think I've probably ever experienced. Where everybody everywhere is enjoying this thing together, at the exact same time, for a long time," he says. "That feeling is probably the thing I've been chasing forever... I think I'm just chasing that high."</p>
<p>I know that feeling. That old millennial chestnut is returning again, the Peter Pan syndrome that drives this perpetual thirst for new Pokémon information, new links to an ever more distant past, that makes it possible for the likes of Tarpley and his team to dedicate such vast amounts of time to the historical cause. But Tahk0 describes it as a little more than that - or at least something a little different.</p>
<p>"I think there was an acceptance," he says. "I remember mourning the loss of my childhood when I was 20." But that part, he says, "is gone - I'm not actually trying to recreate my childhood, because I left that behind me. It's more: Oh, now I'm free to understand it."</p>
<blockquote>"There's basically a pile of documents in someone's basement, that they can't seem to find. But I know it's real... this guy's name is on it. And I found the guy. And it is really a huge, huge story..."</blockquote>
<p>Returning one last time to the playground legend of Mew, I ask Tarpley if he ever got to the bottom of its original source. That one's proved difficult, he explains. He and his peers have tracked other rumours right back to their origins before: they traced one somewhat uncomfortable claim that Satoshi Tajiri is autistic - which made it all the way to articles by the Independent and the BBC - right back to a Japanese middle school student in the late 90s, who simply wrote an essay at school suggesting as much. But Mew's is almost too popular to fully pin down. "I don't think I found any sort of smoking gun," Tarpley says, "like it originated from some child who wrote into Famitsu's April 1996 issue, or something like that". The answer of who patient zero was will be "unfindable," he suspects - any number of people could claim they started it, or even be gaslit into thinking they heard it from someone else. "It's lost to time."</p>
<p>He takes a beat to think about it some more, then goes on. "Like Sugimori was talking about, sometimes the unsettled, unsolved mystery is more captivating than the one with an answer. So I suppose to wrap that up in a bow, it's a nice way of saying: 'Y'know, I don't know'."</p><p>Tahk0's Lore Library continues its shared watch parties - as we speak in the days immediately after David Lynch's death, he tells me they're currently most of the way through Twin Peaks: The Return. It couldn't be more appropriate, a work by a man obsessed with abstractions, and the way his medium can wordlessly express them. I tell Tahk0, who lives in fear of spoilers, he's in for a ride.</p>
<p>Tarpley's search continues, meanwhile, as he hunts for more new answers to old, undiscovered questions. "There's one story I've been working on for years," he tells me, almost reluctant to reference it aloud. One true, smoking gun. "There's basically a pile of documents, essentially, in someone's basement, that they can't seem to find. But I know it's real," he goes on, a glimmer of undiscovered treasure in his eye.</p>
<p>"Possibly they've lost it - but I know that they had it at some point. And I think they still have it, because it's mentioned in some Japanese publications from the 90s. And this guy's name is on it. And I found the guy. And it is really a huge, huge story. But I just cannot get those documents."</p>
<p>Together, I realise Tahk0 and Tarpley form two parts of what makes Pokémon whole. Two interpretations of this series' endless mythology. Two kinds of people in search of puzzle pieces, clues, untapped veins of gold, piecing together what they can within two types of mystery that might forever remain unsolved. And two people who have encouraged me, in different ways, to abandon any millennial shame and go in search of this series' myths all over again. Pokémon's creators would be proud.</p>

            <p>Vampire Survivors was a bite-sized revelation when it arrived in 2022. It looked like someone had made it on their lunch break (I say this with love) and then proceeded to dominate lunch breaks for weeks and months to come. I'm not sure the video game industry knew what hit it. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> certainly didn't know what hit it when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-wins-best-game-at-bafta-game-awards">Vampire Survivors surprise-won the Best Game BAFTA</a> that year, and shout-out to Rock, Paper, Shotgun for being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-game-of-the-year-2022?page=5">brave enough to declare Vampire Survivors its game of the year</a>; I was so impressed I nearly turned coat. I love Vampire Survivors unashamedly, so I've been keeping an eye on follow-up Vampire Crawlers since it was announced.</p>

<p>Vampire Crawlers is the next game from Vampire Survivors developer Poncle, though it's also developed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcade-paradise-review-wash-clothes-and-play-games-in-this-feat-of-grime-caked-memory">Arcade Paradise developer Nosebleed</a>. A different studio to help give a different take on Vampire Survivors - a first-person retro-styled dungeon crawl powered by cards. Does it work? Yes, but.</p>
<p>Vampire Crawlers works within the confines of what it does, but as a Vampire Survivors experience, it wavers. This is mechanically quite a different game. It's a card game. So whereas Vampire Survivors was fluid with battles unfolding in real-time, and levels flooding with enemies as you clung on for dear life, Vampire Crawlers is stop-start. You wander around, from battle to battle, to play turn-based games of cards.</p>
<p>There isn't the same feeling of colossally unfavourable odds piling against you as hundreds of enemies swarm like darkness, threatening to snuff you out. Nor is there the experimental thrill of combining powers and discovering game-shaking evolutions as there was in Vampire Survivors. And I miss these things here. But a card game can't work the same way, and given the constraints, it's impressive how close Nosebleed has made this experience feel.</p><p>In Crawlers, you walk tile-by-tile around 3D spaces inspired by Vampire Survivors, such as the Forest or the Library, as you would move around an old dungeon crawler, hence the name. Enemies stand around and when you approach them, a battle begins. Cards appear, modelled on powers from Vampire Survivors, then you play them according to an energy pool. Defeat enemies to earn gems to level up, at which point you'll be offered more cards (and sometimes other things). So: roam around, battle, and see how far you can get with one health-pool. That's very basically how Vampire Crawlers goes.</p>

<p>What's nice here are all the nods to the parent game. I don't think we've ever seen these levels or maps from a first-person perspective, so there's a dose of novelty in nosing around the wooden bookshelves of the Library and seeing enemies you're familiar with face to face. That praying mantis, for example, is enormous. Levels also have nice detail dotted around them, like breakable candelabras and chests and other things familiar from the other game, which spew chickens or gold or power-ups when they're opened or broken. There's a between-runs town with buildings to explore as well, where you can spend gold to increase powers or buy heroes, as in Vampire Survivors. There's homage everywhere, and as a fan that's nice to be around.</p>
<p>Nosebleed has also done much to energise Vampire Crawlers' card game and make it feel more real-time, even though it isn't. You don't have to wait for a card's animation to play before playing another one, for example, so you can click cards and they'll play the moment you do. This keeps the pace motoring. There's an enjoyable combo idea, too, activated by playing cards of sequentially higher mana-cost one after another, so a one-cost card followed by a two-cost card followed by a three-cost card, for example. Do it and the value of the next card rises significantly, whether it's a damage card or card-draw or a buff. Combos are incredibly useful, they're vital later on, and there's an underlying sense the game wants you to be powerful, which tallies brilliantly with Vampire Survivors. There's no slow build-up here either, as powers are strong from the start.</p>



<p>But Vampire Crawlers doesn't scale in the same way; card-powers can only be upgraded once rather than multiple times. Each card has a socket for an upgrade gem, which can do things like double damage, draw a card, return the card, add a buff and so on. Gems also evolve powers via a rare evolution gem, which means it isn't a case of combining things and hoping for a great discovery. It feels a bit flat, a bit pre-prescribed. There doesn't seem to be as much opportunity for experimentation, or breadth and depth in what's offered, though it's worth pointing out I'm only playing a demo, which doesn't have all potential upgrades unlocked. It's also worth stating that when you do have an upgraded deck, rammed with card-draw and complementary buffs, you can make some big plays that go some way towards touching the power-thrill of Vampire Survivors.</p><p>I'm a bit torn, then. I appreciate the attention to detail here and marvel at recreating a Vampire Survivors experience in a different genre, and there are moments - usually when fighting waves of creatures in a boss encounter - that Vampire Crawlers comes close to the intoxication of its source material. But the staccato nature of the game always seems to interrupt it. As a Vampire Survivors experience, it's fractured, and as a card game, it's not really detailed enough; I don't see much room for strategy or theorising here. Small things like not being able to refuse card rewards (as far as I can tell) mean you can't really trim and shape your deck the way you would in other deck-building games.</p>
<p>But again, this is only a demo. There's development time left and more game to discover. As it stands, though, Vampire Crawlers feels trapped between two masters. It's fun, but.</p>

            <h2>28th February</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing. This week, we sadly say goodbye to some of the Eurogamer team, including Tom, who here says goodbye. Meanwhile, Bertie has a scattered gaming week, and Marie, as regularly as clockwork, goes back to Stardew Valley.</p>
<p>If you're looking for something else to read, or a reminder of what you once wrote, there's a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">What We've Been Playing archive</a> to delve into.</p>
<h2>Games media, VideoGamer, USGamer, VG247, and Eurogamer</h2>
<p>22 years (or something like that - to be honest, I've lost track of where it all began). This career is all I ever wanted to do, ever since I realised at a young age that the people who made Mean Machines magazine were being paid to do that. It was a dream. Not one my old school headmaster was that keen on my pursuing, obviously; his stern words attempted to push me (a working class boy who happened to be lucky enough to thrive at school) into a safe career in computing. So I did as I was told.</p>
<p>The world had other plans, as is hopefully clear to anyone who has followed me for the last two decades. I did get a degree in software engineering, but at the same time set up a business with a friend, and the rest is history. There have been plenty of downs over the years (running a business is hard, games media is hard, and working in games media for someone other than yourself is hard too), but I've never lost my passion to be part of something great - something bigger than myself that impacts people's lives. You might find that statement silly, for this is just writing about video games, but I wholeheartedly believe it's possible.</p><p>I don't know what's next for me. This could well be my very last piece of games writing. If it is, I'm not sad about it (well, maybe a little). I know everyone I've worked with will do their best to continue on with that very same philosophy, to aim high, roll with the punches, and do the very best job they can. They all deserve your support in trying to do so.</p>
<p><em>-Tom O (Former Eurogamer Editorial Director)</em></p>
<h2>Farewell Tom, and everyone else leaving Eurogamer this week</h2>
<p>How do you follow that? Tom, you're a hero, and you've done so much for Eurogamer that often goes unseen (like contributing unfailingly to this article every week). Thank you for everything and I wish you - we all wish you - the best of luck with what comes next. And a wider thank you and farewell to the other people leaving Eurogamer this week. I don't want to say too much for fear of ruining their personal announcements but you have all, to a person, made Eurogamer a place worth visiting. I will miss you; we will all miss you.</p>
<p>As for the games I've been playing this week: it's a jumbled bunch. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> continues to call to me, and I'm trying to work my way around the character roster to get a sense of everyone I haven't played there. I was splashing around with Wuyang the other day and while I'm not huge on the character's visual design, mechanically, he's great. I also dropped into Highguard for the first time this week, eager to try it before it disappears, and Quantic Dream's odd new project Spellcasters Chronicles - odd because Quantic Dream does not make third-person MOBA games. It's okay. Besides that I also spent an evening dabbling in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and I'm starting to get into it now. I've been scattered, basically. It's been a week.</p>

            <p>
Retro specialist Evercade has unveiled a bit of a treat for Rare fans: a cute little handheld device featuring 14 of the legendary British developer's games, spanning right back to its earliest days.
</p>
<p>
Officially known as the Super Pocket Rare Edition, it's a <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/rare-edition/">vaguely Game Boy shaped handheld</a> sporting some eye-catchingly vibrant primary hues (basically, the standard Super Pocket with a bit of Rare flair). It's got a 2.8" 320×240 IPS Screen, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and supports USB-C charging. Additionally, it's fully Evercade compatible, meaning you're not just limited to its 14 included games - it also works with the company's library of 75+ cartridges, covering over 650 titles.

<p>
But it's the included games you'll probably be most curious about, and Evercade has pulled together a pretty nice selection - albeit heavily favouring Rare's early 8-bit output, when it was still known as Ultimate Play the Game. You do get the studio's much-loved platformer Banjo-Kazooie alongside the likes of Battletoads, but after that we're firmly in the realm of classics like Knight Lore, Atic Atac, and Lunar Jetman. Here's the list in full:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Banjo-Kazooie (64-bit console)</li>
<li>Conker’s Pocket Tales (8-bit handheld console)</li>
<li>Battletoads in Battlemaniacs (16-bit console)</li>
<li>Battletoads (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Cobra Triangle (8-bit console)</li>
<li>R.C. Pro-Am II (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Slalom (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Snake Rattle ‘n’ Roll (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warpship (8-bit console)</li>
<li>Atic Atac (home computer)</li>
<li>Jetpac (home computer)</li>
<li>Lunar Jetman (home computer)</li>
<li>Knight Lore (home computer)</li>
<li>Gunfright (home computer)</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you're wondering how much this adorable little nostalgia machine might set you back, the (officially licensed) Super Pocket Rare Edition will cost £49.99/€59.99/$69.99 when it launches this June. And if that's got you sufficiently tempted, <a href="https://www.hypermegatech.com/retailers/">pre-orders are now open</a>.

            <p>Pokémon fans have just finished watching the 30th anniversary presentation, and the debut trailer for the 10th generation games: Pokémon Winds and Waves. While thoughts and feelings are still gestating, the internet has, as ever, already begun to have its fun in reacting to the latest set of neat little guys.</p>
<p>"Yo! it's red from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a>!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg8kd4/yo_its_red_from_angry_birds/">wrote user Sceptic_Stream</a> on the Pokémon Reddit, who slotted in the titular moody bird from the popular phone game in the place of Browt - one of the new starter Pokémon. They <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg8juu/we_really_got_the_angry_bird/">were not alone in connecting these dots</a>, but despite his moody mannerisms Browt seems to have gone down a treat.</p> 
<p>"I have never not picked a grass starter in a Pokémon game, and I'm not about to start now," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petestewart.bsky.social/post/3mftyhnzszc2w">wrote Respawn Entertainment's Pete Stewart</a>. "but I'll damned if Pombon isn't everything to me (but also I love you very much, angry little Browt)."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The similarity is uncanny...</p> 
<p>But how can you hate this moody boy!</p> 
<p>Bombon, a cheery pomeranian, has gone a long way in winning the hearts of thousands. "You have no idea how excited I am to have my pup be with me in Waves" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg8j5v/you_have_no_idea_how_excited_i_am_to_have_my_pup/">wrote Impressive-Eggplant6</a>, seeing a lot of Bombon in their own, real life adorable dog.</p><p>Others, still throwing adoration to the Fire-type starter, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/petrana.bsky.social/post/3mftx2c5scs2m">did so with a disclaimer</a>: "Please don’t turn into a Man please don’t turn into a Man PLEASE don’t turn into a Man" begged Petrana Radulovic, a desire born of the series' tendencies to take four-legged Pokémon and pull them up on their hind legs.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Keep 'em on four legs! (Credit: @petrana.bsky.social)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The final starter, Gecqua, is also getting their flowers. One <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg86dz/comment/o7pfkhe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Key_Amazed proclaimed</a>: "I'm in love with Gecqua's design. I really love elegant water type Pokemon like Milotic. Hopefully the final evolutions aren't bipeds."</p> 
<p>Artists spared no time paying homage to the new starters!</p>
<p>But putting aside the starters, what else did fans like the look of? Well, for the first time in a while, a Pokémon game looks visually impressive! In a post titled 'If this is representative of the game's visuals I am cautiously optimistic', user _AntiSocialMedia shared their thoughts on the early gameplay footage shown off today.</p>
<p>"Low image quality aside, the last few games have looked pretty rough so I am cautiously optimistic about this game looking good," they wrote. "What really got my attention was the lighting on the Slugmas in the caves."</p> 
<p>SpaceShipRat<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1rg8543/comment/o7pfork/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"> shared the sentiment</a>: "They've done it. After 10 years, they've managed to make a full 3D game that's not painful to look at."</p>
<p>So as far as first impressions go, it looks like Pokémon Winds and Waves are off to a grand start. Whether this momentum continues throughout the year as we near the 2026 release date for both titles, is the big question. Especially since, in a bold move, this new Pokémon  generation will be exclusive to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <p>Amazon has shared a first look at Ryan Hurst as Kratos in the God of War TV series it's making.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/PrimeVideo/status/2027398332482465882/photo/1">The picture, shared on X</a>, shows Hurst topless and leaning forwards while teaching his son Atreus, played by Callum Vinson, how to hunt. It's an image that echoes the opening parts of the God of War reboot, which was released in 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">Ryan Hurst was named as Kratos</a> in January and is no stranger to the God of War series, having played Thor in God of War: Ragnarok - a performance that earned him a BAFTA nomination. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-atreus-actor">Callum Vinson was confirmed as Atreus</a> earlier this month.</p>
<figure>

<p>They'll be joined by actor Ed Skrein - known for portraying sellsword Daario Naharis in the Game of Thrones TV series - as Baldur, who confronts Kratos at the beginning of the God of War game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-keeps-casting-characters-from-ragnarok-adds-severance-and-homeland-stars-as-odin-and-thor">Severance actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson has been cast as Thor, and Homeland actor Mandy Patinkin as Odin</a>.

            <p>Nintendo is making a mini Game Boy-styled music player that will play special Pokémon Red and Blue music cartridges that look like Game Boy games. This palm-sized device is being released today.</p>
<p>The music player was announced by Pokémon music man Junichi Masuda during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-todays-30th-anniversary-pokemon-presents-showcase">this afternoon's Pokémon Presents</a>, where we heard that there will be 45 songs/cartridges to collect for the music player device. This represents all of the songs from the Red and Blue Pokémon game, and "particular care" has apparently been made to make the player's audio sound like in the originating Pokémon game.</p>
<p>There's <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/ex/gameboy_musiccollection/ja/">a Japanese website for the new device</a> that lists a price of JPY 9900, which translates to £47, but I can't find any European regional details yet.</p>

            <p>Pokémon Wind and Waves, the 10th generation of mainline Pokémon games, have just been revealed during today's 30th anniversary celebratory event. It's set to release in 2027 simultaneously.</p>
<p>The reveal, a gameplay trailer introducing us to a variety of Pokémon new and old, takes us through various locations in game, including a volcano, beaches, and sapphire blue oceans. </p>
<p>In terms of setting, Winds and Waves appears to be based in a locale inspired by South East Asia. We also got a quick look at what appear to be the three new starters: Grass-type Browt, Fire-type Pombon, and Water-type Gecqua.</p>

<figcaption>Here's the new trailer for Winds and Waves.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfz8dR2P8kY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Perhaps the biggest stinger of the trailer is that the 10th generation of Pokémon will be missing a 2026 release. At the tail end of the trailer, both logos for Winds and Waves were shown, alongside the line: "global simultaneous release in 2027". It'll also be released on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. This is notable as the Winds and Waves trailer did not feature a Nintendo Switch 1 logo, indicating it'll release solely on Nintendo's latest console.</p>

            <p>The Pokémon company has just announced a key feature of conveniance for the upcoming Nintnedo Online versions of Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. Pokémon you catch in these classics can be transfered over to more contemporary titles via Pokémon Home.
</p>
<p>This was a big sticking point for Pokémon fans, who were curious as to whether any of the classic Pokémon present in these generation one ports would be accessible across other titles. This feature has been a key interconnecting feature across modern releases in the series. Without it, these re-releases of classic games would be a tad barebones.
</p>
<p>While the Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen re-release has been known about for a while now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-home-support-mention-deleted">soaring up the Nintendo Switch sales charts</a>, whether or not this would be possible was kept a secret from the game's eShop page.</p>
<p>Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen are out today, available for sale for £16.99 or your regional equivalent.
</p>

            <p>Happy birthday, Pokémon - now officially at the age when the joints start to creak and you can really feel those hangovers kicking in. Today marks 30 years since the perennially popular creature-catching series made its Japanese Game Boy debut in the form of Pocket Monsters Red and Green, and The Pokémon Company is celebrating the occasion with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oi-dwqVWX_o">special anniversary Pokémon Presents showcase</a>. Wondering what’s been announced? You'll find everything - from the Gen 10 to the free-to-play suff - below.</p>
<h2>A Game Boy-like device for Pokémon music!</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Want a cute (if probably quite impractical) way to listen to music from Pokémon Red and Blue? Well, then you might be intrigued by the Game Boy Jukebox - a small device, designed to resemble a mini Game Boy, that you slot Pokémon game cartridges into. Except they don't play games, only music. These music players are available via the Pokémon Center store in the UK, Canada, and US from today, and there are 45 songs - and therefore 45 cartridges - to collect. No pricing details were mentioned.</p>
<h2>A brief update on this year's Pokémon World Championships</h2>
<p>The Pokémon World Championships 2026 are being held in San Francisco alongside the inaugural Pokémon XP fan event, which runs from 28-30 August, and are set to welcome over 3000 competitors. Attendees will be battling each other in the Pokémon Trading Card Game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, and Pokémon Unite. And for the firt time this year, the competution includes the soon-to-be-released Pokémon Champions (see below!).</p>
<h2>Pokémon TCG is also having a birthday celebration</h2>

<p>It's not just Pokémon that turns 30 this year; The Pokémon Trading Card Game is also celebrating the big three-oh. And to mark that milestone, The Pokémon Company is promising - although not yet detailing - a "dazzling line" of TGC "products" that's getting a global launch in 2026.</p>

<p>There's a bit of relevant news for fans of GameCube's Pokémon XD: Gale of the Darkness. It's being made available to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers as part of the Nintendo Classics range. It's coming this March, which isn't far away - but do note is exclusive to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>And yet another birthday! This year marks the 10th anniversary of Pokémon Go, but what we have here specifically is a 30th Anniversary Event (it's called All Out) to celebrate the franchise as a whole. The gist is that a "huge range" of Pokémon will return to Go between 7th-9th March, so if you want to catch-'em-all, you know what to do. Additionally, the Pokémon Go Tour: Kalos Global runs from 28th February to 1st March, should you want something else to do.</p>

<p>The nostalgia continues! Pokémon Blue and Red protagonist, Red, will soon be making an appearance in Pokémon Masters EX with his classic look. More specifically, he's arriving as part of a new Pokémon Masters EX Sync Pair - featuring Pikachu and Red (1996) - that's available now. Additionally, another Sync Pair - this time Florian and Ogerpon (Anniversary 2026) - arrive tomorrow, 28th February, while Juliana and Terapagos (Anniversary 2026) turn up on 2nd March. Oh, and if you log in now, you'll get 3000 gems.</p>

<p>There's not much say about this one: only that Mew is coming to Pokémon Sleep with a bunch of new missions starting tonight. Time to catch some Zs!</p>
<h2>New arrivals hit Pokémon Unite</h2>
<p>To celebrate Pokémon Day, three legendary birds are on their way to Pokémon Unite. Who? That'll be Zapdos, Moltres, and Articuno - and you'll need to participate in the relevant event to unlock their Unite licences. Elsewhere, players can say hello to Meganium, Typhlosion, and Feraligar soon.</p>

<h2>Pokémon TCG Pocket's 30 Years of Pokémon</h2>

<p>The previously announced Pokémon Champions, which lets players battle each other in an arena using new or previous Pokémon Partners (you'll need to use Pokémon Home in order to access the latter), finally has narrowed down its 2026 release window a little further: it's coming to Switch sometime this April, with Android and iOS versions to follow.</p>

<p>If you're still tootling away in Pokémon Z-A, you might be interested to hear that its Mega Dimension DLC is getting a bit of an update. Starting today, 27th February, you can claim a Mystery Gift that'll let you detect a special hyperspace distortion - in-game, obviously. That, in turn, will lead you to Mega Garchomp Z. And if you manage to defeat it, you'll get a Garchompite Z stone that your own Garchomp can hold to Mega Evolve into Mega Garchomp Z.</p>

<p>It's not too far away at this point, but it seems like Pokémon Pokopia has been hanging onto a few last surprises - including DJ Rotom's role as a handy music player. And if you're peckish you can chat with Chef Dente - a Greedent - to learn new food recipes. Pokopia's latest trailer also featured a peek at four-player mode, for those wanting to visit their pals' islands. So not much that’s super new or super exciting, but it continues to looks cool!</p>

<p>And here it is, Gen 10! Pokémon Winds and Waves got their big debut during the Pokémon showcase, including a look at the games' seemingly Southeast Asia-inspired world - all blue skies, tropical jungles, and rolling waves - alongside its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-gen-10-starters-browt-pombom-gecqua">three new starters</a>: Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua. The major news, though, is we won't be getting the games this year - Pokémon Wind and Waves are confirmed for release in 2027. We've taken a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-winds-and-waves-everything-we-know-so-far">closer look at Pokémon Winds and Waves</a>, along with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-pokemon-winds-and-waves-returning">returning Pokémon</a>.</p>

            <p>Pokémon's 30th anniversary celebrations start with a bang this afternoon, with a special Pokémon Presents broadcast that could reveal the new generation (gen 10) of core Pokémon games. The show starts at 2pm (UK) and you can watch it in the video embedded here.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Presents is scheduled to run for about 20-25 minutes and is expected to be where we'll hear about  the successor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>, and the next generation of Pokémon games. Legends Z-A technically belongs to generation nine.</p>
<p>We're also expecting updates on Pokémon Champions and we're bracing, we hope, for some surprises. We won't be covering this event live, by the way, but we will be rounding up the broadcast afterwards.</p>

            <p>A new report into what went wrong with multiplayer shooter Highguard has revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> allegedly pulled funding from the studio two weeks after the game's launch. This was what Wildlight reportedly told staff while laying off most of the 100-person team.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier wrote</a> that on 11th February, slightly more than two weeks after the game's 26th January launch, staff were called to an all-hands meeting and told there would be layoffs. Management said Tencent had pulled funding, according to "people familiar with the events", and the general consensus was Highguard failed to meet whatever metrics Tencent had for it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildlight publicly confirmed layoffs a day later</a> but wouldn't specify numbers, and it insisted "a core group of developers" remained to work on the game. Bloomberg says fewer than 20 people remain at Wildlight today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-funded-by-tencent">Tencent's role in Highguard's development</a> was, curiously, kept quiet. It wasn't until several days after the layoffs that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-reportedly-funded-by-tencent">Game File confirmed Tencent's involvement</a>. The reason for the secrecy around the company's involvement is unclear, given its foundational role in Wildlight. Had it not been for the "significant amount of funding" Wildlight reportedly received from Tencent, it likely wouldn't have been able to hire the team that made Highguard.</p><p>But what went wrong with Highguard? Bloomberg sketched a picture of development by talking to 10 former Wildlight employees. It's interesting to me that the game started as a survival-shooter, along the lines of Rust apparently, partly to avoid the crowded competitive shooter area it eventually ended up in. Two years of development went towards achieving this survival idea until Wildlight realised it wasn't working and pivoted.</p>
<p>This survival-shooter heritage is important because it resulted in some of the things we still see in the game now, such as the mining for Vesper currency, and even base raiding. These things were salvaged. Perhaps it's because of the muddled origins we're left with a game with an overly dense and complicated core. Highguard is a base-raiding game where you upgrade equipment and use siege weaponry and hero powers while also fighting other players, so it's a mash of a few different ideas. It's telling that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-barely-has-several-hundred-people-playing-together">much of this complexity is being swept aside by new game modes being added to the game</a> now.</p>
<p>How did nobody notice this unfavourable complexity in the lead-up to launch? Highguard was apparently "extensively" tested, both internally and externally according to the Bloomberg report. But the conditions for testing were ideal. Internal testers already knew the game, so the complexity wasn't an issue, and controlled testing groups used voice comms, which is a subtle but meaningful difference to how casual players play.</p>
<p>The idea of open testing was raised, but Wildlight leadership apparently "nixed it". "They wanted to recreate what had worked with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>," Bloomberg wrote, "which had been kept secret until it was announced and launched at the same time."</p><p>Apex Legends' success cast a shadow over Highguard. Some of the team came from Respawn so were confident - the interviewed developers used the word "hubris" to describe Wildlight's mindset - that they could achieve success with Highguard. Even when negativity started to surround the game after The Game Awards announcement, Wildlight "encouraged" staff to secrecy because it believed the game would "speak for itself".</p>
<p>It seems fair to say Highguard's future is uncertain, despite Wildlight's scramble to introduce new modes and characters to jump-start the game. One such mode, an all-out Raid Rush mode, was added to Highguard today. But Highguard doesn't exist in a vacuum, and its continued struggle is surrounded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-server-slam-steam-players-concurrent">the high-profile debut of competitive shooter Marathon</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">a resurgent Overwatch</a>. Amongst that, it's hard, bearing in mind the size of the team still working on Highguard, to see where a revival or comeback will come from.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Marathon's Server Slam kicked off yesterday, and attracted an healthy number of players on Steam. In the past 24 hours, the game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/">brought in a peak of 143,621 concurrent players, solely on the PC platform</a>.</p>
<p>The Marathon Server Slam, the final public beta for Bungie's sci-fi extraction shooter ahead of its launch on the 5th March, is free-to-download and try out for anyone interested in the game. It's available on Steam, as well as PlayStation and Xbox. As such, while these early figures are impressive, they remain just a slice of the Slam's full popularity.</p>
<p>For context, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-already-has-servers-slammed-by-almost-100000-players-in-two-hours-as-weekend-playtest-starts">Arc Raiders' final public beta test also broke above the 100,000 concurrent peak milestone soon after its release</a>. It reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2427520/charts/">an all-time peak of 189,668</a>, so for those keeping track of the numbers as an indicator of launch success, the hope is that Marathon can stack an extra 40,000 or so over the weekend.</p>
<p>Indeed it's hard not to compare the two games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, while certainly not the first extraction shooter to make a big splash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">certainly brought the subgenre into the spotlight since its launch last year</a>. It has proven exceptionally popular, and arguably opened the door for other extraction shooters to tap into that engaged audience. Marathon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-plagiarism-scandal-resolved-satisfaction-of-artist">which has by no means had a hurdle-free development cycle</a>, may be able to emulate a similar success.</p><p>In terms of <em>very</em> early community reception, things appear to be positive. Typical Bungie gunplay quality is present, and the aesthetic while offputting for some has enraptured others. Best to keep an eye on the game over the weekend, and jump in yourself to see what all the fuss is about if you're so inclined! The Server Slam ends on the 2nd March.</p>

            <p>The team behind 2D side-scroller God of War: Sons of Sparta has shared details on how to access the game's two player co-op content without finishing the main story first.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced and shadow dropped earlier this month on PS5. Developed by Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Sony Santa Monica, it is a retro-inspired canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>On its debut earlier this year, many had assumed the game would be able to be played in single player, or as a two-player co-op experience, due to the wording on the PlayStation Store which said the game was suitable for "1-2 players". However, it turned out this was only partly accurate, as the co-op gameplay was actually a roguelike challenge mode which was only accessible <em>after </em>Sons of Sparta's main story had been completed.</p>
<p>This led to a certain amount of disappointment among the God of War community. Comments like "this might be legit false advertising" and "locking co op behind beating the full story is such a weird call" soon <a href="https://x.com/SonySantaMonica/status/2022393739986244098">peppered Sony Santa Monica and Mega Cat Studio's social media</a>. But, it now seems that the Sons of Sparta team has heard these cries, and sought to remedy the situation by providing a code players can enter on the start menu which will unlock the separate endgame roguelike challenge mode from the off.</p>
<p>And that code? Well, it's:</p>
<p><strong>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, L1, R1, Touchpad</strong></p>
<p>If you pop that in, you will then get a new option on your menu which will allow you to access Sons of Sparta's The Pit of Agonies, which can be played solo or in two-player local co-op.</p>
<p>As for what The Pit of Agonies is all about, well the reason the team initially decided to keep it as endgame content is because it is apparently very difficult. But, if you are up for it, this challenge mode will present you with different enemies and reward pools each time you play. You can check out a trailer about it all below.</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade. However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

            <p>
Pokémon is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-30-super-bowl-spot-lady-gaga-and-jigglypuff-performance">30 this week</a>. Stardew Valley is 10! Coincidence? YOU DECIDE. Our focus here, though, is developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's smash-hit farming game, which is celebrating its major birthday milestone with a special video featuring, among other things, a look at its forthcoming 1.7 update.
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley launched for PC on 26th February, 2016, meaning today, specifically, marks its tenth anniversary. And Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2026717852162732412">confirmed he had a bit of a treat planned for the occasion</a> on social media earlier the week. Officially, the video - which is set to air at 7pm in the UK this evening - is a "retrospective and new spouse reveal", which will include some old pre-release footage of the game, with Barone providing commentary.
</p>
<p>
He'll also be talking about the many updates Stardew Valley has received over the years, which brings us to that "spouse reveal". Last August - despite previously saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">there'd be no more Stardew Valley updates</a> until after the release of his next game, the Haunted Chocolatier - Barone revealed he'd <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-be-getting-another-update-after-all">had a bit of a change of heart</a>. Then, back in February, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-getting-new-marriage-options-better-children-in-next-update">teased the forthcoming 1.7 update</a> would include upgrades to the children of Stardew Valley, making them "a little more interesting", as well as two new marriage candidates for players to woo. And it's the latter we'll be meeting tonight.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all there is to report until after Barone's anniversary video airs. So if you fancy meeting your new potential life partners, you'll be wanting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geiTg6Z7w3A">point your face at YouTube</a> starting 7pm GMT/8pm CET/11am PST. 
</p>
<p>
As for the long-awaited Haunted Chocolatier, Barone <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">recently revealed</a> that work on his next game, originally announced back in 2021, had been "very productive lately". There's still no whiff of a release date yet, however, with Barone only saying it'll "come out when it's done."</p>

            <p>If you're not up on your South Korean pop culture, there's a decent chance you might have been a little surprised to see a musclebound bipedal chicken take centre stage when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">publisher Krafton unveiled Project Windless earlier this year</a>. But if you're already familiar with author Lee Youngdo's wildly popular (in South Korea, at least) high fantasy series The Bird That Drinks Tears, it probably made a lot more sense. That lack of global familiarity with Project Windless' source material is something Krafton is all too aware of, and something it's eager to remedy. Which is why - despite Windless seemingly still being some way off - I recently found myself having a chat with project lead and veteran Far Cry series director Patrik Méthé to find out more.</p>
<p>Windless is not - despite having its origins in a hugely popular high fantasy series that's yet to break the west - the "Korean Witcher". Yet that's how the project first caught Méthé's eye after he left Ubisoft. "It's a long story, he explains. "It was purely a classic case of someone poking me on LinkedIn... and there was a link in the contact... and it brought me to an article [which said] something like, 'The creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> is looking to do the Korean Witcher', and for me, it was like, 'Whoa, okay. I'm very interested in that.'"</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD0dMr3kAQs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure><p>Project Windless reveal trailer.
</p><p>As it happened, those press comparisons were a little premature. Méthé eventually learned that while Krafton had secured the rights to The Bird That Drinks Tears series (the publisher's CEO is reportedly a big fan) the specific direction of the project had yet to be determined. "Basically," Méthé explains, "Krafton launched [the Montreal studio where he now works] because they wanted our expertise... They were like, look, we have this IP - what can you do to bring it into the Western world, knowing that in Korea, it's already very well known? What can you do to bring it to as many people as possible, so that everyone discovers this incredible universe?" And from there, Methe and his team were given "a lot of freedom" to shape the game.</p><p>This would be Methe's first encounter with The Bird That Drinks Tears; a series that, having now read a "very rough" in-house English version, he calls, "so far from the tropes that we know from more Western culture" and "fresh." And as to how that might translate to a video game, the team "considered different approaches," he explains, but the decision to focus on the series' bird-like race, known as the Rekon, came about surprisingly organically. "At the time [we were brainstorming]," Méthé continues, "the studio was very, very young. So every week we were interviewing candidates to join the adventure. And we had different books, concept art about the novel... and every time a candidate would come, they would look at the book, and look at some of the characters of the story, and they would say, 'No matter what, I hope I can play this character'. And it was a Rekon, everyone was really intrigued by this huge, half-bird humanoid, so it helped us refine [our angle]. There was one very mythic [Rekon] in the universe... so that's where we slowly but surely started to lean toward this idea."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Officially, Project Windless is an open-world adventure with "one-versus-many combat fantasy", and its debut trailer immediately drew comparison with the likes of God of War and Dynasty Warriors. But Méthé says that while he can "understand" how people might have reached that conclusion, he still feels "that we're very different from these games". And one major differentiator is that fact Project Windless is "a game about war" and "not just [as] set-dressing".</p>
<p>"For us," Méthé explains, "it's part of the economy of the game. Every action that you'll do, every action that you won't do, will have an impact on the outcome of what's going on on-screen. And you are very, very powerful as a Rekon [but] you'll still need the help of other people. So it's the universal need of helping each other and creating those alliances that will help you prevail."</p><p>And more than that, players "are creating [their] own myth." Project Windless' protagonist, the Hero King, isn't just strong, he's the "mightiest of them all" and so the team is playing into the "notion of being a myth". 1000 years after his time, the Hero King remains the stuff of legend, but "everything that he did, and the order in which he did it is unknown". This allows Project Windless to give players "as much freedom and liberty as in open world games, but all of that while having huge impact and having to face huge armies like you see in other types of games."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And then there's the Hero King's inherent strength. When you're playing someone who's the "mightiest", says Méthé, "it's a really different mindset. So the first time you take the controller and you start to turn the corner and you see 100 units rushing at you, your reflex is to back up a bit, and then you realise, 'Oh no, okay, I'm a legend.' Which isn't to say you can't become <em>more</em> of a legend. "You'll still have your progression," explains Méthé. "You'll still unlock new abilities, new equipment. But the main difference is that, right from the get go, you can take on 30 enemies at once, and it's not such a big challenge." All of this together, says  Méthé, creates "a mix we've never seen - at least I've never played that kind of game where the combination of those ingredients creates that feeling."</p>
<p>As for the kind of rhythm players can expect from Project Windless' action, Méthé is only willing to share a little right now. "I don't want to spoil too much at this point," he says, "but once again, for us, respecting the notion of a true world at war is very important. So there's the [reptilian] Nhaga army that's invaded the place... and at first you're quite alone, because the army [has] succeeded at overwhelming the humans and... a few of the Rekon. And it's up to you to decide, okay, what do I do? If I go to the east, I know there used to be a tower in that direction. Maybe I can find an ally over there. There used to be a huge human settlement... Maybe I will go there, because [their] catapult could help me later on, and each player will then figure out and create and carve their own journey, to find the best way to repel - or at least to try to repel - the enemy army."</p><p>As a veteran director on Ubisoft's Far Cry series, Méthé does, of course, know his way around an open-world game, and I ask him how his experience is helping shape Project Windless. For him, it's not just about knowing what to do in an open-world game, but what <em>not</em> to do too. "So one thing we're discussing every week," he elaborates, "[is] we want to make sure that nothing is imposed on the player. We don't want a checklist. We create the world, we create the context - the war is happening - and we want to let the player be as free as possible while doing that." But beyond that, Méthé says it's also crucial to make players care. "And to care," he continues, "means that the protagonist, their motivation, needs to resonate with you as a player. But also it means the antagonist needs to be someone that you love to hate. And those are the two elements I would say we're always keeping in mind and working on."</p>

</figure>
<p>How all this will come together in the end? It may be a while before we find out. Project Windless (officially just a codename at present) has been in development for "a few years" and is currently "somewhere between conception and alpha", or "pre-alpha" as Méthé puts it. Even so the team is "super proud" of the public reception to Windless' debut trailer. "We're a mix of veterans and people working on their first game," he explains. "So for me it was almost emotional to see the reaction of some of our members, and realise, wow, it's the first time that they're seeing [this], because at the end of the day, we do this job [to create emotions among players]. And we got a lot of [positive] emotions following the release, so we couldn't be more happy."</p>
<p>When we'll see more of Project Windless is unclear, but for those interested in its origins, The Bird That Drinks Tears' English translation releases this June.</p>

            <p>More drastic changes are being made to Highguard as developer Wildlight desperately tries to hold onto a playerbase leaking through its fingers like water.</p>
<p>Yesterday Highguard recorded a high-point of only 694 concurrent players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#1m">according to stat-tracker SteamDB</a>. This number has been steadily declining throughout February, a month Highguard began with approximately 13,000 daily concurrent players.</p>
<p>The latest effort to stem the drainage, and perhaps even reverse it, comes in the addition of a fast-paced game mode called Raid Rush, which arrives tomorrow, 27th February, 5pm GMT. This pits two teams of five against each other in base attack and defense, and does away with the faffy looting phase entirely.</p>
<p>During the match, teams alternate between attack and defence each round, bases will be automatically repaired and you don't need to buy armour (everyone will get the same armour and it will increase in rarity each round). The only admin you'll do is buy things from the Trader, if you want. It's basically all-out action. There are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">various quality of life and balance fixes</a> alongside this.</p><p>Whether the Raid Rush update will affect Highguard's ominous predicament, I don't know, but I'm doubtful. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-reveals-one-final-character-trailer-ahead-of-its-server-slam-test-the-humble-rook">a public Marathon playtest</a> scheduled for this weekend, and likeminded hero shooters such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">Overwatch resurgent</a>, there doesn't seem much air in the space to breathe. A more incisive question might be how long Highguard can hang on for.</p>
<p>Highguard was the show-closing announcement at The Game Awards in December, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">a suspicious silence followed that undermined confidence in the game</a>. Then, when the game was released, it struggled to convince. Wildlight quickly reacted by adding larger team modes to appease players, but by then the direction of travel, away from the game, seemed set. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildlight underwent lay-offs as a result, though the team stoically insisted Highguard would live on</a>. But with only several hundred concurrent players a day, I don't know how long that's feasible for.</p>

            <p>Skate developer Full Circle - which is part of EA's studio network - has announced "changes to [its] team structure", that will result in layoffs at the company.</p>
<p>Full Circle said it is "transforming" the studio, which will see it "reshaping to better support Skate's long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most" to players. This transformation, it said, will include layoffs.</p>

<p>"The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-2025">Skate.</a> Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today," <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">Full Circle wrote in a blog post</a>, stressing the "decision is not a reflection of their impact and we're committed to supporting them through this transition".</p>
<p>As for Skate, which was released in September and proved especially popular on its first day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-players-stuck-in-lengthy-queues-for-online-only-skate-those-who-made-it-in-are-comparing-its-bouncing-belly-flopping-traversal-to-mario-64">leading to lengthy queues</a>, work will still continue. "We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you," Full Circle said. "Our commitment to Skate, and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong."</p>
<p>The studio did not say how many Full Circle employees are affected by the this week's layoffs. Eurogamer has asked EA for a comment and will update when we know more.</p>
<p>"After an absolute age, EA's wheelie classic is back with great handling and a whole world of slightly jarring niceness," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-early-access-review">Skate early access review</a>.</p>

            <p>The New York State Attorney General Letitia James has announced her intention to sue Valve over alleged illegal gambling. They claim that the developer and owner of Steam allows "children and adults" to do so via lootboxes in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through">In a statement</a> released alongside the <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/new-york-v-valve-corporation-complaint-2026.pdf">52-page legal filing</a>, James stated: "Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people. Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve's illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers."</p>
<p>This lawsuit will be handled by assistant attorney generals Marc Montgomery and Alexandra Hiatt, senior enforcement counsel Jordan Adler, the Bureau of Internet and Technology's bureau chief Kim Berger, as well as deputy bureau chief Clark Russell.</p>
<p>The statement also touches on aspects of these loot box environments, including the substantial increase of value it's seen over the years. It reads: "The virtual items awarded when a user opens a "loot box" are cosmetic, like a hat for a player's character or artistic skins for a player's weapons. Like slot machines, the prizes won from loot boxes are determined randomly in accordance with odds set by the casino, which in this case is Valve. Valve intentionally makes some items far harder to win than others, making the rare items more valuable. Despite having no in-game functionality, these virtual items can be extremely valuable, with the rarest items selling for thousands of dollars online.</p><p>"The value of Counter-Strike's skins rose significantly in recent years, attracting speculators and investors who viewed these virtual items as potentially lucrative digital assets. In March 2025, it was reported that the market for Counter-Strike skins had surpassed $4.3 billion."</p>
<p>According to the filing, the New York State is requesting the following in terms of relief from this lawsuit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permanently enjoining Defendant from violating the Constitution and laws of the state of New York, including Executive Law § 63(12) and Penal Law §§ 225.05 and 225.10</li>
<li>Directing Defendant to produce an accounting of monies lost by consumers in New York as a result of Defendant’s illegal acts</li>
<li>Directing Defendant to make full restitution to consumers and pay damages caused, directly or indirectly, by the illegal acts complained of herein plus applicable pre-judgment interest</li>
<li>Directing Defendant to disgorge all monies resulting from the illegal practices alleged herein</li>
<li>Directing Defendant to pay a fine of three times the amount of its gain from the illegal practices alleged herein, pursuant to Penal Law § 80.10</li>
<li>Directing such other equitable relief as may be necessary to redress Defendant’s violations of New York law; g. Awarding Plaintiff costs of $2,000 pursuant to CPLR § 8303(a)(6)</li>
<li>Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of writing, Valve has yet to respond to this lawsuit.</p>

<p>We had a lot of love for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> on its release. "With smart additions that move the series forward, this is the most accessible, deepest and simply very best Monster Hunter to date," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-rise-review-the-switchs-best-game-since-breath-of-the-wild">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Rise review from 2021</a>.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slime-rancher-2">Slime Rancher 2</a>, well, back in 2022 Christian Donlan called it both "glorious" and "ghastly" after he took it for a short spin.</p>
<p>"Slime Rancher 2 is absolutely gorgeous, a kind of duvet-soft archipelago filled with thick waving grass, sun-warmed rocks, and dreamy coastal vistas. It is such a pleasure to explore, I would be out there wandering even if I wasn't lured through it with the promise of slimes to capture," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-2-is-glorious-and-ghastly-and-thats-whats-fascinating-about-it">Eurogamer's Slime Rancher 2 feature</a>.</p>
<p>PGA Tour 2K25, Monster Hunter Rise, Slime Rancher 2 and The Elder Scrolls Online Collection: Gold Road will be available for all PlayStation Plus members from 3rd March. They will be on the service until Monday, 6th April.</p>

            <p>The casting for Wolfenstein 3 has begun.</p>
<p>There has long been chatter that MachineGames, the team also behind the sublime Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, wasn't done with the Wolfenstein series. Towards the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-doesnt-sound-like-weve-heard-the-last-from-machinegames-wolfenstein-series">studio head Jerk Gustafsson said the team would like to work on a New Colossus sequel</a>. "We have a story to tell," he said during a documentary by Noclip, which was released in September.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Then, just this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-developer-machinegames-still-plans-to-finish-its-wolfenstein-trilogy">Gustafsson told Eurogamer's sister site GamesIndustry that the "intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein"</a>, and MachineGames "wanted to finish the trilogy". And, it seems like we are one very key step closer to that becoming a reality.</p>
<p>According to a casting call seen by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-wolfenstein-3-first-story-details-unveiled-as-casting-begins">MP1st</a>, performance capture for Wolfenstein 3 - codenamed Valkyrie - is scheduled to kick off later this year, in April. This process will allegedly run into 2027.</p>
<p>As for story details, the call is for a character named Sofiya, who is described as an orphan between the ages of 8-11 from Ukraine. She has a dog called Ralph, and the two of them form a bond with Blazkowicz. William "B.J." Blazkowicz - or, to give him his proper name Terror-Billy, the scourge of the Nazi empire - is the Wolfenstein franchise's lead.</p>
<p>"While initially suspicious and traumatised by war, she blooms under the care of the resistance (possibly referring to the Kreisau Circle) as a strong-willed survivor," Sofiya's casting description reads.</p>
<p>Further details - such as whether Sofiya actually full on joins B.J's crew or if we can expect to see some kind of The Last of Us Joel and Ellie style surrogate father daughter relationship form - remain to be seen. What do you hope MachineGames is cooking up?</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Discord co-founder and chief technology officer Stanislav Vishnevskiy has announced the company is delaying the global rollout of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-mandatory-age-verification-sensitive-content-teen-by-default">controversial age verification requirements</a>, admitting it "missed the mark".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Discord revealed it would begin a "phased global rollout" of a new update in March that would give all new and existing users a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Essentially, this meant many of the platform's features - including access to age-gated channels, servers, app commands, and "sensitive content" - would be heavily restricted unless users had been age verified. This, the company said at the time, would enable it to give "teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility".
</p>
<p>
The outcry was swift, with some raising the spectre of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-customer-service-system-breached-by-authorised-party-gaining-access-to-a-small-number-of-government-id-images">last year's Discord security breach</a>, which saw hackers successfully acquiring an unspecified number of users' personal data, including government IDs. And Discord has now acknowledged users concerns, pausing its rollout until a later date.
</p>
<p>
"The way this [announcement] landed," Vishnevskiy wrote in a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">new blog post</a>, "many of you walked away thinking we're requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That's not what's happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why. That's on us. On top of that, many of you are worried that this is just another big tech company finding new ways to collect your personal data. That we're creating a problem to justify invasive solutions... But that's not what we're doing."
</p><p>
"We know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all. We hear you," Vishnevskiy continued. "We also know these changes carry different weight for different communities, and that for some, questions of privacy and identity aren't just preferences but safety concerns shaped by real experience. That's not lost on us, and it directly informs the choices we're making."
</p>
<p>
In an effort to offer clarity on Discord's previous announcement, Vishnevskiy says most users - even those wanting to access age-restricted content - will never need to submit video selfies for facial age estimation, or supply identification documents to Discord's vendor partners. Rather, the company's own internal systems will attempt to automatically determine a user's age, based on the time their account has existed, any payment method on file, the types of servers they're in, and general patterns of account activity.
</p>
<p>
Less than 10 percent of users, he claims, will need to undergo alternative age verification methods to access age-restricted content. This may be because Discord's systems can't confirm they're an adult or because local laws - such as those in the UK and Australia - explicitly require facial age estimation or ID checks. For those users needing to be verified by a third party, Vishnevskiy acknowledges there may be scepticism around "how we handle partnerships", particularly in light of last year's security breach. However, he insists Discord no longer works with the company involved in that incident and pledges to publish every verification vendor it works with - alongside their data handling practices - while also providing users with choices about the vendors they use.
</p>
<p>
This vendor transparency will be part of changes Discord is making to its global age verification rollout, which has now been delayed into the second half of this year. Vishnevskiy says the company won't work with vendors whose facial age estimation is not performed entirely on-device, and that alternative verification options, including credit card verification, will be added before rollout. Elsewhere, it's launching a new "spoiler" channel for servers that have previously utilised age-restricted channels as a way of separating users from non-adult topics they "may prefer to engage with on their own terms". It'll also publish a technical blog before rollout making it clear how its automatic age determination systems work, and will include information - on the number of users asked to age verify, the methods used, and how often Discord's automated systems handled verification - in its transparency reports. 
</p><p>
What it won't do, however, is halt the rollout entirely. As Vishnevskiy explains, "The number of teenagers on Discord has significantly increased since the pandemic, and they deserve an experience appropriate to their age. At the same time, we believe adults should be able to have a full content experience on Discord. Doing both responsibly means having safeguards that help ensure age-restricted content stays in adult spaces."
</p>
<p>
It's currently unclear how - or indeed if - the changes announced by Vishnevskiy will impact countries like the UK and Australia, which explicitly mandate facial age estimation or ID checks for adult content. Already, Discord has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">generated a second wave of controversy</a> in the UK after it launched an "experiment" that would see age verification data leaving users' phones, despite previously stating otherwise. There's been additional concern over Discord's decision to use Persona as the vending partner for its "experiment". Persona has funding ties with Peter Thiel, whose data and surveillance company Palantir is currently used by US federal agencies, <a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/">including ICE</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s privacy policy featured a disclaimer indicating users' voices were being used to train AI. This privacy policy, last published this January, has since been quietly updated to remove this clause.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ohpsksibwwtlsfe3n4dp6p2j?ref_src=embed">Spotted by user Cevian on Bluesky</a>, section 1 subsection xviii of the Policy, 'what data we collect and process' prior to the clauses' removal stated: "Where applicable, our services may offer voice-based chat functions that allow users to communicate with others in real time using voice. If you choose to use such features, we may process voice communication data for the purposes described in section 2 and section 13 of this Privacy Policy, including providing communication services, maintaining service security and stability, content moderation, and complying with applicable laws and regulations." This subsection has since been removed entirely</p>
<p>Section 2 of the Privacy Policy, titled 'why we collect and process your personal data' states, among many other uses: "Like many AI-powered experiences, we may use your user-generated input such as chat data to train and improve the model that we use to provide our Services. You can opt-out of model training anytime in your Service-related settings. Opting out will not affect your existing gameplay."</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this was just once clause of Section 2, and other clauses including providing customer support and preventing malicious content to "ensure a harmonious and healthy online environment" are included. This same policy states that users must opt out of model training through service-related settings.</p><p>MiHoYo has been open about its embrace of generative AI in the past. It  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai">released a teaser for an upcoming Unreal Engine 5 MMO project that used generative AI late last year</a>. This game, while largely still a mystery, will feature: "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System", All-Terrain Battle AI, and "Intellectual NPC".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted MiHoYo for comment on exactly what users' voice communication data is being used for, and why the subsection related to the gathering of such data was removed from the Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>As triple-A releases begin to swarm us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> continues to shine bright as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-sets-huge-steam-concurrent-player-record-taking-a-crown-previously-worn-by-hades-2">one of 2026's most popular indie releases so far</a>. After its massive success, we've already received confirmation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-mewgenics-rolls-out-its-latest-patch-the-creators-have-been-mapping-out-dlc-1-and-theyre-getting-a-little-bit-excited-about-it">a first DLC is in the works</a>, but what about user-made content?</p>
<p>Well, there's been no official announcement yet, but we can be optimistic, as co-developer Tyler Glaiel has been answering questions via X and confirmed modding is on the team's mind:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Eventually. I want to add an official launcher and workshop support. I was originally planning on using the same ones I had for TEIN, but I think that launcher would not be steamdeck verified so it's gonna have to wait a bit for me to have the time to do a new one.

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>"Eventually" is the key word here. We know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">even the first DLC could take more than a year to arrive</a>, so this isn't a "stay tuned for concrete news in the coming months" situation. We could completely forget about Glaiel and Edmund McMillen's immediate post-launch words, only to be surprised by the arrival of Steam Workshop support a few years from now. These developers took their time with Mewgenics, and there's no reason to believe new content is going to be rushed out.</p>

            <p>All eyes are on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-3-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-move-to-multiplatform-release">third Final Fantasy 7 Remake entry</a> now, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">fantastic Xbox and Switch 2 ports</a> of the first game plus a new Steam re-release of the 1997 original, fans haven't been neglected recently. That new OG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">FF7</a> version hasn't landed as well as the powers that be at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> had hoped for though.</p>
<p>After a surprise announcement a few weeks ago, the new Steam version of FF7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3837340/view/498346952550779352?l=english">arrived on 24th February</a> alongside a first-time launch <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gog.com/post/3mfmnsrfj762m">on GOG</a>. The problem? Midgar veterans are blasting it online, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3837340/FINAL_FANTASY_VII/">Steam reviews</a> are currently "mostly negative" despite new QoL improvements like a 3x speed mode, the ability to turn random battle encounters off, and autosaves.</p>
<p>"The FPS limit has been increased from 15 to 30, doubling the speed of fights and actions but without adapting the animations, so the actions desyncs with the audio," one negative review from a disgruntled player explains. "The filtering for the background looks god awful," another veteran with "over 1400 hours" in the original added. Tech woes are to be expected with each new re-release of a classic, especially when things are touched up, but after the removal of the previous 2013 release (only previous owners can access it now), this could be seen as very worrying and yet another sign of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-asks-for-support-regarding-game-preservation-efforts">how important game preservation is</a>.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/og-final-fantasy-7-re-release-sends-steam-user-review-rating-plummeting-to-mostly-negative">IGN</a>, a quick patch has already dropped to fix the speed in battles and other unspecified bugs. Combat encounters running at twice the intended speed is a huge oversight though, and makes us wonder about Square Enix's QA process when it comes to these small re-releases and updates.</p><p>Regardless, even after the patch, other odd choices and terrible changes remain, such as the removal of resolutions which aren't in the original 4:3 format. Even worse, some players can't get into the game: "Still can't get the game to launch. just crashes on clicking play." The same people are reporting that, meanwhile, the 2013 version they own works fine. At least, it has been added to their libraries at no extra cost.</p>
<p>While angry, some fans are still giving valuable feedback in hopes they can recommend this iteration of the game at a later date: "All backgrounds and FMVs are blurry from whatever upscaling they did... Any SFX that should play rapidly or cut itself off... These need to be fixed for it to be possible to recommend this version."</p>
<p>Looking at Square Enix's actions following the disastrous launch, chances are it'll be in good shape sooner rather than later, but all this mess made us wonder why the 2013 version had to be delisted in the first place and how much money publishers put into some of these awful re-release and remastering efforts. It's not a good look!</p>

            <section><p>Capcom marks Resident Evil's 30th anniversary with a stellar return that's both a masterful bit of suffocating horror and a nostalgic, fan-thrilling victory lap for the legendary series.</p></section>
<p>Here's a question: what <em>is</em> Resident Evil? For some, weaned on the series' earliest entries, it's campy survival horror - staccato gunplay punctuating smothering scares; for others, who joined the series with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> and beyond, it's perhaps closer to action. And there's still a third group, who, since Resident Evil 7 redefined the series yet again, might be expecting something like horror in its purest form. 30 years on, Resident Evil is a series with so many identities, so many histories, that trying to resolve them all is a problem Capcom has struggled with time and again. But with Resident Evil Requiem, it feels like it's finally found a way to address that tension: don't fight it, embrace it all.</p>

<p>You probably already know Resident Evil Requiem is, in essence, a game of two halves. On one side there's FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who continues the modern series' focus on heightened first-person horror. On the other is Resident Evil icon Leon S. Kennedy, who turns up intermittently to punctuate the tension with ludicrous, larger-than-life action. It sounds like a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a>-style recipe for discordant disaster on paper, but in practice it's anything but, even if the balance shifts dramatically as Requiem eventually goes places - both figuratively and literally - you might not be expecting.</p>
<p>No matter where it heads, though, Requiem is consistently spectacular. This is pure, mega-budget blockbuster gaming: gorgeous, meticulously realised, and polished to a sheen. Its prologue alone, hitting a tone that feels as much TV police procedural as Resident Evil, jumps from bustling, rain-drenched city streets - exquisitely rendered in first-person - to an abandoned hotel which, as Grace confronts her traumatic past, is host to playable flashbacks and campy funhouse chills. Then Leon makes his absurd, hatchet-twirling debut amid pile-ups and fleeing crowds, and on it goes - Capcom's enormously talented team of designers, engineers, artists, animators, sound specialists, performers constantly exceeding Requiem's incredible demands.</p>

<p>When Requiem eventually settles down, though, it's for a sustained bout of pure horror that's arguably the most terrifying the series has ever been - I might even go as far as to call Requiem one of the best horror games ever made. After Grace is deposited into the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center, where you'll spend a significant portion of your playtime - perhaps the closest thing the series has come to a classic gothic "mansion" in a long while - you're given a few minutes breathing room before your first major adversary arrives. And you'll want to make the most of that lull, because once it gets going Requiem is relentless. Capcom's control of atmosphere and tension, its command of pace, is impeccable, and the set-up for its first big reveal is a great example: an ominous rhyme in a children's nursery book sows seeds of uncertainty and mounting dread, eventually culminating - after a tightly choreographed succession of jump scares and fake-outs -  with a humongous claw sliding terrifyingly into view. And that's just the start.</p><p>The creature, one of Rhodes Hill's most persistent foes, is a wonderful bit of design, legitimately terrifying in scale but - with her forlorn gait, her tattered gown - oddly sympathetic too as she begins her relentless prowl. And it's surprising just how far Requiem goes to humanise its monsters. One abomination you'll encounter is so large it's forced to squeeze itself - pitifully, painfully - along the mansion's too-small corridors to continue its patrol. And virtually every zombie in Rhodes Hill is stuck in a loop of half-remembered living; undead cleaners attack filthy bathrooms with violent vigour, orderlies obsessively flick light switches on and off, cooks give chase with sharpened utensils, and you'll even find a zombie by a grand piano belting out a tune. It's at once a little sad and a little silly, and there's an appealingly goofy throughline to Requiem that serves as critical connective tissue between the horrors Grace faces and Leon's more outlandish trials. But crucially, once a zombie gives chase, the mood immediately chills.</p>



<p>For the bulk of Rhodes Hill, Requiem is skewed toward stealth. Often, Grace - as she sets off in search of yet another distantly scattered McGuffin - is corralled into cruelly claustrophobic spaces with minimal loops for avoidance, forcing a stressful rhythm of creeping progress and frenzied escape. Almost every zombie in Requiem is on perpetual patrol and, once alerted to your presence, they'll happily, aggressively pursue you as far as their bounds will allow. Few have the brute-force strength of Rhodes Hill's biggest adversary, admittedly, but even once Grace is armed, and even as her abilities grow, Capcom contrives - whether through limited ammo, zombies' attraction to noise, or other rather more nefarious means - to ensure their threat is significant enough that stealth always <em>feels</em> like the better option.</p><p>And from that baseline of sustained tension, Capcom continues twisting the knife. Upgrades often require you to collect blood from zombies that might, you suspect, spring back to life at any moment; your inventory is small, meaning you always need to think carefully about what you carry and what you leave behind in safe rooms - miscalculate and you might need to backtrack, prolonging the ordeal. And if you choose to play on Classic mode, your limited typewriter ribbons mean limited saves. It becomes a game of tough decisions under pressure, Capcom constantly toying with the rules and the rhythm in a way that's as exhilarating as it is exhausting. And there's just so much else to applaud - the magnificent sound design, tiny touches like the way Grace's hands shake when she holds her gun - all coming together to create this relentlessly oppressive mood. So it's within this smothering blanket of stress that Leon's segments - unfolding in classic third-person - are a welcome reprieve.</p>



<p>Leon's series-spanning journey from fresh-faced twink to world-weary muscle daddy sees him, here, recast as something like the ultimate action hero - pure, wisecracking testosterone in a skin-tight shirt. From the very first moment you hit the 'melee' prompt and watch him roundhouse kick a zombie across the street, to the point he's motorcycling up the side of a skyscraper or casually batting rocket grenades out of the air, it's clear Capcom isn't so much embracing Resident Evil's action heritage as revelling in it, with hatchet-wielding, viciously decapitating aplomb. And the balance feels right, Leon and Grace's two distinct styles complementing rather than undermining one another.</p><p>But then, at almost exactly the midway point of its 20-hour or so runtime, there comes such a radical shift in tone that Requiem might as well be a different game entirely. Once you leave Rhodes Hill and you're deposited in the beige dereliction of something like an urban war zone (I shall say no more on this), it's Leon who - for a while at least - gets the bulk of the screentime, Requiem settling into a new rhythm that overwhelmingly favours intense action. Even as Grace begins to play a more prominent role again later on, her usual stealth is - bar one brilliantly creepy late-game surprise - given a far more urgent pace. It's not that this mid-game shift is especially unusual for the series, but after such a masterful first half, the change - and the sudden dissipation of Capcom's meticulously cultivated atmosphere - is <em>incredibly</em> jarring. Disappointing even, and it takes a bit of mental recalibration before it can be properly enjoyed.</p>



<p>But it is, still, enjoyable. The gunplay remains great in its slickly ridiculous action-movie fervour, Leon's arsenal growing to absurd proportions as he hoovers up machine guns, pistols, grenades, sniper rifles, and anything else capable of obliterating the undead as noisily as possible. Even the inventory system shifts to something more conducive to this pacier rhythm - forcing you to Tetris your spoils into the equivalent of a Resident Evil 4-style attache case until space is gone and decisions must be made. And as you race across rooftops dodging mortar fire, or take on the heavily armoured undead in increasing numbers, its action - its constant ambushes and fights-in-tight spaces - remains tense and exhilarating, albeit in entirely different ways. If anything, with Rhodes Hill behind it, Requiem adopts a more transparently old-school vibe - and, if you hadn't already twigged, this isn't accidental.</p>

<p>The clues are there from the start of course - it's right there in the name! - but Requiem isn't <em>just</em> a horror game; it isn't <em>just</em> an action game; it's a joyful, honest-to-goodness celebration of Resident Evil, this legendary series, as it enters its 30th anniversary year. And the longer it goes on - the more it borrows and repurposes from the past - the more it plays like a gift to fans. It's there in that sprawling mansion that feels like a return to the start; in its shifting camera perspectives and shifting tones. It's there in its different inventory systems from two different eras, in the typewriter ribbons, and the wonderfully old-school puzzle contrivances. It's there in a bifurcated campaign that feels like a Resident Evil 6 callback, in an upgrade system for Leon that feels ripped right out of Mercenaries, and it's there in so many other ways. I'm not going to say too much more - partly because Capcom understandably wants to keep Requiem's biggest surprises secret, and partly because I wouldn't want to spoil their impact anyway - but the more it played into its legacy, the bigger my smile became.</p>
<p>There's a clear tension here in that the first half of Requiem is incredible; a straight-up horror classic as far as I'm concerned. In contrast, its latter half is less obviously remarkable; boundary pushing horror making way for a slightly retro, backward-looking celebration of the past. That makes it tricky, if not outright impossible to judge. Is Requiem uneven? Absolutely. Does it eventually, slightly, run out of steam? I think that's a fair criticism too. But carried away on a wave of increasing nostalgia, I didn't especially care. In a way, Capcom's deliberate - and impressively cohesive - grab bag approach to Requiem almost makes it impervious to criticism, and you might as well just sit back and enjoy the ride. And with 30 years of brilliant, ludicrous nonsense squashed down into a single game, this well-earned victory lap is one hell of a time.</p>

            <p>Lara Croft's newest actress Alix Wilton Regan has promised she will honour every Lara that has come before with her portrayal of the legendary tomb raider.</p>
<p>At The Game Awards last year, Wilton Regan was announced to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">taking over the role of Lara Croft for Tomb Raider: Catalyst and Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis from Camilla Luddington</a>, who appeared in the recent Survivor trilogy.</p>

<p>While Luddington's Lara started the series as an inexperienced and somewhat naive adventurer, she soon grew into a gritty and more than capable killer. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2026-lara-croft-seems-to-be-returning-to-what-made-90s-tomb-raider-great-and-as-a-lifelong-fan-i-couldnt-be-more-excited">Lara from the original Tomb Raider games was for sure a force to be reckoned with</a>, but she also had a sassy confident attitude which immediately endeared fans. So, where will Wilton Regan's Lara land? Will she be familiar to long-term Tomb Raider fans, or will her Lara be something totally different? Well, she will be a mixture of both.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying that to be convoluted," Wilton Regan told the Press X to Continue podcast about her take on Lara Croft, stating she had to go through several rounds of auditions before landing the role. "I think it is genuinely a bit of both."</p><p>The Tomb Raider: Catalyst actress said the phrase she is working with for her portrayal is "no Laras left behind", which I personally love. "I like the idea of 'no Lara is left behind'," Wilton Regan continued. "I've looked at all of the performances. Obviously, I've got all the scripts, so I know where it's going, and, you know, I think all of the Lara's that have previously come before will also be informing as we move into a new era of Tomb Raider, I would say.</p>
<p>"I genuinely, I <em>genuinely</em> think that fans are going to love it… I want to insert a swear word. It's brilliant. I know what we are making, it's brilliant. Wherever you fall, whether it's the original, the remasters, the classics, the Survivor trilogy, wherever on that spectrum… you are going to love it."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Tomb Raider: Catalyst is due to release next year</a>, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. It will take Lara to Northern India, following a "mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them".</p><p>Before that, though, we also have the remake of the first ever <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> arriving sometime this year. Legacy of Atlantis will place players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">back in the shoes of Lara Croft as she hops from country to country in search of the Scion of Atlantis</a>.</p>

            <p>I'd be lying if I said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> doesn't look (and sound) like one the coolest triple-A games coming out this year. With its post-delay <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/merry-christmas-james-bond-game-007-first-light-has-been-delayed">27th May release date</a> not far away now, marketing and developer chatter are ramping up, and now we've learned about the explicit influences that were added to all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman">Hitman</a> DNA we've able to discern in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s latest.</p>
<p>On 23th February, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-aims-to-channel-batman-arkham-freeflow-combat-with-uncharted-spectacle/1100-6538356/">GameSpot</a> shared juicy bits from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/007firstlight">Game Informer</a>'s recent interview with gameplay director Andreas Krogh, who admits the team looked at triple-A games "on the same scale" for inspiration. After all, even with a reboot, there's set of expectations around what a James Bond game should be, and IO's own style shouldn't get in the way of that if you ask me.</p>
<p>We already know many stealth and immersive sim elements from the recent Hitman trilogy, as well as spectacular and layered level design, have made their way into 007: First Light, but it's good to know IO looked at modern action-adventure classics for the more explosive sequences: "I think you see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham games</a>, you see those games in it. You also see some modern takes on destructibility in the environment that are not necessarily from the Arkham games, but newer takes like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. We have a deeper system than that because we want to do more of it, and from shooting, you see references that are also from modern games," Krogh explained.</p>
<p>In any case, while some gameplay scenes will railroad players into big set pieces that would make renowned Hollywood action directors smile, the studio hasn't sacrificed the freedom of "choice" it's known for in most scenarios: "We want to set the player up to choose for himself. What kind of player are you? What kind of playstyle do you prefer? Play that way."</p><p>It won't be long before we check for ourselves if everything has come together beautifully, but with a mix of old and new, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-unveils-lenny-kravitzs-villainous-side">Lenny Kravitz on board as the villain</a>, it seems like IO's take on the property won't be retreading much old ground.</p>

            <p>Xbox's new leadership double-act Asha Sharma (CEO Microsoft Gaming) and Matt Booty (chief content officer Xbox) have stressed the importance of new Xbox gaming hardware to their vision going forward.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">Windows Central</a>, Sharma said: "I am committed to 'returning to Xbox', and that starts with console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon - we'll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here.</p>
<p>"We also know that there are a lot of players who aren't on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too. I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and I want a little bit of time and space to do that."</p>
<p>Matt Booty added: "Our studio system is fully built around being first-party. We're not built to just be a publisher. It is core to our partnership with the Microsoft platform, being involved in early hardware decisions - all the work we've done to get games like Gears of War running great on new devices like the Xbox Ally, and so on. It is embedded within our structure, we're not backing away from that. We're committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team."</p><p>Their comments come after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/future-of-xbox-vague-contradictory-phil-spencer-sarah-bond-asha-sharma-matt-booty">a wave of change unsettled the Xbox business and brand at the weekend</a>, with long-time Xbox figurehead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, and Sarah Bond, the former president of Xbox - presumed to be Spencer's replacement-in-waiting - suddenly departing as well.</p>
<blockquote><em>"This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again" - Asha Sharma</em></blockquote>
<p>Into the leadership void stepped Asha Sharma, a relative unknown to the gaming community, brought over from Microsoft's CoreAI division, and someone who boasts no gaming experience or apparent gaming passion of her own. Matt Booty is a much more known quantity, having led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> since 2018, and Microsoft's first-party gaming output since 2023.</p>
<p>The suspicion surrounding Sharma's appointment is Microsoft is sunsetting Xbox and reorganising the company around AI - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-likening-new-xbox-heads-job-to-a-palliative-care-doctor-original-co-creator-doesnt-actually-think-xbox-is-dead">Seamus Blackley, the original co-creator of Xbox, was very vocal about</a>. But there are contrasting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">reports that claim Microsoft genuinely wants to reset the Xbox business</a> and turn it around. This "return of Xbox" is something Sharma talked about in her opening memo to staff, and it's something she elaborated on in the Windows Central interview.</p><p>Sharma said: "For me, the spirit of 'return to Xbox' is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on. It's that spirit of surprise, it's the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try - I've heard 'renegade', 'rebellion', and 'fun' used. That's what I was thinking about when I wrote that."</p>
<p>Reports have suggested that Sarah Bond was ousted because of the 'Xbox Anywhere' initiative, largely attributed to her, which hasn't really worked out. Regardless, it's an initiative Sharma will inherit, alongside things such as Game Pass and publishing on PlayStation that have become increasingly central to the Xbox division's core. What will Sharma do with them?</p>
<p>"Right now, I need to learn, candidly, about the 'why' of these decisions, what we were optimising for and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That's the honest answer," she said. "I'm looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan's the plan until it's not the plan."</p>
<p>Sharma also underlined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">her previously stated gen-AI stance</a> by restating that there are opportunities there but she won't allow this to devolve into okaying "slop". "I will not flood our ecosystem with slop," she said. "We won't have careless output, we won't have derivative work. I deeply believe in the words that I shared previously there."</p><p>Matt Booty had an additional remark to make on this, stating: "We've got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down. Our teams are free to use any technologies that might be beneficial, whether it's helping write code or check for bugs - things more in the production pipeline. At the end of the day as Asha said, we're committed to art made by people. Technology is only in support of that."</p>
<p>In closing, Sharma said she would try to "honour and uphold" the culture that Xbox Phil Spencer instilled - "a remarkable human and a remarkable leader" - when he took over Xbox in 2014. "We know that the business has gone through some challenges," she said. "I'm going to use my expertise and the leaders that have the deep gaming depth around the table to help us grow the business, and make sure that we have an incredible next 25 years.</p>
<p>"I will listen, I will learn, I will communicate what we're seeing, and what we're doing. I think from here, the work is proof over promise. Matt and I are in it, every hour of every day of every night; I am fully in this thing. This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again."</p>

            <p>Amazon Game Studios will no longer be publishing Maverick Games' upcoming narrative-led racing game, as part of its continued stumble out of the triple-A games business.</p>
<p>First reported <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving">by The Games Business</a>, this upcoming title from Maverick Games was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-publishing-narrative-led-racer-from-former-forza-horizon-devs-skins-co-creator">announced as a project-in-development under Amazon's umbrella back in 2024</a>. It has not been cancelled as of writing, as the UK-based studio looks to find a new publisher.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to The Games Business, an Amazon spokesperson said: "As part of our strategic evolution to focus on projects that leverage Amazon's unique strengths and scale, including the recent re-launch of Luna and our Tomb Raider franchise partnership with Crystal Dynamics, we have decided to release Maverick Games from their publishing agreement with Amazon Game Studios.</p>
<p>"We have tremendous respect for the Maverick Games team and the compelling narrative-led driving experience they're creating. This decision allows Maverick Games the flexibility to find a publishing partner whose strategic priorities are better aligned with bringing their game to market. We're proud of what we accomplished together during our partnership and wish them every success in the future."</p><p>Maverick Games, which was founded in 2022 by former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> developers from Playground Games, broke away to create a "premium open-world game for consoles and PC". The studio is led by Mike Brown, who was the creative director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and is joined by other veterans from the studio alongside fresh faces.</p>
<p>Amazon Game Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts"> recently decimated its in-house development teams</a> working on games such as MMORPG New World and an in-development Lord of the Rings MMO. It has also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/king-of-meat-canceled-amazon-game-studios-refunds/">killed its released multiplayer co-op game King of Meat this week</a>, which joins Crucible and Breakaway on the pile of attempts to break into the live service space.</p>
<p>Amazon Game Studios is still, as of writing, publishing two upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">Legacy of Atlantis</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Tomb Raider Catalyst</a>. It's also still in charge of the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-ark-is-blowing-up-and-i-can-totally-see-why"> western release of Lost Ark</a>, the popular MMORPG first created by Smilegate.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-a-lot-of-new-far-cry-and-assassins-creed-games-are-in-development">all in on Assassin's Creed and Far Cry</a> (among other lucky IPs) following all the recent layoffs, studio closures, and project cancellations, yet <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/with-ubisofts-dire-finances-widespread-cancellations-and-a-disastrous-launch-working-against-it-famously-aaaa-game-skull-and-bones-celebrates-year-2-with-a-big-ol-kraken/">Skull and Bones somehow continues to sail onward</a> against all odds. Its launch was a bit disastrous though, and one key creative behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> had something to say about that project and why it struggled so much.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/the-director-of-the-first-assassins-creed-with-naval-battles-found-it-bizarre-to-watch-skull-and-bones-agonisingly-long-development-because-it-was-essentially-the-same-stuff-re-shipping-14-years-after-we-made-it/">PC Gamer had a chance to talk to AC3 and Far Cry 4 creative director Alex Hutchinson</a>, who's worked on the two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review">Savage Planet</a> games since leaving Ubisoft. From the get-go, Hutchinson commented it was "bizarre" to see "essentially the same stuff re-shipping 14 years" after he and his team cracked the systems for the third Assassin's Creed. The full pirate experience wouldn't become a thing until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review">Black Flag</a>, as Ubisoft <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/assassins-creed/assassins-creed-3s-greatest-feature-was-pushed-to-the-side-until-black-flag-because-ubisoft-was-worried-that-the-tech-wouldnt-work/">reportedly wasn't confident in the feature's chances</a> during AC3's development.</p>
<p>The rest is history, but even as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> enters another year of post-launch support, many are still wondering how and why the base game's development was so difficult. In the director's mind, it was a mix of its core ideas feeling "stale" and the main development team not having the necessary experience to finish such a daunting project without major hiccups.</p>
<p>"Ideas have a window... They age out and become stale," he explained before adding a "junior" team trying to "make Black Flag crossed with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-tanks">World of Tanks</a> or World of Warships" was a recipe for disaster. "And then they didn't really have experience in making even an Assassin's Creed game down there, because they really did co-development. And then I think it just got away from them," he added.</p><p>As pointed out in the original piece by PC Gamer's Fraser Brown and Jeremy Peel, Ubisoft Singapore was founded in 2008 and mostly acted as a support studio before its headcount "ballooned to more than 300 employees." Even Hutchinson admitted many Ubisoft devs just moved to Singapore for the fun vibes: "For a lot of the French or Canadian developers, they would go down to Singapore for a year's holiday... I don't think they were serious."</p>

            <p>Seamus Blackley, one of the co-creators of the original Xbox, has assured the community he doesn't actually think Xbox is "dead", despite just yesterday likening the recent appointment of Asha Sharma to "a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night".</p>
<p>Following his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seamus-blackley-microsoft-reshuffle-all-about-ai">comments earlier this week about the recent leadership shakeup at Microsoft</a>, Blackley revealed he has been asked 59 times whether or not he truly believes Xbox is dead. "No," he has now stated.</p>

<p>"I love Xbox as my own flesh and blood," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seamus.bsky.social">Blackley wrote on his social media feed</a>. "It's the most wonderful thing to me," he said, before adding: "The distress it's in kills me, haunts me." However, the Xbox co-creator said "progress requires introspection and realism" remarking that "learning is pain".</p>
<p>In an exchange with another Bluesky user, Blackley stated Xbox is "literally something I nearly died to bring into existence," so of course "seeing it struggle and being unable to act is hard". He added he loves Xbox "more than literally anyone" else.</p>
<p>"This is killing me," he wrote, "but I know a lot about organisations and business now, and I was being honest, not a PR asshole." Blackley also called Xbox "family", complete with a little green heart.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/article-45824">Blackley left Microsoft back in 2002</a>, to pursue other opportunities.</p>

<p>As for the here and now at Microsoft, Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>

            <p>It's said you will not necessarily remember a person's exact size or shape - does it really matter that they had a bit of a tum, no tum at all, multiple freckles, skin like a blank sheet of paper? So what if they were taller than you or shorter than you? These metrics become less and less important as a relationship and your memories together grow. You also probably won't remember everything someone has ever said to you. Snippets, but not every word.</p>

<p>What you will remember, though, is how a person made you feel. You will remember the ease you felt in their company, you will remember the joyous laughter you shared together, you will remember any feelings of hurt. Often when you tell stories about your time with someone, these are what come back to you.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about this since playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a>: Reunion, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has already said will serve as the final part of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price's story. When we first met Max and Chloe in the original Life is Strange, they were two young girls with their own complexities and stories waiting to be unwrapped. So was I. And, much like looking back on the time I spent with my own friends from school and university, when I think about the first time I played Life is Strange, I really remember how these characters - and the game - made me feel. I remember my love for these girls growing with each passing chapter. I remember the protection I wanted to give them and the anger I felt when they were dealt a bad hand. And, of course I remember the gut wrenching moment I knew I had to choose between saving Arcadia Bay from a ravaging tempest, or saving Chloe, knowing that no matter what I chose, I would always wonder if I had made the right decision.</p>

<p>In the end, and I know this will be controversial, I saved Arcadia Bay, after listening to Chloe's impassioned speech about the people there who deserve to live. In her final moments, Chloe thought about her mother and the diner she works in, before thanking Max for showing her so much love during their time together. "You made me smile and laugh, like I haven't done in years," Chloe tells Max. "Wherever I end up after this… in whatever reality… all those moments between us were real, and they'll always be ours." Chloe remembered the feelings.</p><p>So even though I loved Chloe deeply, I believed that Max and her relationship would be tainted by guilt once the storm had passed, and they were left with the devastation of its wake. I have lived with this decision for many years now, and while I still feel sad remembering that moment near the lighthouse, with the wind and rain whipping violently around, I had made my peace with it. At least, I thought I had, until I was once again confronted with my decision on booting up Life is Strange: Reunion. Did Chloe live, or did she die? Well for me, she died.</p>
<p>This has been a bit of a sticking point for me ever since Life is Strange: Reunion was announced. I've been trying to decide how I actually feel about seeing Chloe back again, having already learned to accept her death. Even in a world with characters who can rewind time, shapeshift or experience the emotions of others in a burst of colour, having someone come back from the dead like this wasn't sitting right with me. I went to Chloe's funeral. I said goodbye. And it hurt. But that was the path <em>I</em> chose. So, while I have felt moments of joy seeing a face I cared for so deeply return, I have also wondered if Reunion will ultimately dilute the impact that the original Life is Strange left on me.</p>

<p>Now, I haven't played enough of Reunion yet to definitively say if this will be the case or not, but I have played the best part of an hour, and I am at least pleased to report that Deck Nine has treated Chloe's return to the series sensitively. I joined the game roughly an hour or so in, and was first reunited with Max, who is back at Caledon University after the events of Double Exposure, a game which now appears to have been developed as a stepping stone to orchestrate Chloe's return.</p><p>Max is of course able to rewind time in Reunion, which came in handy when a rowdy heckler at the local bar continuously interrupted one of her friend's stand up comedy acts. No one ruins my friend's evening and gets away with it, so with a bit of time manipulation and a canny choice of words, I was able to ensure this ne'er do well was out of the way before the set began, and the evening could continue on smoothly. So far, so Life is Strange.</p>
<p>As the evening went on, I talked to more and more locals, and started to piece together bits of information which would tell me more about a fire Max knows to be arriving in the coming days. Again, I was able to use Max's ability to rewind time to ensure conversations ultimately ended the way I needed them to, and soon Max set off for a building due to be demolished in search of further answers.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Deck Nine</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I then played as Chloe, who while unable to rewind time or anything supernatural like that, has the gift of the gab, and could use her backtalk ability to 'confront' others via conversations (a returning feature from Life is Strange: Before the Storm).</p><p>As Chloe, I managed to sneak my way into the same bar Max had been in earlier, as she looked for answers to the nightmarish memories she has started having of a life (or death) she may (or may not) have lived out. In Chloe's mind, the only person who can help her make sense of these strange visions is Max, who, no matter which Life is Strange ending you may have chosen, she has not seen for years.</p>
<p>Again, these various backs and forths ultimately led Chloe to the same building Max had also left the bar for. And, after a slightly tense chain of events involving some explosives, police and the sinister rumblings of a cultish fraternity, the two girls were reunited, with sirens and flashing lights making for a dramatic backdrop (which seems fitting). It was these next moments which made up the crux of my Life is Strange: Reunion preview: how the girls reacted to being back together after all this time, and after - let's be honest - some shared trauma.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Deck Nine</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I don't want to go <em>too </em>heavy into the details here, I fully appreciate that many people looking forward to Reunion will be looking forward to, well, the reunion. But I will say that I am pleasantly surprised with how Deck Nine has handled things. There were the little details in namely Max's actions that really made me feel how she was feeling to see her once dead friend back. Max, bless her, stayed up all night as Chloe slept in her bed, so worried that if she allowed herself to close her eyes for even one moment her friend may once again disappear. Who hasn't wanted to hold on to someone or something so deeply, that its very existence seems too unbelievable to be true? Eyes heavy with sleep but a heart so full with a mix of love and the desire for a night to never end that staying awake seems like the right thing to do, just to treasure (or process) this time for as long as possible.</p><p>Then, on Chloe's side, there was of course confusion, fear and frustration due to the fraught 'memories' that she does not understand. Thankfully, I was able to tread the boards of these topics in a way that felt right for me, with multiple dialogue options for both girls. This meant I could be to the point or I could be sensitive, depending on what I believed these characters needed in those moments.</p>
<p>I know from sneaking a look at my neighbour's screen during the preview, they chose a different conversation branch which suited their personal narrative journey for Chloe and Max. And that is something that - even as that one, ultimate decision gets somewhat upended - continues to be so beautiful about the Life is Strange series.</p>
<figure>

<p>I would be lying if I said I no longer had any concerns about Life is Strange: Reunion after my short spell with it. From a purely technical point of view, there were times when the graphics were not as crisp as they should have been, with fuzzy patching particularly around the ends of a characters' hair often drawing my eye. But, there is still time for this to be fixed. The characters' expressions, though, were the best for the series yet.</p><p>Gameplay wise, meanwhile, there is nothing revolutionary about Reunion so far. The mechanics and the worlds are what you will have come to expect from a Life is Strange game. The leaf strewn community, the quirky bar, the bands, the varsity jackets, the struggling artists. They are all once again there. Is it now a worn out formula? I honestly can't say just yet.</p>
<p>But from a narrative point of view, while I am going to save my final judgement for the full release, I will say the reunion between Chloe and Max was sweet and well scripted. I felt genuinely emotional seeing the two girls who I thought had said their final goodbye to each other back together again. As Isabel Allende wrote in Portrait in Sepia: "True friendship resists time, distance and silence." That certainly seems to be the case here. I just hope the rest of Life is Strange: Reunion's story holds the same gravitas and momentum, so that this reunion can really stick its final landing.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Slowly but steadily, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is building up an impressive library of third-party ports, and Bethesda has been aggressively (and unsurprisingly) pushing to get as many of its heavy hitters on the platform since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>'s arrival last December. Now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> has arrived to great fanfare and is surprisingly strong on the hybrid console.</p>
<p>Of course, we always wanted the FO4 Switch 2 port to turn out good, but our expectations were lowered after Skyrim's frankly disastrous launch on the system (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrim-switch-2-port-gets-proper-performance-and-quality-modes">which has since been fixed and greatly improved</a>). Would it mirror that mess or the Skyrim port's latest iteration? The answer is surprising: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> currently offers an even better experience than Skyrim across both docked and portable play.</p>
<p>The shocker comes in the form of three different graphical modes available from the get-go versus Skyrim's two: Quality, Balanced, and Performance. In-game, however, they're named as 30, 40, and 60 FPS targets respectively, but that's what they are. The presence of the 40 FPS mode instantly confirms Fallout 4 is making good use of the Switch 2's 120 Hz screen and VRR capabilities, but it seems the 30 and 60 FPS modes also run on portable mode without lowering the refresh rate, with helps with responsiveness across the board. Even better, I've yet to notice any instances of screen tearing. Another pleasant surprise is TVs with 120 Hz capabilities can access the 40 FPS mode too.</p>
<p>In-depth testing by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdPfzW17WPM">ElAnalistaDeBits</a> has also revealed that, in docked mode, the game targets 1440p at 30 FPS, 1080p at 40 FPS with a nearly identical graphical setup, and dynamic 1080p (often below the target) with lowered graphical settings at 60 FPS. On portable mode, 1080p is the target in all modes, but the image can get quite blurry in Performance (60 FPS) mode. Check out my own screenshots near Sanctuary below:</p>



<p>The 30 FPS mode is the clear winner here when it comes to image clarity and settings, with texture resolution and filtering also seeing a significant boost vs. the other modes. Of course, you'll have to put up with less responsive controls and sluggish camera movement that just doesn't feel good enough anymore if you ask me.</p><p>The 40 FPS mode looks noticeably softer, but still provides a clean image result even when playing in portable mode in my experience. The extra 10 frames per second greatly help with the game feel, and with the console's 120 Hz screen, it lands very close to the experience of running it at 60 FPS.</p>
<p>Finally, at 60 FPS, you're getting frankly good results in interiors and areas that aren't overly busy, but the console has a harder time hitting the target in most exterior areas and crowded enemy encounters. This isn't such a big deal when running the game in portable mode due to VRR's help, but the image simply becomes too soft and blurry, especially when looking at distant details. Even my girlfriend, who typically doesn't pay much attention to graphics and was playing FO4 for the first time last night, complained about it looking "bad." Perhaps the shocker here is the actual graphical settings didn't seem as paired back as in Skyrim when going for 60 FPS.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for stability, I'm happy to report it hasn't crashed on me a single time yet, something I couldn't say about the recent re-releases of the game on other platforms. Load times are virtually identical to recent iterations of the game on consoles, too. The missed opportunity here might be the lack of gyro or mouse controls, which makes Skyrim a more complete port at the time of writing. Hopefully, patches will add in those platform-specific control options as the fifth Elder Scrolls gets a 40 FPS Balance mode in exchange for them.</p><p>Overall, I'm quite impressed with this Fallout 4 port at launch, especially considering the current-gen refreshes and last year's Anniversary Edition launch were a bit of a technical nightmare. Moreover, lessons were learned following Skyrim's disappointing launch and recent improvements. Though the teams and tech involved are different, I'm now quite excited for how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-february-2026-everything-announced">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Oblivion Remastered</a> could be translated to Switch 2 later this year.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>French video game publisher Nacon has filed for insolvency, after the company's majority shareholder Bigben Interactive failed to make the partial repayment of its bond loan to its bondholders. This, Nacon said, was due to "an unexpected and late refusal by its banking pool".</p>
<p>A company is insolvent when it can't pay its debts, meaning it is at risk of being closed down. Last week, the Styx: Blades of Greed publisher stated its situation "required the rapid implementation of a financial restructuring with its creditors in order to ensure the continuity of its operations". </p>
<p>This morning, Nacon subsequently announced its available assets "do not allow it to meet its due liabilities". As such, the company will now file for insolvency with the Court and "request the opening of judicial reorganisation proceedings".</p>

<p>The publisher stated its aim is to "assess all possible solutions to ensure the sustainability of the company's activity under the best possible conditions, protect employees, and preserve jobs, while renegotiating with its creditors in a calm and constructive framework".</p><p>Nacon said this procedure will allow the publisher to "continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan". It added the suspension of the company's share price which was first announced on 20th February will remain in effect for now.</p>
<p>In addition to the recently-released Styx: Blades of Greed, Nacon also handled publishing duties for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hell-is-us">Hell is Us</a> and RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, to name a few. The publisher will be hosting its next Nacon Connect showcase next month, on 4th March. You can check out a little teaser for it below.</p>

            <p>Bungie has released another Marathon short cinematic trailer for one of its playable characters / shells, this time for Rook. All this only a few days prior to the game's scheduled Server Slam test.</p>
<p>Unlike prior trailers, which show off the combat prowess of the various types of shells players can use, Rook is a scavenger keen on looting scraps rather than taking on fights themselves. We see them temporarily turn NPC enemies friendly, only to be scared by one of the other shells they're looting and unloading their gun haphazardly.</p>
<p>This then turns the pacifism off from those NPCs, causing rook to run away with their ill-gotten goods. It's the classic loot goblin archetype from extraction shooters, for players keen on avoiding fights and being a bit of a vulture in-game. We even see alien vulture-like creatures throughout the trailer, hitting the point home.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this marks yet another character trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">ahead of the Marathon Server Slam</a>. Between the 26th February until the 2nd March. During this time, anyone interested in trying out Marathon will be able to do so for free, ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">the game's full release on the 5th March</a>.</p><p>In other Marathon news, the developers recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-outlines-marathon-networking-and-security-features">released information about the game's security features and anti-cheat initiatives</a>, stating there will be no second chances for those found cheating in Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter. The game continues to show signs of early popularity even before its released, sticking to the upper echelons of Steam's Top Sellers page prior to its debut.</p>

            <p>The live-action God of War series from Amazon and Sony has found its Baldur.</p>
<p>Ed Skrein has been cast as Baldur in the upcoming show. Skrein's previous roles include in Jurassic World Rebirth, where he played Bobby Atwater, and as supervillain Francis Freeman / Ajax in Deadpool. He also popped up in Game of Thrones' third season as Daario Naharis.</p>

<p>Fans of the games will of course know who Baldur is (yes, my butt got kicked and then some), but for those unfamiliar with the God of War antagonist, here's the show's official character description, as shared by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/ed-skrein-cast-baldur-prime-video-god-of-war-1236734596/">Deadline</a>:</p>
<p>"Baldur may be the youngest son of Odin, but he's his father's most dangerous weapon. Charismatic, unpredictable and armed with a razor-sharp tongue, Baldur lives by his own rules. As a boy, Baldur was cursed; this curse denied him the ability to feel pleasure and physical sensation. This fuels an insatiable anger and bloodlust in Baldur, who favors a brawling fighting style that blends his immense power with the raw impact of his fists.</p>
<p>"Above all else, he longs for an opponent that can truly match his prowess in battle. An opponent that can finally make him feel something." (Enter Kratos stage right.)</p>

            <p>Marvel's Wolverine finally has a release date, and good news: it's coming out later this year.</p>
<p>Announced just a few minutes ago, the upcoming Marvel action game by Insomniac and PlayStation Studios will release on the 15th September, 2026. You can wishlist it now, if you're especially keen on it. This news also comes with an incredibly short <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2026341241936335224">release date trailer published on social media</a> - though if you were hoping for more gameplay you're out of luck.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-but-dont-expect-to-see-wolverine-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play">The game bizarrely skipped the Sony State of Play earlier this month</a>, though this date reveal comes after a vague and mysterious <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?s=20">social media post by Insomniac</a> which stated we'd hear more about the game in spring 2026. There was also an open fall 2026 release window established relatively recently, which has as of today been narrowed all the way down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">The game was first revealed in 2021</a>, with a cinematic teaser during a State of Play livestream. Since then, it's been largely radio silent for the AAA super hero slasher, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-later-playstation-and-insomniac-gives-marvels-wolverine-a-2026-release-window-debuts-trailer-full-of-blood-brutality-and-blades">save for a gameplay trailer released last September</a> which was packed full of action and gory violence.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s producer Alexia Christofi has spoken about the game's meta-progression overhaul, which needed a rework following player-feedback shortly after the game's launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/battlefield-6-s-meta-progression-needed-a-little-bit-of-a-rework-says-producer?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Speaking to Game Developer at DICE</a> earlier this year, Christofi told the outlet about the team's approach to making substantial changes to how players unlock weapons and other in-game items through challenges in Battlefield 6. Their initial approach faced criticism after many found the requirements too daunting or unrewarding.</p>
<p>Players didn't like feeling they were forced into specific modes," Christofi stated. "We took a step back, re-evaluated, and as we're launching future seasons, we've changed our ethos a little bit to challenges and player progression in general."</p>
<p>Following this shift in approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">meta-progression requirements were drastically reduced</a>. Within a short period of time, what was once difficult became far easier, allowing players to unlock specific tools in a relatively short amount of time, without feeling the frustration of a long grind or arduous task. This, according to Christofi, has influenced other aspects of the game experienced today.</p><p>"There have been times when I've woken up in my morning, we've seen something, we've got some bugs we need to fix for the next patch, and we haven't got around to fixing it by the evening... and then we've been able to hand it over to someone in LA to take that on and carry on working on that," Christofi explained.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-first-reactions">Battlefield 6 players are entrenched in the game's second season</a>, which added a new map as well as various other activities to engage in. There's also the game's battle royale mode — RedSec — <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-redsec-battle-royale-makes-me-miss-peak-pubg">which was initial received with mixed reception from players and critics alike</a>. This too, has undergone a suite of changes and tweaks in response to feedback.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to play Battlefield 6 yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>. In it, Rick Lane wrote: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-hunters-gathering-is-a-three-player-tactical-co-op-game-that-looks-a-bit-like-dauntless-with-a-closed-playtest-coming-soon">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a> wasn't exactly what we were expecting when we first heard about Guerilla Games tackling an online multiplayer Horizon game for Sony, but the PS5 and PC "tactical co-op" title certainly looks interesting to enough to warrant a closer look. Now, it appears the first closed beta test is about to happen, and its timing is a bit funny.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/wait-some-fans-will-be-playing-horizons-divisive-ps5-pc-multiplayer-game-this-weekend">Push Square</a> and social media posts, we've learned the first Horizon Hunters Gathering test will be happening during certain time slots this weekend. More specifically, from 7:00pm to 10:00pm CET in Europe, and 4:00pm to 7:00pm PST in North America; it'll "get underway from 27th February and run until 1st March." At the time of writing, it seems other regions are not part of this test.</p>
<p>To access, you'll need to both be part of the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/?">PlayStation Beta Program</a> and get lucky. The good news is the closed test seems substantial, as it'll include access to three different characters: Axle, Rem, and Sun. Two modes, Machine Incursion and Cauldron Descent, come with this test, which will happen exclusively "on the previously announced Colorado Springs map." Moreover, the Gathering social space and a customisable camp site will also be available, which suggests development on the game is further along than many thought.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sony and Bungie will be hosting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Marathon's "server slam" weekend</a> to test the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-outlines-marathon-networking-and-security-features">online infrastructure</a> ahead of its launch on 5th March. Unlike the closed Horizon Hunters Gathering test, Marathon's pre-release weekend is free for everyone and open, so we're gonna assume Horizon's little event is <em>really </em>limited when it comes to player numbers, as overlapping them (and the ensuing conversations) seems a bit silly.</p>

            <p>The two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prototype">Prototype</a> games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/incredible-hulk-ultimate-destruction">The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/simpsons-hit-run">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a> were all great open-world games  before open-world games became a thing, and they all have one thing in common: Radical Entertainment was their developer. Now, after being shut down by Activision over a decade ago, the studio seems to have returned. </p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-simpsons-hit-run-and-prototype-developer-radical-entertainment-appears-to-have-returned-and-fans-are-hyped-for-fresh-remakes">IGN</a>, we've learned of the existence of New Radical Games, which already has a <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/">shiny website</a> highlighting the "new" studio's origins and pedigree. Radical co-founder Ian Wilkinson is serving as CEO, with ex-Capcom Vancouver exec Tim Bennison joining the venture as New Radical's COO (he worked at Radical back in the day). New Radical Games is also the result of joining forces with <a href="https://www.hotheadgames.com/games">Hothead Games</a>, which was founded by ex-Radical devs.</p>
<p>Considering all the cumulative experience the resulting studio is packing, it comes as no surprise its leaders are positioning it as "available immediately to take on full game, metaverse, or realtime VFX projects" that involve full development, co-development, remastering efforts, ports, or any other kind of endeavour. It's currently unknown if the developers are already at work on a main video game.</p>
<p>Other underrated games developed by the original Radical Entertainment included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scarface-world-is-yours">Scarface: The World Is Yours</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-tag-team-racing">Crash Tag Team Racing</a>, and entries in the Crash series post-<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>. Of course, all those credentials also raise the question of whether The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run and the Prototype games could get substantial remasters; it's not the first time <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prototype-remaster-may-be-on-the-way-after-new-credits-were-quietly-added-to-the-steam-version">players have received hope on that front</a>.</p><p>In fact, buzz about a potential Prototype remaster has been a thing for quite some time now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/">pointing to Iron Galaxy (Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4) being involved</a> too. Could New Radical Games be leading such an effort?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-washes-up-on-pc-in-march-less-than-a-year-since-it-arrived-on-ps5">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will arrive on PC next month</a>, on 19th March. For those keeping track, that is less than a year since Death Stranding 2 made its bombastic debut in June of last year on PS5.</p><p>So, will you be picking it up on PC? If you are still on the fence about whether or not Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is for you, be sure to check out our PS5 thoughts. "A busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Eurogamer's four star review</a> by Lewis Gordon.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the world of porters, last year Kojima Productions announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-strandings-anime-is-unfortunately-going-to-be-locked-behind-a-disney-plus-subscription">Death Stranding anime series will be heading exclusively to Disney Plus</a>. An original story, the anime is set for a release in 2027, with Hideo Kojima serving as executive producer while Takayuki Sano will direct.</p>

            <p>So <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Phil Spencer is gone. So too is Sarah Bond</a> who, per some reports, had as much if not more influence over strategy than Spencer in recent years. Up comes Matt Booty, who was already part of the main leadership trio and is now chief content officer, broadly overseeing Xbox's internal studios and the games they make. And in comes Asha Sharma.</p>
<p>Sharma, now the executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft Gaming - essentially the new Spencer and Bond combined - seems a peculiar character. Not a household name to gamers, or really anyone outside the business world, much has already been made of the fact her background lies outside of video games altogether, having previously worked at Instacart and Meta, before moving into AI at Microsoft. And much too about that background in AI.</p>
<p>For many that's two alarm bells already ringing. (This writer's take, for what it's worth, is that you needn't be a gamer to be a gaming CEO, but you do have to <em>get it</em>, whatever getting it ultimately means. Friend of Eurogamer Chris Dring has pointed to 2K's Strauss Zelnick as one non-gamer example there, which seems wise. I'd personally look at Sharma's initial interactions on X, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3mffcfrkhnk2u">including with one person</a> currently locked in a legal battle over alleged repeat harassment of a journalist, as a reason to at least raise one very large eyebrow. And look at original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seamus-blackley-microsoft-reshuffle-all-about-ai">Xbox creator Seamus Blackley's quotes</a>, in a rare interview, about how many others have promised him they'll "figure it out" in video games only to fail. And also generally the less said about gen-AI the better).</p>
<p>And then there's the comments Sharma <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9UWaltU-7Q&amp;t=2582s">made on a podcast last year</a> which instantly began to circulate after her arrival at Xbox, where she talks about how AI can help with, of all things, birth rates, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/asha-sharma-new-xbox-ceo-is-a-natalist-who-believes-that-ai-can-improve-fertility-rates-will-my-son-have-classmates-in-the-future.1442539/">and which have seen her labelled a natalist and worse</a>. (The very short summary of this already very odd sidebar is that, on the one hand, natalist views and excessive fixations on birth rates have become a central pillar of the modern far right, especially those in the world of tech, and also that talking about birth rates out loud is always at the very least <em>a bit weird</em>; on the other, Sharma, still an AI executive at the time, was in the middle of citing all the wonderful ways ChatGPT and AI as a whole can help with <em>everything</em>, in healthcare and beyond - many asterisks required - and is at least as likely to be generally pumping up the AI hype balloon here as she is to be revealing personal beliefs of anything more sinister).</p><p>Either way, her appointment has not exactly sparked joyous celebrations in the streets of Xbox land - and it comes alongside yet more corporate intrigue as well. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">report from the Verge</a>, citing anonymous senior sources within the company, throws Sarah Bond well and truly under the bus, placing the infamous "This is an Xbox" marketing campaign at her feet, intimating that she was the driving force behind much of Xbox's recent strategy while Spencer was occupied with the Activision Blizzard merger, and describing her as "tough to work with".</p>
<p>But one important twist here is that this narrative bears a lot of the hallmarks of a classic "glass cliff", where women, especially women of colour, break through the glass ceiling of the corporate world only to be stitched up with a role of impossible responsibility - and all the blame for failure. Football fans here in the UK might also recognise a bit of classic upper brass arse-covering after a big leadership change - in the vein of briefing an 'inside story' after a top club's manager is sacked that details, say, all the many reasons the players didn't like their training methods, or the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/nov/23/antonio-conte-steven-gerrard-pour-fuel-on-ketchup-wars-in-tasty-cultural-divide-within-football">cruel banning of canteen ketchup</a>.</p>
<p>This is not to say this reporting can't be entirely true - it may well be; the Verge is mostly reliable on Microsoft - only that some reading between the lines is often required. It's notable, for instance, that the only evidence given for Bond being "tough to work with" is in that she "built a team structure that meant if you didn't follow the vision or questioned it, you were out" - which while cutthroat, also sounds an awful lot like how most big vision corporate leaders tend to operate. (Another curious observation: Microsoft's blog announcing the change, made in haste as IGN looked to break the story, featured the internal messages of Spencer, Sharma, Booty, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella - but no inclusion of Bond, who instead shared her own internal memo on LinkedIn.)</p>
<p>What this does signify, with some certainty, is that the task of managing Xbox is not a smooth one. Even putting the corporate politics aside there's the fact the platform now finds itself in a number of Catch-22 dilemmas. Sharma's own blog post-née-internal-memo is a perfect example. In it she makes three key commitments which, in the absence of any other public manifesto, will serve as the main yardstick of her success for now, and the main means by which the gaming public sizes her up.</p><p>The first is "great games" - strong start - where she rightly says Xbox "must have great games beloved by players before we do anything", correctly identifying this as perhaps the most terminal of Xbox's ongoing issues, at least until the brute force solution of acquiring Zenimax and Activision Blizzard King. She then goes on to cite this as her reasoning for promoting Matt Booty, who has overseen years of projects stuck in development hell, infinite reboot cycles, waves of cancellations, and the shuttering of numerous once-prestigious studios. (And who was also the unfortunate face of corporate creativity-harpooning in the DoubleFine documentary, where he's filmed informing eager developers that all their fun side project ideas will be the intellectual property of Microsoft going forward, at which point we see the light seem to drain from those developers' eyes in real time).</p>

</figure>
<p>The second, somewhat muddier, is the promise of "the return of Xbox". On the one hand this seems to be a promise to return to an Xbox fan's idea of the brand: "a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console" and a promise to "recommit to our core Xbox fans and players". But this is also followed by the acknowledgement of the 'new Xbox' way - that "gaming now lives across devices". It leaves a confused view of what might come next - a return to exclusives? Some kind of unified Xbox priority? Or maybe just a marketing rework to re-emphasise the console's importance above all. But as our friends at <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/xbox-under-new-management-but-what-can-actually-change">Digital Foundry have already pointed out</a>, these ideas each come with a sacrifice of some other, equally prioritised commitment - and on the next-gen console front, the technology reportedly more or less locked in now, there's very little that can be changed beyond the surface.</p>
<p>Sharma's third commitment is to "the future of play", where again there are promising lines, again met with immediate contradictions. She promises not to "chase short-term efficiency" with monetisation or "flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop", but as many have already noted, this makes for an interesting contrast to the views of her boss. Satya Nadella has made much-publicised comments recently that people "need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication". There's a note that "the next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through" - spot on! This is just what Xbox has failed to do! - made shortly after a heavy hint at creating a UGC platform of Xbox brands, that user-generated content being the buzzword of GDC at least two years ago, and another case of looking to a different company - namely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> - for answers rather than seeking new ones of your own.</p><p>Maybe it's worth putting this in the context of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a>'s own legacy. By all accounts a nice bloke in person - he's reported as well-liked internally, is someone who does seem to evidently 'get' video games, has always been personally friendly and has been known to privately contact members of the gaming world with messages of support in times of difficulty - Spencer strikes me as a decent person who chose to work a job not made for decent people, whose responsibility includes removing thousands and thousands of people from their jobs, for a company that seems increasingly hellbent on placing humanity last. (All the AI talk aside, Microsoft - specifically Xbox and its products - continues to be subject of a boycott request from the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement, specifically selected because of its involvement in supporting the Israeli military enact what the United Nations and scores of academic experts have ruled a genocide.)</p>
<p>Spencer will be remembered for rescuing Xbox from the brink after the Xbox One generation's debacle, saying an awful lot of the right things in seeming earnest - and in fairness doing plenty of them, in consumer-friendly moves such as crossplay, cross buy, and arguably Game Pass itself - and then overseeing its return right back to that same brink all over again. Much of his role has been to close barn doors after bolted horses, building powerful consoles in the Xbox One X and Series X after being outmuscled by the PS4, but then being without any tentpole games for their launch. Then buying up all the games in response, only for that to come at a huge, pandemic-infused premium, and result in wave upon wave of layoffs and closures as the market returned to normal size. Then putting those games everywhere in search of growth, since the console battle itself was already lost, only for gaming's growth to be abruptly halted by the rise of the rivalling attention economy (and the fact that, ultimately, nowhere near enough people want to play a big fancy triple-A game on a tiny little phone).</p>
<p>But above all, Spencer's time running Xbox for Microsoft has been defined by Microsoft. While Spencer, Booty and Bond are not innocent of the axe-swinging, the demand for those cuts will always come from the very top. The same will happen to Sharma, eventually and inevitably, sooner or later as the line swerves up and down over time. Amongst all the many mistakes and mistimings at Xbox over the years, there's none bigger than the amount of raw talent shunted out the door. You only need to look as far as Sharma's promise to renew the "renegade spirit that built Xbox" and her deference to the "generations of artists, engineers, designers, musicians, operators and more" that made it what it was, and then look just over her shoulder at, say, 343 Industries, or Turn 10, or Undead Labs, or Rare, or Lionhead - not to mention the Arkane Austins and Tango Gameworks and beyond - and wonder just how many of those fabled Xbox OGs there actually are left.</p>
<p>Mismanagement plays a real part, but ultimately it begins above the managers, above the executives, above even Nadella at the top - it might seem trite or obvious, but much of Xbox's extraordinary propensity for self-sabotage comes from the same place as so many other big companies that suffer from the same; it comes from the system they find themselves in (and that many once-independents at Xbox find themselves dragged into through no choice of their own), the great big shareholder in the sky, the way this all somehow detaches decisions about budgets and cuts from what's actually, rationally best for a business long-term. Sharma and the new team might revitalise Xbox, the good sides to her promises defeating the many built-in obstacles on the way. Even with her somewhat wobbly first steps, no real judgment should come before giving this new Xbox some time. There is, in many of her points about investment, creativity, artistry, patience, a genuine glimmer of hope - for all the talent lost, plenty of talented developers remain, and deserve acknowledgement. But we've also heard Xbox leaders talk the good talk before - and the big problem at its heart is never truly going to go away.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has announced a new mobile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> game called Overwatch Rush. It's a top-down reinterpretation of the hero shooter built especially for mobile players and it's in development at Blizzard, made by a team separate from the Overwatch team, <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24244645/development-update-overwatch-rush">Blizzard said in a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>A four-minute video of the game was shared with the announcement, showing a match in action, and it's immediately apparent from it how much slower the experience is. Characters move more slowly and aiming requirements are much less strenuous on two axes rather than three. Flying still exists, just, although the impact of verticality seems significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Despite the MOBA-like presentation and slow gameplay speed, the essence of a hectic Overwatch team fight is still there. We see iconic original Overwatch characters such as Reinhardt, Lucio, Mercy, Reaper and Tracer fight in a battle of a very familiar shape - Reinhardt shielding, Reaper and Tracer flanking, Lucio and Mercy healing. However, some abilities have been modified to fit the new format.</p>
<p>Blizzard described the game's development as being "early days" still, and the only indication of a release date was word it was preparing to test Overwatch Rush in "select countries". Joining <a href="https://discord.com/invite/overwatchrush">the Overwatch Discord</a> is how to stay abreast of when test phases will launch, apparently.</p>

<figcaption>The fake banter here even goes as far as to have someone accuse Mercy of not healing.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_GNt0ILldw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>It's an interesting decision to separate this announcement from the Overwatch Spotlight event at the beginning of the month, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">Blizzard showcased a new expansion for the game - and a new yearly expansion plan</a> - which has since been released and reinvigorated the game. Perhaps associations with a mobile game risked jeopardising goodwill generated by that.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Overwatch is currently in a good place. As I wrote last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">this is the most excited I've been about Overwatch in 10 years</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-2026">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a> is only a matter of months from release, and it now seems an unannounced character may play a key role in the upcoming sequel thanks to a slight slip up by one UK cinema chain.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential The Super Mario Galaxy Movie spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-description-appears-to-spoil-a-major-unannounced-character">IGN</a>, luxury cinema chain Everyman recently released a description for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, which read thus:</p>
<p>"After defeating Bowser and saving Brooklyn, Mario faces Wario and Bowser Jr.'s evil alliance. Now, alongside his friends and Yoshi, he must stop their plans for world domination."</p>
<p>Yep, that's Wario's name you read there, Nintendo's zig-zag moustachioed and purple dungareed wearing Mario-like caricature of a man, who is instantly recognisable by his bellicose cackle.</p>
<p>Since IGN spotted the cinema listing pointing to Wario's inclusion in the forthcoming film, <a href="https://www.everymancinema.com/film-listing/327878-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/#coming-soon">Everyman</a> has now changed its wording, and there is no mention of Nintendo's antihero. But, who could play Wario if he does indeed show up in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movies-us-release-date-has-been-brought-forward">which is set to debut this April</a>? I guess time will tell…</p>
<figure>

<p>Along with Mario, Luigi and - perhaps - Wario, the upcoming animated sequel will also see Bowser Junior and Rosalina joining the chaos. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">Rosalina is being voiced by long-time Nintendo fan</a>, Brie Larson.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, we were treated to a new trailer, which was introduced by Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>. This trailer saw Mario and Luigi pull up to investigate a "troubled pipe", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-unveils-new-characters-that-do-not-disappoint">while also offering us our first look at Yoshi and Birdo</a>.</p>

            <p>Evo - the largest fighting game tournament series - <a href="https://evo.gg/news/thenextevolution">announced future plans</a> to expand across the world with five new regional tournaments, a new World Championship, and plans to support local communities in the proximity of these new events.</p>
<p>These five new events will be hosted in China, Brazil, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico. The announcement blog post states: "Evo will be building new, sustainable events that highlight our diverse regional communities around the globe. We are making it our mission to ensure fighting game events are available for generations of players."</p>
<p>The new World Championship has an interesting quirk. Not only do we not know its location or how exactly it will function within the Evo ecosystem, it will require players to: "showcase their mastery of multiple fighting games."</p>
<p>Then there's wider local community support, which Evo states will be one of its many focuses moving forward. "Evo will be working together with the community, on the ground level, to elevate it and help it grow," the company wrote in its announcement blog.</p><p>News of this expansion came after RTS, which was recently acquired by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/evo-insists-its-traditions-values-and-identity-will-remain-unchanged-as-saudi-acquisition-completes">took ownership of Nodwin Gaming's share of the Evo brand</a>. Evo, which already encompasses a main event in Las Vegas, Japan, and recently France, will be undergoing intense proliferation starting in 2027. According to its new full-owners, the Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC): "Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged.".</p>
<p>There's a lot to break down here. Evo, while primarily a tournament attracting thousands of fighting game faithfuls to compete across a variety of games, has for years buttoned its coat tight over many different roles for the genre. It is also a convention, where fighting game influencers and creators can meet their fans and sell tailored goods to an impassioned audience. It has also become a stage for new reveals, where developers and publishers reveal new releases and update to the core audience. From an esports perspective, Evo events have been enveloped into the World Tours; core infrastructure, foundational to publisher-owned finales.</p>
<p>We'll start with the good, as there is doubtless plenty here. For one, more events at a time where money and opportunities are tight across not only the competitive gaming space, nor the video game industry, but the world entire is a good thing. More events means more work for those who work in the space. These events being spread across the globe also provide for regions that have been, frankly, underserved. South America via Brazil and Mexico, Africa via Morocco, and Saudi Arabia for the MENA region. Brazil and China make sense from a business perspective, as countries with growing gaming populations. Mexico specifically has deep roots in Western fighting game history, China is a growing force in the space, and even Saudi Arabia (while obviously included for reasons touched on later) is no stranger to competition in this genre with individuals like Abdullatif "Latif" Alhmili.</p>

</figure>
<p>This new World Championship is strange, though taking a glass half-full perspective could tie its multi-game format to older arcade culture, where players would dabble across multiple games. This, due to better network quality in fighting games and general industry trends has fallen by the wayside somewhat in recent years, with players sticking to their favourite titles rather than cross-polinating.</p><p>And of course, a pledge to support local communities is an important note, amidst concerns that a sweeping expansion of new Evos may smother community-run events in these regions. With the recent Evo France, many members of that countries' community were celebrated and employed.</p>
<p>Best case scenario, this means more events for more people around the world, and further enrichment of the Evo brand. With that established let's move onto the bad.</p>
<p>Evo's new owners, the QIC, is fully owned by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, and as such is directly tied to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/saudi-arabia">Saudi Arabia has been criticised heavily by Human Rights organisations</a>, and the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2024/11/20/man-who-bought-world/rights-abuses-linked-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund">Public Investment Fund itself is tied to such abuses</a>. What the QIC  owns, the country owns, and as such Evo is now fully - inarguably - tied to this country in its attempts to sportswash its reputation. If Evo and esports in general was a highly lucrative venture that raked in profits, one could argue this has been done purely on financial merit. The problem is, it isn't. Most fighting game majors run at a loss, with Evo making thin margins based on sponsors and advertisement. As such, there's an ethical dilemma people must contend with.</p>

</figure>
<p>Through this lens Evo's spread is not one of typical corporate growth nor gradual sustainable outreach, but an extensive of influence. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-saudi-arabian-takeover-of-fighting-games-biggest-tournament-means-players-and-the-wider-community-have-a-choice-to-make-between-its-culture-and-a-payout">The inclusion of an Evo in Saudi Arabia should be a surprise to very few</a> up-to-date on Evo's history since its acquisition. It has been discussed in Evo media rooms, on the tournament floor, and in the secluded smoking areas at these events for years. I would know, I've been there myself.
</p><p>There's also the question of diluting the brand. Evo (Vegas) has been, and currently still is, the Superbowl of fighting game events. It is the place to be, filling the largest convention centre in America. Evo Japan, a smaller event, has managed to minimally impact this prestige. Evo France, too, may have managed to do the same though, given its recency, its impact is hard to measure. Three events, it seems, is not too much to throw Evo off balance.</p>
<p>But <em>nine?</em> Nine Evo events, plus a World Championship? Even those who care little about Evo's place on some pedestal can surely not disregard that a leap to nine Evo events does make what is currently a big annual occasion plus a few extras into part of the furniture. Another two months, another Evo. Also, the idea of having another "World Championship". Excuse me if I didn't get the memo, but I was under the impression that Evo Vegas <em>was</em> the World Championship?</p>
<p>I'm also concerned about the impact these events will have on their local communities. While the pledge to support locals is great, one must only look at Evo France to see the ramifications of more Evo events at a time when wallets are light among attendees. France's Ultimate Fighting Arena suffered due to its proximity in the calendar to Evo France. If there are all these Evo events happening in 2027, make no mistake, will squeeze community-grown events out of the calendar for good. While I have no doubt this reality will tear at the hearts of those at Evo entrenched in the community, I doubt this is of any concern to its new owners.</p>
<p>I would ask fighting game enthusiasts this: if Brazil gains a new Evo starting from 2027, but loses Battle Coliseum (a grassroots major hosted in Sao Paulo), would it actually gain something meaningful? Or would what's actually important fall by the wayside?</p><p>What you should take away from this news is simple. Evolution is, well, evolving as part of Saudi Arabia's growing involvement in the video game industry. It's doing so at speed, perhaps too forcefully, but the board is essentially theirs now to do with whatever they wish. Done with consideration for the community-driven events around it, something the Evo team surely cares about, there's absolutely a possibility that the average enthusiast will benefit greatly. But done hamfistedly, without care, and the repercussions could very well be a deforestation of sorts, a felling of community hubs to make room for geopolitical interests.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Seamus Blackley, one of the co-creators of the original Xbox, has interpreted Microsoft's recent Xbox leadership shuffle as a sign the business is being "sunsetted". The appointment of Asha Sharma, he thinks, is "as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night".</p>
<p>Blackley, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">speaking to GamesBeat</a>, said what we're witnessing is Microsoft reorganising everything around Copilot - around gen-AI. "Satya Nadella [Microsoft CEO] has made an incredible number of bets and invested an incredible amount of money and credibility in the transform model AI future," Blackley said. "Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren't the core AI business, is being sunsetted. They don't say that, but that's what's happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/article-45824">Blackley left Microsoft in 2002</a>, so he hasn't worked at the company for a long time, but he's sceptical about Microsoft appointing someone with no apparent love of gaming to lead the Gaming division, and questions the ulterior motives of promoting someone from the company's AI division. "Imagine asking somebody if it made sense to put a major motion picture studio into the hands of somebody who didn't like movies, or a major record label into the hands of somebody who'd never seen a live show," he said. "Why would you do that?</p>
<p>"The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI," he added. "That's what you're seeing here. Whether or not you agree with it, whether you agree with AI having the potential to do that, whether AI will be successful, is a separate matter. But that's what we're seeing. That is in no way surprising. It would have been shocking if they had somebody in there in a meaningful role who was passionate about games, passionate about the creator-driven business of games, because it would be in direct conflict with everything else Microsoft is doing."</p>
<blockquote><em>"The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI"</em></blockquote>
<p>Blackley believes Microsoft boss Satya Nadella sees everything as a gen-AI problem now, which is why he's put a former gen-AI person in charge of Xbox. He says Sharma will be trained on gaming, a bit like a large language model, until she can "bring gen-AI into a position to revolutionise games".</p>
<p>"I think younger me would be screaming about this and saying, 'What the hell? Why would you put somebody in charge of a record label who didn't like records?' Looking at it now from my perspective, I probably still feel that way. I do still feel that way, as I've been saying.</p><p>"But at the same time, I understand exactly why it is," Blackley added. "I know that, again, Satya is holding a hammer and everything is a nail. There's a nail with an Xbox logo on it. He's applying the AI person to it. He has to show shareholders and the press and the world that he is all-in on this investment. He has to show them that he believes generative AI is going to fix games and make it profitable. He has to make this move. It doesn't matter what you think about it. I don't think he had any choice."</p>
<p>Whether or not Sharma will convince game-playing people depends on whether she can muster a passion for games, Blackley believes, because one thing he's seen consistently is people coming from outside of gaming and underestimating how difficult making games will be. If she can't muster that genuine enthusiasm then his advice would be to "find a way to leave this job soon". "You shouldn't do it because it's harder than you think," he said.</p>
<p>Asha Sharma was appointed CEO of Microsoft Gaming during a chaotic weekend, during which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> retired from Microsoft after 38 years and Xbox president Sarah Bond suddenly also departed. Scrutiny remains around Sharma's appointment, but a contrary insider take is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">Microsoft is actually pressing reset on Xbox with a genuine desire to turn the division's fortunes around</a>, though it's an argument that will take some convincing to swallow.</p>

            <p>We've known for a while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> is in proper production, with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-1-lead-story-designer-talks-final-cg-cutscene">CD Projekt Red</a> hoping to have it ready to go sooner rather than later. Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">a launch in 2026 has been ruled out</a>. Now, we've potentially learned about an exciting new addition to its roster of devs.</p>
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/clair-obscur-cinematic-animator-joins-the-witcher-4-studio-cd-projekt-red/">VGC</a> has revealed cinematic animator Lucie Hennet, who worked at Sandfall Interactive "from May 2023 to the end of 2024," has now joined the Polish studio as an on-site cinematic animator. Needless to say, having some of the talent that made 2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> possibly make the jump to one of the most anticipated RPGs around is exciting.</p>
<p>At least that's what we're assuming, as we know CDPR's Polish team is hard at work on the fourth Witcher game while the company's North American studios are developing the online multiplayer Witcher spinoff and the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. You can see part of Hennet's behind-the-scenes work on Expedition 33 via <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/4Nevy1">her ArtStation page</a>.</p>
<p>While we wait for a proper in-game look at The Witcher 4 and a tentative release window, there's more movement happening around the IP beyond Project Sirius (the multiplayer spinoff). Fool's Theory has reportedly <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/the-witcher-1-remake-delayed-to-2028/">paused development</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">full-blown remake of The Witcher 1</a> in order to support CDPR with the new instalment, but it's still happening at some point in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, we've also been hearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">rumblings of a new Witcher 3 DLC coming this year</a> and being handled by the same studio, so chances are we may return to the Continent soon.</p>

            <p>2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was a big enough stumble to push Xbox-owned Activision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">reconsider its approach to yearly CoD entries</a> moving forward. Mind you, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/january-2026-us-consumer-spending-on-video-games-was-up">the game is still topping charts</a>, but after a poor critical reception and lukewarm player sentiment, things are being re-examined. Could a standalone, fully-fledged Zombies entry spice things up? Maybe, but it appears that's not on the table... yet.</p>
<p>At least that's what a rare comment posted through <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty">Call of Duty's official X/Twitter account</a> is suggesting (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-aint-it-activision-issues-rare-denial-of-standalone-call-of-duty-zombies-report">IGN</a>):</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The rumor factory working overtime. This ain't it.</p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Social media accounts are typically run by community managers and dedicated social teams, but needless to say, replies to rumours about new entries <em>should</em> have to go through a few approvals first even if they're in jest. That's what makes the quick comment significant. Traditionally, the teams would just ignore and move on when being hit with these claims.</p>
<p>If we're to believe the denial, however, it's not entirely clear what the comment is referring to. The original rumour, kickstarted by alleged insider <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope">TheGhostOfHope</a> and <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/standalone-cod-zombies-game-reportedly-planned-for-next-gen-consoles-3322963/">shared by Dexerto</a>, was actually saying two things: First, that a standalone Zombies title was in dev. Secondly, it claimed there were plans to release it alongside a mainline entry just in time for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year">Microsoft's next Xbox launch</a>, which could even skip 2027 according to recent reports. Perhaps that's the play here: Shutting down the whole conversation without really specifying what they're referring to.</p><p>In any case, I'm of the opinion a standalone Call of Duty Zombies game (perhaps released with a lower price tag on it) would make <em>a ton </em>of sense. It's not uncommon to see longtime fans say they're annoyed by the franchise's current state only to pick up the latest entry to get that Zombies fix only. And in many cases, it's safe to say diehards would happily grab two separate Call of Duty releases that offered different-enough experiences.</p>
<p>For now, however, we're stuck in the loop of wondering about the series' future following a subpar entry that's performing really well regardless. Is Modern Warfare 4 next in line? It's what everyone is assuming, especially after lead developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> openly said "<a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/249223/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-infinity-ward-shuts-down-rumours-about-the-game-being-a-copy-of-mw2">see you in 2026</a>" back in December.</p>

            <p>Following a calmer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">two-week event</a> and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-details-actions-against-exploits-and-glitches-abusers">assault on exploiters</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' next huge content update, Shrouded Sky, is here. A hurricane is engulfing the Rust Belt, and all-new Arc enemies are joining the hunt for human survivors. Good luck out there.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 23rd February, Embark Studios released the introduction to the Shrouded Sky update with an official post and an ominous trailer you can watch below. The short story is the game's generally chill setting (if we don't count the killer robots and treacherous raiders) is being hit with nasty weather, at least for a bit. Today, 24th February, the update has gone live.</p> <figure>
<p>

<p>The new Hurricane map condition affects visibility and movement, but new loot caches are being unearthed by the rains and winds, so of course the most daring raiders will be going topside in search of valuables. To make matters worse, two new Arc enemies will roam the Rust Belt moving forward: Fireflies are floating, flame-emitting terrors, and then you'll have to deal with the spherical Comets, which lock on to unsuspecting raiders before exploding. You can imagine why these two are especially scary when visibility is so bad.</p>
<p>The good news is a new free raider deck is available: the Surgeon. The new cosmetic drop comes alongside the ability to (finally) put facial hair on your toon, a feature that somehow wasn't there at launch. A stubble will be available from the get-go to all players, but the full beard is part of the Surgeon deck. Via the store, the stubble beard and thick moustache are available too. I dislike having to grind for proper facial hair, but some folks have it worse IRL, so I won't complain too much.</p>

<p>Other additions include updates to the Dam Battlegrounds map, a new expedition window, new cosmetic bundles, and the Weather Monitoring System project, which has, as usual, its own set of rewards. Also, you'll probably want to check out the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/es/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">full patch notes</a> to keep track of the latest balance pass, fixes, and tweaks before you go on a rant online about your guns feeling like pea shooters.</p>

            <p>A new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>'s head of parental advocacy Dr. Elizabeth Milovidov has touched on the subject of children's safety on the platform, as well how easy it is for children to be exposed to unregulated content. This, according to Milovidov, is a "challenge".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/roblox-kids-safety-head-of-parental-advocacy-interview.html?utm_medium=s1&amp;utm_campaign=vulture&amp;utm_source=bluesky">Speaking to Vulture</a>, Milovidov addressed previous reports of children being exposed to content or people that they shouldn't have access to, and stated that they've heard mixed reports from parents on the dangers of Roblox.</p>
<p>"That's kind of the interesting spot right now is that no matter how good my intentions are, sometimes it's hard to beat back against something negative that goes viral," Milovidov said. "A lot of the reports that have come out have been based on things that happened a few years ago, or where moderation teams caught it but, unfortunately, someone took a screenshot; it went out on Instagram and it's game over for us."</p>
<p>When Vulture asked if Milovidov was saying the problem wasn't real, she responded: "I would say that, in general, Roblox is a platform online. The internet is the internet, right? We have to realize that once we give a child any sort of Wi-Fi access, the world is an open place, right? I remember doing digital parenting sessions and telling parents, 'Look, I'm wearing my Apple Watch. Can you believe I can be bullied on my Apple Watch?' You can be bullied in Google Documents. It's not about banning these things. It's about balance and boundaries. Now that we've introduced them, they've seen the water; we can't just say, 'You're never going to go there.'</p><p>When asked if parents and Roblox and the parents of Roblox players had equal responsibility in protecting these children, Milovidov responded with: "Oh, 1,000 percent. Would I say equal? Oh, Nicole, I think you're going to get me in trouble. I would say the company has even more responsibility. But yes, parents are right in there. I think all the tech companies have a responsibility to ensure that they are doing their utmost to make sure the platform is safe. Do I think Roblox is doing that? Yes, I do. I wouldn't be here if I didn't. Do I think there's more to be done? Yes, I do."</p>
<p>Vulture also raised the issue of ease of access, specifically with how easy it was for children to make new accounts and access unregulated, potentially problematic content. To this, Milovidov said: "We're trying to balance the privacy concerns of users and families with trying to wall things down a little bit more. It's a challenge. When I was writing the parent's guide for Instagram, I was also telling parents about finsta -- fake Instagram accounts. I mean, these things exist in almost every setting. The idea, again, is to talk with your children and say, 'Listen, this is our family. These are our expectations on this. This is why I don't want you to do this.'</p>
<p>"I know parents are busy, and I don't want to put the onus on them, which is why I'm trying to make it as simple as possible. Let your child guide you. Ask them what they're doing on Roblox. Ask them, 'Has anything ever happened that made them feel a little icky?'"</p>
<p>In a 2022 UK report - the <a href="https://assets.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wpuploads/2022/09/cc-digital-childhoods-a-survey-of-children-and-parents.pdf">UK's Digital childhoods: a survey of children and parents report</a> -  the Children's commissioner for England found among other things that "50 percent of children who saw harmful content reported it, older children and girls are less likely to report harmful content. 40 percent of children who didn't report harmful content told us they didn't report because they felt there was no point in doing so, while only 15 percent felt that the content didn't need to be reported."</p><p>Roblox is currently being sued by a variety of entities on the grounds of children's safety. Only last week, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/los-angeles-county-sues-roblox-rcna259891">Los Angeles county sued Roblox</a>, alleging it made it easy for adults to target children. <a href="https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/roblox-sex-abuse-lawsuit.html">Many families are also suing Roblox over similar grounds</a>, these include <a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/roblox-class-action-lawsuit-sent-to-arbitration-in-kids-data-privacy-case/">class action lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/local/georgia-attorney-general-investigates-roblox-over-child-exploitation-concerns">a grooming lawsuit in Georgia</a>, and <a href="https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/2025/09/03/accused-assault-dickinson-county-girl-brings-lawsuit-towards-roblox/">one from Dickinson Country, Michigan</a> in which its alleged that an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted on the platform.</p>

            <p>The surprising appointment of Microsoft's CoreAI president Asha Sharma as head of Microsoft Gaming at the weekend - in conjunction with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer retiring and former Xbox president Sarah Bond suddenly departing</a> - may actually be a genuine attempt by the company to turn Xbox's fortunes around. This slightly different read on the events of the past few days comes from The Verge, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">a report compiled by long-time Microsoft reporter Tom Warren</a> who spoke to "multiple" sources it sounds like were inside the company itself.</p>
<p>The Verge heard that Spencer's retirement had been a long time coming and was largely expected by staff. But Bond's more surprising departure - for she had been the obvious replacement-in-waiting for Spencer - came about as the result of her big 'Xbox Anywhere' push not working out. Her idea was to move Xbox away from a single console and spread the brand across multiple devices including mobile. This divided focus led to continued drops in hardware revenue, and core parts of the vision - such as a promised Xbox mobile gaming store - still haven't appeared long after they were supposed to.</p>
<p>Internally this Xbox Anywhere plan apparently "offended many Xbox employees", The Verge reported, and Bond herself is described as "tough to work with". She's praised by employees for striking deals with companies - apparently she was "crucial" in completing the $68.7bn Activision Blizzard deal - but she was also allegedly ruthless if you didn't stick to her vision. "You were out," The Verge wrote. "Most of the current and former Xbox employees I've spoken to in recent days are relieved that Bond is leaving Microsoft."</p>
<p>It's against that backdrop Asha Sharma was brought in, someone who seems ill-fitted to the role of CEO of Microsoft Gaming because she doesn't have gaming experience, either professionally or personally, and because of her worrying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">background in AI - a background she's already had to answer for</a>. But there might actually be a legitimate push here to reboot and refresh the Xbox division.</p><p>If Microsoft were only interested in making Xbox a game publisher going forwards, why not promote Xbox game overseer Matt Booty? And why would Sharma promise a "return of Xbox" and say things like "I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox" if looking only for empty platitudes while Xbox was sunsetted? Those are the kind of claims that will embarrass a person should they be proven insincere. "I get the impression from sources that Microsoft wants a turnaround and is worried about losing Xbox," The Verge wrote, "as it's one of its only remaining successful consumer brands."</p>
<p>Those who know Sharma reportedly say she's "enthusiastic" and "willing to learn" and "very capable of getting teams to execute on a clear vision", and that she's had good success with user acquisition at previous companies - something Xbox could sorely do with. Is this the start of a comeback fight for the Xbox console - a return to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-was-afraid-sony-was-going-to-own-the-living-room-the-big-xbox-360-interview">the "challenger brand" mindset Peter Moore instilled so aggressively for Xbox 360</a>? And if it is, what happens to that Xbox Anywhere vision?</p>
<p>Questions abound. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has been the vision holder for Xbox for a long time. He became president of Xbox in 2014 and then CEO of Microsoft Gaming in 2022, and helped drastically revitalise Xbox's image after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-one-developers-have-their-say-on-specs-self-publishing-and-tvtvtv">the disastrous Xbox One reveal</a> and launch. He was the face and figurehead of Xbox, even with Sarah Bond as president, and he instigated things like Xbox Game Pass, which Sharma will have to deal with now.</p>
<p>But there is an opportunity for Sharma to re-establish Xbox when launching new hardware, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">Microsoft has said it's working on</a>, although we have no idea when it intends to release it. There are, however, strong economical challenges faced by hardware manufacturers today, notably those caused by a rush to gen-AI, which is pushing component prices sky high, as well as unpredictable tariffs and a general rise in living costs. As we've been told before, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">the role of the console is changing</a>.</p>

            <p>Excitement around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s launch next week seems to finally be a thing, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">this weekend's "server slam" aims to convince extraction shooter enjoyers</a> on the fence. Ahead of it, Bungie has outlined a frankly impressive effort regarding networking and security features that will be implemented from the get-go.</p>
<p>On 23rd February, the Sony-owned developer <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">shared a meaty blog post</a> that dives deep into what players can expect from the game's many layers of security and key network features. Needless to say, all of them are crucial to ensuring a smooth and fair online experience, but it's often that shooters targeting a competitive crowd don't launch in a robust-enough state.</p>
<p>First, Bungie has made Marathon's dedicated servers "fully authoritative on key combat and looting actions," meaning any "correction" of suspicious behaviour won't impact other players and their experience. It's combined with "client-side prediction and rewind" to ensure actions feel immediate. Moreover, it's promised that servers "carefully track each bullet to its target even with high packet loss." Consistent hit registration at launch in an online shooter? Imagine that.</p>
<p>When it comes to wall hacks and other cheats that might reveal the position of key items and players, a Fog of War system limits the regions of a map that individual player clients have knowledge of. "It also helps keep your position hidden from other players' clients." This isn't enough to guarantee full protection from hacks alone, but it's part of the game's arsenal to combat cheaters. On top of that, the security stack was rebuilt "from the ground up" for this game, and that will work alongside the familiar BattlEye solution.</p><p>There's also the matter of one's Internet connection going down mid-run. Each online game handles such events differently. In the case of Marathon, "you can reconnect and continue playing the run" like in other match-based shooters. "If connection recovery fails due to an issue with Bungie's server or network infrastructure, we will attempt to return the starting gear to all impacted players."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps the biggest shocker comes near the end of the list of features, where Bungie states "anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever." Yeah, no second chances. So, make sure you're not running anything suspicious while playing it.</p>
<p>In any case, the veteran online shooter developer, admits that "product security is never fully solved" and says it'll continue to invest in systems and infrastructure for as long as the game stays alive.</p>
<p>As an extra, we now also have confirmation Xbox players will automatically get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">exclusive gun charms</a> when the game releases on 5th March:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Marathon players on Xbox Series X|S will automatically receive the exclusive Emerald Clutch Weapon Charm and Emerald Catch Weapon Charm when Marathon releases on March 5. <a href="https://t.co/lOpdNfle71">pic.twitter.com/lOpdNfle71</a></p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2026099758838816820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

            <p>There are nearly as many people playing Valve's unreleased and invite-only game Deadlock on Steam as there  are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">people playing the resurgent Overwatch</a>. Deadlock was actually the sixth most played game on Steam in January in the US, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcdhiexi62r">according to stat-tracking company Circana</a>. It's an indication, if such an indication was needed, that Valve's next multiplayer game is shaping up to be something big.</p>
<p>Deadlock is a team-based hero shooter, hence the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> comparison, but it's also a MOBA. It's a mash of Valve's other games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, really. You pick a kind of 1930s gangster-inspired fantasy hero, then you set about earning cash while killing computer-controlled characters in 'lanes' so you can buy upgrades and power yourself up, and overwhelm the opposing team of players.</p>
<p>Deadlock was softly launched a while ago, in the autumn of 2024, and being Valve's next game, naturally had a lot of interest. But player numbers dropped off until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-major-update-new-characters-patrons">in January this year, a large Old Gods, New Blood update was released</a>. This brought six new characters to the game along with a new faster game mode, and overhauled a large part of the overall experience.</p>
<p>The effect of the update was dramatic, propelling concurrent player numbers from a highpoint of around 30,000 at the start of the year, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a>, to a peak of 125,000 concurrents 24 hours ago. Overwatch, by comparison, has a current peak Steam playerbase of 134,000.</p>

<p>Deadlock's numbers are all the more remarkable because you can't freely access the game. You need someone currently playing to invite you which, granted, is fairly easily done - plenty of streamers and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NyPdE6mL9s">Deadlock-specialising creators are handing codes out</a> - but it isn't open access. It's also not being advertised or pushed by Valve in any way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">The Deadlock Steam page</a> doesn't have much information on it at all. Yet, people are flocking to it.</p><p>In many ways, it's not surprising. Valve's pedigree is unquestionable, with Team Fortress 2 arguably creating the hero shooter - a formula Blizzard borrowed and honed for Overwatch - and Dota 2 being one of the most popular MOBAs (and games full stop) in the world today. Dota 2's current peak concurrent player base is 830,000, which is staggering. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">the second most played game on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Deadlock currently has no release date, nor is there any word when it will be available openly to test and play.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/">GOG</a> remains the one digital distribution platform that seemingly cares about proper video game preservation. This isn't free PR or a generous read of what it's been stating since it was born; facts and numerous endeavours to save old games from being lost to time are enough to be certain the folks at the top aren't messing around.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">CD Projekt co-founder Michał Kiciński acquired the entirety of the platform</a>, effectively taking it away from the famous game maker's partial control. Since then, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">mission statement</a> has only become louder: People want to <em>truly </em>own their games even when they're in digital format, and the works of the past, no matter their popularity, need to survive in their original forms too. GOG has even declared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-faces-difficult-questions-about-generative-ai-use">it won't shy away from taking advantage of recent AI advancements</a> in conjunction with "human judgment" if they can be safely used to "advance" its crusade.</p>
<p>Now, following New Blood CEO Dave Oshry's praise for the platform <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19699-new-blood-interactive-dave-oshry-2026-interview-dungeons-of-dusk-rpg-steam-epic-games-store-switch-2">during an interview for RPG Site</a>, GOG's X/Twitter account has once again posted a loud call to action:</p>

<p>"Game preservation only works if people care" is a true statement which no one should be able to argue against. No matter how much we collectively say we care about saving the old games from oblivion and true digital ownership, few things (if any) will change if we continue to grab remasters and remakes while ignoring original releases made readily available, or if we refuse to grab PC games which aren't on Steam.</p><p>Even Oshry admitted that, as much as he loves GOG and what it does, Valve's platform is a more pleasant one than GOG Galaxy, so there's room for improvement which can hopefully boost GOG's overall popularity: "I mean, GOG is great. I love their preservation efforts and everything they're trying to do, but they need enough people to give a shit, or, how long are they even going to be around?"</p>
<p>GOG's official account acknowledged both the praise and criticism, but (smartly) used this opportunity to ask people to "buy DRM-free, vote on the Dreamlist, join <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/patrons">GOG Patrons</a>" and continue to support "the games that shaped us." In recent years, the company has ramped up its efforts to give players more ways to directly engage with what goes on the platform and suggest new additions.</p>
<p>The Patrons initiative is particularly interesting, as it allows the most passionate video game preservation fanatics to directly support GOG's own restoration efforts, which target tune-ups and updates that make old releases (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-1-2-getting-enhanced-pc-re-releases-courtesy-of-gog">like the two original Dino Crisis</a>) work out of the box on modern systems with improved rendering options, controls, cloud saves, and whatnot. At the time of writing, it's 5 euros per month and also grants a number of perks like an exclusive Discord community, voting on preservation priorities, and exclusive BTS content.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> - best known for this work on the Nier and Drakengard series - will be writing a new Evangelion series. This series was announced as part of the 30th Evangelion anniversary celebration over the weekend.</p>
<p>This revelation was spotted on <a href="https://www.evangelion.jp/news/260223-1/">the official Evangelion website</a>, in which a small credits page for the upcoming series was posted. In addition to Taro, the show will be directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and Toru Yatabe, while the music will be composed by longtime Bandai Namco composer Keiichi Okabe.</p>
<p>What this series will be about is currently a mystery, but it comes in the wake of Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time which among other things acted as a firm conclusion to protagonist Shinji Ikari's story. So whether he'll return, or we'll see a drastically different spin on Evangelion, is the big question.</p>
<p>As for Taro's inclusion, his own work is no stranger to Evangelion inspiration and influence. Only a year ago, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-taro-yoko-hyung-tae-kim?utm_source=twitter">he credited Neon Genesis Evangelion as one of the main inspirations for Nier Automata</a>, a game that exploded in popularity following its 2017 release. Nier Automata has also had some big news recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-future-developments-teased-as-it-passes-10m-worldwide-sales">with new developments in the series teased following a recent 10m sales milestone stream</a>.</p><p>So is it a good thing that we're getting more Evangelion? Well, if you like the series then obviously more entries in a series you love is great news. You could, however, argue that Shinji's finale in the latest movie where he steps away from the world of Evangelion was also quite a heavy-handed message to the audience too, urging them to move on from Eva. To have that message, then a new series, may conflict with what was a meaningful conclusion. Here's hoping they don't bring Shinji back, basically.</p>
<p>But let us know what you think? What would you like to see from a new Eva series? Do you even want one?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is almost here, but that hasn't stopped evildoers from dropping lots of spoilers all over the Internet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-issues-resident-evil-requiem-plea-as-leaks-become-a-flood">prompting Capcom to acknowledge the situation</a> ahead of the final weekend before the game's launch. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> director (and famous games industry bad boy) Hideki Kamiya had stronger words for the leakers.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X">his X/Twitter account</a>, the creative commented on the ongoing drama and launched a personal attack against the folks who are ruining other fans' fun before the game hits both the shelves and digital storefronts. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival-horror/resident-evil-requiem-leakers-deserve-to-die-ten-thousand-deaths-former-series-director-hideki-kamiya-says-i-pray-they-are-cursed-to-never-play-the-game-again/">GamesRadar+ translated the post</a>, but you can find the original one below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">確かバイオ2の時も終盤の展開を写真週刊誌にスッパ抜かれたよなー…<br>テメエ個人の利己的な満足のために、楽しみにしてるユーザーの気持ちも、力を尽くして制作したクリエイターの気持ちも踏み躙る、全ての人の幸せを破壊する唾棄すべき行為で、万死に値するだろ…二度とゲームを遊べない呪いにかかれ… <a href="https://t.co/iKueo8axFC">https://t.co/iKueo8axFC</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/2025040184614728119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>First, he pointed out RE2 actually went through something similar due to a magazine's poor handling of pre-release leaks: "Towards the end of development on Resident Evil 2, I'm sure there were some leaks that were exposed in a weekly magazine." Mind you, being aware of leaks (and even resharing them) isn't uncommon these days, but things were different back in the day. Still, <em>actual plot spoilers</em>, especially so close to a game's release, are in bad taste in my opinion.</p>
<p>Regardless, the RE Requiem leaks are coming from less official sources and aren't a matter of an outlet slipping up. Thus, cracking down on the leakers is far more difficult. Kamiya said there's almost nothing to gain from leaks that ultimately hurt those who worked hard on the games: "Trampling on the feelings of the people who are looking forward to the game, and the creatives who worked so hard to make it... Destroying everyone's joy, just for these assholes' self-gratification."</p><p>Towards the end of his port, the developer's meaner side reappeared: "Should you commit these contemptible acts, you deserve to die ten thousand deaths," he declared before going with a softer alternative that's just praying "they are cursed to never play the game again."</p>
<p>It must be noted Kamiya is a much friendlier individual in person, but he's well-known for his harsh attitude online, one which, if you ask me, is often justified based on who/what he often has to deal with.</p>

            <p>The vibes are rotten out there if you work anywhere near video games. 2026 is yet another year off to a terrible start when it comes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">project cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">studio closures that often don't make a lick of sense</a>. Despite all this, though, US consumer spending on video games has gone up year-on-year.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-video-game-spending-rose-3-in-january-driven-by-596m-from-subscription-services-us-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, we've gotten a quick look at Circana's latest data on console and PC content spending during January 2026. The year-on-year rise was of 3% (getting it to $4.3 billion by last month). "This growth was driven by a 23% increase in non-mobile subscription services, generating $596 million in revenue." We'd been hearing for a while that, even after price increases across the board, premium subscription services were driving a lot of growth these days, and the data continues to back those assessments up.</p>
<p>"Hardware spend reached $248 million, up 16% compared to January 2025" despite PS5 (down 17%), Xbox Series X/S (down 27%), and Nintendo Switch (down 79%) all seeing substantial year-on-year declines. It's all explained by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s strong launch period and hold despite a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">slower-than-desirable Christmas season</a>. PS5 continued to be leading in the US market, though.</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking (at least to disgruntled Call of Duty fans and outsiders) is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> has been topping the charts during the January 2026 period. Its initial launch was well below Microsoft and Xbox's high expectations, but we're talking about CoD here, and the IP continues to be <em>the</em> rival to beat in the FPS space. It was followed by NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and Minecraft. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6</a> dropped from No. 3 to No. 5" but continues to perform strongly after its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch">killer launch</a> back in October.</p><p>Other highlights include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> sneaking into the Top 10 (from way down at No. 255!) after the release of its fantastic Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S ports. Shocking few gamers, "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> just made it into the Top 20, rising from No.68 after the second season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunner-teases-ron-perlman-role-in-future-seasons">Prime Video's adaptation</a>." Chances are the modern RPG classic will get another boost after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">Switch 2 port</a> arrives tomorrow, 24th February.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's new gaming CEO Asha Sharma has responded to concerns surrounding her background in AI, as well as her lack of previous gaming-related roles.</p>
<p>Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following Friday's shock news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>
<p>When word came out that Sharma would be taking over as Xbox's head of gaming, many raised concerns about her background in AI (Sharma was previously Microsoft's president of CoreAI). However, Sharma has now seeked to calm these concerns, stating to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a> she has "no tolerance" for what she classifies as "bad" AI.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be," Sharma told the publication, stating that industry needs new "growth engines". That said, the new Xbox head added "great stories are created by humans", and not by machines.</p><p>As for her lack of professional roles within the gaming sector specifically, on the announcement of her new position Sharma made "three commitments" to the Xbox community: "Great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". She has since affirmed that she wants Xbox to tell stories that make people "feel something" when they play, complete with "deep emotional resonance" and a "distinct point of view". Sharma cited Campo Santo's 2016 first-person mystery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as a game that had this kind of impact on her.</p>
<p>Sharma admitted she had "a lot to learn" in her new role within the gaming industry, however she is committed to "being grounded in what the community is telling" Xbox. "I'm coming into gaming as a platform builder," she said, with her goal to "earn the right to be trusted by players and developers". She will do this by demonstrating "consistency" over time, Sharma added.</p>
<p>We can expect to hear more about what Xbox has in store next month, during the annual GDC conference, Sharma said, before teasing some bigger announcements to come during an Xbox Games Showcase this spring.</p>
<p>For more, over the weekend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-president-sarah-bond-bids-farewell-to-xbox-staff">Sarah Bond shared her farewell to Xbox staff</a>, where said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally".</p>

            <p>Grok, the generative AI chatbot on X (formerly Twitter), reportedly had an update delay because it wasn't a good enough expert on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. This came from its owner Elon Musk, who apparently was dissatisfied with his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8gz8g2qnlo">non-consentual nude creating</a>, formerly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g8r34nxeno">Hitler-praising</a>, tool.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">Business Insider</a>, which published a report into xAI following Musk's shift from head of the US Government's Department of Government Efficiency back to his prior role as CEO at various tech-based companies.</p>
<p>Business Insider wrote: "a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>,' according to people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>Sources also told Business Insider that Musk had requested Grok learning about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> - one of his favourite games - a priority. To achieve this, Musk brought together a group of staff into a "war room", as Business Insider claims he does whenever there's a problem he deems urgent. One of these war room groups was dedicated to getting the impressionable AI chatbot to play perhaps the most toxic game of all time.</p><p>What is the purpose of having an generative AI chatbot play a game for you, who knows? Years ago, before the generative AI boom, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172612-ai-trained-on-3500-years-of-games-finally-beats-humans-at-dota-2/">one program was able to beat Dota 2 players after training on 3,500 hours of gameplay</a>. So it's not like this idea is particularly novel either.</p>
<p>If you're in the UK, your parliament recently <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/65027/grok-ai-generation-and-dissemination-of-sexually-explicit-and-nonconsensual-images-of-women-and-children-on-x">discussed the dissemination of sexually explicit and non-consensual images due to Grok's recent behavior</a>. This may lead to expansions of the Online Safety Act, so that it covers the output of AI chat bots.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unmade-bioshock-movie-had-two-game-endings-says-director">BioShock movie</a> was revived... only be stuck in limbo again. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">Slow progress is being made on a script</a>, however, and like many suspected, it seems that director Francis Lawrence's busy agenda has been the main thing preventing it from happening.</p>
<p>Since Netflix's take on the cursed project <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-bioshock-movie-announcement/">was announced</a> in February 2022, Lawrence has been busy working on two different Hunger Games prequels, The Long Walk, and even the tentative sequels to I Am Legend and Constantine. Now, via <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">Collider</a>, producer Roy Lee has teased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> <em>could</em> be the filmmaker's next big project after he's done with The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping's post-production later this year.</p>
<p>"We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being The Long Walk and the other being The Hunger Games prequel, which comes out this December. We're just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he's going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it," Lee openly admitted during a chat with Collider's Steve Weintraub. Many cinephiles and video game fans figured this could be the case, especially with the I Am Legend and Constantine sequels being far from locked, but it's reassuring to get a proper update from BioShock's producer.</p>
<p>Netflix and rights-holder Take-Two might also be pushing hard to get the ball rolling on the long-in-the-works adaptation pronto, as the fourth game in the series might get a nice boost after former Gears of War and Diablo head <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">Rod Fergusson joined Cloud Chamber</a> last year to rework and fast-track its troubled development. Fergusson is no stranger to coming in hot to fix and finally release troublesome games, and it seems the powers that be are betting on the game being ready in the coming years, which is why the movie needs to get going soon: "I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game," Lee added.</p><p>After last year's creative shakeup at 2K and Cloud Chamber, we also learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive">a remake of the original BioShock was in development</a> and ultimately binned according to reports. That would've been the perfect thing to release alongside a live-action movie, but now all eyes are on the all-new fourth BioShock... even if we don't know anything about its nature yet.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last week gave us the announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-releasing-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-on-switch-consoles-but-youll-have-to-buy-them-as-they-are-skipping-nintendo-switch-online">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen coming to the Switch</a> systems. This would've been celebrated under normal circumstances, but Nintendo and The Pokémon Company chose to skip the Nintendo Switch Online service in favour of a paid re-release of the original games at £16.99 (or $20) each. A silver lining was mention of support for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-home">Pokémon Home</a> service, but now that's up in the air.</p>
<p>From the get-go, the official return of FireRed and LeafGreen to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary felt a bit barebones. With no new content or graphical upgrades to speak of or online play/trading (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">only local wireless</a>), the only thing that was half-justifying putting down the cash many would rather spend on an indie was the Home functionality, which allows players to freely transfer Pokémon between games, even those of different generations.</p>
<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/">pointed out by fans</a> shortly after the announcement, mentions of such a feature have been scrubbed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">eShop listings</a> for both versions of the game. Maybe that simply wasn't meant to be announced before <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/watch-the-new-pokemon-presents-this-pokemon-day-on-february-27-2026">this week's Pokémon Presents stream</a>, or maybe it's only planned to arrive post-launch and the powers that be aren't ready to fully commit yet in case development hiccups happen. As it stands, a potential Pokémon Home integration would be the only new feature being added to the FireRed and LeafGreen ports, so the information could've broken containment earlier than planned.</p>
<p>In any case, it's worth underlining that, at the time of writing, Pokémon Home isn't officially locked for this re-release of the GBA classics, which are priced at £16.99 each and only include a single language per purchase (pick yours carefully if you're biting the bullet). All this hasn't stopped FireRed and LeafGreen from climbing to the top of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html">eShop's charts</a> ahead of their launch on 27th February though.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2 will release in early access on 5th March, 2026.</p>
<p>The hugely-anticipated sequel to the brilliant roguelike deck-building game is set to feature "new cards, characters, events, enemies, environments, and more," with developer Mega Crit teasing, "will you attempt the climb alone... or enlist the aid of your fellow adventurers?"</p>
<p>That's right – while, like its predecessor, Slay the Spire 2 is listed as single-player on Steam, it looks like four-player online co-op will also be available from launch day.</p>
<figure>

<p>According to the new teaser, players can also expect all-new relics, potions, abilities, and alternate acts – more on those below – when the game finally releases for PC via Steam next month. It's currently the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam, behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, Deadlock, Light no Fire, Resident Evil Requiem, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>.</p><p>Developer Mega Crit had been aiming for an autumn 2025 release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slay-the-spire-2-has-been-delayed-but-it-wasnt-silksongs-fault-promise">but pushed it back to an unspecified Thursday in March 2026</a>, insisting at the time that "there's no single dramatic reason [for the delay]. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards".</p>
<p>I'm delighted to report that Slay the Spire 2 looks a lot like Slay the Spire 1  – which is a good thing – but upon closer inspection has some notable differences. As we summarised at the time, a lot of effort has gone into improving the visual presentation of the game, including 3D models in 2D environments, and a great deal more content stuffed in.</p>
<p>There are also alternate acts that allow you to choose different "a" and "b" variations of acts when you replay the game to help ease rerun repetition. Each alteration is said to have "radically" different environments, enemies, events, and bosses.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has shuttered another western studio: TiMi Montréal.</p>
<p>TiMi – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-assassins-creed-creative-director-now-at-tencent">which was headed up by former Assassin's Creed creative director Ashraf Ismail</a> after he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-creative-director-ashraf-ismail-fired-from-ubisoft">let go from Ubisoft</a> amid a flurry of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">high-profile departures</a> in 2020 – seemingly closed on Friday, 20th February.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> – which says sources had warned that a "shutdown was imminent" – a senior gameplay programmer wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fernandezluzuriaga_today-timi-montreal-is-officially-closing-share-7430638121156784128-RAMk/">LinkedIn</a> that though the team "had been aware this was coming for some time, it doesn't make the reality any easier".</p>
<p>A senior designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430638121714659328?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7430638121714659328%2C7430644929057415169%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287430644929057415169%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7430638121714659328%29">added</a>: "This team was exceptional not just in talent, but also in camaraderie. It’s one of those experiences that sticks with you for a very long time, and I feel privileged to have been part of it".</p><p>The five-year-old studio had been committed to creating "AAA open-world multi-platform games" but was chiefly working on titles it had inherited from Jade Studio, TiMi's name before 2020, and mobile spin-offs, including Pokémon Unite and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> (which is different from the mobile Warzone game that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-will-shut-down">shutting down in April</a>).</p>
<p>According to its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/timistudiogroup/">LinkedIn</a> profile, TiMi Group in its entirety employs between 5000 and 10,000 people.</p>
<p><em>An earlier version of this story inadverently classed TiMi as a NetEase studio, not Tencent. We've now updated the story - apologies for any confusion.</em></p>

            <p>Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC) has now completed its acquisition of the Evolution Championship Series – Evo, as it's more commonly known – and insists that "Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged" under its new parent company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">Fighting game players were up in arms when news broke last year that RTS</a> – a gaming talent agency and owner of the Evo tournament series – would be acquired by the Saudi Arabian mega city project, Qiddiya.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer reported at the time the news broke, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">the response online from fighting game community members was largely one of disappointment</a>, as various fans of the genre came out to express sadness at the new owner – which is a subsidiary of Mohammed bin Salman's Public Investment Fund (PIF) – and emphasised the importance of supporting grassroots community-run events given Saudi Arabia has been criticised by Human Rights organisations for its prolific use of slavery, the death penalty, and more.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2026-business-update">statement</a> posted to Evo's website now the acquisition has completed, the organisation said it will "stage major international events" in Tokyo, Las Vegas, and Nice, France, later this year, "as it continues its role as a global platform for competitive excellence, cultural exchange, and community connection".</p><p>"Under RTS ownership, Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged, with a continued focus on serving players, fans, and publishers at every level of the industry," the statement said. "Key leadership will remain in place, ensuring long-term stability, including Stuart Saw in his role as Chief Executive Officer at RTS."</p>
<p>Qiddiya's chief strategy officer, Muhannad Aldawood, added: "Evo is a global gaming institution, built on community, competition, and creativity. Through RTS and Qiddiya City, we are committed to supporting Evo's long-term growth in a way that respects its heritage and strengthens its role within the global Fighting Game Community. This is about investing in the future of play, and safeguarding what makes Evo special."</p>
<p>Numerous fans are not convinced, however.</p>
<p>"Support your locals any way you can, folks. I was already on my way out of Evo because I don’t like how corporate the scene has become," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1r94pvj/comment/o69vznc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one commenter. "I don’t even want fighting games to be a scene anymore, just play and watch the games you like, give feedback that you care about, and growth will come organically." Another simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1r94pvj/comment/o69zec4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a>: "And this, everybody, is why supporting grassroots locals should still be the priority over pushing big tentpole tournaments."</p>
<p>A number of prolific players and content creators in the fighting game community, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1pq6xzu/sajam_boycotting_all_evo_events/">Sajam</a>, have pledged not to attend Evo this year.</p>

            <p>Nintendo is reportedly issuing refunds for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> upgrade.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as the new release is officially known, released earlier this week. Following similar Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-fans-its-happening-nintendo-a-drops-a-surprise-switch-2-upgrade-for-xenoblade-chronicles-x-with-60fps-and-more">for £4.19/$4.99 USD, players with the Switch 1 version can get 4K and "up to" 60fps support in TV mode</a>, plus 1080p and "up to" 60fps when playing in handheld mode. Theoretically, anyway.</p>

And while some are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1raqtnn/very_important_psa_about_the_switch_2_edition_how/">devising workarounds in an attempt to improve the game</a>, others have gone straight to Nintendo for a refund. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/nintendo_is_refunding_xenoblade_x_upgrade_patch/">And they're getting it.</a></p><p>"Image quality seems sharper, but after a while, the image starts to grow over my perception and just turns bad," explained redditor tamodolo. "Long range textures seem to have [been applied] a convolution filter on it. And the overall image seems to be just FHD being upscales and antialiased with strong filters. Not really a true high resolution game.</p>
<p>"I played the Wii U version in native 4k using Cemu and that version in 4K is incredible! I expected that Nintendo did that for the Switch 2 edition but this is less than any other free update they issued until now."</p>
<p>Tamodolo was so unhappy, in fact, that they wrote to Nintendo requesting a refund.</p>
<p>"I just asked mine saying that the image quality of the upgraded version is worse than the original game (which is true)," they wrote. "They said that they normally don't refund digital games but can do in this case after analysing the problem. (which they did in something like one and a half minute).</p>
<p>"What I wanted to comunicate to Nintendo by doing this: This isn't the Nintendo quality I expected and [received] until now so I'll not pay for something that deliver less quality than a free patch."</p>
<p>They then told other unhappy players to follow suit, and to contact Nintendo via the form on the eShop.</p>
<p>"I [encourage] you all doing this to pass the message to Nintendo that this level of quality for something that is paid isn't acceptable and they need to improve."</p>

Told them pretty much the same thing, the upgrade makes the game look worse (I'm handheld only). No fighting, I just gave them the numbers they asked for and its on its way."</p><p>Eurogamer had good things to say about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">gave it four stars last year</a>, saying that while "not all its additions are for the better... this excavation of Monolith Soft's alien opus remains as fascinating and enthralling as it was a decade ago." Of course, that wasn't reviewed on the Switch 2.</p>

            <p>First it came for our intellectual property, then it came for our workers, and now it's after our Steam Decks!</p>
<p>Generative AI remains, it's fair to say, a hugely controversial technology; but quite aside from the substantial ethical and environmental concerns, AI - and the huge quantities of RAM needed to power it - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">now causing strife for the consumer electronics industry at large</a>. And inevitably, that includes gaming. Unity might be priming its game engine for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-boss-claims-engines-next-generative-ai-update-will-let-users-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-just-by-using-natural-language">whole new era of AI-generated slop</a>, but if things go on, might we eventually run out of things to play that slop <em>on</em>?</p>
<p>Steam Decks are in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">increasingly short supply</a>, Steam Machines are impacted, Sony is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-mulling-ps6-delay-while-nintendo-eyes-switch-2-price-hike">claimed to be mulling a PS6 delay</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">gaming hardware price hikes</a> are reportedly on the way. That's a lot of bad news, of course, but a PS6 delay? Well, that got us wondering - looming AI-driven disaster aside, would a delayed start to the next console generation really be such a bad thing? Yup, it's Big Question time again, where we gently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/the-big-question">tackle a topical talking point</a> from the week's gaming news before flinging it, grenade like, over to you.</p>

</div><figcaption>AI is killing gaming - here's why.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwCQDsN6sBI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is, of course, an expectation when it comes to console generations. Traditional wisdom is they last, on average, five years or so before the arrival of something flashier, more exciting, and new. Console generations have felt a little more elastic in recent times, admittedly, especially with the advent of mid-gen models like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. But regardless of tradition, Eurogamer's Ian Higton notes there are very real, practical reasons why an imminent march into a proper new console generation (as ever, Nintendo continues to do its own thing) would be a terrible idea.</p><p>"Listen, I know that everyone gets properly excited when there's the prospect of a new console generation on the horizon," he says. "I've lived through a couple of these moments myself so I understand the buzz, I really do. But if the next generation of consoles brings a price tag that means I can't afford to eat for a couple of months if I buy one, well that kind of ruins the thrill. In fact, as the cost of living continues to increase, along with the cost of games and other forms of modern entertainment, I struggle to see how the majority of the upcoming gaming audience could even begin to consider forking out for PS6 or an Xbox Whatever-the-hell-stupid-name-they-call-it on launch day. Unless they decide to sell a kidney or something."</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>And quite aside from the cost, there's a sense among many that the current console generation has been a particularly weird one. It took a long, long time for Microsoft and Sony to shift from cross-generational support to fully focus on the new one, and that's left a lingering suspicion among players that the PS5 and Xbox Series X still have plenty of untapped potential. Is the best the current generation can do really just shinier graphics and shorter loading times? Are there really no new experiences waiting to emerge from all that purported power? And apart from the games we've yet to see, what about the games we already have? Almost 20,000 games were released on Steam last year, and even if only a fraction of those came to consoles, that's still a bloody big backlog to get through. Perhaps that in itself is justification for longer console cycles, to give everyone - publishers and developers with games to sell, customers who need time to actually play them - some breathing room.</p>
<p>There's a flip side to all this, of course. And while Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese also believes there are very good reasons not to rush into a new console generation just yet, he suggests there is still, perhaps, such a thing as too long. "We need ends so we can have beginnings again," he says. "We want a glimpse of what's next so we can spend months fantasising about the future, losing ourselves in daydreams of possibilities. It's a periscope moment for gaming where we are forced to suddenly look up and beyond, and lose ourselves in heady proclamations about what's to come."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Closest thing I could find to a "periscope moment", sorry. | <span>Image credit: <cite>FakeFish/Undertow Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But more than offering excitement, "new consoles court the attention of the wider world," Bertie continues. "They propel gaming onto the front pages again and force a reappraisal by mainstream media... How realistic games are now! How sophisticated! And their arrival creates space for newcomers, for newness, as new brands and games and game makers squeeze in and capitalise on people's newfound sense of curiosity, and make a name for themselves. This cyclical nature of consoles, it's a bit like the seasons, in that each one is important. But stretch one of those seasons out too long and we might lose the shape of the thing forever."</p><p>All good points, but might there be some interesting side-effects, should the tech giants' AI arms race continue messing with gaming's future, as many fear? "I do wonder," says Ian, "if the cost of all this new technology could instead kickstart a renaissance in retro gaming. And I'm not talking about the current retro scene, which is already enjoyed by collectors and older gamers as a form of nostalgic entertainment. I'm talking about younger video game fans who've been priced out of the modern day market getting into retro gaming as an alternative to being ripped off. A bit like how hipsters got into VHS tapes and vinyls a while back, but less posey."</p>
<p>"Despite the price that some old Nintendo carts go for," Ian continues, "getting into retro gaming doesn't have to break the bank and in some cases it could even be free! There must be plenty of teenagers out there whose parents have a PS2, or an OG Xbox plus a bunch of games just sitting there in an old Tesco bag in the loft waiting to be discovered. Or how about Xbox 360s? All those kids have to do is climb up and down a ladder then head to their local CEX with twenty quid in hand. With that (for now at least) they could walk out with some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-10-xbox-360-games-that-mattered-the-most">incredible games</a>. Singularity, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a>, Bioshock, the Halos, the old GTAs, the list goes on.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Who needs a new Uncharted when you've got this? | <span>Image credit: <cite>AtariAge</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"So, instead of shelling out mountains of money for a new console that, going by the underwhelming launch of the current console generation, probably won't give us that big of a leap graphically anyway (and will probably have a library that consists purely of shovelware AI shitslop at this rate)," suggests Ian, "why not go <em>back</em> a couple of console generations instead? If you're young, then I have some excellent news: there's so much out there to catch up on! And if you're old, why not go pick up something that passed you by the first time around? Maybe you were a 360 kid so never got to try the PS3's library of awesome games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>, Resistance or Gran Turismo? There's only one upcoming and overpriced generation of new consoles but there are the tens of console generations from the past, so don't let those potential price hikes get you down - just get into retro games instead. Your wallet will thank you and you'll have an absolute blast at the same time!"</p><p>So there you go! It's undeniable that new console generations are <em>exciting</em>, and it's clear, in more practical terms, they breathe new life into the market when interest in the old starts to wane. But at the same time, it's been a funny old generation, and with hardware prices threatening to skyrocket, maybe it <em>is</em> more sensible to squeeze as much as we can out of what we've already got before moving on - and maybe if we wean ourselves away from ever-more-shiny, that'll have knock-on effects elsewhere too. Or have you had enough? Is it time for a retreat into the world of bargain bin classics, blow-powered cartridge fixes, and perhaps even, for those willing to go still further back, POKE commands? That's the Big Question... are you happy to wait for the next generation or are you ready to GO-GO-GO? It's over to you!</p>

            <p>I miss boxing - not that I ever did it. It used to be a kind of combat-sport backbone running through the country. I remember sleeping at a friend's house when Frank Bruno was fighting Mike Tyson in 1989, and us kids were listening to the fight on a radio upstairs while our parents listened to it on a radio downstairs. Their cheers led ours. Boxing matches were big deals, they were moments where everyone seemed to turn around, but where are they now? Lying on the canvas alongside Jake Paul.</p>
<p>Boxing games echoed this. They used to be as predictable for games machines as football games and driving games and tennis games. The first one I properly remember is Super Punch-Out!!, on Super Nintendo, but there's another more obscure boxing game from around that time I remember strongly too: Foes of Ali, on 3DO - a console no one other than my friend down the road seemed to own.</p>
<p>We'd play Foes of Ali relentlessly. It featured all of the fighters Muhammad Ali had famous fights with: Foreman, Frazier, Liston. I can't remember the others. But I do remember I had a fondness for Joe Frazier, so I'd forever be trying to lure whoever I was fighting with onto my left so I could pulverize them with his trademark hook. I remember excitedly telling my dad about this one day and he looked at me in surprise. How did his tweenage son know about the strengths of Joe Frazier? Video games, Dad - they're educational.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>I didn't realise this was one of EA's first boxing titles, so it indirectly led to Fight Night. You learn something every day, huh?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrA5wgW_66k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>But the boxing game that really caught my chin was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fight-night-round-3">Fight Night Round 3</a> on Xbox 360. It arrived at a golden time for the Xbox 360, Microsoft's best console (Bertie!), barely three months after it was released. There's a case for it being a launch title, although Wikipedia tells me it was released on the original Xbox and PlayStation 2 as well, which I don't remember at all. They were the runts of the litter, though, because on Xbox 360, Fight Night Round 3 was effectively a different game. The settings were ramped up to graphical showcase level, boasting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fi-fightnight3-x360">"pore-level detail"</a>, and the UI was dramatically altered. But most significantly of all, on Xbox 360 it had a completely different control method.</p><p>This was one of Fight Night Round 3's major novelties, or intrigue points: you controlled your punches with the thumbsticks. One thumb handled one side's punching and blocking, and the other thumb handled the other. You determined what kind of punch you were throwing by performing a similar movement with the thumbstick. A jab required a short sharp shove, for example, whereas a hook required a semi-circular hooking motion. It was quite intuitive. And it was a startlingly new approach for the time.</p>
<p>Alongside the fancy graphics, the wacky control scheme made Fight Night Round 3 alluringly next-generational. This was the sort of game you'd whip out to show your friends when they came over for tea - that's a sentence I'll never write again - because it was forward-presenting and new. And perhaps partly because it was so bizarre to control that your friends would flounder while you flattened them. Button mashing wasn't possible here because there weren't button-based attacks to bash, though it was possible for a lucky result if a newcomer went berserk with the thumbsticks, which they usually did, and accidentally landed a few solid blows. I wonder how many thumbsticks suffered as a result of this game.</p>

<p>But depleting stamina usually negated this, and the game had long punching animations you'd be vulnerable after committing to, meaning you wouldn't want to swing recklessly. This all led to a real sense of learned skill in the game, and a closer relationship with what you were doing in it. Fight Night Round 3 pulled you closer than other boxing games did. The feeling of trapping someone in the corner and then unleashing a thumb-twirling barrage of hooks and uppercuts was thrillingly tactile and violent. Then you'd land your haymaker and get your cinematic knockout cam replay, and feel a huge rush of gaming satisfaction.</p><p>What really stuck me to Fight Night Round 3 was the Career Mode. This was basically an RPG. You'd customise - in impressive detail - the look and shape of your boxer, then you'd set about training them and fighting your way through lower divisions all the way to the floodlit top. It wasn't all about winning fights, though. There was background progression here whereby you'd hit the gym between fights to do mini-games like weightlifting, heavy bag work, or combo dummy work, to improve your stats. You'd be able to spar to practise your general boxing as well. Then you'd do things like select fight contracts to choose which boxer you'd go up against next, weighing up prize purses, their form, and varying match conditions. There was a lot to do.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>I have very fond memories of turning my ridiculous-haired nobody into a ridiculous haired somebody, and watching all that hard work pay off in the shape of better muscles and flashier patterned shorts. I had a pretty good fight record as well, right up until I didn't. I'm fairly sure I got knocked down and then imploded at the distressing sight of a loss on my career record and stopped playing the game. Can I excuse that behaviour by saying I was much younger at the time?</p>
<p>Regardless, I miss it. I miss boxing. Every so often I look around for a game to scratch the itch with, but I never find anything. All I see is UFC. UFC on all of the advertising, UFC dominating combat video games. I respect it but it's never really appealed. It doesn't hold the same historical and hallowed allure for me that boxing does. It's too new, there are too many variables, too many things I don't understand. I want to be taken back to the days of Bruno fighting Tyson and that feeling of a whole nation backing their fighter. I want to be Joe Frazier landing the historic hook that took Ali down.</p>

            <p>Patrick Söderlund – founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> studio, Embark – has been appointed as executive chairman at Nexon to "accelerate global strategy, transform creative direction, and lead the next phase of growth" for its parent company.</p>
<p>Fresh from the success of Arc Raiders, Söderlund will now be working "closely with [Nexon] CEO Junghun Lee and the executive leadership team", setting the "strategic direction" that Lee will then implement.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear if this position comes in addition to Söderlund's already pretty meaty role leading Embark – which is owned by Nexon – or is in place of it, but it appears to be the former.</p>

<p>"Nexon has all the assets to unleash dramatic growth – incredibly talented people, iconic franchises, large and committed player communities, and best-in-class live service capabilities," Söderlund said via a press statement.</p>
<p>"This is an enormous opportunity, but one that will require deep focus and discipline. [Nexon CEO] Junghun and I are aligned on what needs to happen, and I'm ready to get to work."</p>
<p>It's a huge appointment for Nexon, which – although bobbing along just fine with its immensely popular mobile titles like MapleStory – has failed to get a bite of the live-service sector, and chiefly dabbled in casual and mobile gaming until subsidiary Mintrocket released the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> in 2023. It also published Embark Studios' inaugural title, The Finals, that same year, and the middling The First Descendant in 2024.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Arc Raiders continues to impress, nearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">almost 1m concurrent players </a>on PC alone and pushing onwards with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">events</a> and regular updates <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">planned out until April</a>.</p>
<p>It has also started to grapple with the consequences of that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-latest-duplication-glitch-has-players-placing-hundreds-of-ziplines-and-trigger-nades-and-safe-to-say-its-scaring-everyone-i-hope-this-gets-addressed-soon/">massive duplication glitch</a> that allowed cheeky players to double anything they were holding in their hands, confirming it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embark-studios-details-actions-against-exploits-and-glitches-abusers">finished a large investigation into how the recent exploits and glitches</a> came to be and how to deal with offenders now and in the future.</p>

<p>Last week, Mewgenics broke a rather impressive Steam record, welcoming 115,428 concurrent players on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-sets-huge-steam-concurrent-player-record-taking-a-crown-previously-worn-by-hades-2">meaning it now boasts the highest concurrent player count of any roguelike on Steam <em>of all time</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you are one of the many already playing Mewgenics on Steam, be sure to check out our guides. Here is one on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-mewgenics-classes-tier-list-how-to-unlock">best Mewgenics classes tier list and how to unlock every class</a> to get you started. As for those aforementioned patch notes? Here you go:</p>
<blockquote><h2>MEWGENICS 1.0.20695</h2>
<ul>
<li>This patch is focused on major bug fixes and "easy" changes that are unlikely to cause secondary issues</li>
</ul>
<h3>QOL Changes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Coin/Food/Item zoomers no longer prevent you from opening the backpack while they're animating</li>
<li>Added "Limit Framerate" to video settings.</li>
<li>"Tall" tiles now go semi-transparent when in tactical view</li>
<li>Fixed item sort order upon returning from an adventure (one of the last changes pre-release was adding sort buttons to the in-combat inventory screen and this broke how they sorted upon returning home)</li>
<li>If playing on steam deck, End Turn (Hotkey) is now bound to "Enter Key" by default instead of nothing. Should allow for some steam input config hacks for those who want to bind it to a back button easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed Copy Cat / Learn From Me being able to copy things other than spells in some cases</li>
<li>Fixed Tina3's Mama Maggot and Familiar Korbee not having a portrait</li>
<li>Fixed a certain very late game boss fight's summons running away when the boss died. In this particular case they weren't supposed to run</li>
<li>Fixed a few cases where an ability or passive icon in the UI would not update after being overridden by a new one (ex when using a Forbidden spell while already having 2 disorders)</li>
<li>Fixed a minor odds issue related to how Stimulation affects a parent with a class passive but not a class active</li>
<li>Fixed level spawn order to spawn static objects before familiars (This should fix a few cases where a familiar occupies a space a static object wants to be, causing it to spawn in a different place and sometimes blocking cats or enemies in)</li>
<li>Fixed Eat Rock and Rock Crusher showing a tooltip for Petrify</li>
<li>New idle animation for pet rock and pet boulder and fixed death gib</li>
<li>Fixed the way Interchange interacts with Bonus Move and Bonus Attack</li>
<li>Fixed a case where quitting after losing your last cat to a sacrifice event would cause a crash upon re-loading the save file</li>
<li>Fixed a few flickering pieces in a cutscene</li>
<li>Fixed amoebas being able to drop larger rocks partially off-map</li>
<li>fixed a very late game enemy leaving an invisible corpse</li>
<li>fixed Unscarred+ and Uncapped HP causing infinitely growing HP</li>
<li>lowered the odds of seeing a variant version of one act 3 miniboss</li>
<li>Added "texture_atlas_size" to settings file to allow for some configuration hacks for under-min-spec machines. Default is 4096. Note that lowering this will also require lowering "texture_scale_big" as well so larger textures can fit into the atlas. This will remain settings-file-only, no intent to add this to the options menu</li>
<li>Misc localisation fixes</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <p>Balatro developer LocalThunk has marked the second anniversary of his hit indie roguelike with a heartfelt blog post that ended: "Yes, I'm still working on 1.1."</p>
<p>Balatro was set to receive a 1.1 update last year, but its solo developer, LocalThunk, pushed it back <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-update-delayed-as-developer-preserves-hobbyist-approach-to-ensure-this-isnt-the-last-update-the-game-gets">in order to preserve his "hobbyist" approach to game development</a>. Since release, he has been crunching alone on a balance patch and releasing a mobile port, before taking some time out and then beginning 1.1 work.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/bad-grades">blog post entitled Bad Grades</a>, LocalThunk talks about dropping out of his engineering degree – "the idea of spending the rest of my life doing something I didn't care about was enough for me to throw in the towel" – and talked about approaching his academic advisor for help switching to a computer science degree instead (luckily for us).</p>

<p>"The choice was simple. It was hardly a choice at all, really. I loved programming. I wasn’t any good at it, nor was I aware of what may await me after graduation, but in the months since that Intro to Computer Science course I had created a few programs that convinced me this is the thing for me. I want to make things with code," he wrote.</p><p>"The transition into Computer Science was a bit rough, seeing as I’d already missed a couple of weeks of the semester with a full course load. I was not a good student, and to be honest I barely passed some of my required courses."</p>
<p>But this new skill enabled him to make things – a "perlin noise terrain generator", a grid-based heat dissipation simulation" – and a "more granular version of Risk, or a bite-sized version of a grand strategy game like Europa Universalis".</p>
<p>"I worked on that game for over two years. It never had a name, it was never completed, and apart from showing it to a few friends and family, nobody knew it even existed," he added. "But it was exactly what I wanted to make, and the feeling of absolute freedom I had while working on it is the reason why I kept game development as a hobby years later. That project was the template. I found the files for that project and played it for a couple [of] days recently; it was pretty fun."</p>
<p>LocalThunk said he "thinks about that version of myself a lot now", adding, "Even if I could warn myself, I'm not sure what I could have said to prepare for the insanity" of releasing Balatro.</p>
<p>"With all the success, baggage, attention, heartache, fear, stress, and joy that I’ve had since Balatro was created, at least that old version of myself is still there," he concluded. "Last night I stayed up until the early hours of the morning drawing pixel art, writing code, and listening to music in my quiet house. Notebook of ideas open next to me, cup of decaf in hand."</p>
<p>Then, right at the end as a postscript, he added: "Yes, I'm still working on 1.1."</p>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">shaky start with ratings boards</a>, Balatro has gone on to find phenomenal success. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-completing-balatro-has-developer-better-equipped-to-design-the-next-big-update">LocalThunk has 100 percent completed his own game</a>, which has "equipped" him to better design the next update.</p>

            <p>Former Xbox president Sarah Bond thanked former CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> and congratulated his successor, Asha Sharma, in a letter sent to all staff as news broke that she was leaving after eight years with the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox CEO Phil Spencer announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years yesterday</a> (21st February), amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role, and Xbox president Bond depart the company.</p>
<p>In a message shared via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sarahrbond_sharing-with-gratitude-the-note-i-sent-to-activity-7430753683912531968-YEXj/">LinkedIn</a>, Bond said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally". She did not share what those next steps would be.</p>
<p>"I've had the privilege of spending time with [new CEO] Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand," Bond said.</p>
<p>"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this. I'm excited to see her lead this next chapter for our team."</p>
<p>Bond added: "I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together over the past eight-plus years. PC and cloud gaming are growing faster than ever, our next console is well underway, and together we've helped lay the foundation for a more open gaming platform that spans devices and reaches players around the world."</p>
<p>She closed on thanking Spencer for his "mentorship and friendship over the years", and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for "his sponsorship and support throughout my time at Microsoft".</p>
<p>In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction."</p>
<p>Spencer said: "Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team."</p>

            <p>Original Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has declared the Saints Row franchise is "dead".</p>
<p>Last November, Stockman revealed he wanted to revive the open-world crime series following the poorly received 2022 reboot – developed after he had left Volition – and claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-saints-row-designer-says-unloved-2022-reboot-missed-the-mark-but-the-big-news-is-embracer-wants-him-to-pitch-a-revival">publisher Embracer Group had reached out to hear more</a> about his ideas.</p>

<p>Fast forward a few months, however, and Stockman is now less confident, responding to a fan on Discord that IP holder Embracer has "ghosted him" and "has zero ability to do anything with [the franchise]".</p>
<p>"[H]onestly, I think the franchise is dead, unfortunately," Stockman said in reply to a commenter who'd shared their dismay that the last canon game was released "a decade ago".</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>"I get the sense that Embracer has zero ability to do anything with it," he added. "I wish things were different. I tried my best to offer a path forward, but they've ghosted me."</p>
<p>Stockman's comments come <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-reboot-developer-didnt-know-what-they-were-building-saber-ceo-says-criticising-shuttered-team">after the CEO of Saber Interactive had some pretty damning words to say about the reboot</a> and its developer, Volition, after it was shuttered in 2023 as part of then-parent company Embracer Group's previously announced "restructuring" programme.</p>
<p>"They didn't know what they were building," Matt Karch said. "They didn't have any real direction. It couldn't last," Karch said. "And so, who's going to fund them for the next game after that disaster?"</p>
<p>I found the 2022 game to be a very mediocre affair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-2022-review-a-snappy-but-slightly-uneven-reboot">when I reviewed it back in 2022</a>, calling it a reboot that "won't set the world alight, but there's a punchy game here with some pleasant surprises".</p>

            <p>
Xbox CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has announced his retirement from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, amid a major leadership shakeup for the gaming brand that'll see Microsoft's current president of CoreAI, Asha Sharma, take over the role. Additionally, Xbox president Sarah Bond will depart the company.
</p>
<p>
"Last fall, I shared with [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella] that I was thinking about stepping back and starting the next chapter of my life," Spencer - who joined Microsoft in 1988 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-named-new-boss-of-xbox">became the boss of Xbox in 2014</a> - wrote in an email to staff. "From that moment, we aligned on approaching this transition with intention, ensuring stability, and strengthening the foundation we've built. Xbox has always been more than a business. It's a vibrant community of players, creators, and teams who care deeply about what we build and how we build it. And it deserves a thoughtful, deliberate plan for the road ahead.
</p>
<p>
"Today marks an exciting new chapter for Microsoft Gaming as Asha Sharma steps into the role of CEO, and I want to be the first to welcome her to this incredible team," Spencer continued. "She brings genuine curiosity, clarity and a deep commitment to understanding players, creators, and the decisions that shape our future. We know this is an important moment for our fans, partners, and team, and we're committed to getting it right." Spencer added he'll remain in an advisory role "through the summer".
</p>
<p>
As part of his retirement announcement, Spencer also confirmed the departure of Xbox president Sarah Bond, who he said had "decided to leave Microsoft to begin a new chapter." He called Bond's work "instrumental during a defining period for Xbox", wishing her "the very best in what comes next". Bond joined Xbox in 2017 and was named Xbox president in 2022. As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> head Matt Booty, he's received a new role amid Xbox's significant executive overhaul, and will now work closely with the newly appointed Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.
</p><p>
In her first email to staff as CEO of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma wrote, "I feel two things at once: humility and urgency. Humility because this team has built something extraordinary over decades. Urgency because gaming is in a period of rapid change, and we need to move with clarity and conviction.
</p>
<p>
"I am stepping into work shaped by generations of artists, engineers, designers, writers, musicians, operators and more who create worlds that have brought joy and deep personal meaning to hundreds of millions of players," Sharma continued. "The level of craft here is exceptional, and it is amplified by Xbox, which was founded in the belief that the power of games connect people and push the industry forward... We are stewards of some of the most loved stories and characters in entertainment and bring players and creators together around the fun and community of gaming in entirely new ways."
</p>
<p>
Sharma also made what she called "three commitments", referencing "great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". On games, she said Microsoft - which has made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">sweeping cuts across its gaming division in recent years,</a> including layoffs and team closures - will "empower our studios, invest in iconic franchises, and back bold new ideas." She also promised to "take risks" and "enter new categories and markets where we can add real value, grounded in what players care about most."
</p>
<p>
On the return of Xbox, Sharma said the company would "celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console which has shaped who we are... Gaming now lives across devices, not within the limits of any single piece of hardware. As we expand across PC, mobile, and cloud, Xbox should feel seamless, instant, and worthy of the communities we serve. We will break down barriers so developers can build once and reach players everywhere without compromise." Sharma did not explicitly reference the "next-gen hardware" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-gen-xbox-confirmed-in-development-following-rumours-microsoft-would-stop-making-consoles">announced by then-president Sarah Bond last year</a> amid reports Microsoft was ending console development.
</p><p>
On the future, Sharma spoke of the "reinvention of play", pledging to "invent new business models and new ways to play" that will "meet the moment". This will include the building of "a shared platform and tools that empower developers and players to create and share their own stories". Additionally, she promised the team will "not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop. Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.
</p>
<p>
"The next 25 years belong to the teams who dare to build something surprising, something no one else is willing to try, and have the patience to see it through," Sharma concluded. "We have done this before, and I am here to help us do it again. I want to return to the renegade spirit that built Xbox in the first place. It will require us to relentlessly question everything, revisit processes, protect what works, and be brave enough to change what does not. Thank you for welcoming me into this journey."
</p>
<p>
In a separate email to staff, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Sharma would bring "deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth." He also thanked Spencer for his "extraordinary leadership and partnership".

            <p>I was in the gift shop of a small art gallery the other day when I bought a postcard depicting a bunch of different keys. The postcard turned out to be a reproduction from the six-volume dictionary and encyclopedia Larousse du XXe siècle (me neither) and the keys come in a gorgeous range of shapes and sizes. The Roman key is broad and boot-shaped. The Merovingian looks like part of a crank.</p>
<p>I love a good key, obviously, and yet I wasn't thinking of that as I bought the postcard. I wasn't thinking of the many keys I've owned and lost over the years, or the acquaintance of mine who is a locksmith. I wasn't thinking of the junk shop I'd once visited on a Greek island where I spent a happy twenty minutes looking through a trunk filled with rusted keys whose locks had clearly long-since crumbled, or a friend who is a caretaker at a church and once showed me the huge long-stemmed key he uses to get in each evening. I didn't even think of church keys, the colloquial name for a flat-edged tool that is used to open human skulls - hopefully only during autopsies.</p>
<p>Instead, I thought of a single word: Zelda.</p>
<p>Oh man, Zelda and its keys. The boss keys, with their villainous, intimidating shapes. The little silver keys collected and portioned out in dungeons, each one a gamble. And that moment, a few weeks ago, when I spent much longer than I should in some shrine deep in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, watching a stone ball rolling around a concave semi-circle in the ground before it settled into the centre. This mesmerising thing was a key of sorts: once in the centre, the stone ball certainly triggered a nearby gate. But it was also just a wonderful thing in and of itself. The rolling ball, the lazy, beautiful, ideal physics that kept it in motion, the lovely grating chunk as it finally found its resting spot.</p><p>Zelda is keys, in a way: locks and doors and chests and the urge to find out what's inside things and behind things. But in a crucial way, as I watched that stone ball roll around, I realised that I had no key at all for the two most recent Zeldas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> and Tears of the Kingdom. I think I love these games. And just watching the ball made me realise they're clearly beautiful, and capable of conjuring wonder. But I don't understand them. They haven't fully come into focus for me or made sense of themselves to me. A brilliant friend once wrote that the Zelda games are clockwork fairy tales. Clockwork often needs a key. So are these recent Zeldas still clockwork, now that they've gone open-world? And where's the key I'm after?</p>

<p>I struggle to do what I'm told in games, but this never used to be the case with Zeldas. Back in the day, whether slipping between dimensions, pushing through the mineral veils of time, or simply messing around in a boat that came with a head, I did exactly what I was told. The land was in danger, so a hero in green had returned. Time to battle through dungeons, collect cherished items, and give Ganon a showing at the end of it all.</p>
<p>These games were discursive - god those little stones you had to collect and clip together in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-minish-cap">The Minish Cap</a>, that brass and wood camera from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">Wind Waker</a> - but their discursions, how to put this, always left me facing in the right direction afterwards. Hyrule field was dauntingly vast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>, or so it seemed, but I always found the dungeons in the right order and I always made it to the final credits. My favourite of these games, Link to the Past, is a single puzzle box from start to finish - I appreciate this is not an original thought - and I wandered through it, got lost, found my way again, despaired and tasted triumph and almost gave up, all without feeling, really, that I had wandered even for a second where I was not meant to go.</p><p>Then came Breath of the Wild. And I think I was lost from the start. I emerged into that bright green and blue world, right at the top of a hill, and I duly collected all my new powers, but did I ever really understand what they were for? Moving stuff around, messing with time, bringing ice blocks out of the earth! Reader, I am ashamed to say that it took me a week or two of playing before realising I was even meant to be applying these powers outside of the shrines, those collectathon fragments of old Zelda dungeons that were suddenly my only guide through this expansive, panoramically broad and emphatically hands-off world I was dumped into.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Tears of the Kingdom was much the same, except by now I had seen about a billion TikToks that showed me that the game was really about using the skills I was given in ways that hopefully nobody else had thought of. I saw people using the time powers from Breath of the Wild to travel everywhere on trees they'd felled and then filled with pent-up kinetic energy. As for the building tools from Tears of the Kingdom, I saw someone who had made the DeLorean from Back to the Future, right down to the gull-wing doors, which opened and shut automatically. Anything was allowed here. Everything was allowed.</p>
<p>So that was it! Forget about Zelda and Ganon and the curse that had fallen across the land. Just enjoy the sandbox. Live for the lark of it.</p>
<p>Yeah, but that's not quite right either. Hyrule is a great toybox, but the more I screwed around with the bits and pieces the more I realised that the game has all these subtle ways of reminding a dutiful, slightly plodding person like me that there is a central quest. There are the people you meet, and their manias and tragedies. There are the derelict castles and flying dragons and the Blood Moon or whatever it's called, everything reminding you, just enough, that things are kind of serious here really.</p><p>More than that, there's a sadness laced into the landscape of Hyrule itself. One of my favourite painters is Eric Ravilious, master of watercolours, visual poet of the South Downs, and apparently one of the most cheerful people who ever lived. He knew war and he died mysteriously near the North Pole (I think) but he also ricocheted from one love affair to another and was known, I gather, for his habit of whistling to himself wherever he was and whatever he was doing, probably even when he was conducting those love affairs.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>His paintings? Well, they have me in total conflict. Pleasing rounded shapes and simple colours, but they also move me so much! Is that a tear in my eye? What a contradiction. Anyway, Hyrule in the two recent Zeldas feels like Ravilious to me, and that's not just because of the watercolour skies and cross-hatching of bright green grass. It's because it feels like a melancholic landscape drawn into being by someone who was disproportionately upbeat.</p>
<p>And this quiet collision of opposite moods is everywhere in the games. Once again (twice again?) that ancient evil has returned and the princess is missing. Yet some unseen <em>someone</em> with great influence over the land is clearly feeling pretty good about things. Winds are playfully abroad in the grasses. The night are often clear and cool and bright with opportunity. Trigger a battle and the game busts out the old Joanna. What is injury when it's accompanied by a jazzy cat walking splay-footedly across the keys? What's life and death when it's met with a <em>glissando</em>?</p><p>Yes. Quite. And to all of this, throw in scale. I'm going to abuse that word a little bit. It's not just that the land is vast and rolls away in every direction, that the mountains are tall and the valleys are deep. It's that there's so much here to do: those seeds to find, people to help, those guys with the signs, those towers to climb, all of those hundreds of shrines.</p>
<p>And your powers! Breath of the Wild again with its initial brace of tricks, and then Tears of the Kingdom with its ersatz modding tools: bodge together weapons, build anything you can think of, clip through the geometry. (It was only with Tears of the Kingdom's arrival, incidentally, that Breath of the Wild suddenly felt complete to me. Why? Because all of a sudden I could be in one game and feel that sweet sadness of conceiving a perfect solution to a puzzle, but a solution that would only work if I had the powers that I had in the other game and not this one.)</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And Hyrule as we know it is just the start of it. In Tears of the Kingdom it goes up, to those windblown archipelagos of skyminded rock with their rail carts and turning orbs and sad, winter trees.  The puzzles here are often completely brilliant, and the very feeling of wandering through the wild blue is magic too. It's a feeling, for me, of being off from school on a term-time weekday, exploring where I shouldn't and messing with things out of sight of grown-ups.</p><p>And it goes down, too. Slope downwards to thy depths, O Link! Down in the darkness, Zelda suddenly feels nothing like Zelda. Shadows and horror and sticky red gore everywhere. You have to light your way through the darkness, moving from one pool of vision to the next. I've suspected at times that in the Depths under Hyrule we see that game that the developers of Zelda have wished they could make for years, something chaotic, under-imagined and disturbing.</p>
<p>Is that true? I have no idea, but I do believe that the power of the Depths, and I love these places, is not what they contain but what they <em>might</em> contain. It's rubble and stone mushrooms for miles and then you hit a huge, sharp edged structure that feels, for all the world, like a DLR station visited at two in the morning on a Tuesday. There's the same sense of dormant purpose, of capturing a busy, useful place in a rare moment of absence. Games, it's said, are about possibility space. The Depths feel like a way of giving shape to the very <em>idea</em> of possibility space: what else is out there?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's so much I haven't mentioned. We haven't visited the dungeons and their guardians or so much as saddled up a horse, or even that cool skeletal horse I found in the Depths the other day. But that's the point. Whenever I try to write about these recent Zeldas I feel like I should be trying for completeness. But it never seems to be possible. I know there is deep harmony here, in themes and systems and art and all that jazz, but I have my most fun when it feels like I'm playing against that, or tripping over myself, or getting lost and distracted and absolutely not trying to save the land or anybody in it.</p><p>And perhaps that's where I'm meant to end up. From my own experience, the defining quality of the open-world Zeldas is that you can write about them forever, but you can only capture them in parts. And for writing, I mean play, explore, think about, approach. The wholeness of these games, if such a thing even exists, always eludes me and I end up in distractions and discursions, all of them wonderful but all of them somehow disconnected from one another, connected and disconnected from the very idea of Zelda. In this world of hills and mountains and parapets, there is simply no vantage point, real or metaphysical, where absolutely everything can be glimpsed at once.</p>
<p>And I should add, this is not a criticism. In fact, it's the absolute opposite. As the physics system that sent my stone boulder in motion freed the shrines from having a right or wrong solution, the open world has freed the games from standing for one specific thing. Back to keys, I reckon? Everything is a potential key now. Everything is a potential lock. You just have to decide where you're going for and what you're looking for and what you value in your experience. It's overwhelming and ingenious and sweet and detailed and broad strokes and kind and terrifying. Zelda's no longer an adventure. It is adventure.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing.

<p>Last Friday night, I made a bet with my husband that I could start and finish a game well before he was ready to watch the last few episodes of Better Call Saul. He smirked and said fine, but it couldn't be a mobile game like Wordle or something similar. "No problem," I replied, for I knew something he didn't - I knew about the secret <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-4">Far Cry 4</a> ending.</p><p>As my husband went upstairs to close down his work computer and get into his comfy non-work clothes, I booted up my Series X and settled in to watch Far Cry 4's opening cutscenes up until the point I found myself in front of a plate of monkey heads. Then, once the flamboyant and self-proclaimed King of Kyrat, Pagen Min, had made himself scarce, I prepared myself to do... absolutely nothing. Yes, I set down my controller and waited patiently.</p>
<p>After around 10 minutes (I didn't keep track of the exact time), Pagen Min returned to the dining table - which he had asked me to wait at - and proceeded to take me with him to place the ashes of Ajay Ghale's mother in a shrine within Far Cry 4's fictional Himalayan countryside. Some light button pressing later, to look around and set down/pick up items, I was ready to climb into Pagen Min's helicopter and watch the end credits roll.</p>
<p>20 minutes and I was done. A further five minutes later, my husband showed up. I was smug.</p>

<p>It's a school half-term holiday down this way, which means my son has been up late playing games. While he insists on playing EA Sports FC 26 on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, which I hate because of the sluggish frame rate in comparison to the other console versions, we have also played some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> which is brilliant.</p><p>Nintendo's Switch 2 kart racer feels so great to play, the world is so colourful and alive, and the variety in locations is superb. This game always had a tough task following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, a game that I and millions of others had played to death over years. There are few games I have ever become so familiar with, so change was also going to be tricky. Some eight-ish months since the Switch 2 launched, I'm starting to get some of that familiarity, and I'm able to enjoy the game more easily.</p>

<h2>Overwatch, PC</h2>
<p>It just occurred to me that you can't choose from all of the characters in Stadium. I've been playing for a week but somehow haven't noticed. Stadium is the newish game mode where you can customise your character between rounds by buying ability buffs, or ability tweaks. Example: you can change Mei's ice block ability into an ice boulder that rolls around and she can hurt people with, which is great, so you see that you can quite significantly change a character's behaviour over the course of a game. I wish there were more characters available here, especially the newer ones, but it's still exciting to alter characters I thought I knew so well. I'm re-energised, and it's only one small part of the reason why - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">I wrote much more excitedly about Overwatch's sort-of relaunch earlier this week</a>. I'm also looking for people to play with because it's more fun with friends. Hop on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/eurogamer">the Eurogamer Discord</a> and say hey if you fancy it.</p>

<p>So it's me, Pontoon, Guano and Flapjack right? They're all newbies; the planet government has hired me to hold their hands while we level an "undefended" pirate base. They said that the bad guys were running bootleg holotapes out of it - I don't care, it was meant to be an easy paycheck. Just keep an eye on the other three and make sure their BattleMechs don't trip and fall off a cliff while they're shooting the place up.</p><p>Of course, the intel was wrong. By the time we'd got eyes on the base, sensors showed four heat signatures out there in the fog. I told them to get into the woods nearby quick-quick, and two of the stick jockeys managed to do it in time. Flapjack wasn't having it, though. He got so damn gung-ho he ran up to the base to take them all on.</p>
<p>He even got a few shots off against the tiny Locust that was out on patrol, but the light Mech was moving too fast to suffer anything more than a few scratches from his wild laser fire. Pontoon and Guano let it rip too, but from further back they couldn't hit it either.</p>
<p>The Locust wasn't the problem though. Flapjack's 45-ton Firestarter was twice its weight and three times as armoured. The problem was the three extra Mechs at the back of the base, brimming with long-range missiles, large lasers and extended-range particle projector cannons. Once Flapjack entered their line of fire, it was over - the first wave of missiles took his legs, and the next slammed mercilessly into the cockpit before he could punch out.</p>
<p>It's a damn shame. I tore up into the base in my 100-ton King Crab, soaking up the rest of the fire as best I could, and the rest of the green pilots made themselves useful in the background. Pontoon even took out a Panther with a lucky autocannon headshot to tip the battle in our favour. All three of us made it back in one piece. But I'm going to spend more on field repairs and ammo resupply than I'll have made on the job.</p>
<p>And that damn kid. I'll never see those oaty treats in the mess the same way again.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has not one, but two Far Cry games currently in development.</p>
<p>That's coming from Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot, who was interviewed by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">Variety</a> about various goings on at the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">such as its recent 'restructuring'</a> which will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">including the already launched subsidiary with Tencent known as Vantage Studios</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Here, the publication asked Guillemot if this new company model will see development on its biggest franchises such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed speed up, to which the exec replied:</p>
<p>"We have a solid pipeline underway across Vantage Studios. Under the Assassin's Creed brand, several titles are in development, spanning both single-player and multiplayer experiences, with the ambition to further grow a community that exceeded 30 million players last year.</p>
<p>"On Far Cry, anticipation is high, and we currently have two very promising projects in development."</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Ubisoft had two new Far Cry releases on the way, but this is now official confirmation that this indeed the case. As for those previous reports, it has been said that one release - codenamed Project Blackbird - will be the next mainline Far Cry entry. This chap will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-will-reportedly-see-players-attempting-to-rescue-their-kidnapped-family-against-the-clock">allegedly feature a "non-linear" story based around the kidnapping of the protagonist's family</a>, that plays out over - and seemingly must be completed within - 72 in-game hours, equating to 24 hours in real-time.</p><p>The second game previously reported to be in the works is a standalone Far Cry multiplayer game, known as Project Maverick. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-reportedly-in-development-at-ubisoft">sources claimed Maverick would be an extraction-based shooter pitched as being based in "the Alaskan wilderness"</a>. At this time, it was said Maverick would allegedly include "mechanics such as permadeath, a backpack system, contracts, and more". The "and more" here could likely refer to lootable chests and extraction zones.</p>

<figcaption>The latest mainline Far Cry entry - Far Cry 6 - took players to the fictional Caribbean island of Yara. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Assassin's Creed, we already know about some of its upcoming games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-project-hexe">such as Project Hexe</a> and of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">its Black Flag remake</a>. However, a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/">Insider Gaming</a> has said that as part of Ubisoft's recent restructuring, two upcoming Assassin's Creed titles were cancelled, including one said to be called Assassin's Creed Singularity.</p>
<p>According to the publication's sources, Singularity was intended to be a virtual trading card game with Web3 and blockchain integration, and it would have been released across PC and mobile platforms. While I do have my - ahem - thoughts about what Ubisoft has done to its studios and games over the past few months, this is one game I don't feel especially sad to see gone.</p>
<figure>

<p>Elsewhere at the company, as well as these two Far Cry games, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-anthology-series-in-the-works-with-always-sunny-in-philadelphias-rob-mac">anthology series is also in the works with Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Rob Mac (née McElhenney) and Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley</a>. In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>
<p>As for Ubisoft more generally, earlier today it was announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">company was laying off 40 developers at the studio working on its Splinter Cell remake</a>, but the game itself remains in production.</p>

            <p>We are just a matter of days away from the release of Resident Evil Requiem, but already leaks are running rampant, causing Capcom to ask its community to 'please, cut it out!'.</p>
<p>As our Connor reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-out-resident-evil-requiems-ending-is-being-spoiled-online-as-capcom-fights-to-clean-up-leaks">physical copies of Resident Evil Requiem were obtained ahead of schedule by some members of the public earlier this week</a>. And thanks to this, gameplay and story leaks started making the rounds on the likes of reddit. Sigh.</p>

<p>Capcom did its best to curtail the problem by removing unauthorised videos and whatnot, but it did feel a bit like that man sticking a bit of sellotape over a massive leaking vat of liquid. So, now, the studio is appealing to any potential leaker's better nature, with a firm but fair 'stop it'.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590/photo/1">social media post</a> shared this afternoon, Capcom wrote: "Please don't post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for Resident Evil Requiem. We really want everyone to enjoy the game's story and experience as much as possible."</p>
<p>It added its legal department "will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience". It then said very reasonably that we don't exactly have much longer to wait until we can all experience what horrors are in store first hand.</p>
<p>"We look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!" Capcom closed.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch across PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in one week's time, on 27th February.</p>
<p>Our Alex is one of the many here at Eurogamer very keen to play the latest series entry, but unlike the rest of us, he has been able to go hands-on with it already  (what, no I am not jealous <em>at all</em>…). "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer's Resident Evil Requiem preview earlier this year</a>.</p><p>"I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>

<p><strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series below</strong> (to be clear, I have no idea what the plot is - for this show and just generally in life - but I don't want to accidentally show you too much too soon if you would rather keep an air of the unknown around the upcoming series).</p>

<p>The latest Tomb Raider set photos appear to take place in the same Surrey woods from earlier set photos, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-sophie-turners-lara-croft-and-her-dual-pistols-on-set-of-tomb-raider">saw Turner parachuting in during the day time</a>. These new images, however, appear to take place at night, with Lara now sporting that aforementioned new kit - a mysterious dagger.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15573351/amp/Sophie-Turner-knife-fight-scenes-motorbike-films-new-Tomb-Raider-series.html">Daily Mail</a>, Turner filmed "dramatic knife fight scenes" during the shoot, so I am now wondering if she went to the woods in search of this (potential) artifact. Though, Lara's gloves are <em>slightly </em>different, so maybe not… I guess we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>In addition to the dagger, Lara also appears to have a retractable pickaxe with her. This tool made an appearance in the animated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> on Netflix if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>As for Zip, Lara's resident tech expert is no longer relegated to being behind an ear piece or computer. As you can see in the images below, Bobb-Semple's Zip is in on the action, and can be seen picking Lara up on a motorcycle.</p><p>I have to admit, I am not sure he is wearing <em>exactly </em>what I would choose to wear if I had to go and scoop my friend up from the dark, rain-soaked woods at night while on a motorbike, but he does look pretty sharp.</p>
<p>Also, I would have liked to see Lara on the front of the bike rather than at the back, but even so, I am very pleased to see motorbikes will be a part of Amazon's Tomb Raider show. Overall, I am really feeling rather optimistic about this adaptation.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we had a wave of cast announcements for Amazon's Tomb Raider series. As well as Turner and Bobb-Semple, the show will also feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas and Bill Paterson as Winston</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a> earlier this year, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Waller-Bridge has said of Tomb Raider</a>. "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is.</p>
<p>"Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The message "Nier Automata will continue" was the stinger concluding today's celebratory showcase for the game, which covered the game's many cameo appearances, spin-offs, and its passing of 10m worldwide sales.</p>
<p>This video, posted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> YouTube channel, covered the game's history of releases and adaptations since its initial release in 2017. Having only recently passed 10m sales, it marks a steady increase from December 2024 when it passed 9m.</p>
<p>This announcement came alongside some new art <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394">posted to official Nier Automata social media platforms</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this final message mean, aside from the obvious indication that Nier Automata will carry on in some form. Well, there's been little word of a sequel to Nier Automata, despite its widespread acclaim and success. There was Nier: Reincarnation, a mobile sequel of sorts that launched in 2021 and was shut down and made unplayable in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">Tencent also cancelled another Nier mobile game in 2024</a>, which reportedly "struggled to find a monetisation to offset its high costs.".</p><p>You could kill all hope of a AAA direct sequel in your heart, and instead see the tease as an indication of more cameos in other games. These have proven exceptionally popular whenever they emerge: <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nier-automata-collaboration-pushes-goddess-of-victory-nikke-to-a-half-a-billion-in-revenue/">Goddess of Victory: Nikke saw a 215 percent increase in sales thanks to its Nier Automata collaboration</a>, leaping over $500m in revenue as a result.</p>
<p>One can certainly hope for the former. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> has been largely an absent presence from the world of <em>released</em> video games since the Nier Replicant remake in 2021, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">stating last year the projects he had been working on were cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for? If you've not played Nier Automata, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-review">Eurogamer's review to see what all the fuss is about.</a> In it, Jeffrey Matulef wrote: "Yoko Taro's eccentric action RPG gets a follow-up that's every bit as surprising as its predecessor with a little help from Platinum Games."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Jake Solomon, a decorated game designer known for his work at Firaxis on games like XCOM and Marvel Midnight Suns, has announced that his studio Midsummer is going to close. In doing so, he also shared a pre-alpha look at the "Life Sims + The Truman Show" game the studio was making, called Burbank.</p>
<p>Solomon didn't elaborate on the reasons for closure in <a href="https://x.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181">the statement he released on X</a>. "We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both," he wrote. "Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into."</p>
<p>Burbank seems to be a game about making TV shows with a cast of characters you can pick up and drop into various customisable situations. It reminds me a lot of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lionheads-secret-best-game-and-one-of-the-greatest-ever-abandonware-games-the-movies-turns-20-today">Lionhead's The Movies</a>.</p>
<p>The Burbank trailer shows somewhat action-figure-like people leading dramatic lives in a small-town location, which you watch as though you would a soap opera on TV. The trailer then reveals that you're the one directing it, choosing the characters who'll be the stars and then adding a support cast from bundles of support cast characters. Then you choose a broad outline for the episode, establish character motivations and behaviour, and go on to unlock new cast abilities as you play.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We built a studio, we made a game, and I'm really proud of both. Before we close the doors at Midsummer Studios I'd like to share a glimpse of Burbank, the game we poured our hearts into.</p><p>It's like "Life Sims + The Truman Show," but it's more than that. I believe people are… <a href="https://t.co/RuYvDhdEZO">pic.twitter.com/RuYvDhdEZO</a></p></div>— Jake Solomon (@SolomonJake) <a href="https://twitter.com/SolomonJake/status/2024510423190430181?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The alluring part seems to be that you're not totally in control, which means your actors and characters have minds of their own, so finding out what they'll do when placed in certain situations becomes a key part of the game. You set their parameters and then watch to see what you've created.</p>
<p>Jake Solomon explained: "It's like 'Life Sims + The Truman Show', but it's more than that. I believe people are storytellers, and I want them to share whatever stories and characters they can dream up. Burbank lets you do that.</p>
<p>"We have moments playing this game where characters come alive in a way we've never experienced. And for an old game developer like me that's special [...] This game was a dream of mine, our team made it come true, so watch and dream with us."</p>
<p>He later added: "Our characters use AI for memory, reasoning and speech. That's what lets you create anyone you want and drop them in any story you write. But all of our art is created by our talented artists. We had no interest in replacing *any* developers with AI."</p>
<p>That is the only other comment he made.</p>

<p>It's a surprising announcement and it's sad, and it's also slightly strange in that it doesn't unequivocally state that this game's journey is over. The language used seems to suggest Burbank could live on, but if the studio is about to close, how could that be? Jake Solomon has given no previous indication the studio was in trouble. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jake-solomon-0247a037_midsummer-is-officially-a-game-changer-activity-7395096938137690112-Zc8d?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAUoxGIBcYD7dzkEFna_Jwj_cI4OhPmSEjo">His last post on LinkedIn</a>, made three months ago, had him saying he was "excited to share more about what we're building soon".</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-superheroes-to-soap-operas-xcoms-jake-solomon-unveils-first-details-of-his-new-studio-and-next-gen-life-sim">We last spoke to Solomon in 2024</a>, a couple of years after Marvel's Midnight Suns had charmed us, and after Solomon had left Firaxis to create his own studio and spin-up this new game idea. In that interview, he said Midsummer had been backed by venture capitalists and received funding from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> maker Krafton. I'm assuming that money has now run out. Solomon also talked more about the thinking behind Burbank, and the 'create your own stories' idea.</p>
<p>Marvel's Midnight Suns was released in 2022. It's a card-based, turn-based spin on creating your own Marvel superhero team - and Marvel superhero - and then saving the day. And very good it was too. "Great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse," wrote Christian Donlan in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Marvel's Midnight Suns review</a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft is laying off 40 employees at its Toronto studio, which is currently working on the company's long-in-the-works Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>In a statement shared with tech outlet <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/">MobileSyrup</a>, Ubisoft said this decision "was not taken lightly". It added it was not a reflection of the "talent, dedication, or contributions" of those impacted by the layoffs at the studio.</p>

<p>"Our priority now is to support them through this transition with comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance," Ubisoft said.</p>
<p>Despite these changes at Ubisoft Toronto, its Splinter Cell remake is still in development, the company confirmed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft first announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>As well as this remake, Ubisoft Toronto will also remain a "key contributor to several codev mandates and service teams", the company told MobileSyrup.</p>

<p>News of layoffs at the Toronto studio follows an announcement earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft was initiating a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>. This saw Ubisoft close two studios, cancel six projects - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sands-of-times-shock-cancellation-does-not-mean-we-are-stepping-away-from-the-franchise-says-remake-team">including its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> -  and delay seven games.</p>

            <p>It feels weird to buy a peripheral in order to play games you don't own. I'm generally very positive about the Nintendo Classics offered through the Nintendo Switch Online membership (and the classic Mega Drive games). I know I'll lose access if I stop subscribing, but it feels like a reasonable fee to get these on top of other benefits. But, just like I have never bought DLC for a game I don't own, I find the idea of needing to buy a peripheral to play the newly added Virtual Boy games a little hard to swallow.</p>
<p>We've written about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">Virtual Boy before on Eurogamer</a>, thanks to Alex feeling rather keen to throw his money away one night, so I won't bog this article down with more on the console other than to say it's such a bizarre creation that it feels rather exciting to get to play it today via the Switch consoles. A kind of portable you can only really play while sitting at a desk that offers a red and black 3D gaming experience via its in-built display, it's not something I ever imagined playing in my own home, yet here we are - and that's neat.</p>

<p>The aforementioned peripheral, then, is needed to create the 3D screen view that the original console offered - there's no way to play these games without the peripheral, which I understand but at the same time wouldn't see the harm in Nintendo offering 2D versions for those with more of a casual interest. An excellent fully modelled Virtual Boy replica (sans controllers) can be bought for £67, and if you'd rather not spend that much you can opt for a cardboard device of an original design for £17. Would I pay £67 for some plastic that becomes completely useless the moment I no longer subscribe to Switch Online + Expansion Pack? I don't think I would.</p><p>Would I fairly happily hand over £80 for the peripheral and all the games? That's a sweeter deal, and one I feel the hardcore audience interested in this out-there slice of Nintendo history would much prefer. Ultimately, for a retro collection like this an option to own every game on a single Switch cart would be the best scenario, and no doubt some would be willing to stump up the extra cost that would incur. Given Nintendo is planning to release two Virtual Boy games that were never on the original hardware, there's a real collector's angle to this project that doesn't feel fully realised via the way it's being distributed at the moment.</p>

<figcaption>This is what the original hardware looks like, and the peripheral is a great copy just without the controller.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is a bizarre thing to say on a website that reviews video games (calm down those of you at the back in the comments), but the quality of the games on offer for the Virtual Boy doesn't really matter. This is as much a piece of history as it is a form of entertainment, so had every game here been a complete stinker I'd have still argued that they are worth experiencing - but gladly there are some that deserve to be played for more than curiosity's sake.</p><p>Virtual Boy Wario Land comes with the reputation of being the best game on the system, and based on the seven games available right now I can't disagree. It's a tight side-scrolling platformer with the classic Nintendo feel that makes good use of the depth offered by the 3D visuals. While I reckon it would work fine in 2D (honestly, most of these games would be absolutely playable), the effects, as basic as they are, still manage to add a surprising amount of visual flair. It's got a banging soundtrack, too, which for some reason I wasn't expecting.</p>
<p>Of the other six available games, I've spent most time with Galactic Pinball, but I'm not sure if this is because it's a great game or if I just find the stationary pinball table easier on my eyes. I say "most time" but I should note here that the 'console' encourages you to take breaks pretty often, and I recommend it. I played Red Alarm (a wireframe graphics 3D futuristic aircraft shooter that is decent if rather odd to experience in the year 2026) for about 30 minutes, and returning to the real world was akin to when Neo got unplugged in The Matrix, but he also had a crooked neck because he had been forced into a completely ridiculous body position.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's really only Wario and Pinball that I've had the drive to dive back into, knowing that I'd come out the other side a little worse for wear. As I said, this whole Virtual Boy project for Switch is worth it for the time capsule experience (even more so in the UK where the console didn't hit stores), and no matter my issues with the way it's been released it's still a lot cheaper than buying a second-hand system and the games. The games yet to release seem more appealing to me, including Mario Clash, Mario's Tennis, Jack Bros, and the never released F-Zero racer Zero Racers, but we've got to wait a little for those to land.</p><p>All in all, I'm glad Nintendo has brought the Virtual Boy to Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, but it's not without its problems. From technical and practical points of view, the machine is uncomfortable, I had some problems seeing the whole display which forced me to reduce the game view size (although other people who tested it haven't had such issues), and I'm not in love with how you slot the Switch into the hard plastic peripheral - nothing bad has happened yet, but it feels like scratches could happen pretty easily.</p>
<p>I think you know if the cost of the Virtual Boy experience on Switch is something you're happy to pay. I kind of love the whole thing despite itself, which isn't so much giving the system and its lineup and free pass, but an acknowledgement of Nintendo's willingness to try something different. And I still can't help but feel happy this exists at all.</p>

            <p>Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy, and this year is no exception. One thing that does make this February's Pokémon Presents a little different, though, is that this year marks 30 years since Red and Green made their debut.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has been confirmed to air next week, on Friday 27th February at 2pm UK time. For those Pikachu fans across the pond, that's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.</p>
<p>As to what we can expect, well earlier today the company announced that the remakes of those classic Pokémon Game Boy games from 1996 will arrive on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 27th February. FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version - as these remakes are known in their Game Boy Advance versions - will be available exclusively to buy and download on Pokémon Day, once the broadcast has come to a close.</p>
<p>You can check out a little teaser trailer for the Switch editions of Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version below. Or, if you are keen, you can pre-order these games <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-FireRed-Version-3031207.html">via the Nintendo eShop</a>, where <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">they retail for £16.99</a>. </p>

<p>There's also the chance we will see more from Pokémon Pokopia, which is due to be released next month, on 5th March. Pokopia is Pokémon's take on Animal Crossing, and our Alex is already rather taken with the upcoming release.</p><p>"Mechanics I love mashed up with characters and a world I also have a great affinity for," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">Eurogamer's Pokémon Pokopia preview</a>. " I haven't felt this way about a Pokémon game since Conquest, the 2012 strategy crossover with Nobunaga's Ambition."</p>
<p>We will also probably hear about some updates for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>, Pokémon Sleep, Pokémon Unite and Pokémon EX Masters. Perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japans-pokemon-theme-park-is-opening-next-february-and-pikachus-popping-up-in-an-electric-pokemon-ride">something to do with the Pokémon park in Japan</a>? Our Lottie, though, is hopeful we will hear something about Gen 10.</p>
<p>What do you hope to see next week?</p>

<p>It was only last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-gets-its-first-big-post-launch-patch-on-steam-and-playstation-5-and-it-mostly-affects-progress-halting-bugs">Nioh 3 received its first major post-launch patch</a>, fixing progress halting bugs, crashes, and tweaking the health of some enemies. It also fixed the friend searching mechanic, which stopped working after a while. All in all, the game is in a decent state now with its rougher edges smoothed off.</p><p>If you've not picked up Nioh 3 yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">you can read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Dom Peppiatt wrote: "Innovation is the ki to success for Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, as Nioh 3 iterates on the formula once more to take an already great 'masocore' series to new heights."</p>

            <p>Despite calling Bluepoint Games "an incredibly talented team" full of "technical expertise" which has "delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community", Sony has decided to shut the studio down.</p>
<p>Last night, it was revealed that Bluepoint - the studio behind the widely praised Demon's Souls remake and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-nathan-drake-collection">Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection</a>, to name just two  - was being shut down by PlayStation. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint">Bloomberg</a>, around 70 employees will be impacted by the studio's shock closure, which will come into force in March. A spokesperson told the publication the decision was made "following a recent business review".</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The move comes five years after Bluepoint Games released Demon's Souls as a launch exclusive for the PS5. Since then, Sony - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">which acquired Bluepoint in 2021</a> - put the beloved and exceptionally talented studio to work on a live-service God of War game, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">project it ultimately cancelled last year</a>.</p>
<p>A reported response to Bluepoint's closure by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloomberg-playstation-is-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-demons-souls-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes.1440826/">Sony exec Herman Hulst said</a>: "As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within PlayStation Studios. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> launched to critical and commercial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and MLB The Show continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we're operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p>
<p>"To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We've taken a close look at our business to ensure we're delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March."</p><p>Hulst said this decision "was not made lightly", before rubbing more salt on the wound by calling Bluepoint "an incredibly talented team" whose "technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community". Hulst closed by stating he knew this news would come as a blow, but he is "confident" in the "direction" PlayStation is heading.</p>
<p>"Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for FY26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead," he said. "Thank you for your hard work and continued support."</p>
<p>Personally, I find the closure of Bluepoint absolutely devastating, and a real loss for the gaming industry. Sony's decision to put a studio renowned for its acclaimed remakes on a live-service project raised many an eyebrow, not just mine, with more than just a handful of fans hoping the company would use Bluepoint Games to revive other classic games from within the PlayStation library, namely PS4's Bloodborne. Putting the studio on a live-service project felt like a waste of talent, and a clear misdirection for the team's strengths.</p>

<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects including Bluepoint's God of War game cancelled.</p>
<p>Most prominently in recent years, Sony closed Firewalk Studios after its failed launch of live-service shooter Concord in 2024. Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>. The game had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">in the works for eight years</a>, it had been said.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">ceased work on its live-service The Last of Us multiplayer back in 2023</a>, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was cancelled</a> in 2024. In March of that same year, footage of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">cancelled co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - appeared online.</p>

            <p>
God of War actor Christopher Judge, the rumbling voice behind beardy Kratos, has suggested more news on the series' future could arrive "late summer".
</p>
<p>
Judge shared the information during a signing session at Canada's Fan Expo, where his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/RTJe0WGFuIM">words were captured</a> (it's unclear if was aware he was being recorded) by streamer Fuzhpuzy. In the video, Judge confirmed he won't be lending his vocal talents to Sony Santa Monica's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently announced God of War Greek trilogy remakes</a> - Kratos actor TC Carson will return for those, he claimed - but he did tease other news is coming.
</p>
<p>
According to Judge, who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kratos-is-now-played-by-stargate-sg-1s-christopher-judge">voiced Kratos since 2018's God of War</a>, fans will "be hearing about what we're doing probably late summer", suggesting Sony Santa Monica might be ready to unveil a follow-up to 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> later this year. That, though, is far from a certainty, and it's possible Judge is working  with the studio in another capacity.
</p>
<p>
As yet, the most substantial hint toward Sony Santa Monica's next project emerged last year, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier teased</a> the studio's "next big thing" - headed up by long-time God of War director and producer Cory Balrog - won't be a new IP, but "might feel like one".
</p><p>
"Maybe that's why people are confused," Schreier wrote in response to rumours surrounding the studio's next project. "Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum." He also noted "the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."
</p>
<p>
Could this be a radical reinvention of the God of War series or something else entirely? If Judge is correct, perhaps we'll learn more later this year. And what about Sony Santa Monica's "new IP", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">hinted at by a developer</a> last August? Mysteries upon mysteries! But until more is revealed, there's always Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">recently released spin-off Sons of Sparta</a> to sate your God of War needs. And don't forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">there's a TV show on the way</a> too.

            <p>If you're excited for Resident Evil: Requiem, you may want to stay clear of social media for a while, as leaks about the game's ending are popping up online.</p>
<p>Capcom is trying to curb the problem, taking down early spoilers for the survival horror release, but it's proving to be a struggle. On the Resident Evil Requiem Reddit, posts about the leak are being shared and discussed widely. This includes full story breakdowns, specific conversations around certain characters, and gameplay discussion. Steer clear!</p>
<p>This comes after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-early-copies-of-resident-evil-requiem-appear-in-the-wild-fans-warn-that-now-is-the-time-to-log-off-in-order-to-avoid-leaks">physical versions of the game were obtained early by some members of the public</a> earlier this week. The moment this happened, the clock started ticking towards a wave of unfettered story details spreading across the internet. Almost like some kind of virus. Umbrella would be proud.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, a continuation of the main-line story and Leon Kennedy's arc through the legendary horror franchise, sees him return to Racoon City to uncover some mystery still lurking in that ruined city. Grace, a new character to the series, also plays a key role as the game's second protagonist. All this was known about already from trailers and official releases. Take that and hide away from anything else!</p><p>If you want to get an idea of what the game is like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">Eurogamer previewed it earlier this year</a>. In it, Alex Donaldson wrote: "I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in. I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to launch on the 27th February, to the PS5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <p>
If you're anything like me, the second Nintendo announced it'd be giving select Switch 1 titles a fancy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> makeover, you probably immediately starting compiling a wish list. The Xenoblade series was high on mine, but remained persistently unloved. Until now that is! Out of nowhere, Nintendo just released an upgrade for last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition - and better still, it's available now.
</p>
<p>
Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as the new release is officially known, follows similar Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Some have been free, some (namely the ones with a bunch of additional content) have had a heftier price tag, while some updates have arrived with a nominal fee.
</p>

<p>
Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition falls into the latter camp, and owners of the Switch 1 version can upgrade to the new Switch 2 Edition for £4.19/$4.99 USD. And what does that get you? According to Nintendo, 4K and "up to" 60fps support in TV mode, plus 1080p and "up to" 60fps when playing in handheld mode. It doesn't sound like anything else is included, so you might well wonder why Nintendo hasn't followed previous form and provided this zero-content update for free (probably, money?).
</p><p>
Regardless, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Xenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-3026104.html">available on the eShop right now</a>, both as an upgrade and a full game. However, a physical Switch 2 edition is set to launch on 16th April, if you prefer your games small, red, and solid.
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, Eurogamer had good things to say about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">gave it four stars last year</a>, saying that while "not all its additions are for the better... this excavation of Monolith Soft's alien opus remains as fascinating and enthralling as it was a decade ago." Now do Xenoblade Chronicles 2 next Nintendo, please.

            <section><p>Styx: Blades of Greed isn't quite as well cut out as a fine piece of quartz, but it's easily the best stealth game in years - and so utterly compelling you'll be desperate to get back to it when you have to do boring un-murdery things like, I dunno, going to the shops, or feeding the cat.</p></section>
<p>Boy am I glad to see Styx again. Not because I felt any great yearning to return to the murky, Temu-Warhammer dark fantasy setting of long-forgotten RPG Of Orcs and Men, you understand. But because Blades of Greed represents an ever dwindling chunk of ore from that once rich seam of B-tier games that are just bloody good at what they do. The zenith of the "shorter games with worse graphics" category that people on Bluesky claim to want (and rarely seem to actively seek out, alas).</p>

<p>But don't let the lack of a studio-shuttering budget colour your expectations: Styx 3 is marvellous on almost every front. Picking up literally minutes after the cliffhanger ending of his last outing, 2017's Shards of Darkness, this latest installment throws a dash of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> into the pot, with the eponymous goblin assembling a crew of fellow outlaws, fugitives, and misfits on board a floating ship of thieves. The goal? Collect shards of quartz, a mysterious magical ore that is a crucial energy source for the evil human empire and its Inquisition, a ruthless wizard gestapo intent on eradicating the non-human races and generally not being that nice to humans either.</p>
<p>Stealing shards of quartz from all over the continent disrupts human operations and keeps the stuff out of Inquisition hands, but most importantly, it's a convenient device for weaving RPG-lite character progression into the narrative. Styx is effectively a drug addict, always laser-focused on getting his next hit of quartz, as absorbing it grants him magical abilities. These quartz-derived abilities, along with your innate goblin talents and a set of Batman gadgets are managed via skill trees. It's similar to the way a motivating heroin addiction makes you really good at pinching car radios.</p>

</figure>
<p>And it's a good core analogy for the entire thing: in a world-building sense, the Styx story is about a ravenous, ruinous empire addicted to conquest. In a meta sense, the game itself is astoundingly compelling: a Pringles can of objectives to methodically sneak, stab, and steal your way through that is more moreish than the Iberian peninsula.</p><p>It's a curious structure for a game with grand, open-world ambitions. Proudly touted as a true Metroidvania, Styx 3 is set across three vast and beautifully distinct murder playgrounds over which the all-important quartz shards are scattered. The Wall is your main stomping ground: a location previously depicted in Of Orcs and Men, which divides the continent between the realms of those races and is a sort of big, dirty hybrid of Hadrian's Wall, the old London Bridge, and the Burj Khalifa: a staggering, labyrinthine tangle of building regs violations, medieval bustle, and impossible verticality.</p>
<p>The second major location is Turquoise Dawn, a tangled alien jungle in which rests a fusion of Orcish tree city and wood-fashioned Imperial outpost: a feast for the eyes, and not at all similar to The Wall aesthetically or structurally, where you're much more likely to die from misadventure or bug attack. Lastly, the ruined tower of Akenash: the entire setting of the first Styx game, reimagined as a warped apocalypse zone full of magical abominations and roving bands of Dark Elves on the hunt for relics.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>NACON/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Akenash is especially interesting if you remember 2014's Styx: Master of Shadows, which I reviewed way back when and revisited a few weeks back in anticipation of this release. It's a fine example of a particularly marvellous thing that only video game sequels can do: the chance to explore an old stomping ground in a new context, warped by time (or magical disaster). The Akenash in Blades of Greed is recognisably a post-disaster remix of the original levels, now presented from angles previously unavailable via a series of floating islands and Styx's array of unlockable traversal options that are metered out over the course of the game's story and provide the Metroidvania part of this delicious genre cocktail.Batman's grapple, Link's glider, Corvo's blink… a bit of everything is borrowed to give Styx an expanding set of tools for accessing ever grander parts of each map, unfolding beautifully like an origami chicken in a deft example of measured, finely tuned pacing.</p><p>A set number of quartz shards must be collected to advance from each act to the next. This takes something that would be a side-objective in, say, a recent Assassin's Creed game and puts it front and centre: this is not a game about icon janitoring, but a tightly focused to-do list with an extraordinary amount of freedom in how you go about it. Over the course of the game I've stumbled across numerous alternate ways to get past particular obstacles. Many areas can be skipped entirely if you care to explore off the beaten path and make regular use of your "amber vision" (a detective mode dependent on amber, a liquid macguffin from the first game that is also a type of drug; Styx is a massive junkie).</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>NACON/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are five story acts in total, separated by linear, setpiece stages designed to tutorialise whatever new traversal gimmick you've just unlocked while allowing the game to showcase unique, one-shot areas as postcards of the wider world. This is, mercifully, not a full-on open world pivot for the series but its instanced, linear approach to widening and narrowing the scope at key intervals keeps things interesting, as well as making the world just feel larger than a true open world ever really manages.</p>
<p>What isn't as successful are the cutscenes. Necessary for plot transport, sure, but often comically naff: partly for annoying technical reasons that have plagued the Unreal engine since the Xbox 360 days to varying degrees, but mostly because the voice acting is about 50 percent wretched. Most of the line delivery is functional but lacking any sort of charisma or flair, like the performer would have the exact same inflection reading the shipping forecast. A good deal of it is simply dreadful, as horridly miscast and clumsily delivered as the average school play. Add to this the Unreal-ness of it all, that engine's particular difficulty with camera cuts (why are you redrawing the entire scene from scratch every time we change angles? Why?!), audio cues that ping in entirely the wrong places, and various other minor annoyances.</p>



<p>Luckily, the cutscenes don't form a high percentage of the experience, this isn't Metal Gear after all. In pure gameplay terms, Blades of Greed absolutely sings. Its traversal is a rush to the senses, a game where you cover large distances with death-defying stunts and acrobatic feats like impossible ledge-grabs and riding vortex-like air currents half way to the skybox and back. And then, slinking around the small spaces, ducking under tables, scampering up walls, slithering through drains, grabbing any and all of the burgeoning opportunities on offer to position yourself for the kill, or the snatch. The array of magical abilities on Styx's cheat sheet certainly make things fun, often inspiring the intense dopamine hit that comes when a game convinces you that you've gotten one over on the baddies. The rush of having planned and executed the perfect crime: a loosened chandelier here, a distraction there, a mind-controlled armoured guard puppeteered into plunging to his doom, why not? It's only amber.</p><p>And yet some of the most thrilling time you'll have with Styx is when you <em>don't </em>have the amber to spare. When you can't just Derren Brown your way around a problem. When you can't vomit up a clone to go and pull the lever while you stay in the rafters. Resources are scarce enough that on plenty of occasions, you are simply unable to deploy gadgets or special talents and must solve the current puzzle of getting past some guards in a room by utilising the very basic tools that you had before you even booted the game up: hiding, observing, patience, and timing. Every scrape can be survived and every puzzle can be solved with just these fundamentals, and every blunder into open conflict will get you killed. This is what makes Styx 3 a true stealth game, a proper stealth game, as distinct from the franchise bloat that has, for example, made Assassin's Creed into a straight up action RPG where the virtues of silence and shadow are paid a lot of lip service but ultimately are entirely optional.</p>

<p>Not so here. For those of us who frankly prefer all this sneaking around to a straight fight, Blades of Greed is the real deal, and despite a shift in the general direction of a more open world-ish experience it has, whether via creative restraint or the absence of an infinite budget, resisted the urge to load up on empty calories. Like the titular goblin himself, Styx 3 is smart, and lean. But it has also cracked the formula: previous Styx games relied far too much on reusing locations, which often felt stifling, and killed the sense of progress. What Blades of Greed manages to do with its Metroidvania sensibilities is craft a set of locations that you absolutely don't mind revisiting. I'll go further than that: when the set pieces and story cutscenes are done, they are a joy to return to.</p>
<p>And what this leads to is the conclusion that, not only is this the best Styx game by a wide margin, it's also the best stealth game in years. Styx, you horrid, grotty little git, I didn't realise how much I needed you back. Please don't wait a decade next time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-are-losing-the-attention-war-to-gambling-porn-and-crypto-according-to-industry-report</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-are-losing-the-attention-war-to-gambling-porn-and-crypto-according-to-industry-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new report by Epyllion, a gaming industry advisory company headed by venture capitalist and market guru Matthew Ball, has broken down the state of the video game industry, and has published data indicating the medium is losing the war for people's attention to other ventures, including gambling, crypto, and pornography.</p>
<p><a href="https://issuu.com/ballmatthew/docs/gaming2025_vee10?fr=xIAEoAT3_MzMz">The report</a>, a lengthy 164-page presentation which you can (and should) read yourself, dedicates a whole section called "Video Games are losing the attention war in the 'Major Market 8'" to the topic. It starts by comparing pre and post pandemic consumer spending from eight major video game markets - the USA, Japan, South Korea, UK, Germany, France, Canada, and Italy.</p>
<p>Prior to the pandemic, these countries made up over 60 percent of total spending on video games. Post-pandemic, almost all of these regions have seen a drop in gaming population. In the US, 2.5-4 points worth of players stopped playing video games, the Canadian Trade Association found in its latest report that roughly one-in-six players prior to the pandemic have stopped playing.</p>
<p>These decreases in participation have resulted, the report posits, in a drop in spending. In the US, PC and console spend is down eight percent since 2020 / 2021, which comes to roughly $2.3bn. Mobile gaming's US annual growth in terms of spending has largely flattened since 2025, but it's still above 12 percent compared to 2020, and now beats out console spend.</p><p>Total spend across all "Major Market 8" regions on console and PC shrunk by $4.8bn, and mobile is down by $2.3bn, all while five of these eight markets are at all-time highs in terms of total spend. This money is instead going elsewhere, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> for example, which the report states makes up 67 percent of net growth.</p>
<p>So that's a lot of dire-sounding figures, but why is this happening? Where is all this attention and money going? Well, chapter four of the report links this drop to multiple other mediums garnering people's attention. These are social video, creator pornography, AI assistants, crypto and memecoins, prediction markets, online sports betting, and igaming &amp; icasinos.</p>
<p>In just the US consumption of Tiktok is up 39m hours a day compared to pre-COVID figures. In the 2025, American consumers spent roughly $5bn on Onlyfans. Crypto currency too has been siphoning attention and money from video games according to the report. While its first boom happened during the pandemic video game boom, its second rise in popularity among the public happened in 2025 while the video game industry stagnated.</p>
<p>During this 2025 period, AI apps that allowed for "role play, erotica, and art" have soared. The latest tracked statistic for installs for this software came to just under one billion worldwide.</p>
<p>Prediction markets, where users can bet on events that happen in the world, also had a recent boom in popularity. Users placed 1.5m bets a day during Q4 2025. Online Sports Betting is also taking potential users' money. In 2025, US net losses due to sports betting passed $17bn, a 35x increase from 2019 as these sorts of services become normalised, legalised, and integrated into sports in the USA. Despite bans in other countries, international net losses are around $53bn a year.</p><p>iGaming, which include online casinos, are yet another avenue from gambling which the report raises as an alternative path of gamer's money. iGaming is twice the size of the mobile casino game category in terms of growth, and 21 percent of <strong>all</strong> US video game spend. Worldwide, gamers lose $54bn a year in legal iGaming, which accounts for 45 percent of global gaming spending.</p>
<p>The report states: "Video Gaming's post-pandemic problem isn't that players choose to watch TikTok instead of buying a AAA game, or subscribe to Onlyfans instead of buying a PlayStation; it's that on a Friday evening, players are placing a growing share of their time and spend <em>elsewhere</em>."</p>

            <p>Floundering PvP shooter Highguard lives on, as developer Wildlight releases a new content update and assures worried fans that ominous signs like the game's website going offline are "low priority" problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">The new content update</a>, released overnight, adds an airship-featuring base to the game, a lockpick raid tool, and expands what's on sale in the Store. There's an owlbear-like mount there called a Moonbruin, and some Iron Vigil-themed outfits.</p>
<p>The patch arrives amidst growing concern that Highguard is about to shut down - an assumption that follows a bad start for the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">resulting in lay-offs at Wildlight</a>, and more recently, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the game's website suddenly going offline</a>. (It's still offline, by the way.)</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Q286nJoqI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>But Wildlight remains outwardly resolute despite these setbacks, insisting in the game's Discord overnight that the website issue is nothing sinister. "Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified," explained Wildlight staff member WL_Coronach (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2024081430674800915/photo/2">screenshotted by CharlieIntel</a>). "Low priority atm (reputational damage already done). Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve."</p>
<p>These comments follow a statement sent to Eurogamer earlier this month, regarding the layoffs, in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildguard said a "core group of developers" would remain to support Highguard</a>, and that the game wasn't about to close.</p>
<p>Highguard's had a hard time ever since closing The Game Awards in December. Despite the prominence of such an announcement and the proximity of a January release date, the game remained almost invisible until release, suggesting there were problems. Then when Highguard did finally arrive - a game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> pedigree - it failed to convince. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">"We were turned into a joke from minute one," former Highguard developers said</a>.</p>
