            <p>It takes approximately two minutes before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> shows you two cats, somewhat ironically, raw-dogging it. Within seconds, an oozing kitten is shot skidding onto the carpet, a car crash of various traits from its poorly-groomed parents. It will, in a matter of days, become a mage that can cast fireballs. It will also develop feline AIDS.</p>
<p>That, as a tone setter, is Mewgenics. Itself the lovechild of Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, the game is crass and violent, gross and off-putting. It is also a ludicrously deep turn-based RPG, a devilishly funny adventure rooted in the raw depiction of cats, and to me a frankly-heartwarming message on the value of even the most abhorrent creatures.</p>
<p>I have battled through haunted graveyards and dark caves within a handful of hours. I have battled zombie kittens, hippos with heart problems, and literal shit. Even within this narrow sliver of the game, though, you see the sheer possibility of Mewgenics vastly expand. This preview has been like peeking through a crack in the door.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> creator's latest, you gather up a party of four cats, and assign each a class. This could be a tank, a rogue, a fighter: each benefit from certain stats a cat may have. My cat, Catsune Miku (randomly generated, thank you) has lots of intellect, so I make her a mage. Miku gains a basic fireball spell, but also has a passive ability which is part of who they are. Maybe they inherited it from their parents, maybe they just have it. In Miku's case, her burns are stronger. Convenient! Let's say you have another cat - Fred - who is tough but stupid. You make Fred the tank.</p><p>These are somewhat basic examples but you can create some truly monstrous synergies right here. If you spot a cat with a passive that boosts minions, you can give them items that spawn or further boost minions, and snowball a cat into a powerful archetype in the run.</p>
<p>So you go off on your adventure through the city streets, which start linear as you progress down a sequence of tiles with various events present. You land on a loot space, granting a stone that improves your intellect - great find! You slap it on Miku because, in combat, intellect determines how much mana you regenerate a turn. You also get a headbrace that increases toughness but drastically lowers intellect. Fred is now a brick wall, but his intellect stat has fallen below zero so sadly can no longer read. Swings and roundabouts.</p>
<p>You come across random events, too! These are RPG-style skill checks which pick out one of your four cats and have them face a dilemma of some sort. Miku finds some money on the ground and is smart enough to pick it up. Fred later has the same opportunity, but is so stupid the text is jumbled leaving you unable to determine which option is the right one. You pick wrong and Fred gets hurt. Money, items, stat boosts, and food are the main resources you're hunting for as you progress through Mewgenics.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>You finally arrive at a battle, and this is where Mewgenics gets bananas. You're dropped onto a grid made up of squares on which you can move, attack, and generally cause mayhem. Your squad is placed down on one side, as are foes and miscellaneous junk, food, poo, etc. Early on these enemies are simple - fat rats, other cats, maggots, and flies. This so far is a gross-but-standard TRPG battle system, and should be of no surprise coming from McMillen himself.</p><p>However, it's the environment and item systems that take Mewgenics to another level here. Let's say Miku throws a fireball at an enemy and sets some nearby grass on fire. Fred, in melee range, can use an ability or equipped weapon to push an enemy into this inferno. Or let's say an ice spell is used instead. This grass then becomes sharp grass, which again acts as a hazard.</p>
<p>Items and abilities interact with the environment so ravenously that it kept me constantly thinking about inventive ways to interact with the battles I'm in, beyond just killing all the enemies with the spells and attacks at my disposal. The closest, admittedly ham-fisted, comparison I can think of is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-original-sin-review">Divinity: Original Sin</a> and its similarly obsessive passion for messing with your surroundings. Mewgenics even goes so far as to change bosses depending on random weather conditions, giving them entirely different move lists. Wild.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>After beating these enemies Miku levels up, providing you with a selection of four active abilities or passives to choose from. Here's where you evolve your build on the fly, doubling-down on your original approach or pivoting to a different strategy depending on the whims of chance. Miku is offered a passive that improves her damage when at full mana, which means her first turn will be spent not casting her fireball so she can hit that limit and nab the buff.</p><p>You pass a fork in the road: the easy path or the hard path. Each level I played had this choice available, tempting you with honeyed loot locked behind tougher fights. You take a chance and go for it. The good news: you get a shotgun, which Fred loves. The bad news: Miku is downed in one of these tougher fights. This doesn't mean she's dead, it just means she's suffered a broken leg and a permanent decrease in dexterity.</p>
<p>Despite this, you eventually reach the end of the level, and beat the boss. Now you can choose whether to continue on to another level, or head home with your loot. You head home, taking your ill-gotten gains with you. Your food and money is stored away and your cats can relax at home, retired.</p>
<p>After ending the day, Fred and Catsune Miku have sex and a kitten is born. It inherits Miku's burn boost passive, which is lovely. Miku can then be kept in your home base - a disgusting house filled with rancid cats - or sent off to one of many NPCs who will give you permanent unlocks, side quests, and other goodies in exchange. But it doesn't have to go that way. Maybe Miku has twins, what a score! Maybe she's asexual, or just doesn't get on with Fred at all. Maybe she gets permanently disfigured in a fight with Fred, or maybe she's just gay? All of these are possible, and all of these have significant consequences to how you approach your next excursion in Mewgenics.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>It sounds like a lot, because it is a lot. I can only promise you that the game does hold your hand through the learning process. Even if all your cats die, a stray cat will show up at your house every day. Despite its complexity, Mewgenics (at least in its opening chapter) is not an overly challenging game. It's mostly balanced upon how well you can exploit your cats' strengths, and as such your task as the player is to identify how to best use your gaggle of horrid little furballs.</p><p>What McMillen and Glaiel have done with Mewgenics is create a game about cats duking it out in which there is no such thing as a useless cat, and they've done so in a game where you can truly do horrific things to your cats. You can have a disfigured, unlovable cat, who is too stupid to read and cursed with some horrid, inherited disease. Some would look at that cat and see garbage, but look closer and you'll see that cat is hella tough. That useless cat looks like a five-star tank to me!</p>
<p>And with that we arrive at what I feel is a powerful message at the heart of Mewgenics, especially as someone who owns a cat: cats are not purfect princes who do no wrong. They can be loud, messy, greedy things. And yet, every good cat owner will tell you that in spite of these quirks and genuine harrowing problems, they do still love their cat. They see the qualities their cat has, beyond all the issues.</p>
<p>That is the heart of Mewgenics, both in its opening narrative and overall design. Every freak cat that crawls to your door has the potential to run a blazing streak through the game given enough love and attention. They can fend off ghosts and spiders and venture out into the desert, or maybe defend your home from outside intrusions. Once they've returned, it doesn't matter how much they've been beaten up, they will have a home with an NPC. Even past their prime they have value. That, I feel, is a pretty powerful message. Even in a game swirling in toilet humour. In fact, maybe <em>because</em> of it.</p>
<p>In case you can't tell, I came away deeply excited for Mewgenics. When my preview access was taken away I was distraught. It looks to be an absolute banger. After years-upon-years of development, I can only hope that the developer duo can nail the landing on what could be a bombshell release next year.</p>
<p>Mewgenics will be launching on 10th February, 2026 on PC.</p>

            <p>Remember that trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> 4, which made the rounds last week? Well, I am sorry to say it was indeed unofficial after all, and Ys Net is now considering legal action against the uploader.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, Ys Net said last week's trailer - which clocked in at over four minutes - has "absolutely no connection" to the studio. Its logo was used "without permission", Ys Net said, "falsely giving the impression that it is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us".</p>

<p>"We recognise that the unauthorised use of our logo, and any act that misleads viewers into believing such content is official, constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition," Ys Net continued.</p>
<p>"We are currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action".</p>
<p>While Ys Net does not actually own the Shenmue IP, with that honour belonging to Sega, the studio apologised to its community for the confusion last week's trailer may have caused. Let's be honest, it surely raised more than just a few hopes (I mean, last year fans of the series went so far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">rent out a billboard in New York's Time Square to campaign for a fourth game</a>).</p>
<p>"We will continue to ensure the proper and accurate dissemination of information, and we ask for your understanding and cooperation," Ys Net's statement on the fake trailer closed.</p>
<p>As for the offending trailer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/real-or-ai-fake-suspicious-off-screen-shenmue-4-trailer-sparks-excited-debate">it followed Shenmue protagonist Ryo as he went about various around-the-town jobs</a>, such as washing dishes and arm wrestling. Many were sceptical about its legitimacy from the off, though, with the video coming from an unknown and unvalidated YouTube source with very few followers.</p><div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a> resurrected the RPG series in 2019, and our former editor Martin Robison was rather taken with it all. "A bewitching time capsule that transports us to late 80s China, and to turn-of-the-century video games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">Eurogamer's Shenmue 3 review</a>.</p>

<p>"We've created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games," the Kojima Productions head told <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735">ananweb</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/">Automaton</a>). As well as Death Stranding 1 and 2, the developer is also best known for the Metal Gear series.</p>
<p>But for the horror-flavoured OD, he continued, the studio is "trying to change the service model from the ground up", with Kojima adding "it should be quite challenging".</p>
<p>That all being said, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-and-xbox-team-up-to-show-off-more-od-knock">OD developer did say the recent trailer was "packed" full of hints</a>. "So if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out", he closed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">OD was first announced back in 2023</a>, though Kojima stopped short of actually telling us all that much more about it at the time. Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer are both tied to the project, and there is also some involvement from director Jordan Peele, who is known for his films Get Out and Nope.</p><p>Otherwise, Kojima said it's "a game and at the same time a movie and at the same time a new form of media", so make of that what you will. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">Kojima recently admitted he was sure plenty of people will hate OD</a>, but he is ok with that in the short term.</p>

            <p>Speculation is still brewing around the demonic statue <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> has planted in the Mojave desert ahead of The Game Awards this week, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> studio CI Games is the latest to chip in.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">Keighley teased the statue at the start of the month</a> with the words "regal.inspiring.thickness", and its demonic lights and skeletal figures had fans guessing which game it was related to, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and God of War being top guesses.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-still-surrounds-keighleys-demon-statue-ahead-of-the-game-awards-as-diablo-4-and-god-of-war-teasers-ruled-out">these were ruled out a day later</a>, with further guesses including Sony's forthcoming shooter Saros, or even Doom. Other studios have even jumped on the bandwagon, with <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1995971888464687211">Devolver quipping</a>: "We made it out of the bones of most of our interns and the remaining interns put it in the desert".</p>

<p>Perhaps the best evidence we have for the statue is a new reply from The Game Awards account, which states: "The [blank] are silent. [Blank] bleeds. New [blank] stir." What could it mean? </p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The █████ are silent. █████ bleeds. New █████ stir.</p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1996993470322692176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>CI Games founder and CEO Marek Tyminski has now stepped in, not because the statue is related to the studio's forthcoming Soulslike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a>, but because the studio hopes it's related to something from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> maker FromSoftware.</p><p>"Flattered so many think we're behind that statue," Tyminski wrote on social media. "Can confirm it's not us, we're just as hyped as you are. Devs are praying it's something From. Huge respect to them and we dream of reaching that level one day."</p>
<p>Tyminski added "big news" is on the way for both Lords of the Fallen and its sequel, adding: "We've listened. Soon it's time to reveal."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Flattered so many think we’re behind that statue 😅 Can confirm it’s not us, we’re just as hyped as you are.

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>So could it really be something from FromSoftware? The DLC for Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign has already been released, and the statue doesn't look related to either the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition or Switch 2 exclusive The Duskbloods, both due next year.</p>
<p>More likely, Tyminski is simply hoping for some positive attention in aligning the studio's work with that of FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen released back in 2023 and received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">two star review from Eurogamer</a>. While the studio has put in work to improve its poor launch day performance, it remains an unoriginal imitator of FromSoftware's Dark Souls games.</p>

            <p>The team behind Amazon's Fallout TV show hopes to begin shooting the third series this coming summer, with the goal to release new seasons as fast as possible.</p>
<p>That's coming from the series' executive producer, Jonathan Nolan. "With regards to production, we're hoping to be shooting again next summer," Nolan said in an interview with IGN (video below), before quipping: "We'll see if that all comes together, best laid plans, and all."</p>

<p>The executive producer said he believes the "scope" of the Fallout show remains "undiminished season to season", and the cast and crew were all able to "work quickly enough" to get the second series "back on the air in a reasonable amount of time".</p>
<p>And, it seems this zippy way of doing things is something Nolan and the team want to continue.</p>
<p>"I think what's happened with television in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season is an unfortunate trend," Nolan said. "You don't want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that we'd like to be back on the air as soon as we can."</p>
<p>You can check out the full chat with Nolan and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet below.</p>

<p>Production on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">Fallout's second season began in November last year</a>, and that December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins shared a close up of the show's prosthetic team applying the Ghoul's leathery, nuclear worn skin</a>. Filming paused for a period following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">devastating wildfires which raged across multiple districts of Los Angeles and shut down production across Hollywood</a>.</p>
<p>But even with this setback, the second season of Fallout is still airing a little over a year after filming first began. Its third season, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">was confirmed back in May of this year</a>.</p>

<p>The second season of Fallout will be heading to Amazon Prime on 17th December.

            <p>Katsuhiro Harada, has announced his departure from Bandai Namco having worked on the Tekken series for 30 years.</p>
<p>"I'd like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025," he wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I've devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas. I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.</p>
<p>"The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator. Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the centre of my identity. And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars. Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi - whom I respect as though he were another father - and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p><p>"Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects - VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</p>
<p>"To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>"I'll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything."</p>
<p>If you've been following Harada's outspoken comments over the past few years, this may not come as much of a surprise: the Tekken boss has made a few suggestions that his future may not rest within the walls of the Japanese publisher. First up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">he had a 'looking for work' tag on his LinkedIn page</a>, leading people to speculate that he was looking for the door in his current place of work.</p><p>Then, earlier this year, Harada spoke to Eurogamer about what a future without him would look like at Bandai Namco. "[I] feel over the past 30 years the gameplay has been polished and everything is in place, so it's much easier to continue with someone else," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekkens-harada-isnt-worried-about-his-future-absence-damaging-the-series-wont-be-hard-to-continue-with-someone-else">he told Connor Makar at Evo 2025</a>. "[Producer Michael Murray and I are] public figures for Tekken, sure. Compared to other people outside of the company - and this is [my] personal opinion not the official stance of Bandai Namco - it really depends [on the game]. There are other games out there - even fighting games - where there is no public figure to attach to it."</p>
<p>In the same interview, Murray also mentioned that he may have 'only one Tekken game left in him', so it feels like there could be a potential shift in the franchise as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> continues to grow and people start to think about what Tekken 9 (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> 3) could look like.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been the source of a lot of controversy ever since launch. Alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-receives-emergency-patch-in-response-to-season-two-balancing-backlash">a series of emergency patches</a> that had to be issued by the developer to appease irritated fans, there was also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-reneges-on-its-controversial-dlc-rollout-but-is-it-too-little-too-late">a glut of controversy</a> surrounding the game and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-street-fighter-6-monetization-hurdle">its DLC methods</a>, which Harada - in typical fashion - was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-community-up-in-arms-over-plans-to-add-premium-currency-to-game-post-launch">very outspoken about</a>.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about the game losing its identity without the dynamic, public-facing duo, fret not: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> was the first game in the series for years that didn't include much input from Yoshinori Ono, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-figurehead-yoshinori-ono-leaves-capcom-after-nearly-30-years">who also left Capcom after 30 years with the company</a>. Street Fighter 6 has been a massive success, however, proving that there is life in these storied fighting games - even without the notable figureheads leading the charge with the crowd-facing side of development.</p>

            <p>The European Top 20 didn't welcome any new entries last week, but Black Friday week saw a boost in sales nonetheless thanks in no small part to Sony, which was seemingly the MVP of Black Friday, hoovering up 62 percent of all console sales in the UK over the week.</p>
<p>The data – supplied by NielsenIQ and GSD, and published by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> – showed that console sales were much stronger this holiday period, with revenue up 14 per cent, and unit sales up 7 percent.</p>

<p>And while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> took a sizeable 23 percent chunk of all hardware sales, it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> that had its best week outside of launch. Xbox Series S and X accounted for just 10 percent of all console sales, possibly because Xbox consoles were discounted by around 8 percent on the typical price, but PS5 Slim consoles were down 21-34 percent depending upon the model.</p>
<p>Accessory sales, however, were down 17 percent when compared to the same period last year, as did joypad  and headset sales, which tumbled by 27 and 28 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>And while both the Meta Quest 3 and the PS5 VR headsets enjoyed their best weeks of the year, overall, VR headset sales dropped by around 7 percent, too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida-admits-it-would-be-difficult-for-japanese-developers-to-make-games-in-the-same-way-mihoyo-does">Japanese studios "can't replicate" the speed at which games are produced in China</a>, suggesting Chinese studios can hire more people "who can work long hours".</p>
<p>"Back when I talked to representatives of miHoYo, we discussed how it would be quite difficult for Japanese developers to make games in the same way miHoYo does. Not to mention the legal problems that would come with it," Yoshida said.</p>

            <p>UK developer Three Fields Entertainment - the studio behind the likes of Dangerous Golf and Dangerous Driving - says it has been "forced" into placing its "entire team on notice of redundancy" because publisher THQ Nordic has shown no "enthusiasm or financial support to continue development" of its latest title, Wreckreation.</p>
<p>Three Fields Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dangerous-driving-devs-wreckreation-is-an-open-world-racer-with-a-diy-focus">unveiled Wreckreation back in 2022</a>. A custom-content-focused open-world racer, it released on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox in October this year. Now, however, in a heartfelt message posted to X/Twitter, CEO Fiona Sperry said that it was "a heartbreaking moment for all of us", but hoped that by going public, "someone out there might also see the potential" in Wreckreation.</p>

<p>"Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard – with heart and dedication – to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project," Sperry wrote.</p>
<p>"But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future.</p> <div>

<p>"We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post-launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful."</p>
<p>Because of claims it has had to self-fund, Sperry added that the studio cannot be sustained and it "will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future," (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/wreckreation-developer-puts-its-entire-staff-on-notice-as-publisher-thq-nordic-abandons-it-we-simply-cannot-sustain-the-studio-in-its-current-form/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>

            <p>Iam8bit is suing Skybound Games for £2.9 million ($4 million), alleging breach of contract, fraudulent expenses, theft of designs, and claiming that Skybound used iam8bit's trade secrets to cut it out of a Stray deal.</p>
<p>Iam8bit – which entered into a partnership with Robert Kirkman's game studio, Skybound, in 2021 – alleges Skybound failed to provide its contractually obligated monthly reports, and "padded its expenses with millions of dollars in fake line items".</p>

<p>After Skybound was reportedly unable to provide evidence of the line items to a third-party auditor, 8bit has now filed a breach-of-contract complaint with the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p>In the complaint seen by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/iam8bit-is-suing-skybound-game-studios-alleging-fraud-and-theft-of-designs-000822886.html">Engadget</a>, iam8bit similarly claims that after designing promotional materials for the launch of Stray, Skybound used iam8bit's materials to secure its own deal for the Nintendo Switch port, intentionally cutting the latter out while using "almost exact copies" of 8bit's marketing materials.</p>
<p>Iam8bit also claims Skybound used confidential information about 8bit's royalty split with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> to cut it out of the deal.</p>
<p>In all, iam8bit is suing for breach of contract, fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation. It's seeking real and punitive damages totalling $4 million. Neither company has publicly commented on the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>A noted leaker claims there's a "big" Star Wars announcement on the way, hinting the game's title ends "The Old Republic".</p>
<p>Kurakasis, a video game researcher and notable leaker who has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-believe-they-know-what-machinegames-indiana-jones-game-is-called">correctly leaked announcements ahead of time before</a>, first <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1996337045921493050">teased</a> the news last week, stressing that the "big Star Wars game" has "nothing to do with Star Wars: Zero Company or Eclipse", two Star Wars-flavoured games already announced.</p>

<p>Then, over the weekend, the leaker turned it up a notch and alleged the title of the game "ends with The Old Republic", appending a wide-eyed emoji.</p> <div>

<p>As many are speculating on in the comments on X/Twitter, thoughts immediately turn to Saber Interactive's long-in-the-works and reportedly troubled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> remake. In March, the team broke its silence to assure us that it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-kotors-troubled-remake-still-coming-suggests-studios-latest-comments">still on the way</a>, telling us, "Everything that we have talked about is still in development", but it's been pretty quiet ever since.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, the leaker clearly uses the word "announcement", intimating it's either huge news about an existing game... or a revelation about one we don't yet know about.</p>
<p>That's possibly why some fans hope it will be a single-player Old Republic game. But without any formal word from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/lucasfilm-games">Lucasfilm Games</a>, it's probably best not to get your hopes up just yet. With The Game Awards just days away, though, we may finally get to see more later this week. Watch this space.</p><p>Admittedly, there hasn't been much information about any of the Star Wars games currently in development lately, either, but in October, Quantic Dream assured us that it was still developing Star Wars: Eclipse, the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first revealed in 2021</a>. In October 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">development was said to be "simmering"</a>, while earlier this year, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">confirmed the studio was not impacted by cuts at NetEase</a> and development continued "at full pace".</p>
<p>Go just a little further back, and EA finally gave us our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-gritty-and-authentic-story-coming-to-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-in-2026">first look at its upcoming Star Wars strategy game, Star Wars: Zero Company back in April</a>. The single-player turn-based tactics game by Bit Reactor and Respawn was confirmed back in 2022, described as a "gritty and authentic original story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars".</p>

            <p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a joyous game to play, that much I'll tell you up front. Made by Tribute Games and Dotemu it's a proper romp in classic beat 'em up style. Waves of goons assault you from both sides as you punch, kick, and blast your way through. It's radical, and I mean that in the era-appropriate meaning of the word. In fact, I'm starting to feel strongly that Marvel games are best when radical.</p>

<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is as much a classic style side scrolling action game as it is as hand-written sonnet to the comics and cartoons of times long past. Characters slap on the 'ol spandex,  Iron Man soars through levels in hot red and yellow, She Hulk charges through the monitor with a one-two punch of green and purple. The eyes are pleased, the ears perk up to bitpop tunes and all is right with the world.</p>
<p>The story, too, is a cartoon level deep cut. Your team of Marvel heroes battle against Annihilus, who assaults earth from the Negative Zone with an army of otherworldly forces at his back. It's all very Yesterday's X-Men, a reminder of older joys. You're thrust into the arms of a space-faring adventure and you don't care that it's all a bit rushed. She-Hulk shouts "catch these hands" as they elbow drop from the top of the screen and enemies are sent sprawling across the floor. Ghost Rider, packing a glass space helmet for his skull face, rides a motorbike across the screen with blazing blue tires. A little cheesy? Sure. But who cares? It's fun.</p>

<p>God. I'm so thankful Marvel is fun again. With this, Marvel Rivals, and Marvel Tokon, the franchise has unchained itself from big-budget movies and triple-A cinematic aesthetics that can rob the franchise of its vigour. What do I mean by that? Marvel at its best is <em>meant</em> to be cheesy, cartoonish. Its characters can lose all charm when you strip their roots away from them. Marvel Cosmic Invasion is the opposite: I've had a bigger grin on my face playing Iron Man here than I've had in any other Marvel game over the past ten years.</p><p>It's strange too, because I've not got a particularly strong personal connection to the era of Marvel that Cosmic Invasion is holding up on a pedestal here. I'm 27 years old, which means I never really got to play the arcade classics. I remember playing a bit of Michael Jackson's Moonwalker, maybe? But even so, I can look at the classics and see the connection, I can see hallmarks of the genre, and see how they've been championed here.</p>

<figcaption>I don't care who you are, this is super cool. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The thing is, so true is Marvel Cosmic Invasion's love for this era that you get a sort of phantom nostalgia playing it. I get it. The game takes you on a ride, and if you stick your hands up and scream like you're meant to, you're taken back to a time you could never actually remember.</p>
<p>You just can't get that feeling if you simply try to emulate the super hero movies. I'm so glad that games like Marvel Cosmic Invasion are still coming out and representing a style of hero media that treats those heroes as what they are. I'd recommend it to anyone, young or old, with real nostalgic memories or mere phantom ones, just as a reminder of what these characters, what these stories, are all about.</p>

            <p>Mob Entertainment has dropped another new cinematic trailer to whet our collective appetites for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 5.</p>
<p>It's one of those blink-and-you-miss-it affairs - it's not even a minute long - but it does give a flavour of what we can expect from Mob Entertainment's gargantuan mascot horror series, including another shadowy glimpse of the mysterious Prototype and our first look at an all-new character that may or may not be a new villain that some fans are calling Lilly Lovebraids.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's no release date accompanying this teaser - just a request to wishlist it on Steam and Epic Games Store - but the speed at which Mob is churning out teasers suggests it could be here sooner rather than later.</p><p>The prior chapter, called Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, predictably enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January of this year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-coming-to-consoles-this-month">on consoles in the summer</a>, which also makes January 2026 a timely opportunity to drop its successor. Watch this space.</p>
<p>In May of last year, the studio announced that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works</a> with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time. "This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has suggested that Japanese studios "can't replicate" the speed at which games are produced in China, suggesting Chinese studios can hire more people "who can work long hours".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/966/G096641/20251205009/">4Gamer</a>, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-says-japanese-studios-are-unlikely-to-replicate-the-production-scale-and-speed-of-chinese-games-like-genshin-or-honkai-star-rail/">Automaton</a>, Yoshida shared his impressions of the Chinese industry, saying: "the development speed in China is amazing [and] they’re also quick at changing personnel, and all of the game development work itself unfolds rapidly".</p>

<p>"Back when I talked to representatives of miHoYo, we discussed how it would be quite difficult for Japanese developers to make games in the same way miHoYo does. Not to mention the legal problems that would come with it," Yoshida said.</p><p>"I wonder if there are some aspects [of the development process] that Japanese game developers just can't replicate. One reason why games in China are so strong is because they are made in an environment which allows for hiring a large number of personnel who can work long hours.</p>
<p>"Of course, you never know what might happen in the near future, but looking at the current state of things, I think that's the biggest factor."</p>
<p>Last month, a number of Japanese publishers, including Bandai Namco, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and others came together as part of CODA (Content Overseas Distribution Association) to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">request Open AI cease training AI video generation tool Sora 2 on their collective creative works</a>.</p>
<p>The statement to Open AI, <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">made public via a statement published on the CODA website</a>, requests that CODA members' works are not used for machine learning without prior permission.</p>

            <p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda would love to bring back the found-footage survival-horror game Michigan: Report from Hell, either as a sequel or a remake.</p>
<p>The original, released in Japan in 2004 as Michigan, was not released in the US, although a dubbed version was released in Europe the following year, with the "Report from Hell" added to the PAL title.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/suda51-says-he-wants-to-bring-back-this-forgotten-ps2-game-hopefully-sooner-rather-than-later/">VGC</a>, Suda was asked if the age of social media had ever given the producer pause to reconsider bringing Michigan to a new audience, to which he replied, "hopefully sooner rather than later".</p>

<p>"As far as Michigan goes, that's something that I would definitely like to revisit or bring back in some form at some time," Suda said, who was reportedly inspired by Stephen King's The Mist.</p>
<p>"And so if possible, I hope I'll be able to speak with Spike Chunsoft and make it a reality somehow, hopefully sooner rather than later. But yeah, that's something that I've been wanting to go back to for a while."</p><p>Hotel Barcelona, the side-scrolling slasher movie parody from Suda51 and Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda51-and-swerys-25d-slasher-parody-hotel-barcelona-delayed-into-next-year">delayed from 2024 to September 2025</a> so developer White Owls could "keep polishing it and making it better". It's currently sitting on a 'Mixed' Steam user score.</p>

<p>Based on "one of the greatest video games of all time", Fallout is described as the story of "haves and have-nots in a world in which there's almost nothing left to have".</p>
<p>"200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them above," the blurb teases.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">The Fallout TV show has already been renewed for a third season</a>, which certainly means we won't be finished with this cast anytime soon. However, what'll actually happen this season remains a tantalising mystery. How the show will change the pre-existing cannon established in the beloved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, if it does at all, is the most pressing wonder among fans of the video game series.</p><p>We know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">Walton Goggins (who plays The Ghoul) thinks Season 2 is pretty good,</a> which is a positive sign. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/walton-goggins-celebrates-wrapping-fallout-season-two-by-peeling-off-his-skin">It was only back in May that he peeled off his skin in celebration of the second season wrapping up filming</a>.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-cambridge-audio-evo-one-all-in-one-system-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-cambridge-audio-evo-one-all-in-one-system-review</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-cambridge-audio-evo-one-all-in-one-system-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
        

        <p>This all-in-one music system packs style and power in a neat package.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>The Cambridge Audio Evo One isn't usually the sort of product I cover, but I felt intrigued when they listed 'gaming' as a potential feature of a dear <a href="https://www.cambridgeaudio.com/gbr/en/products/evo/evo-one" rel="sponsored">£999</a>/<a href="https://www.cambridgeaudio.com/usa/en/products/evo/evo-one" rel="sponsored">$1499</a> all-in-one music system. This is a product that's more classic hi-fi than gaming soundbar, but with 14 speakers inside and compatibility with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-4k-tvs-for-hdr-gaming-7009">best gaming TVs</a>, it's actually a pretty powerful option that's worth knowing about. </p>
<p>In terms of looks, the Evo One reminds me of a modernised version of old hi-fi cabinets from the 1970s, pairing a large 6.8-inch IPS display on the front and a removable black surround fabric grille with a walnut finish on top. It's just the right blend of old and new to fit just about anywhere.</p>
<p>Weighing in at 14.5kg and measuring 67.5cm wide means you'll need somewhere robust and sturdy to match the speaker's high-quality finishing – mine has been living on my dining room sideboard for musical purposes, and it'll just about fit under my 32-inch monitor on a desk for gaming. The speaker actually sits on a recessed stand, so it's raised slightly off the ground - another nice touch.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Upside down? Yup, the labels are oriented so you can read them while leaning over the unit from above. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The large screen is very useful for at-a-glance information about the music you're listening to, plus it can display everything from VU meters to album artwork, and it can also work as a clock. The selection of buttons beneath the screen handles more menial tasks, such as volume control, track seeking and more besides. They are a little cheap feeling against the smooth, slick lit-up dial and touchscreen combo you'll find on the competitive Naim Mu-So 2, but they work well enough.</p><p>Connectivity is plentiful, too, with everything from HDMI eARC, for connecting to your TV (or a gaming monitor) as a very powerful soundbar, to a USB port for playing files directly off a drive, an Ethernet port for wired networking and more usual aux-in and optical inputs. This system even has a moving magnet phono stage inside, so you can hook up a turntable directly to it for enjoying vinyl on a modern system. You can also connect to it over a network and stream directly from your phone (or through Cambridge's Streammagic app), with support for Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, Deezer and Qobuz. Plus, there's AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Bluetooth 5.1, and it's Roon Ready if you're a paid-up subscriber. The Evo One also accepts music over the app from a network server via UPnP (which is what I've been doing with my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-build-your-perfect-nas-guide">QNAP NAS</a> over Plex).</p>
<p>Alongside integrating it with Spotify Connect and UPnP, I must also commend the Google Cast integration. I know a lot of folks in the know will be surprised that I've only just discovered this, but it is possible to create multi-room audio over Wi-Fi with two or more different speakers that support Google Cast in the Google Home app. You can create a speaker group in the app with speakers connected to Wi-Fi in separate rooms (you have to designate each speaker a separate room in the app) and then bring them together with a couple of small taps, so you can have multi-room audio without being at the behest of having matching speakers a la Sonos. In the living room, there's a Naim Mu-So Qb 2, with the Evo One in the dining room, and it works without a hitch.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>A large IPS display means you can always know what's playing - and in what quality. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Streammagic app is also there for when you want to control music at a distance from the Evo One, providing you with the same degree of control as with the display, plus it integrates with the streaming services above in a slick and neat interface. There are also additional settings, such as for room compensation and speaker placement and a seven-band EQ so you can get audio just right. The app also lends itself well to getting the unit set up initially, providing on-screen instructions on getting it connected to Wifi, and then running over-the-air firmware updates so it's ready to go in a matter of minutes.</p><p>The Evo One features what I think is the largest number of drivers in a single box to date, featuring a set of 14 drive units with upwards of 700W of amplification that's aided with digital signal processing – Cambridge says this is designed to help the Evo One produce deep and controlled bass, for instance. You get four 25mm silk dome tweeters, with four 57mm aluminium cone mid-range units, and a further six 70mm woofers that are designed to produce big sound to fill a large room.</p>
<p>With such a vast array of speakers and versatile use cases, I had high hopes for this Cambridge system. The thing that immediately hit me when putting it through my customary tests of both September from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire and 2112 from Rush was the width and expanse of the audio. Its sound extends beyond the confines of the unit, and carries some excellent precision and space for clearly picking out different elements, such as September's far-off bongos, or 2112's running water in the 'Discovery' section.</p>
<p>In the Bee Gees' Nights on Broadway, as much as the track's marvellous harmonies were front and centre, I could still hear the track's clavichord and electric piano work far off on the distance with the utmost clarity. I also like to use a live cut of George Benson's Affirmation (thanks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-c0zbdJxTA&amp;themeRefresh=1">DankPods</a>) for testing soundstage due to the crowd noise at the beginning, plus the track's percussion and clapping elements, whose detail was discernable even among a busy live recording. Speaking of busy, Brand X's Dance of the Illegal Aliens is a <em>very</em> busy jazz fusion track with everything from frenetic bass and rolling drums to percussion and more besides; the song's bongo hits felt far off on one direction, beyond the confines of the unit, and almost towards the back of the set.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Branding is, as always, subtle and tasteful. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Evo One's bass is as described above, I'd argue, with good depth and control to it. In some instances, it can encroach a smidgen on the mid-range and provide this system with a heavier-handed approach, but this can be adjusted with EQ settings should you wish. In spinning up The Invisible Man from Marillion, the track features a deep and brooding bassline amongst an atmospheric vocal from Steve Hogarth that demonstrates both its extension and power, but also the depth and body that lends itself well to darker–sounding, busier songs. I felt much the same with Steven Wilson's very tricky Meanwhile from his last album, which has a gritty bassline at one particular point contrasted with lighter acoustic guitar work - there's certainly plenty of rumble.</p><p>As much as the low-end can feel a little overbearing at times, there is still plenty of room for the rest to breathe. On James Taylor's September Grass, his warm vocal and the track's acoustic guitar elements came through with some gorgeous detail and richness without feeling pushed back into the unit. The same was true for the brighter Tape Deck from Jack Johnson, with his vocal, the song's minimalistic acoustic guitar and light drum and percussion work each occupying their own space in the mix.</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group"><figure>
 



</figure>
<figure>
 



</figure></figure>
<p>Unlike other speakers, the top end from the Evo One isn't sharp or overbearing, and this system doesn't lend itself to a V-shaped profile (that is, one that prioritises bass and treble above all). It's a precise and bright treble, as I noted with the competing percussion intro to Steely Dan's Do It Again. That can be particularly challenging for any speaker to master, but the combination of the sparkly feel and vast soundstage means that Cambridge's unit handled it with panache. The Strokes' On The Other Side provides an interesting challenge, with its introduction pairing a pounding bassline with constant cymbal hits, and as much as the booming bassline was there consistently, the cymbals didn't feel drowned out and held their own in the mix.</p><p>The expansive soundstage and consistent performance, no matter how far you are away from the unit, also lend themselves well to games. Granted, it isn't the typical use case for this system, but hook it up to a compatible TV or monitor (rare, but possible) via HDMI eARC, and it works a charm with the combination of a powerful low-end for atmosphere for gunfire or engine noises, plus expansive space for the mids and highs for vocal clarity. I'm not saying to use it for competitive eSports such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, where precision is vital, but for more cinematic titles with scale and depth, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and even my usual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> and EA FC titles worked great with noise such as deep engine rumbles and the far-off noises of crowd chants.</p>
<p>The Cambridge Audio Evo One is a genuinely gorgeous all-in-one system that's equally adept for games as it is for music. Its fit and finish is excellent, and I'm loathe to send it back with how pleasant it looks in my dining room. Not to mention, its very versatile connectivity, the bonus of a large screen and handy app support. Its audio is expansive, detailed and wonderfully clean with tight bass, rich mids, and surprisingly bright treble that sounds fantastic. Some may prefer a speaker that isn't as heavy-handed with the low-end at times, but to my ears, it's still a huge technical achievement. It's surely worth recommending as one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-computer-speakers-pc-gaming-7030">best console or computer speakers</a>, a rare product that ticks basically every box - just as long as it physically fits where you want to use it. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/cracking-sci-fi-horror-routine-escapes-a-decade-of-development-hell-as-a-great-reminder-that-patronising-game-design-can-do-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>There's a bit early on in Routine where your progress is blocked by a blinking computer terminal demanding your personal ID number. I was stumped; maybe because I've been so coddled by modern gaming's frequent insistence on eradicating all but the most minor of friction points that - without a conspicuous Post-it note secreted in the immediate vicinity, a blatant on-screen objective marker to beckon me onward, or (sigh) a chatty companion ready to spit out the answer four seconds in - I wasn't sure how to proceed. And then it hit me. Not 20 minutes earlier, I'd explicitly printed out my own ID card and pinned it to my chest - all the game wanted me to do was look down.</p>

<p>I might have <em>been</em> an idiot at that moment, but Routine is a wonderful reminder of how satisfying games can be when they're not treating you like one. Not that there aren't plenty of modern games that have faith in their audience. Rather, Routine has a particularly old-school, just-get-on-with-it vibe that feels especially uncommon these days; one it's tempting to ascribe to its decade-plus time in development hell. Lunar Software, you might recall, first announced Routine back in 2012, before the first-person sci-fi horror succumbed to frequent radio silence and countless delays. But honestly, its hands-off approach feels reminiscent of an even more distant past, and is so deeply embedded in its bones, so intrinsic to its soul, it's far more likely this is just the old-school spirit Lunar Software always had in mind.</p>

<figcaption>Routine trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm8Gw2MaLEY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is, though, hard to talk about Routine without referencing some of the things - specifically the game-shaped things - that have happened during its lengthy development. Aside from its obvious movie touchpoints - the occasional psychedelia of 2001: A Space Odyssey and its clear debt to Alien - it also echoes everything from the grimy, psychological sci-fi of Frictional Games' 2015 horror <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soma">SOMA</a> to, most notably, Creative Assembly's stellar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a>.</p><p>Partly, it's the vibe; Routine's familiar tale of ancient influences and rogue AI takes place on a retro-futuristic lunar resort where lo-fi 80s tech lends proceedings an anachronistic flavour that feels displaced in time. This is a world where sleek transportation trains display adverts for VHS recorders on chunky CRT screens, and where Terminator-like robots exist alongside game arcades. But more than that, Routine shares Isolation's specific love of physicality, its panicked pursuits, and its deliberate mechanical precision. But it's to the game's credit that, for all its familiarity, it still generates an ambience that feels of its own.</p>



<p>And, yes, a lot of that comes down to its approach. There's a flow to its events - to the way it's willing to present its spaces and then just let players use their initiative to muddle through - that feels wonderfully organic. Routine isn't, to be clear, a sandbox game or immersive sim, but even so, progress along its tightly prescribed path still manages to feel personal. Early on, for instance, you encounter a roadblock requiring two specific pieces of information. A bit of additional investigation reveals you've access to two distinct locations: the mall and the resort's residential quarters. How you proceed from there is up to you.</p><p>That gives Routine a strong exploratory focus, and bit by bit, as you scour abandoned personal effects and computer terminals loaded with employee emails, you'll hone in on recurring motifs and insinuations that form a gentle breadcrumb trail. Sure, progress remains strictly linear, but by opting for suggestion over heavy handed urgency, there's a lovely sense of reward. And more than that, it contributes to Routine's keen sense of verisimilitude. It's sterile, sci-fi spaces might be eerily liminal, but they still feel lived in, while its email conversations are authentic, and the occasional voice work is naturalistic in a way that brings <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> to mind. And its strong sense of physicality takes that even further. I adore its convincingly fussy crouch animation, for instance, and the lumbering, somewhat uncontrollable gait of your run. But Routine's real star is the Cosmonaut Assistance Tool.</p>



<p>Your C.A.T. is just fabulous, a gun-like maintenance device whose various buttons and modules require frequent physical manipulation. You'll need to manually degauss its tiny screen when it succumbs to magnetic interference, and you'll slide levers and flick open flaps to switch between its functions. On this front, you've an electrical pulse used to overload machinery, a security interface for opening doors, and more, all utilising its laggy, lo-res viewfinder, whose feeble torch proves to be the perfect tension-heightening contrivance when the lights falter. And it <em>also</em> serves as a vital - if comically impractical - PDA, whose save functionality, objective reminders, and information archive are only accessible after connecting it to one of Routine's relatively infrequent projection screens. It's fiddly in a way that feels designed to stop it from becoming a crutch, and also means it can't be abused when the horror comes.</p>

<p>And yes, Routine does horror well too. Admittedly, I'm not finished yet, and its latter portion feels different enough that its scare mechanics might well evolve - but its opening hours are wonderfully, unbelievably stressful. In another echo of Alien: Isolation, this time in its Working Joes, your primary foes are the lunar resort's security bots. These hulking machines are a relentless presence, their clanking footsteps reaching a frantic crescendo once they get you in their sights and take up pursuit. They're a bit dim, yes - they'll immediately lose interest if you hide under a table - but they contribute to an opening half absolutely defined by teeth-clamping tension and panic as you creep and careen around unfamiliar locations, desperately trying to make a mental map for exploration. And the fact you're left to your own devices to figure out how to deal with them is even more intimidating.</p><p>Right now, I'm somewhere new, juggling an expansive navigational problem that frankly feels far too big to fit in my brain, and I've resorted to doodling my own map with notes to keep track of it all - something I've not felt compelled to do outside of an intentionally obtuse puzzle game in a long time. Routine isn't obtuse (although I did fail to realise a sequence was bugged for over an hour because I'd assumed I was overlooking something), but it's hands-off in a way I admire and slightly miss. Am I masochistic enough to demand we purge video games of all modern-day niceties? That we jettison objective markers, mini-maps, and more? Absolutely not, but Routine is a lovely throwback and an unexpected breath of fresh air.</p>

            <h2>6th December</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing. This week, Marie is unable to resist replaying a torturous old PS1 game; Connor finds himself wrapped up in more obscure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a> challenges; Ed forgives shortcomings because of immaculate vibes; Bertie finally finishes Dispatch; and Dom discovers a whole half of the game in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> he didn't know existed.</p>

<p>Technically I haven't played it this week but I've been thinking about it non-stop. This colourful game about stopping the M&amp;M Minis from destroying the factory takes the top prize as the most frustrating game I have ever touched, but which always keeps me coming back for more.</p>
<p>I'm not exaggerating. It's genuinely the most rage-inducing game I've ever encountered, and I've played Crash Bandicoot. Yet somehow I keep going back for more. Even now, if the game was in front of me, I'd play it and regret my choices all over again. I fear that my love-loathe relationship with this game will be eternal.</p>

<p>Did you know that to unlock the title 'Gods Walking Amongst Mere Mortals' in Guild Wars 2, you have to achieve something truly impressive in the <em>original</em>, preceding Guild Wars games? I didn't. I only learned about that about a week ago while feeling all nostalgic about the MMOs of my youth.</p><p>Gods Walking Amongst Mere Mortals, dubbed GWAMM by the Guild Wars community, is a title granted by completing 'title tracks' in the original game and its expansions. Think of them like meta-achievements, marks of acclaim. The grind to earn said title takes over two months to complete, and roughly 1000 hours, according to player estimates, so yeah sure, why not.</p>
<p>Thanks to Guild Wars: Reforged I can go back to the old game and have other people there to play with, and I've also, in the process of going back, discovered some entertaining facts about the game. Did you know you, for instance, you can grind all the way to the max level of 20 in Guild Wars: Prophecies's tutorial zone? Did you know that doing so is necessary to obtain GWAMM, and that there's a whole subset of Guild Wars players dedicated to this slice of the game? I bet you did not!</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'm doing this right now, so if you need me, I'll be hanging around pre-searing Ascalon. Toodaloo!</p>

<h2>Demonschool, PC (Steam)</h2>

<p>A good soundtrack can really elevate a game. We all know this. But Demonschool's horror-funk music just makes me love it even more. The game is Persona-meets-Buffy, as a bunch of kids wind up in a demon infested school on a mysterious island in the late '90s. The RPG and relationship side of things is a little light (I'm a few hours in), but the turn-based combat is strategic and chess-like in the best way, rewarding clever positioning and character combinations as you put a menagerie of horrible-looking monsters into check-mate.</p><p>But what really elevates combat is the music, a sort of melange of jazz, funk, Italo Disco, and Castlevania, which has my head bopping as I contemplate each move. It fits so perfectly with the technicolour anime visuals that I can forgive any shortcomings in favour of exceptional vibes.</p>
<p><em>-Ed</em></p>
<h2>Dispatch, Where Winds Meet, PC</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / EverStone</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Only I could manage to string a game like this out for so long, but I finally finished Dispatch ahead of an interview with developer AdHoc - keep your eyes on the site - and generally, I loved it. Playing it feels like taking a sunbeam of energy to the face. It's so condensed, so energetic, so funny, so stylish. Those several hours of running stuff pack a lot in. Perhaps it's because episodic gaming like this has been away for so long that it feels so refreshing, or perhaps it's because Dispatch is simply <em>that </em>good, but I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending it to everyone.</p><p>I tried playing Quantic Dream's surprise new 3D MOBA game Spellcasters: Chronicles, too, but my 16GB of RAM was causing impassable problems, no matter how much I lowered graphics settings. I haven't come across a RAM-related issue like that in a while - years, in fact - and given the global RAM economy at the moment, it seems like a very bad time to encounter it.</p>
<p>I also had a go at Where Winds Meet, messing around with the AI chat bots and - I kid you not - uploading a picture of myself to the game so it could map my likeness onto my character, which it did. The result didn't look anything like be but the character did have very sad eyes.</p>
<p><em>-Bertie</em></p>
<h2>Dave the Diver, PS5</h2>
<p>Anyone that's been reading my stuff on Eurogamer since I came over here in the summer might have picked up that I'm a foodie. I read recipe books for fun. I spend multiple hours a day in the kitchen. I have a secret Instagram account where I recreate food from games as closely as possible (no, I won't be sharing it). I can forgive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a> for its flaws purely because of "I've come up with a new reci-pey!" Ignis, and the main draw of Monster Hunter as a series for me is sitting down with your pals before a hunt and - quite literally - chewing the fat.</p><p>So how the hell didn't I know that the diving in Dave the Diver is only half the game!? The other half is breathing life into a quiet little sushi bar set in an idyllic Hawaiian-like island, and every time you research some new ochazuke, or ramen, or onigiri, or karaage, you get these intricate, sumptuous little cutscenes realised with absolutely beautiful pixel art that shows a deep appreciation for the process, craftsmanship, and colour of Japanese cuisine.</p>
<p>The game has so much heart, and you tend to access it through its stomach. I can't think of the last game that made me feel like a gourmand artisan just by watching how many dishes come together based on the fruits of my undersea labour.  I know I'm late to this game, but I am so, so glad I found it. Itadakimasu!</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a> studio Fullbright has unveiled Springs, Eternal - a lo-fi narrative adventure where lost souls congregate in a "half-remembered otherworld" that's coming to PC sometime next year.
</p>
<p>
The Fullbright of 2025 is, of course, markedly different to the one that released Gone Home. Back in 2023, co-founder Steve Gaynor confirmed the studio was now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gone-home-studio-fullbright-now-solo-outfit-as-controversial-co-founder-goes-it-alone">effectively a solo outfit</a> after his problematic workplace behaviour - which he acknowledged as "hurtful" - resulted in a split with the rest of the team.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Gaynor has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gone-home-developer-surprise-drops-toilet-spiders-in-early-access">released Toilet Spiders</a> as part of an "ongoing series of small, strange, lo-fi games", and the newly revealed Springs, Eternal is equally lo-fi, sporting a visual style evoking the "dithered and pixelated graphics of late '90s-era PC and home console games". But it's not just the 90s vibe and moody purple colour palette links it back to Gone Home; it shares a narrative-driven, first-person exploratory focus too.

<p>
Springs, Eternal unfolds in the isolated mountain retreat of Stillwater, a forest sprawl - and a "half-remembered otherworld" full of "dark, winding paths" - where lost souls converge to enjoy its soothing waters. As for you, it's the memory of a relationship that's led you here, and you'll recall more of that in flashbacks over its two-to-three hour runtime.
</p><p>
And as you explore the "open-structure" world's pools, saunas, caverns, grand lodge, and other points of interest, you'll encounter over a dozen other characters - from "philosophers engaging in a debate that could last a lifetime" to a "tattooist waiting to inscribe you with your future" - whose stories you'll discover through branching dialogue. "The dark paths you walk are ominous", the announcement adds, "but you can’t die... can you?"
</p>
<p>
Springs, Eternal doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PC - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3677850/Springs_Eternal/">via Steam</a> at the very least - sometime next year.

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, boss of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, has named his game of the year - it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>"Expedition 33 is really unique and amazing," Howard told Eurogamer's social producer Mat Jones when asked for his game of the year choice, before name-checking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 as well.</p>
<p>"I think Expedition 33 is a really unique piece of art in so many ways," he added, doubling down on his choice.</p>

<p>It's certainly a great choice, but also rounds off a rivalry from earlier this year. Bethesda shadow-dropped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> two days before Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, with both also available on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>But that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">didn't scupper the release of Expedition 33</a>, as publisher Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan said "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all". After all, both games represent opposing Western and Japanese ends of the RPG spectrum.</p>
<p>Expedition 33 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">sold over 5m copies worldwide</a> across all formats and is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">frontrunner at next week's The Game Awards with a record-breaking 12 nominations</a>. So it's not just Howard's favour the game has won.</p>
<p>The game has also been a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-xbox-game-passs-biggest-third-party-success-2025">success for Xbox Game Pass as the subscription service's biggest third-party release of the year</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">Howard currently has The Elder Scrolls 6 as his "everyday thing"</a>, but noted recently it's "still a long way off". In the same interview with Eurogamer, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games">defended the use of AI but aims to "protect artistry" in his games</a>.</p>

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> may be gearing up for the Fallout season two debut on Amazon Prime, but don't think we are going to miss a chance to ask him about the Wolfenstein TV series and a potential Elder Scrolls adaptation.</p>
<p>Our social producer Mat Jones recently sat down with the studio head, and asked him just how things were going with Wolfenstein's adaptation. However, while Howard clearly knows more than he was letting on right now, he has admitted it's "not [his] place" to speak about it, preferring to save that honour for MachineGames.</p>
<p>OK, fair enough. But, what about an Elder Scrolls TV show or film? Surely that would be a no brainer for Bethesda after the success of Fallout's own series and the unwavering devotion many gamers have for Skyrim. Well, the answer wasn't a no…</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"I will say this, the Fallout journey was like a 10 year one," Howard replied when Mat asked for the developer's thoughts on an Elder Scrolls adaptation of some description. "After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>, people were asking to do a movie or show for Fallout, and we really took our time."</p><p>That said, Howard "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future." However, the Bethesda exec believes the Fallout franchise was "more uniquely suited" and had "more to say in its genre" at this moment in time.</p>
<p>"But, you never know. I think the impact of the show on Fallout as a franchise has been bigger than I expected, so it does make you think like 'hey, is there a path?'. But, nothing today… [and] I'm willing to say 'no' for a decade."</p>

<p>The second season of Fallout will be heading to Prime later this month, on 17th December.

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has shared his thoughts on the use of AI in video games, calling it a "tool" but one that can't replace human intention.</p>
<p>Howard sat down with Eurogamer's social producer Mat Jones at an event for the second season of Fallout earlier this week. While much of the discussion focused on the Amazon series, Mat took the chance to ask Howard about AI, which remains a hotly debated topic within the industry.</p>

<p>"I view it as a tool," Howard told Mat. "Creative intention comes from human artists, number one.</p>
<p>"But, I think we look at it as a tool for, is there a way we can use it to help us go through some iterations that we do ourselves faster. Not in generating things, but we are always working on our toolset for how we build our worlds or check things. </p>
<p>"I think if you go back 10 years ago, that version of Photoshop, you wouldn't want to go back to that version of Photoshop."</p>
<p>"That's our view on it," the Bethesda head closed. "But we want to protect the artistry. The human intention of it is what makes our stuff special."</p>
<p>Howard's words come as more and more developers are dipping their toes - or at times their whole foot - into the technology. AI has been used across all levels of game development, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meets-side-quests-can-be-skipped-by-tricking-the-ai-npcs-with-infamous-solid-snake-method">NPCs like those in the recently-released Where Winds Meet</a>.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, reported that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. In 2025, that number is likely to be higher, and a recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines as we march confidently towards the end of the year. Just this afternoon, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>
<p>For more from Howard, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-boss-and-rpg-lover-todd-howard-names-his-2025-game-of-the-year-and-it-shouldnt-come-as-a-big-surprise">Bethesda exec also recently revealed his game of the year</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">potential for an Elder Scrolls adaptation</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been an unexpectedly rough year for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. The game, which many assumed would be a massive success after the juggernaut sales of Monster Hunter World, has floundered a little post-launch. Capcom has been eager to point the finger on various factors, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">the price of a PS5 being a high barrier to entry</a>, but the fact remains that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">the game's sales are lagging behind the ageing Street Fighter 6 and Monster Hunter Rise's DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/of-course-were-not-going-to-stop-here-monster-hunter-developers-talk-about-the-future-of-the-series-at-playstation-awards">IGN</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda has appealed to players to consider jumping back into the game again, promising various tweaks the devs have made - and are planning to make - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-revised-roadmap">have righted the wrongs</a> the game suffered at launch.</p>

<p>"We analyzed what kind of places beginners were stuck in, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>," Tokuda explained. “We have worked on these points in turn to make it easier for new users to clear hurdles such as being able to reach certain monsters or to craft certain types of armour.</p><p>"In addition, we have tried to adopt as many new elements as possible that are beneficial for both beginners and existing users, such as Focus Mode. This time, as a result of making the game easy to beat even for new players and players who could not clear it before, I think the difficulty curve was a little lacking for existing users."</p>
<p>This point is notable: many (assumedly now lapsed) players found the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">far too easy</a>, especially by Monster Hunter standards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-details-next-monster-hunter-wilds-update-as-steam-reviews-continue-overwhelmingly-negative-plunge">The resultant 'overwhelmingly negative' plunge</a> on Steam is partially to blame for the game's lack of stickiness with players, which must have come as something of a shock to Capcom given how loyal MonHun fans typically tend to be.</p>
<p>On the upside, though, various free updates have added more difficult gameplay to the title over the course of the year, and recently we saw a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> crossover go live with an absolute nightmare of an encounter in the form of Omega Planetes - something even end-game veterans struggled to put down.</p>
<p>"If you beat the game immediately after its release and stopped playing, I would appreciate it if you could pick it up again."</p>
<p>Need more motivation? You're in luck: Capcom today announced the next Monster Hunter Showcase will air on Monday, 8th December 8. The showcase will cover Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4 and provide us with another look at Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection.</p><p>It'll be broadcast on YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> at 2 PM PT / 10 PM GMT. So far, we know Monster Hunter Wilds TU4 will re-introduce us Gogmazios (an oil-slicked Elder Dragon we've not seen since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-4-ultimate">Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate</a>), expand end-game content, bring in new weapon buffs, start a new seasonal event, apply performance improvements, and more besides.</p>
<p>It launches on December 16 for all platforms. Just in time for the holidays, then.</p>

            <p>After receiving pushback for its flagrant use of generative AI, Postal: Bullet Paradise has been cancelled… just two days after being revealed.</p>
<p>In a statement from publisher Running With Scissors, the company said the reception to Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - had "caused extreme damage" to its brand and reputation.</p>

<p>"We've been overwhelmed with negative responses from our concerned Postal Community," Running with Scissors founder Vince Desi stated today.</p>
<p>The "strong" feedback the publisher recieved said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI. "We've always been, and will always be, transparent with our community," Desi continued, adding the publisher's trust in the development team had been "broken".</p>
<p>As such, Running with Scissors has "killed the project", which would have seen players taking on the mantle of one of the Dudes from across the Postal multiverse.</p>
<p>"Since forming Running With Scissors in 1996, we've always said that our fans are part of the team. Our priority is to always do right by the millions who support the Postal franchise. We are grateful for the opportunity to make the games we want to play, and will continue to focus on our new projects and updates coming in 2026 and beyond," the founder closed.</p>
<p>"We can't wait to share more!"</p>
<p>Postal: Bullet Paradise was announced on 3rd December, with a PC release planned for 2026, before an arrival on PlayStation and Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Running with Scissors' decision to cancel Postal: Bullet Paradise comes as more and more companies are using AI technology. Recent examples include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meets-side-quests-can-be-skipped-by-tricking-the-ai-npcs-with-infamous-solid-snake-method">NPC conversations like those in the newly-released Where Winds Meet</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, just yesterday, Supertrick Games - the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno - released a statement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">after its own use of AI caused a bit of a stir earlier in the week</a>.</p>

            <p>Rage Against The Machine guitarist Tom Morello has written a new song for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, making composer Masayoshi Soken's dreams come true.</p>
<p>The MMORPG has long had a heavy influence of rock music in its score. Jason Charles Miller, lead vocalist and guitarist of the band Godhead, lent his vocals to the game, singing Endwalker's iconic song Close in the Distance (a personal favourite), while the game's developers themselves have formed a rock band called The Primals.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-would-uematsu-do-final-fantasy-14-composer-masayoshi-soken-on-following-series-legend">asked the game's composer why he leans on rock music for inspiration</a>. "Battle content really matches well with rock music," he said. "Musically, rock is something that is easy to hype up to, and it's also easy to understand, even though rock is not necessarily the only thing that would get you excited. I just think, as a genre, it's very easy to get involved in."</p>

<p>What's more, Soken told me Rage Against The Machine is his favourite band, so this collaboration is very much a full circle moment.</p>
<p>"It all started when Jason Charles Miller told me that Soken-san, the composer of Final Fantasy 14, was a huge Rage Against The Machine fan and wanted to collaborate," said Morello in a video message shared on social media.</p>
<p>"So I got down to work and wrote this track…with Beartooth, a great band. We wanted to make something super heavy and super powerful for Final Fantasy 14. I wanted to make an absolute rocking banger of a track that would mirror the energy and the potency of this game."</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Light it up, let's go! 🔥 </p><p>A new song by award-winning guitarist Tom Morello, featuring Beartooth, is making its way onto the Arcadion stage in FFXIV! </p><p>Here's a message from Tom and a preview of the upcoming track, Everything Burns! <a href="https://t.co/1htLXi2V1c">pic.twitter.com/1htLXi2V1c</a></p></div>— FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1996910066952515975?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>Soken shared the post himself, calling it "nonsensical" - he's clearly very excited.</p>
<p>"To write it in an easy-to-understand way? Suddenly, a song gets sent from my top fave, and it gets implemented in the game - that's the flow, and even as I'm writing this now, it's totally nonsensical!" he said (via machine translation).</p>
<div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>The track, called Everything Burns, will feature in the Arcadion battle arena. It'll also be available on streaming services from 17th December. Before then, you can hear a snippet in both the social posts and trailer above.</p>
<p>The next update for Final Fantasy 14, Patch 7.4, will be added on 16th December. Called Into The Mist, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-yoshi-p-glamour-restrictions-into-the-mist">lift restrictions on glamouring outfits</a> in addition to extending the game's story.</p>

            <p>Last night, Twisted Works lifted the lid on its upcoming fantasy London-set online co-op combat game. If you think that concept sounds familiar, you are not alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/twistedworksltd/about/">Twisted Works was established last year</a>, with veteran developers from PlayStation London Studio, Guerrilla Cambridge, Creative Assembly, Disney Interactive, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, Blu, Slide London and more all lending their pedigree to the team.</p>
<p>And, it seems that some of the developers' previous work had more than a just a small influence on the upcoming release, Cast Outs, which bears a striking resemblance to artwork for London Studio's own cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-ps5-online-game">online game for the PlayStation 5</a> that was to be set in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-online-co-op-combat-game-set-in-fantasy-london">fantasy version of the UK capital</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Just like London Studio's now-cancelled game, Cast Outs is also an online co-op game set in an urban fantasy-inspired London. In the words of Twisted Works, Cast Outs is "fantasy in a modern jacket", where up to four players can team up together and use magical spells to traverse the city and defeat enemies.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for Cast Outs below.</p>

<p>"Cast Outs brings you the pure spectacle of magic where spellcasting hits with the physical impact of a brawler and the immediate kick of a shooter. Dive into the ultimate magical urban battleground where you and your friends can truly cooperate, regardless of skill level," reads the official blurb. "It's the perfect balance of quick-fix fun and high-octane action, built to be played together."</p>
<p>And, as you can see in the images below, art for both games has similar iconography and colour schemes:</p>

<p>Cast Outs is set to debut on PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3307340/Cast_Outs/">PC via Steam</a>. A release date is still to be announced. How do you think it looks?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">London Studio was shut down in February of last year</a>, when Sony laid off 900 people, equating to eight percent of its then-workforce.</p>

            <p>Netflix has announced it's acquiring Warner Bros. in a deal worth $82.7bn, including its game studios.</p>
<p>Back in June, <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">Warner Bros. Discovery announced the company would be split</a> between Streaming &amp; Studios (including Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, and HBO among others) and Global Networks (including sports and news TV brands like CNN and TNT Sports).</p>
<p>It's the former half that Netflix is set to acquire, with the transaction closing in 12-18 months once the split takes place, subject to regulatory approvals. At the time of the split announcement, David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said it will "invigorate each company by enabling them to leverage their strengths and specific financial profiles. This will also allow each company to pursue important investment opportunities and drive shareholder value."</p>

<p>Warner Bros.' game studios includes the likes of Rocksteady (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Batman Arkham series</a>), NetherRealm Studios (Mortal Kombat), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>).</p>
<p>It's currently unknown how the gaming division of Warner Bros. will be impacted by the Netflix acquisition. While gaming isn't mentioned specifically in <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros">Netflix's press release</a>, "games and consumer product and experiences" were included during a webcast on the news. Hogwarts Legacy at the least was a huge revenue driver and a sequel is extremely likely, while DC fans will surely be hopeful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is reportedly working on a new Batman game</a> to follow its celebrated Arkham Knight series.</p>

<p>"Our mission has always been to entertain the world," said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix. "By combining Warner Bros.' incredible library of shows and movies - from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends - with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling."</p>
<p>Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters added the acquisition will "improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come".</p>
<p>"Today's announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most," said Zaslav. "For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world’s attention, and shaped our culture. By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come."</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a>, in June it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">initiated a dramatic leadership shift</a> as part of a refocus on its biggest franchises, like Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones. It follows a turbulent time for the company, which saw a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">48 percent decrease in games revenue earlier this year</a> due to not releasing any games.</p>
<p>That followed a reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">cancellation of a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy</a>; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">Suicide Squad flopping</a> and Rocksteady suffering layoffs; the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of brawler Multiversus</a>; and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation of Monolith Productions' Wonder Woman game</a>.</p>

            <p>Ys Net could be preparing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a> 4 announcement possibly to coincide with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/events/the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards next week</a>, if a suspicious, off-screen, leaked trailer is to be believed. If it is, Shenmue 4 will apparently arrive in 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X.</p>
<p>But is the trailer (spotted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/no-one-seems-to-know-if-this-shenmue-4-trailer-is-real-or-ai">PushSquare</a>) to be believed? That is the question. It's filmed off-screen and only in low resolution, making careful, close inspection impossible. And in a world of fairly convincing AI fakes, and this trailer arising from an unknown and unvalidated source - a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heI9T5Vby5I&amp;t=106s"> YouTube account with six followers</a> and no track-record of accurate game-leaking - people aren't sure about it.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heI9T5Vby5I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>But the trailer itself is considerable. It clocks in at just over four minutes and shows a huge chunk of the supposed game, following protagonist Ryo as he goes about various around-the-town jobs, such as washing dishes and arm wrestling, while also learning ancient styles of kung fu.</p><p>Given the length of the trailer, I'd assume that, if it were made by AI, we'd see a telltale AI slip-up - an extra arm appearing from someone's head, say - in that time. But I didn't see anything of that kind. Moreover, the trailer visually looks consistent with what we saw in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue-3">Shenmue 3</a>; it's a very convincing fake if it is one.</p>
<p>Of course, there may be elements of generative AI used in the game even if it does turn out to be real. One area people are particularly scrutinising is a Street Fighter-like fighting game cabinet called Shenmue Fighters - could that be AI generated?</p>
<p>There's been a strong demand for another Shenmue game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-fans-rent-times-square-billboard-campaigning-for-fourth-game">Last year, Shenmue fans rented a billboard in Times Square</a>, no less, to petition series creator Yu Suzuki to "complete his life's work" and make another game.</p>
<p>Shenmue 3 resurrected the beloved simulation RPG series in 2019, and Martin Robison - a series fan - loved it. "A bewitching time capsule that transports us to late 80s China, and to turn-of-the-century video games," Martin wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmue-3-review-a-faithful-follow-up-to-an-all-time-classic">his Shenmue 3 review</a>.</p>

            <p>Banjo-Kazooie is now playable on PlayStation - at least, a fan-made version created in Dreams - and it's even caught the eye of Rare.</p>
<p>Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania has been created by William Butkevicius, and is just a single level made in homage to the N64 platformer. Butkevicius, incidentally, is a level designer at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ori-and-the-blind-forest">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> developer Moon Studios, who created this project in their spare time.</p>
<p>Butkevicius described it as a "labour of love", but doesn't have plans to add to it. "I'd like to move away from big Dreams projects now, so unless I get the opportunity to work on an official Banjo-Threeie (which I would be thrilled to), this is it for now," Butkevicius wrote on social media. Rare, are you listening?</p>

<p>Well actually, it is. The studio shared Butkevicius' post, stating: "Put our fanciest hat on just so we could tip it to this. Incredible work!"</p>
<p>Gregg Mayles, Banjo-Kazooie's director (who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-director-officially-leaves-rare-following-everwild-cancellation">recently left Rare</a>), also <a href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1996694869297795109?s=20">shared the post</a> calling it "splendid", while <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1996298038286111087?s=20">composer Grant Kirkhope</a> shared it with the googly eyes emoji.</p>
<div>

</p></div>

<p>Butkevicius' video shows the iconic bear and bird exploring an island level reminiscent of Treasure Trove Cove - it even has that terrifying shark. There are musical notes and jiggies (30!) to collect, platforming challenges and puzzles, and new characters to meet.</p><p>Perhaps most notable are the new transformations, including a rock golem and a skeletal fish. It took Butkevicius around 14 months and over 800 hours of work to create, adding: "A lot of the concepts were born out of issues I had with the original game, like 'the transformations don't feel fun enough to use', or 'going to the hut to transform is tedious' and then tons of iteration to find good solutions!"</p>
<p>There's some great jaunty music too from composer Duckenomics and brass ensemble The Game Brass, while PieceofCraft assisted with sculpting, animation, and logic.</p>
<p>The original Banjo-Kazooie was released for the N64 27 years ago and the last new release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</a> in 2008 for Xbox 360. It's clear the original game has left a lasting impression, but could we see a new game in the series in future?</p>
<p>It seems unlikely, considering Mayles' recent departure from Rare. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-sequel-chances-better-than-zero-but-not-much-says-composer-grant-kirkhope">Kirkhope also told Eurogamer there's "better than zero but not much" of a chance</a> the bird and bear will return.</p>
<p>The project is also a reminder that Media Molecule's Dreams is still up and running. A report last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dreams-pc-playstation-5-ports-reportedly-canned">claimed PC and PS5 versions of the game were in development</a>, but were later canned.</p>

            <p>The next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> patch will finally remove all glamour restrictions, even though Yoshi-P isn't really a fan of it.</p>
<p>Glamouring essentially allows players to combine the visuals of their favourite armour with the stats of something better - transmog, basically. However, players can only glamour within the Job they're playing as, so your White Mage can wear any other White Mage outfit but can't dress as a Dragoon.</p>
<p>That's all set to change in Patch 7.4, out later this month, which is great news for fashion fans - the real endgame of Final Fantasy 14. However, it seems director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has agreed to the change reluctantly.</p>

<p>The decision not to allow this type of glamour until now wasn't due to technicalities, but Yoshida's personal taste.</p>
<p>"I felt more strongly than anyone else that we had to cherish the Final Fantasy worldview," Yoshida told <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59484">Famitsu</a> (translation via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/ff14s-yoshi-p-reveals-why-hes-finally-lifting-glamour-restrictions-hes-got-his-own-preferences-but-its-no-longer-the-time-to-force-them-on-players/">PC Gamer</a>). "I felt that the way Final Fantasy should be is for Dragoons to be able to equip their character in that style, and to be able to hold their spear and strike the 'Kain pose' [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-iv">Final Fantasy 4</a>'s iconic Dragoon]. It's the job's identity, so to speak. The core of that feeling hasn't changed much even now."</p><p>However, he noted there are "very few games that have the same limitations as Final Fantasy 14 in terms of enjoying fashion", although he added if he were in charge of a free-to-play game he'd naturally want players to buy items without restrictions.</p>
<p>Yoshida has been playing games from other companies and now understands, in this modern era, what players want may differ to his own preference. For instance, he plays as a Black Mage and wouldn't want his character to wear other armour.</p>
<p>"These are my own roleplaying rules, so I have decided them arbitrarily," he said. "I reconsidered and decided that it would be pointless to impede the roleplaying of people who say, 'My character is the coolest and cutest in the world. I want to dress up even more,' by [forcing them to follow] my own rules.</p>
<p>"I'm fine with being particular about my own preferences, and I'm sure there are many others who feel the same way, but that doesn't mean that the system should restrict the motivation of people who are particular about dressing up."</p><p>Another reason for the change is to combat the use of mods. Yoshida has been adamant about not allowing mod-use in Final Fantasy 14, which reached a peak earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-most-controversial-third-party-plugin-used-for-in-game-stalking-has-been-shut-down">a controversial third-party plugin used for in-game stalking was shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Some players used mods to alter their character's appearance - most notably the Mare Synchronos mod, whose creators were <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/legal-inquiry-shuts-down-one-of-final-fantasy-14s-most-popular-mods-adding-yet-another-blurry-line-in-the-sand-from-square-enix/">sent a cease and desist earlier this year</a>. Now the game itself has been altered to appease players.</p>
<p>What's more, the change is an offer of goodwill to players. When, anecdotally, the MMORPG has seen a reduction in player count since the release of the less well-received expansion Dawntrail, this change to glamouring will likely be a popular change - and give an extra incentive to explore everything in the game in the search for the right outfit.</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/patch_7_4/">Patch 7.4, Into The Mist</a>, will be released on 16th December, extending the story and bringing various other additions as expected with each patch. Next year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> will host multiple Fan Fest events as it prepares to launch the next expansion, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-us-fan-fest-event-square-enix-accessibility-disabled-players">disabled fans in the US fear their accessibility needs won't be met</a>.</p>

            <p>It looks as though Epic is getting over its aversion to showing male nipples in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>The discussion around Fortnite's lack of nipples on its shirtless characters famously began after a Travis Scott concert was held in-game, with the <a href="https://x.com/Fresh/status/1252792137143312384">topless singer sporting some very smooth pecs</a>.</p>
<p>However, you may recall last month, a then-leak revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-homer-simpson-going-to-be-the-first-character-skin-to-get-his-nipples-out-in-fortnite">Homer Simpson would be getting his own nipples out in Epic's shooter</a>, thanks to a skin of the yellow patriarch in his underwear. In Homer's case, his nipples were just two black dots on his chest.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But now it seems Homer was in fact a vessel for change. As spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-really-does-seem-to-have-changed-its-nipple-policy-and-now-its-not-just-homer-simpsons-chest-thats-in-the-game">IGN</a>, a new battle pass skin for Carter Wu shows a shirtless Fortnite model complete with actual nipples. Unlike Homer's cartoonish pec specs, though, these nipples are actually (for Fortnite) quite anatomically accurate, with detailed areola.</p>
<p>You can check out how Carter Wu's Fortnite nipples look in the reddit embed below.</p>
<p>So, has Homer Simpson started a new wave of nipples in Fortnite? What a triumph to add to his ever growing list of achievements (I mean, this man has gone to space, become a professional boxer and stopped nuclear meltdowns).</p>

</span></p><p>As for Fortnite more generally, it recently made headlines after players discovered what they believed to be AI-generated images within the game. In a Reddit post entitled "Say 'No' to AI slop, a billion-dollar company should have no problem supporting real artists for real art", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-are-saying-no-to-ai-slop-after-spotting-what-they-believe-are-ai-generated-images-in-game">Fortnite players shared their thoughts on a number of alleged AI-generated images</a>, including in-game posters and sprays.</p>

            <p>A sudden update for Armored Core 6 on Steam has spurred hopes among fans of the third-person mecha action game that something big is coming to The Game Awards next week.</p>
<p>The update, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1888160/history/">which can be seen on the game's SteamDB page</a>, shows a change to the application <em>has</em> happened. However, we can't see what has changed. It could be absolutely nothing, <em>or</em> it could be preparation for something substantial… In this murky realm of possibility, a flicker of hope has been lit.</p>
<p>"Babe wake up. Armored Core got another SteamDB update 1 week before the Game Awards," <a href="https://x.com/Etheox/status/1996259179225620778">posts user Etheox on X</a>. It is worth noting of course that Armored Core 6 has received several Steam page updates over this year and no DLC announcements.</p>

<p>The game, while successful, has been left largely alone since its release in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-has-had-its-best-weapons-nerfed">It received an impactful nerf to some of its most powerful weapons</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-now-has-1v1-and-3v3-ranked-online-matchmaking">ranked matchmaking support for both 1v1 and 3v3</a>. Aside from that, it's been left well enough alone, which is a shame! More Armored Core would be a wonderful thing.</p><p>It is worth noting that previous Armored Core games have recieved DLC packs in the past. Take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/armored-core-5">Armored Core 5</a>, which was updated with the Modeler's Pack. This brought a vast number of new AC parts and weapons to the game. While big narrative updates aren't the norm with the series, FromSoftware has proven keen to create such content for its games in recent years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-difficulty-harder-than-main-game-the-forsaken-hollows">Take Elden Ring: Nightreign's recent Forsaken Hollows DLC</a>, an injection of difficult content adding life to the multiplayer spinoff.
</p>
<p>Armored Core 6 was an outstanding game from FromSoftware. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">In Eurogamer's review</a>, Caelyn Ellis wrote: "FromSoftware delivers a superlative action game that builds on its Soulslike pedigree while staying lean and laser-focused."</p>

<p>The free-to-play Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will arrive across PC (via Steam, Epic Games Store and Windows), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5 and PS4 on 17th December.</p>
<p>"After months of community feedback, testing and rebuilding the entire experience, this is Splitgate refocused on what made it special in the first place: classic arena combat without factions, abilities, or extra noise," the developer shared on Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's announcement, along with a new trailer you can see below.</p>

<p>1047 Games said Splitgate has "always been about the arena first", though the developer admitted it had somewhat missed the mark when it released Splitgate 2 earlier this year. As such, it has now taken elements from both the original Splitgate and its short-lived sequel, removed the bits that "didn't fit" and "refined" the ones that did.</p><p>"In the process, we not only rebuilt the game, we reconnected with the magic of the genre that built this studio in the first place. A Return to the Arena," the studio wrote, saying arena shooters are part of its DNA.</p>
<p>"Splitgate has always been a love letter to the classic shooters that sparked a lifelong passion for games for so many of us. They were fast, expressive, and skillful, and they brought people together around shared experiences.</p>
<p>"With Splitgate : Arena Reloaded, our goal is to bring that feeling forward for a new generation while keeping it fresh for the players who have been with us from the start."</p>
<p>You can check out the various changes coming to Splitgate: Arena Reloaded below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Splitgate 2's factions, abilities, and select equipment so the focus is back on classic arena combat without the extra noise.</li>
<li>Rebuilt progression from the ground up so your time in game feels rewarding, with weapon and character cosmetics you can earn simply by playing.</li>
<li>We've added a true Classic Arena mode with even starts and new map pickups, recapturing the feel of the original.</li>
<li>Fine tuned combat to better match expectations for a modern arena shooter, with more meaningful gunfights and fewer "what just happened" moments.</li>
<li>Completely overhauled the ranked system so your rank reflects your actual skill for players who love to climb and compete.</li>
<li>Added key systems you have been asking for: Mode Select, Player Stats, Ranked Leaderboards, and Account Levels.</li>
<li>Introduced five brand new maps and six fully reworked arenas, bringing the total map pool to 20.</li>
<li>Added three new LMG primary weapons and the iconic Power Weapon, the Railgun.</li>
</ul>

<p>Closing, 1047 Games acknowledged that relaunches such as this one can be "met with scepticism", and it appreciates that. However, the studio is proud of what it has built with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and will be sharing more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>"From everyone at 1047 Games, thank you for your feedback, your patience, and your passion over the last few months," it closed. "We hope to see you back in the arena on December 17."</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 was initially released earlier this year, but soon after the studio and its founder Ian Proulx admitted they had taken the game out of beta too soon. "We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew," a statement in July read. As such, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">the shooter returned to beta</a>, and layoffs were made at 1047 Games.</p>
<p>Will this second go at things be the time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">Splitgate 2 makes FPS great again</a>? We will see.</p>

            <p>The full release of action role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> - otherwise known as the 1.0 release - has slipped further away again. The game is currently in early access, remember.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-path-of-exile-2-10-release-this-year-as-ddos-attacks-blamed-for-server-issues-and-huge-new-update-revealed">Grinding Gear Games had been targeting a potential March 2026 release for Path of Exile 2</a> - that's what game director Jonathan Rogers told me a few months ago. But in an interview conducted yesterday, Rogers told me he didn't think the studio would hit that date.</p>
<p>"I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," Rogers said, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."</p>
<p>His comments follow those made during a Path of Exile 2 presentation Q&amp;A shortly before we spoke, in which he said: "I don't have a specific timeline but I certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027."</p>

<p>The obstacles to a Path of Exile 2 launch are threefold: the campaign, balance changes and endgame content. Path of Exile 2 currently has only four of six campaign-acts implemented, the most recent one - the fourth - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-path-of-exile-2-10-release-this-year-as-ddos-attacks-blamed-for-server-issues-and-huge-new-update-revealed">having been introduced in August</a>. These are big things, and even if we assume the two missing acts are ready to release in the game's next quarterly updates, presumably one after another, we're still potentially looking at one in spring 2026, and one in the summer, and they will both need testing time. Factoring that in, an autumn 2026 release at the earliest seems more reasonable.</p><p>That's assuming, of course, there are no balance changes or endgame changes that hold that up - both being areas Rogers wants "in a good place" before the game comes out. This is a constant pursuit for a game like Path of Exile 2, and balance changes have already interrupted the early access flow of content <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-fixes-incoming-following-criticism-of-dawn-of-the-hunt-updates-slow-pace">as Grinding Gear Games sought to address issues with the hunter class</a> it introduced back in April. This, then, is a potential risk any time the studio introduces a significant new element to the game, such as a player class, which it's just about to do again with the druid in the upcoming update, The Last of the Druids (0.5.0).</p>
<p>Alongside the new druid class, Grinding Gear Games will introduce a new world (league) for players to play in - something it does in every update. This upcoming league, The Fate of the Vaal, is themed around an ancient Vaal civilization and their lost, time-altering temple that's located somewhere underground. The cool thing is once you find it, you'll have to piece the dungeon together yourself, a bit like you do in the blueprint-adjusting puzzle game Blue Prince, although it's actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/loop-hero-review-round-and-round-the-garden">an indie game from 2021, Loop Hero</a>, the idea is inspired by, Rogers told me.</p>
<p>The autumn Path of Exile 2 update, which includes the new druid class, the new league, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-performance-boost">a significant performance boost for all platforms</a> but especially consoles, arrives 12th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 launched into early access in December 2024</a>, so it's been out for about a year now. What was already a very impressive package back then has only grown since. This is, in my mind, the action RPG to beat.</p>

            <p>A new story trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4">Dawn of War 4</a> has just been revealed, showing off the Dark Angels as a playable sub-faction, and teasing the old and busted Lion El' Johnson who appears to actually be hanging around his kids for once.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us some more context as to why the four playable factions are back on Kronus, with Blood Ravens and Orks clashing like the good ol' days, while the Adeptus Mechanicus explore Necron tombs. We see a variety of units new to the series, including a Chaplan on bike, Necron skorpekh destroyers and an Ork Beastboss.</p>
<p>Lion El' Johnson interestingly enough has his helmet on at the tail end of the trailer, which may have prevented some from noticing his presence in the trailer. However, given we see his shield on full display, that's certainly him!</p>

<p>We also now know that the Dawn of War 4 campaign has been written by Black Library author John French. He's written plenty of Warhammer books over the years. This includes books focused on Ahriman, the first captain of the Thousand Suns legion. There's been a long-running fan theory that the Blood Ravens are successors of the Thousand Sons, so who knows? Maybe John French will drop a breadcrumb or two.</p><p>Other interesting tidbits from the trailer include the fact warboss Gorgutz is still alive and kicking. This makes sense as the Orks canonically were the victors of Dawn of War: Soulstorm, thus Orks would still be milling about the place. The Necrons have been fleshed out a bit too, ironically.</p>
<p>During the campaign, players will be able to pick between Dark Angels and Blood Ravens missions, allowing a degree of choice depending on which Space Marine faction you vibe with the most. These missions are "non-linear" according to the official press release for this story trailer.</p>
<p>Dawn of War 4 is set to release sometime in 2026, though you can wishlist it now! If you want to get an idea of what it's like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-and-it-feels-like-the-sequel-to-the-original-that-rts-fans-always-wanted">why not read our Dawn of War 4 preview</a>. In it, writer Chris Tapsell stated: "it feels like the sequel to the original that RTS fans always wanted".</p>

            <p>A new Den of Wolves gameplay trailer has been revealed at tonight's PC Gaming Show, showcasing fans of 10 Chambers' previous titles tackling a heist within a giant robot factory in the upcoming co-operative FPS.</p>
<p>The trailer, splicing player reactions and gameplay, showcases a little bit of the pre-heist stealth gameplay, as well as live firefights and mechanical Sentinels wiping out the squad. The trailer ends with a call to wishlist the game, with no release date stated.</p>
<p>On the topic of the release date, communications director Robin Björkell and 10 Chambers co-founder Oscar J-T Holm explained why a release date is yet to be provided</p>

<p>Björkell stated: "I've been begging management to give us a release window for Den of Wolves in the trailer - but no. They won't budge. These developers really don't want to make promises they can't keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer. We invited some of our most loyal fans to come to our office and play the game. This is real footage of them playing the game - not scripted, not us playing. The game does exist - ask them"</p><p>Oscar J-T Holm followed up with: "Even though we've not conducted any closed or public playtests yet, Den of Wolves has over half a million wishlists. We're so grateful for our community's support, and we can't wait to show more details about the game. The reason we're shy about communicating a release window yet is that we learned our lesson with GTFO, which was delayed multiple times. We don't think it's fair to communicate fake dates for the sake of getting an announcement out"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gtfo-developer-10-chambers-has-a-co-op-heist-fps-in-pre-production">Den of Wolves was first teased in August 2023</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/den-of-wolves">and later revealed in December that same year</a>. Even then, any hint at a release date was dispelled with a "ready when it's ready" approach. It seems those looking for a new heist game will have to wait patiently a little longer.</p>

            <p>Action role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> is about to get a significant performance boost on all platforms - one that, apparently, will be especially noticeable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X.</p>
<p>The boost comes from a change in the game's code to allow it to utilise multiple CPU cores better, developer Grinding Gear Games explained in a press presentation for the game that I attended.</p>
<p>"The primary issue is CPU load," co-game director Mark Roberts said, "and to address that a lot of things have been optimised, and we have done a lot of work to take advantage of more of your CPU cores. You should see frame-rates at least 25 percent higher, and a lot less bad frame spikes during gameplay. It does make quite a big difference, especially on consoles."</p>

<p>That 25 percent estimate, however, is an understatement, as I found out while talking to the other game director, Jonathan Rogers, in an interview following the presentation.</p>
<p>"The reason why we mentioned consoles specifically is that they tend to have slower CPUs generally," Rogers said, "which means that on console, you are more likely to run into performance problems at endgame compared to players with PCs. And of course on a console, the hardware is the hardware: you can't upgrade it. You can't do anything about it. It is what it is. So we obviously have to make sure that it's good enough in any situation. That's why there was that call-out specifically.</p>
<p>"I would say, if anything, it's understated. I was willing to commit to 25 percent because I know that we're definitely hitting that, but honestly, in a lot of situations, it's straight up double."</p>
<p>Incidentally, those changes naturally benefit Steam Deck performance as well, and while we're on the topic of handheld gaming devices, has Grinding Gear Games given any more thought putting the game on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>?</p>
<p>"I haven't," answered Rogers. "It's been suggested to us a few times, but... Look, it's not like it couldn't happen. It's just it's one of those things where we have a lot to be doing that isn't that right now, unfortunately. At the end of the day, our engine team is only four people, and we've got a lot of platforms to support. It's one of those things that we can look into once I no longer feel like I've got a problem with performance on the other platforms."</p><p>The performance boost will be one of the many game changes coming to Path of Exile 2 on 12th December, as part of a quarterly update. This will bring, notably, a new druid class to the game and a new league (world) with an underground temple you need to piece together yourself, inspired by the indie game of a few years ago, Loop Hero.</p>
<p>But it's another, smaller, incidental detail - besides the performance boost - that's likely to appeal far more immediately to the Path of Exile 2 playerbase, and that's the dispersing of the Delirium fog. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1pe32vr/a_meme_a_day_until_they_make_a_toggle_to_turn_off/">The game's Subreddit is currently covered in memes about this fog</a>, each of which are a variation on 'I can't see anything because of it'.</p>

</span></p><p>Thankfully, Grinding Gear Games has heard your fog-muffled cries, and toned it down "significantly", Rogers said. It's still there because it's a fundamental part of going to a Delirium world, but it's been dramatically altered.</p>
<p>"Part of the reason why it's an issue is because the game currently has Instilling, and the way that Instilling rewards you effectively meant that it was completely mandatory to use. There is no downside to having it so therefore every map should have it, and therefore every map is just grey fog. So the first thing to do is to straight up remove the requirement to use it," he said.</p><p>"But then there's still Delirium, the league, that we still want to be a thing. So for that, we can't really remove the fog entirely, because then Delirium just wouldn't really be anything at that point - it would just suck. So really, what we need to do is make the fog be a nice experience, so that's what you can see in the [presentation] video where we changed it very significantly. It's not nearly the same as it was before. It's much more fine. So it's fixed in two ways: it's not mandatory and when you do get it, it's way less annoying."</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 is currently available in early access on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again">A full 1.0 release</a>, which will include all six Acts in the campaign, will likely not happen until later next year.</p>

            <p>Creative Assembly has revealed Total War: Medieval 3, a new game in the long-running strategy series that's returning to its historical roots to celebrate its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>The second Medieval game was released back in 2006 - since then, the studio has explored multiple time periods and civilisations (most recently Ancient Egypt in Total War: Pharoah), as well as multiple games in the fantastical Warhammer universe.</p>
<p>This newly-announced third Medieval game is currently in pre-production, so there's no release date yet. Creative Assembly promises it will be the "ultimate medieval strategy sandbox" and allows players to "immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before", while its mix of historical authenticity and "unprecedented player agency" mean this isn't just a sequel but "the rebirth of historical Total War".</p>

<p>It certainly sounds ambitious. You can check out the trailer above.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Creative Assembly hasn't forgotten its Warhammer games, which will celebrate their tenth anniversary in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 - Lords of the End Times will be released next summer, introducing four new Legendary Lords into the campaign experience. The first of these is Nagash, the great necromancer.</p>
<p>A free End Times Update is also planned, which will transform the campaign with new scenarios and cataclysmic events. The studio also noted this isn't the end for its Warhammer series, however.</p>

<p>In further news, the studio has developed its proprietary game engine, with a new evolution called Warcore. Not only does this offer more advanced tools for its developers, it means future games will be released on PlayStation and Xbox in addition to PC.</p><p>Lastly, another new game is set to be revealed at The Game Awards next week. It will be the next major release in the series and is "one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history". Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-development-at-creative-assembly">a report suggested the studio was working on Total War: Star Wars</a>, so could this be revealed?</p>
<p>"It's incredible to think Total War is 25 years old," said Roger Collum, vice president of Total War.</p>
<p>"We're extremely grateful that we get to make games that our community get to play for decades, and without them we wouldn't be here. This year was a moment where all Total War fans; old or new, historical or fantasy, could come together and celebrate the exciting next chapter in our story. Here's to 25 more years!"</p>
<p>After the release of Total War: Pharoah, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-apologises-for-missteps-with-total-war-series-offers-pharaoh-refunds">studio apologised for "missteps" and offered partial refunds</a> to players. That followed the high profile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">cancellation of looter shooter Hyenas</a>. As such, the studio is now returning to its roots, perhaps in an attempt to garner goodwill from its players.</p>

            <p>Nvidia's latest <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-geforce-game-ready-driver/">GeForce Game Ready graphics driver update</a> has arrived, bringing with it a fix for performance regressions caused by Microsoft in an October Windows Update, reintroducing PhysX acceleration for RTX 50-series GPUs and providing a rare second pass on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> performance in time for that game's upcoming Winter Offensive update. </p>
<p>Version 591.44 includes the usual laundry list of bug fixes and improvements, including ray tracing changes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, but the Battlefield 6 notes jumped out to me. It's rare to see Nvidia do a significant pass on a game that is generally performing well, and especially to tie it to new post-launch content that only seems to <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-incoming-winter-offensive">feature a single new map and mode</a>. It's possible that the Winter Offensive update also includes new graphical elements that would necessitate specific driver changes on Nvidia's end, though something like that hasn't been hinted at in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-addresses-primary-community-complaint-improves-hit-registrations-and-netcode-ahead-of-winter-offensive-update">recent BF6 updates</a> ahead of the new content's arrival on December 9th. </p>
<p>I also didn't expect to see a fix for the PhysX performance issues that RTX 50-series cards launched with, as Nvidia left out hardware to accelerate 32-bit PhysX on these current generation GPUs. Previously, enabling PhysX effects for particle effects and cloth physics in games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-2">Borderlands 2</a> or Batman: Arkham Oranges lead to disastrous performance, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhK8wbMtivg">cutting down the RTX 5080 and 5090 to sub-60fps</a> readouts in games that otherwise ran at hundreds of frames per second. The new drivers add back in that support on a per-game basis, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> support coming soon and <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce/news/battlefield-6-winter-offensive-geforce-game-ready-driver/">the following titles</a> now supported: </p>
<ul>
<li>Alice: Madness Returns</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</li>
<li>Batman: Arkham City</li>
<li>Batman: Arkham Oranges</li>
<li>Borderlands 2</li>
<li>Mafia II</li>
<li>Metro 2033</li>
<li>Metro: Last Light</li>
<li>Mirror's Edge</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it's also worth noting that this update includes the performance fixes from the recent 581.94 hotfix, which aimed to solve problems caused by a Windows Update (KB5066835) released in October. That Windows Update was meant to improve security, but accidentally tanked performance some games, with users reporting <a href="https://www.pcguide.com/news/nvidias-new-gpu-driver-hotfix-for-windows-11-can-nearly-double-your-fps-benchmark-shows/">their frame-rates halving</a> in games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. If you have experienced poorer-than-expected performance recently, and you haven't already installed the hotfix, I'd certainly give this Nvidia driver a try. </p>

            <p>Replaced, the cyberpunk action-platformer from Belarusian developer Sad Cat Studio, finally has a release date and is set to arrive on PC and Xbox Series X/S on 12th March.</p>
<p>Set in an alternate 1980s, it's got all the trappings of the cyberpunk genre as you can see in the trailer below: a dystopian neon-lit setting; a corrupt, controlling corporation; and flying cars.</p>
<p>But that's all presented in a unique 2.5D style that blends pixel art with environments full of depth.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">studio was forced to delay the game due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2023, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2024">delayed in 2024</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/25d-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2025">delayed once more into 2025</a>. Now it'll be out in 2026.</p>
<p>"It feels great to finally have a set date for the release of Replaced," said game director Yura Zhdanovich. "It's no secret that it's taken longer for us to get here than we initially thought and we want to thank everyone for your continued patience and support. We're looking forward to making it worth your while on March 12th!"</p>
<p>It certainly looks like it will be worth the wait. It's coming to multiple PC stores (Steam, Epic, GOG), and will also be added to Xbox Game Pass.</p>

            <p>Every part of Let it Die: Inferno is bizarre. Visually striking, narratively eccentric, ambitious within the genre it's inhabiting. It may not be the best extraction game I've played this year - by quite a margin I'm afraid - but it's certainly one of the most interesting. It has genuine artistic merit, with a big fat caveat.</p>

<p>Let it Die: Inferno starts off strong. You have died, been implanted into a new body, and signed up for a lifetime of servitude. Waking to a brain-powered robot called Mom and a weeping lady laden with tattoos, you are quickly put to work. You board a capsule, are loaded into a makeshift cannon, and shot into the gates of Hell. What on Earth is going on?</p>
<p>You must forgive the onslaught of story tidbits here, they come just as fast in-game as they do in writing. Down in the Hellgate are monsters galore, treasure aplenty. This includes the Eye of the Reaper, an object so crammed full of SPLithium (think sci-fi energy source) that it could change the course of the world. It's your job to head down there and grab it, meat-puppet that you are.</p>

<p>I give you this brief introduction into the story of Let it Die: Inferno because it's one of the game's more charming quirks. Much like prior entries in the series, the developers are madcap in their approach to worldbuilding and character design. In a genre full of somewhat bland modern military aesthetics and realistic gun porn, going in a vastly different direction is a major perk in and of itself.</p><p>Your base, as it were, is a floating scrap-yard sci-fi hub packed with a gaggle of diverse characters. A throughline of occult magic and a sprinkling of modern apparel creates a setting that isn't really replicated elsewhere. You pull up in a tracksuit to a possessed Nutcracker in a popcorn machine, who'll proceed to build you a giant hammer (of course he does). There's also a handsome guy who's mostly naked, and you can lounge around on a couch while managing your inventory. Sign me up.</p>
<p>Things sadly dip a little bit when you leave your aerial abode and get to actually playing Let it Die: Inferno. Combat itself, for instance, doesn't feel amazing. Things are stiff in places, you plod around rather than traverse the map with much fluidity. Combat feels punchy at times sure, but more often lengthy animations steal the thunder from action-packed moments as you slap immobile melee attacks against foes with the grace of lard plopping on tiled floors.  leaving the whole experience feeling as though it could do with a spurt of grease to smooth things out. Still, that is true of the two prior Let it Die games, so at this point it's perhaps merely an inherent foible of the series. There are moments of pleasure here despite this feeling. Regular blows build up a weapon-specific super metre, for instance, which can be cashed out for explosive Deathblows that are a visual-audio fireworks show I still get a kick out of.</p>
<p>You can get a ladies' portrait as a shield, which didn't feel especially strong at first. However, after some battling about I charged up its Deathblow and unleashed a squirming mass of tentacles that did intense damage to those in front of me. Fighting may feel a bit stiff, but god if it isn't fun.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>What do you think a crab burger tastes like? It looks like a beef burger, but it's a crab so...</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The things you're fighting - giant bugs disguised as plastic playground dolphins, and stumbling piles of boxes with knife-like arms - are pleasing to the eye, somehow. There are scuttling Craburgers that can be killed and scarfed down - a personal favourite. It's hard to look away from the game's grosser corners. I credit this largely to Let it Die: Inferno's ample use of a joyful colour palette. You may be in hell, but this is not some chasm of muted tones, this is a carnival of bright purples, glowing blues, and aggressive oranges. Let it Die: Inferno is both offputting and puzzlingly joyful. At times H.R Giger with a party hat on.</p><p>I must also pay homage to some evolutions on extraction shooter norms here. There is only one map, separated by gates you can only access after collecting a required milestone of SPLithium, and there's a time limit to how long you can spend in one section of course. But this structure encourages you to push ahead as far as you can, for better loot and harder challenges. You can always extract, but a run that's going especially well can blossom into something truly exciting.</p>
<p>I do also love the body swap system. A leitmotif from previous games, each time you die you're inserted into a fresh meaty shell. Different bodies in Let it Die: Inferno are attached to different classes, but if you keep a body alive over consecutive runs you'll be granted permanent boosts to that body. These can be as powerful as the ability to scale new parts of the environment during runs - a real game-changer. And these, alongside most of your equipped gear, are lost on death. Being a scrub and dying stupidly in Let it Die: Inferno can be a soul-searing experience. This is a good thing, by the way. Suffering is honey on the tongue to the extraction game enjoyer.</p>
<p>Time for the downsides. Let it Die: Inferno is a nightmare of microtransactions. You are presented with five body types at the start of the game: two of them are locked behind the Death Metal premium currency. You are given only five gear crafting slots for free, with additional slots unlockable with premium currency. Heals and other consumable items can prove tricky to find during a dive into the Hellgate - but don't worry! You can buy them for, you guessed it, premium currency.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>I mean what can you do but sigh at this?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every Let it Die game has had rancid microtransactions present in some form, so this tragically should not come as a surprise. But I must say, seeing 40 percent of playable bodies locked behind 1,200 Death Metal is a punch to the gut. Especially in a PvP game, and one you've got to pay for. Given you can encounter other players on your runs, how fun do you reckon it would feel to lose your body and loot to some bozo who dropped cash on a host of healing items and equipment? Not great, I suspect.</p><p>Also, there's the AI issue. As of writing, the developers at Supertrick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">have released a statement explaining the use of generative AI</a> in Let it Die: Inferno <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">after receiving backlash</a>. In it, they show all the cases in which it was used, as reference for background art or for voicing some characters. Maybe this is a good enough justification for others, but it still rubs me the wrong way. In a series so beloved for its inventive presentation and artistic merit, why degrade the game in such a way?</p>
<p>There are a pair of puppets called Moz and Gez, who are present in the tutorial and speak to you in garbled Japanese. In the statement made by Supertrick, they justify the use of AI voices by stating: "these characters are mysterious life forms, so AI-generated voices were used again to fit the characters."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>These two are wonderful, yet sadly tarnished.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What are you talking about? Given the track record the team has with finding inventive and often hilarious ways to convey mystery and otherworldliness (shout out to the real human mouths on Let it Die bosses) this does little but water down the appeal. I would rather these limited cases of AI use be absent altogether - they add nothing of value here.</p><p>Let it Die: Inferno is such a strange case for me personally. On some days I felt it was a middling experience I had little desire to engage in. Other days I felt drawn into its world, ensnared by its fresh ideas and wacky presentation. There <em>is</em> gold buried in these hills, but like prior Let it Die games you've got to wade past some pitfalls to see it. I will likely continue to play Let it Die: Inferno out of curiosity, if nothing else, though I doubt my mixed feelings will become any less conflicted.</p>

            <p>Happy late early December everyone! That can only mean one thing: we've opened voting for Eurogamer readers' top 50 games of the year, and a little earlier than last year, too. I'd love there to be a smart reason for this, but it's really because we simply won't have time to collate all the votes and comments and turn them into an article if we leave it any later.</p>
<p>In terms of actual games released, 2025 has been pretty good, I think. There's a nice and varied mix of games making up my personal top 10, so hopefully you'll have plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>As is the usual way, we're asking you for your ranked top five games of the year, with the option to also tell us why each of them had the special sauce. The rules are thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>DLC/expansions are <strong>not</strong> eligible, unless they are playable as 'standalone'</li>
<li>Ongoing games not released in 2025 are also <strong>not</strong> eligible</li>
<li>Ports of games not released in 2025 are also <strong>not</strong> eligible - but we're allowing Switch 2 versions if what's in the new version has been significantly altered/added to.</li>
<li>Games still in Early Access are <strong>not</strong> eligible</li>
<li>Remakes and significant remasters <strong>are</strong> eligible.</li>
<li>Games released from Early Access into '1.0' in 2025 <strong>are</strong> eligible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I attempted to provide you with every game released in 2025 via a dropdown box, but this failed for multiple reasons so we're going the old-fashioned way of typing the names into boxes.</p>
<p>If you are happy to provide your Eurogamer username, your words could form part of our final article. This is set to be published on December 30, a day before Eurogamer's own Game of the Year is revealed. I wonder which is going to have the most embarrassing top 10?</p>
<p>If you could get your votes and comments in by the end of Sunday, 14th December, I (and whoever else is tasked with turning an Excel sheet into a readable article) will be very grateful.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn6Hvv-9yq_M1Mgcsv5eByRd0qRcelSkQZ6IZG5yqSN6bP3A/viewform?usp=publish-editor">the form</a> for your choices, so get voting now (unless you're waiting to play through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and need a few more days with it).</p>
<p>Thanks, as always, for reading - and for sticking with us through 2025 even though we (I) said the Switch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> ports were reasonably priced.</p>

Sega has broached the subject of AI following it latest earnings report, confirming its plans to leverage the technology in development as part of "efficiency improvements". However, it also says it intends to proceed "carefully" in order to identify "appropriate" uses.
</p>
<p>
The company shared its perspective during a Q&amp;A session coinciding with its Q2 earnings report, responding to a question inquiring if it would pursue larger projects or efficiency. "Rather than fully following the trend toward the large-scale development," its executives explained in an <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20251203_q2_major_QA_e.pdf">official translation</a>, "we will also pursue efficiency improvements, such as leveraging AI."
</p>
<p>
It also acknowledged the "strong resistance" AI adoption can face in "creative areas such as character creation", adding it intends to "proceed by carefully assessing appropriate use cases". It suggested one such area might include "streamlining the development processes" but did not elaborate further.
</p>
<p>
Sega is, of course, far from the only publisher to weigh in on AI in recent times, with some companies being less cautious than others. EA CEO Andrew Wilson, for instance, has boasted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">AI is "the very core of our business"</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has taken a more measured approach, calling artificial intelligence an "oxymoron" and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-couldnt-be-made-by-ai-suggests-take-two-boss-there-is-no-creativity-that-can-exist-by-definition-in-any-ai-model">saying</a> "no creativity... can exist by definition in any AI model." Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/execs-pushing-ai-not-humane-creative-rockstar-co-founder-mad-cow-disease">compared the technology to "mad cow disease"</a>, describing the execs pushing it as "not the most humane or creative people".
</p><p>
Even so, a recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development. One of those studios - Let it Die: Inferno developer Supertrick Games - this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">faced the issue head on</a> after receiving significant criticism for its extensive use of generative AI.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> - the ever-lasting sci-fi action MMORPG - is at a turning point. Nearing the release of The Old Peace update, players will be able to look back through memory at an integral part of Warframe's history. There will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-destiny-heres-how-warframe-makes-us-care-about-its-space-stuff">narrative twists</a>, new weapons to collect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-is-getting-two-new-protoframes-and-yes-theyre-romanceable">and people to romance</a>, and perhaps most intriguing of all a suite of ultimate abilities called Tauron Strikes.</p>
<p>These ultimates stem from Tetkolyst artifacts, a new tier of armament which offer cinematic attacks for each of the game's six focus schools. Fans of the game will already be familiar with one, a giant sword introduced at Tennocon earlier this year. The rest are equally enticing: one is even a Kamehameha.</p>
<p>Why and how were these made? How big of a game-changer are they for Warframe, and just what inspired the over-the-top animations that go alongside them? To find out, Eurogamer sat down with Warframe game director Rebecca Ford for an interview which you can read below.</p>

<figcaption>Here's the teaser trailer for The Old Peace here!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2a4_rkcbyM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p><strong>Eurogamer:</strong> How did the idea of these big new ultimate attacks come about?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "Whenever you ask the big broad question I always like to look back to find out when the first time it was brought up. My recollection is that I really wanted to do focus ultimates that were very anime-inspired, ways for each school to have this potent culmination of their respective traits. I can see that all the way back in February they were brought up as a concept! Pablo (game design director) was asking what we wanted them to be and, this is such an obvious answer from my brain, but I was like: 'Giant sword. How do we get a giant sword?'</p>
<p>"It's like a balsamic glaze reduction, you just boil something down until it's this sickly sweet or sour version of itself. That's what the focus school ultimates feel like, they're each a teaspoon of concentrated combat prowess."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: Anime-inspired! </strong>In the Tennocon show earlier this year Final Fantasy came up as an inspiration for these, and some of the poses made seem vaguely Jojo's Bizarre Adventure esq… What were the specific inspirations here?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "We needed to go into the direction of - we have five focus schools and each of them need a signature weapon. Naramon was very easy because it's a melee school and a giant sword would do the trick. We were looking into moments where the protagonists of an anime would bring out a giant sword for this big attack, as a kind of animation and presentation base for that.</p><p>"Things started to get a bit more sensible as we started to look at our favourite inspirations - I don't want to say tropes - for flavour. The bow and arrow came from us, that was our own Warframe slice. We know we wanted Vazarin - our healing school - to have a staff. This mage moment came a lot from Frieren. For the hammer: everyone loves a giant rockin' hammer.</p>
<p>"Zenurik was the hardest one. We wanted it to be a Kamehameha. It had to be an energy beam attack, but it needed a conduit. We actually have an anime channel at work, and one of our designers said: 'oh my god we could just do a book, a tome'. So we got the page doing the beam attack, it came through for us. It's a little bit of a Nier: Replicant throwback with Grimoire Weiss."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>There's nothing like striking a pose and letting your warframe do the work. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Digital Extremes</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer:</strong> How do you make these play into the fantasy of each school, aside from just the aesthetics?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "Sometimes it's the wanting, it's the cooldown. You can only do it so many times every five minutes. But it's all in figuring out what the best in to cycle it into your gameplay. You'll use it when you want a lot of damage, and the secondary buffs that come with it. It's truly like casting an 'ultimate' - it's something we've never done this aggressively in Warframe.</p><p>"We used to have ultimates that animation-locked you, but Warframe got too fast for watching these drawn out attacks. We got rid of it for Ash when you use to do his Bladestorm. But we're going back to try it out, there was this tug of war around how long these would be. At Tennocon, we showed off this 16-second-cast. That will never ship, we just needed to show off what we were making. Three seconds is way too short, so we're right in the middle at around six seconds. Each represents an attribute of the focus school and as you upgrade these via the skill tree you hone in on these attributes."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: </strong>How do you anticipate these ultimates will impact the way general action will work in Warframe going forward, now that players have a new tool to use?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "They're really meant to work well in the 12-minute war. That's been proven at this point with the grappling points and other new things present there. As far as people bringing it back to the regular world, I feel it's just a user expression thing. If you want to do something lethal, you'd be able to do it on a cooldown we assign. There's nothing really anything in the game with cooldowns, aside from your Necramech. So if anything, it'll make things more accessible depending on where you are in the game."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer:</strong> How is it balanced for Conclave?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "You f- You know the answer to that, it's not! I don't even know if you can do… I don't even know if you can use Operators in Conclave, can you?"</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer:</strong> I don't know!</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "I don't think you can. That's embarrassing for me. I literally don't even know if you can. Lol."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: </strong>Do you now have to design encounters in the future with these ultimates in mind? Are there considerations that have to be made?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "It will impact it in the same way all these vertical levels of power growth do, in that we're aware of it and we account for it. The way we handle this case is by attaching a more significant cooldown than with anything we've ever done.</p><p>"We know what we're doing next year and it's all figured out. So this is like a dance move you can bust out, a big animation with a big number at the end of it. You can measure it, and address it systemically."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Recalling the past, new narrative twists will be revealed later this month. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Digital Extremes</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: </strong>One final question on this: why is it valuable to have the big narrative lead-up to obtaining one of these weapons? What do you gain from taking this approach?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "Honestly, it's completely a creative choice derived from the myth of excalibur. We don't really have a lot of named legendary weapons in Warframe. We have the Paracesis, we have Broken War / War. There are all the primes and some quest weapons that are important, but it felt as though we hadn't delved into the world of 'relic weapons'.</p><p>"The experience of designing these felt as though we had hit a tier of legendary weapons that we hadn't hit before. It was a full commitment to flavour. It adds a level of attachment to these new weapons, and also provides an opportunity for us to make new ones. There could be another ancient book. It's a new school of things we can keep expanding."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: </strong>What makes a weapon legendary?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "It's the ceremony. I just came back from England. There's something to be said about ritual and celebration. Like, the crown jewels. What makes that legendary? You know what they represent, there's such a potency there. Some games do it so well, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>! You know what Sephiroth or Cloud's swords are. I love how unique this feels for Warframe - it's like an untouched diamond mine for us."</p>
<hr>
<p>Warframe's next update - The Old Peace - in which Tauron Strikes and a variety of other new features will be making their dubut is set to launch on the 10th December. You can play Warframe on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Mobile. The game is also coming to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> some time next year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-studio-would-love-to-do-a-proper-switch-2-version-but-its-still-waiting-on-a-dev-kit-so-if-you-know-anyone">after Digital Extremes struggled to get dev kits for the hardware earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <p>
Skyblivion - the ambitious, highly anticipated mod remaking the entirety of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion using Skyrim's engine - won't hit its originally anticipated 2025 release, its development team has confirmed, with the project now expected next year.
</p>
<p>
Developer TESRenewal originally announced its 2025 release target back in 2023, but in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc">new update video</a>, project lead Rebelzize confirmed the delay, explained the team still has "some last challenges to overcome that are going to require a little bit more time."
</p>
<p>
"This is something we have known for a while," he continued, "but we did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project." To that end, the remainder of the eight-and-a-half-minute video takes a closer look at its current state, with Rebelzize stressing many parts are now "in great shape".

</div><figcaption>Will Skyblivion really be better than Oblivion Remastered?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmspR2xIL38" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Skyblivion's world map is "100 percent finished", for instance, and the team has <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">uploaded an interactive satellite version of the map</a> for closer perusal. Similarly, all quest dungeons, which have been remade for the project, are complete, while the remaining random dungeons are "mostly finished".
</p><p>
As for other key elements, interiors for houses, shops, castles, stables, inns, and chapels are complete, but there's still some work to be done on the Imperial City before they can all find a home. It sounds like the Imperial City - which is still awaiting final assets - is the last major roadblock as far as locations go. Other cities are complete and the studio believes it'll have all locations wrapped up and ready to go by the end of this year, at which point it can focus on quest finalisation, navmesh work, and QA as 2026 gets underway.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, weapons, armour, clothing, plants, clutter, and the majority of architecture assets are complete, meaning 3D modelling work is virtually done, leaving a few low priority assets to go. Additionally, UI work continues, with the team transitioning to a more Skyrim-like interface, and the mechanics team is said to be making "solid progress" as it focuses on enhancing player experience, based on feedback from the team. Most major systems are anticipated to be complete by the end of the year, and the goal is to open Skyblivion out for wider play-testing at a later date. The team has, however, hit a snag with cinematics, and is seeking volunteers to finish a major scene.
</p>
<p>
Once major work is complete, Rebelzize says the goal is to spend "as much time as possible polishing, balancing, and fixing" ready for launch day. And that work will likely continue after release, as it addresses issues spotted by players once they get their hands on the game. Additionally, there are robust plans for post-release updates, with the team hoping to implement custom content, original Oblivion DLC such as Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine, and other features - including spell crafting, Oblivion-like UI reskins, dynamic dungeons, grave robbing, increased creature variety, followers and hirelings, more unique weapons and armours, additional unique spells, and more.
</p>
<p>
One previously discussed element that won't make release is underwater combat. Despite getting the feature "partially working", the team opted to drop it due to conflicts with animation mods and other technical issues. There is, however, still hope it can be revisited and added at a later date. 
</p><p>
"We thank you all for your continued support of this ambitious project I started more than ten years ago," Rebelzize concludes. "And I really, genuinely cannot wait to get Skyblivion into your hands". Following today's delay announcement, the mod is expected to launch sometime next year.

            <p>Arrowhead trusts the newly-announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film director, and has shut down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Fast &amp; Furious' Justin Lin would be taking the director reins for Sony's upcoming Helldivers adaptation</a>, which will be based on Arrowhead's game. On this announcement, it was revealed that Lin is not a gamer himself, and actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>

<p>However, while this move was clearly enough to win over those within the film business, it caused a bit of scepticism with some over on the game's Discord server. In fact, one user tagged Arrowhead's studio head Shams Jorjani asking if they could direct the adaptation instead.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Jorjani did not take the user up on the offer, and instead showed his support for Lin's work. "Let Justin Lin work his magic," <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1445530210098352138">Jorjani replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a further exchange, another member of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> Discord asked the Arrowhead exec to ensure Lin "plays the game at least once" or checks out some gameplay footage. Again, Jorjani affirmed that Lin is the right person for the job.</p>
<p>"I trust Justin," the Helldivers 2 CEO said, adding: "He did a great job on the Star Trek movie."</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the fantastic musical action game, is losing Denuvo anti-tamper support early next year, according to a post on the game's official Steam page.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">The post</a>, succinct in scope, announced suddenly that the software would be removed in a mandatory patch on the 16th January, 2026. However, it also states the game's own anti-tamper measures will still remain in place, so it shouldn't become totally unguarded from tampering hands.</p>
<p>The reason why? Well, the post gives the following justification: "This adjustment is intended to provide a more stable and efficient service environment. We sincerely appreciate all players who continue to support the game through legitimate use."</p>

<p>So important is this update in the eyes of developer Tango Gameworks that Hi-Fi Rush will apparently not launch unless this patch has been installed. The comments responding to this Steam post are largely filled with fans celebrating the removal of Denuvo. The software has proven controversial for a variety of reasons - one of them being the online connection requirement which has rubbed folks the wrong way over the years.</p><p>We do know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-sequel-being-considered-positively-but-tango-gameworks-considering-various-opportunities">Tango Gameworks is considering a Hi-Fi Rush sequel, among other potential projects</a>. It had been in development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-already-in-development-six-months-when-krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks">for six months at the point when Krafton bought the studio</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-hi-fi-rush-redfall-sign-game-pass-xbox-publishing-model-failing">Tango Gameworks' sudden closure by Microsoft</a>. In recent news, new-owners Krafton has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">its intention to become an "AI-first" company</a> - good luck Tango!</p>
<p>If you've not tried out Hi-Fi, we recommend you remedy that as soon as possible. You can give <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's review</a> a read for an idea of what you've been missing, in which Ed Nightingale wrote: "Vibrant and self-assured, Hi-Fi Rush happily embraces the 00s' cheese - and is all the better for it."</p>

            <p>Supertrick Games, the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno, which launches today, has issued a statement on the game's AI use following controversy from earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">Let it Die: Inferno's AI disclosure on Steam</a>, which suggested substantial use of generative AI during development, across art, music, and voice, but it did not specify in detail exactly how AI had been used. The statement issued in response to the reaction provides that detail, and in general, the game's AI use seems less than suspected.</p>
<p>For example, the game does use generative AI to create the voices of two characters, but these characters are an AI-driven machine and a "mysterious life form", so the AI-generated voices were a deliberate, creative choice to fit the character, rather than a cost-cutting exercise.</p>

<p>"These specific cases use AI-generated voices intentionally to match the nature of the characters," the statement read. "These voices are not derived from or modeled after any human performers, ensuring no copyright concerns." Otherwise, "All in-game characters are voiced by human performers."</p><p>AI-generated art was used, meanwhile, "to generate rough base images" for background posters, InfoCast (news) insert images and in-game reading material, which the team's artists then "painted over, refined, and adjusted by hand". The AI tool also apparently helped the team observe copyright laws, although there's no explanatory detail on how.</p>
<p>Finally with regards to music, AI was used to begin the creation process for music you'll hear in the background in Iron Perch. Specifically, and I don't really understand this, so excuse my lack of sound creation technicalities, AI was used to generate stems, which I believe are collections of audio tracks, or mixes. "Once all stems were exported," the statement read, "few were manually edited, but most were rebuilt from scratch."</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">eccentric and asymmetrical multiplayer game Let it Die</a>, by Suda51's studio Grasshopper - Supertrick was a co-creator. This new game ditches the asymmetrical multiplayer idea for direct, real-time multiplayer, in an on-trend PvEvP framework. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/#app_reviews_hash">Initial reviews on Steam don't seem to be positive</a>, however, with a Mixed overall response.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has been banned in Russia, accused of distributing LGBTQ+ propaganda and terrorism-related extremist materials.</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor, the Russian watchdog for communications and censorship, described Roblox as "rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children". It also flagged reports of sexual harassment of children.</p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate," a Roblox spokesperson told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a>, "and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added Roblox has "a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor has a track record of restricting access to Western media and tech it deems to be in breach of Russian laws, from Duolingo to WhatsApp and Telegram. Last week, the watchdog <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-threatens-full-ban-whatsapp-tass-reports-2025-11-28/">threatened to block WhatsApp entirely</a>.</p>
<p>Russia has of course long had anti-LGBT laws in place, in 2013 banning the "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors.</p>
<p>Yet Roblox also has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>, with a report last year claiming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">platform had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a>. This year, Roblox has been steadily improving its safety standards, most recently <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">requiring age checks for all those wishing to communicate through the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Russia isn't the first country to ban Roblox. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">Türkiye also banned access to the platform last year</a> to "ensure the protection of our children".</p>
<p>"We've spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do," said a Roblox spokesperson to Eurogamer at the time.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">Roblox boss David Baszucki appeared on the New York Times podcast Hard Fork to discuss safety measures</a>, but he described the problem of predators on the platform as an "opportunity", in what amounted to a disastrous interview.</p>

            <p>Dispatch studio AdHoc knew it was taking a risk releasing the game in weekly episodic installments, and was actually advised not to do it. However, the studio did it anyway, and the risk paid off.</p>
<p>AdHoc itself has been around for seven years, with its superhero workplace comedy being in full production for three of those. Dispatch is the studio's first game, so it was understandably a big deal when its first episodes were released back in October of this year.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"Seven years, <em>one </em>game," AdHoc's CEO and executive producer Michael Choung reflected in a recent interview with <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1">Knowledge</a>, before adding: "But what's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a videogame, all meshing and rubbing up against each other."</p>
<p>The studio exec noted the team decided it wanted to go with a completely original narrative driven episodic format, and was not simply about making life easy for them. "And part of it was because we weren't really thinking about feasibility," Choung said. "We were just thinking in terms of creative and player experience."</p>
<p>But, while this approach worked for AdHoc and Dispatch, Choung admitted releasing the game in one go would have been "the conventional wisdom".</p>
<p>"Everyone was telling us not to do it," Choung said of the game's episodic format. "We had internal debates about it but the story was always structured that way." So while other release cadences were floated - such as bringing the game out in two halves or even one episode per week - the studio eventually settled on two episodes, once a week.</p><p>"A lot of the reasons for it we're now seeing the results of," Choung furthered. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered." The developer remarked that we have been seeing this kind of release schedule with TV series for decades now.</p>
<p>"We knew that it gives a 'the train is leaving the station, but not just yet - I can still make it' kind of feeling across weeks, and people catch on. When we look at concurrent user numbers across the drops, it's exactly that - it just kept doubling every week. Again, conventional wisdom says: whatever you guys do in the first week, the second week is going to be half that number. It was literally the opposite. Those things, we anticipated.</p>
<p>"I don't think we anticipated the scale of it."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>But while Dispatch has seen immense success with its release schedule, Choung admits this is not something every studio should now attempt, especially if there isn't the creative backbone to support it. "It's insane to do," he said. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!"</p><p>The exec continued: "If the creative is strong, you can cut it up however you like, and it probably is going to make it through, even if it's a poor decision. If we'd said, 'We're just going to release the whole thing', it probably would have done ok. But it probably wouldn't have been as big as this… If you go episodic with a not-so-great story, you're flirting with people that aren't attracted to you whatsoever."</p>
<p>But while Choung cautioned releasing a game with an episodic format, he said if others did try, AdHoc would of course "be thrilled if it worked out".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p><p>Meanwhile last month, AdHoc said it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">no interest in using AI to replace voice actors or game development</a>. "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," creative director Nick Herman said, before adding: "Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p>

            <p>
Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has recently being doing the rounds to chat about to his company Absurd Ventures, and his latest tidbit from his time at the Grand Theft Auto studio is the surprisingly revelation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> perhaps owes as much to Victorian literature as it does cowboy films.
</p>
<p>
"I binged on Victorian novels for that," he explains in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/03/i-binged-on-victorian-novels-dan-houser-on-dickens-red-dead-redemption-and-redefining-open-world-games">new interview with the Guardian</a>. "I listened to the audiobook of [George Elliot's] Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day. I loved it."
</p>
<p>
As to why Houser turned to this perhaps unexpected source of inspiration, he explained, "I wanted [Red Dead Redemption 2] to feel from the writing perspective, slightly more novelistic. I thought that was a way of doing something new on the story side – and the game was going to look so pretty, the art was so strong, I thought the story had better really set it up."

<p>
It was his search for the right tone that ultimately led him not just to Middlemarch, but other Victorian fiction, including Sherlock Holmes. And as he noted elsewhere, big 19th-century novels perhaps have more in common with open-world games than is immediately obvious, bringing a "sense of slightly spread out storytelling" that's paralleled in the likes of GTA.
</p><p>
Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">departed Rockstar Games in 2020</a>, formally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiled his new media company Absurd Ventures</a> in 2023. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">currently working on A Better Paradise</a>, charting the "ill-fated development of an ambitious but addictive video game project that goes very wrong", which so far spans a novel and podcast series, with a TV series and game on the way.
</p>
<p>
It's also developing a new crime fiction universe, American Caper, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">Absurdaverse</a>, a "story-driven action-comedy adventure game".

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has agreed to halt all promotion and public testing of Light of Motiram - the post-apocalyptic open-world survival game Sony previously accused of being a "slavish clone" of PlayStation's Horizon series in a lawsuit - as the two companies battle it out in court.
</p>
<p>
Light of Motiram, developed by Tencent's Polaris Quest studio, emerged at the end of last year, and its accompanying images - featuring mechanised animal-like creatures and very Aloy like key character art - immediately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">drew comparisons with Horizon</a>. And Sony agreed, mounting legal action against Tencent, who it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">accused of copyright and trademark infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, we've had a bit of back-and-forth - Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">accused Sony</a> of seeking an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions", a claim Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">called "nonsense"</a> - and Tencent even went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">quietly update Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> to tone down the more "egregious" Horizon similarities. But the lawsuit rumbles on.

<p>
Sony wants the court to block Light of Motiram from sale when its legal hearing gets underway next year, but in the interim Tencent has agreed to keep the game out of the spotlight. As <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">reported by TheGamePost</a>, Tencent this week submitted a new California court filing agreeing there will be "no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram" while Sony's injunction request is being argued. This is part of a deal in which Sony will give Tencent more time to respond to its injunction motion.
</p><p>
"SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agreed, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction," the filing reads, "(b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the Light of Motiram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary injunction".
</p>
<p>
TheGamePost notes Sony and Tencent have jointly requested the court hearings - covering both Sony's injunction request and Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit - be moved to the same day in January next year.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update, which is set to go live on the 9th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171?s=20">Announced in a Battlefield Comms post</a>, the developers have stated that work continues to enhance both components of online play. This is especially noteworthy as issues surrounding both online netcode and hit registration have been points of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to build on our work to make hit registration feel consistent, reliable, and predictable during every engagement," the post states. "With this update, we have improved how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including cases where shots were fired while transitioning into a zoom. These improvements correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and the readability of where your shots were landing. We have also made updates to better handle high-density combat scenarios to ensure bullets register more reliably when multiple players are fighting in close proximity."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the new Battlefield 6 update has included additional gameplay adjustments to better the overall experience of getting into a firefight. The post elaborates: "In parallel, we have tightened the clarity of damage feedback so that health UI changes and damage cues feel more immediate and easier to understand during combat. While this is separate from Netcode itself, improving how damage is presented plays a key role in making hit registration feel responsive and intuitive.
</p><p>"Lastly, we have resolved an issue where clients could briefly display certain pieces of geometry as intact even though they had already been destroyed on the server. Fixing this eliminates cases where incoming damage could appear to pass through walls."</p>
<p>Other improvements include a general tweak to soldier visibility. There have also been adjustments to various weapons including changes to weapon-handling, first shot accuracy and more. Certain game modes include Rush and Breakthrough have also been altered to improve the attacker flow, aiming to stop oversaturation when it comes to defending objectives.</p>
<p>Finally, the post pledges further improvements to "clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat". So it seems as though this continued string of gameplay shifts from EA and Battlefield Studios won't be stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>This update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of games post-launch were cheater free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>

            <p>Amazon's upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> from Pheobe Waller-Bridge will interconnect with the video games, rather than being a standalone story with its own continuity in the vein of the Angelina Jolie films.</p>
<p>This latest nugget of Tomb Raider-laced information comes from Story Kitchen, a production company tied to the series.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As shared on the <a href="https://www.story-kitchen.com/projects/tombraider">company's website</a>, and spotted by social media account <a href="https://x.com/infinityTRaider">Infinity Tomb Raider</a>, the deal between Story Kitchen and Amazon MGM studios "will reinvent the franchise on a massive scale, interconnecting a new live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe".</p>
<p>Along with the show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon's game department is also assisting on the next mainline Tomb Raider entry with developer Crystal Dynamics</a>. Story Kitchen's wording here could therefore suggest that whichever comes first - the show or the game - will perhaps lead into the other somehow, or at least drop some clues at what Tomb Raider fans can perhaps expect from the franchise's future.</p><p>It will also be interesting to see how Amazon's interconnecting of the games will differ from what Netflix did with its own Tomb Raider animated series, The Legend of Lara Croft. This series took place after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-series-ptsd-focus-was-something-game-writers-werent-allowed-to-explore-rhianna-pratchett-says">brief  flashbacks to Lara's time on Yamatai from the 2013 reboot</a>. Meanwhile, both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Jonah and Sam from this trilogy of games make an appearance in Netflix's Tomb Raider animated series</a>.</p>
<p>However, other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, we are yet to find out which other characters from the Tomb Raider series more generally will be popping up in Amazon's live-action adventure. Will Turner's Lara also meet those from earlier games such as Jonah? Or even someone like Werner Von Croy, Lara's former mentor who popped up in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a>? </p>
<p>The wording from Story Kitchen doesn't make it totally clear which games, past or future, it will be unifying. It's unclear if the company is referring to Amazon and Crystal Dynamics' new game in the franchise, or if it will be canon with previous games in the series.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-adds-another-major-cast-member">actor Martin Bobb-Semple was cast in Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider series</a>, but as who remains to be seen (though, some have speculated he will play tech-expert Zip).</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will hear more information about Amazon's Tomb Raider series and game soon!</p>

            <p>Antireal, the artist at the heart of a plagiarism scandal involving Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, has posted a statement on social media indicating the saga has come to a close.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?s=20">Antireal posted the following tweet</a>: "The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction." There has been no follow-up by Antireal elaborating on the situation, nor has any statement been released <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame">on the official Marathon social media account</a>.</p>
<p>This appears to be the end of Marathon's plagiarism woes. Some, responding to Antireal's statement, are speculating that it was made as part of a deal between Antireal and Bungie / Sony. However, this has not been verified.</p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Antireal first posted a lengthy breakdown</a> of where their art appeared in Marathon's first public Closed Beta back in May of this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Following this, Bungie announced an investigation into the matter</a>, eventually admitting that yes, Antireal's art had been used during the development of Marathon. Following this controversy as well as the mixed reception to its initial beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">morale at Bungie was reportedly in freefall</a>, though it is worth noting vast changes have been made to the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">in the run up to its release in March, 2026</a>.</p><p>Marathon's cinematic short director also chipped in last month, stating in now-deleted social media posts that the plagiarism scandal was "blown out of proportion". He also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-not-ai-oscar-winning-marathon-cinematic-short-director-hits-back-at-online-accusations">pushed back passionately against claims that AI was used in the creation of the frankly fantastic looking cinematic he directed</a>.</p>

            <p>
Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione's first-person narrative horror Horses has received a last-minute ban from the Epic Games Store. Epic was one of several storefronts confirmed to have approved a build for release when news of Horses' ban from Steam emerged, but it has now reversed its decision, citing what Santa Ragione calls "broad and demonstrably incorrect claims".
</p>
<p>
Horses unfolds across 14 days on a farm where humans are held captive as "horses", using the imagery to explore what Santa Ragione describes as "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility". Last week, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">revealed Steam had refused to distribute Horses</a> - citing concerns around an early, unfinished build, and declining to reappraise the game once it was finished. Despite Valve's rejection, Horses was approved for distribution on all other major PC storefronts, but Epic has now made an eleventh hour reversal.

<p>
In an <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17">FAQ discussing the U-turn</a> on its website, Santa Ragione says it received notification from Epic 24 hours before Horses' release, the storefront explaining it would no longer distribute the game after its "review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines". Epic's email specifically referenced its policies around "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content" - saying Horses contravenes guidelines prohibiting content that "promotes abuse and animal abuse", that "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour or [that is] not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated". On this latter point, Epic said it had filled out an IARC Questionnaire based on the content it reviewed, receiving an Adult Only (AO) rating - a rating category it does not distribute on its storefront.
</p><p>
Epic noted Santa Ragione had several options, including updating Horses to ensure compliance and resubmitting it for review. However, the studio says Epic did not specifically highlight the content it had found objectionable, nor would it have been possible to make significant changes so close to launch.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Santa Ragione chose to immediately appeal Epic's decision, addressing each of the storefront's concerns. It noted the "four brief" sex scenes featured in Horses - two occurring "mainly off camera" - are censored using pixellation, use "stylised and unrealistic" animations, and do not involve involve genitalia. As to Epic's other point, Santa Ragione stressed Horses "does not promote abuse (including animal abuse)" and is rather a "strong critique of violence and abuse in general." It also reiterated that its own IARC submission - filed "more than five weeks" before release - resulted in PEGI 18 and ESRB M ratings, as displayed on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Epic's Horses page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione says it then received an automated response from Epic 12 hours later rejecting its appeal, with the storefront insisting it had determined its original decision was "appropriately applied and will remain in place". It remains unclear what prompted Epic's apparent decision to instigate a last-minute re-review of Horses; Santa Ragione insists the storefront had received and reviewed a build two months ago, with its final achievements-ready build being approved for release 18 days prior to launch. Eurogamer has contacted Epic for comment on the story.
</p>
<p>
Horses continues to be available via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a> and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch.io</a>, where it costs £3.99/$4.99. Epic's decision has temporarily impacted its availability on Humble, but Santa Ragione says it's received confirmation from Humble that it will still be distributing the game - although a build is yet to go live.
</p><p>If you're curious about Horses itself, I reviewed it earlier this week ahead of launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">awarding it four out of five stars</a> and calling it a "rallying cry against hypocrisy, institutional or otherwise, and one that feels particularly potent right now, as puritanism and anti-intellectualism continue to exert themselves".

            <p>Fresh footage of Resident Evil Requiem was shown on Japanese television, and it's very reminiscent of classic series gameplay.</p>
<p>The footage was part of a special programme, and has been shared on social media by series insider Dusk Golem.</p>
<p>It's only thirty seconds long, but it shows protagonist Grace Ashcroft exploring a creepy mansion in third-person, shooting at zombies before being grabbed and nibbled on.</p>

<p>It's not much to go on, admittedly, and that description alone probably sounds incredibly trite. But it does suggest a return to the sort of gameplay and setting that made Resident Evil such a popular series, which will be music to the ears of longtime fans.</p>
<p>Specifically, it looks very reminiscent of Resident Evil 1 - although that's likely not the iconic Spencer Mansion we'll be exploring.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There was some new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television. <a href="https://t.co/FToPeqi4HW">pic.twitter.com/FToPeqi4HW</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996158141793489389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>

<p>Dusk Golem clarified the footage will be from a censored Japanese version, which typically censors headshots and dismemberment, for example.</p>
<p>The mainline series has strayed from its roots somewhat from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> onwards, experimenting with new settings, new perspectives, and new protagonists. Resident Evil Requiem, meanwhile, seems to be attempting to appease a wide spectrum of fans: there's a new protagonist, but linked to the older games; it allows players to shift between first and third-person perspectives; and it returns to Racoon City at last. </p>
<p>Now we know there's a new mansion to explore, to boot.</p>
<p>Further, producer Masato Kumazawa <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who">confirmed characters from previous games in the series will return</a>, though told fans not to "over-expect or hype it". Fans have long been speculating the return of series favourite Leon Kennedy, but we still don't know for sure if he'll appear.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass this year, with game director Guillaume Broche stating the subscription service allowed the studio to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>The stat, shared on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">Xbox Wire</a>, is based on the number of unique users in the first 30 days of the game's availability, meaning it made an immediate impact on the service.</p>
<p>"This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it's down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality," said Broche. "It's really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream."</p>

<p>Broche added the game's inclusion on Game Pass let "a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before".</p>
<p>He continued: "The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realise there's a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren't expecting it at first."</p><p>Expedition 33 also released on PC and PlayStation 5 at the same time as its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass. In its first three days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">the game sold a million copies</a>. It then reached the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">fitting milestone of 3.3m copies in a month</a>; most recently, the studio announced it had sold over 5m copies worldwide across all formats. Presumably, the number of overall players is even larger thanks to Game Pass.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">stiff competition at launch with the surprise release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which also released on Game Pass. However, publisher Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan said "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>
<p>Xbox will be keen for positivity around Game Pass following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price hike earlier this year</a>. And while Expedition 33 is a success for the subscription, without actual numbers it's hard to ascertain how it compares with other platforms. Still, it's further proof <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-xbox-game-pass-dies-then-well-have-lost-one-of-gamings-best-tools-for-discovery">Game Pass remains a great tool for discovery</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">An update is in the works for Expedition 33</a>, which Broche teased to Eurogamer will have "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well". He also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">reflected on the game's success</a>, stating the team is "incredibly moved and grateful at how big [the game] got and how it emotionally resonated with people".</p>

            <p>I've got an issue with people saying 'turn-based games are back, baby'. For those with the eyes to see, they never went away. Yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor Refantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> might have reminded the masses that tactical min/maxing is video game catnip, and that there are so many brain-scratching things you can do with the formula, but the past few generations has been rife with gems in the genre: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeon-encounters-review-all-star-team-assembles-for-one-of-square-enixs-most-fascinating-rpgs-in-an-age">Dungeon Encounters</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chained-echoes">Chained Echoes</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a> immediately spring to mind, but there are dozens more, too.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> 0 has come at a tough time. To stand tall amongst the wealth of RPGs we've had over the past five years alone would be a mammoth task, let alone coming after the first two games in the Octopath series, which are juggernauts in their own right. To make things even harder for the third attempt at the series, Octopath Traveler 0 is a 'reimagining' of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mobile-game-octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent-due-this-year">mobile gacha game, Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</a>. The bones of this mobile effort are still propping up all the flesh of 0, for better and - mostly - worse.</p>
<p>The core of Octopath Traveler 0 is made up of three story arcs, dubbed 'Masters Of': there's power, wealth, and fame, and whilst the first 30 or so hours of the game have you working through each of these tales incrementally, the latter portion of the game (probably about 70 hours) dovetails into something more linear. I like this. I found the eight very separate narratives in the original game a bit jarring and arrhythmic, this feels more in line with the second game's attempt to write a story that's more cohesive and put-together.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Break stuff. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Initially, these stories were separate arcs you could churn through in Champions of the Continent, and whilst 0 does an adequate job of finding a through-line to connect them, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has not managed to erase their standalone nature in the final product. It is fun to struggle through level-appropriate arcs in one breath, and then go and obliterate weaker bosses in early stages of other tales, but it never feels that rewarding to do so: the experience scaling is pretty brutal, so going back overpowered often feels like it leaves you at a disadvantage. You're better cycling through the stories as you go, which summons that feeling of arrhythmia from the first game. It's a shame, really.</p><p>The writing is pretty decent, and I even played a lot of this game with English dub (something I tend not to do in most Japanese RPGs because, frankly, the VO is usually awful). But, similarly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> from earlier this year, the English voice work is superb, and engaging, and natural. The art, too, is gorgeous. I've been playing on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and running in handheld, it looks incredibly pretty. Particular credit goes to the locations and world map, painted by Italian painter and cartographer Francesca Baerald. Using the talents of an actual honest-to-God cartographer makes the whole thing feel Tolkien-esque, and given the setting of Osterra is a big part of the game's driving force, it's money and time well-spent.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Rebuilt this city. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a shame about the rest of it, then. The piecemeal nature of the original mobile game is evident no matter where you look. Even giving you a hometown that you have to rebuild (which puts me in mind of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bravely-default">Bravely Default</a>, actually) does little to plaster over the very obvious joins in the facade. As you meander from story to story, you can just feel how different bits have been glued together, the only constant being your team of heroes that are getting stronger and more bullish as you dispatch the various political, social, and religious evils that plague the fair land of Osterra.</p>
<p>In a year when we've seen such lofty and emotionally-driven stories such as Tactics and Clair Obscur, it feels archaic and a little misguided. The eventual way the narratives meet is fine, I guess, but after 30 or 40 hours of tolerating this stop-start pacing, it's not the payoff I'd expect. Even when you do reach the 'Master of All' arc - surprise, surprise! - the game segments things off again. And there are more false endings than Peter Jackson's take on Return of the King. Maybe if I was playing the game with fewer constraints, I'd have more patience for this, but paired with the sheer length of some of the boss battles and even regular encounters, I found Octopath Traveler 0 to be a real slog at times - and that's coming from someone with a high tolerance for this kind-of setup.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The festive season. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I do really enjoy the synergy you can have with eight characters, though: an upgrade to the four-member parties of the previous games. But when you need to rely on swapping everyone in just to have a realistic crack at finishing off an overly tanky boss, even that novelty begins to lose its impact around 50 hours in. There is a purity to the combat I found compelling, though: there're no flashy mega-special moves, and talking to townsfolk to recruit them for one-off attacks that may cover weaknesses your current party isn't equipped to exploit feels like a meta in and of itself.</p><p>Octopath Traveler 0 is weaker than the sum of its parts. On their own, the mini stories, the town-building mechanic, and the combat all feel pretty good (if not revolutionary). But mashed together into this lumbering, uncoordinated chimera, it misses the mark. Games in this genre, operating at this scope and scale, need to feel more cohesive to keep your attention into the triple digits, and I think the experiment Square Enix has toyed with here proves you can't really do that when your trying to hammer so many pegs of various shapes into one, singular round hole.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has cast a new voice actress for Samus.</p>
<p>If (or should that be when) you succumb to the barrage of enemies that will be heading your way on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release tomorrow, it will not be Jennifer Hale that you will hear screaming in pain. </p>
<p>Rather for this release, Hale - who lent her vocal talents to the role of Samus in the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> trilogy - has instead been replaced with American stage and voice actress Erin Yvette.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>You may have already heard Yvette's voice in many of earlier works. Yvette's previous video game roles include Snow White in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/telltale-games">Telltale Games</a>' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a> and Alex in Night School Studio's debut Oxenfree.</p>
<p>More recently, the actress also voiced Blonde Blazer in AdHoc's brilliant (I honestly can't recommend this game enough) superhero workplace comedy, Dispatch.</p>
<p>It is worth noting though, that while Yvette is credited with voicing Samus in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the character doesn't exactly talk your ear off in the game. Rather, it is more about those all important effort noises when Samus is making her way through the world, and of course that death scream. To give more context, Yvette's performance in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is on par with Hale's own performance as Samus in Metroid Prime 3, I am reliably told.</p>

<p>For more on Samus' chatter (or lack thereof), our Alex recently shared his thoughts about Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's almost silent protagonist. You can check it out here: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-chatty-companions-silent-samus-the-problem">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's chatty space marine companions aren't so bad - it's Samus who is this game's narrative problem</a>.</p><p>As for the game more generally, well it comes out tomorrow, so there's not too much longer to wait until you can hear Yvette's grunts in action for yourself. "Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer's Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review</a>.</p>

            <p>There's been a lot of chatter surrounding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> since its launch. The latest release in a juggernaut franchise, some are seeing cracks in the armour due to a mixed reception to various parts of the game, as well as the little data we have pointing to surprising sales figures.</p>
<p>It is no secret that this year is a tough one all round for the video games industry, but it's also true that the last month or so has been packed full of big releases that could theoretically challenge Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, as mentioned previously, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> which remains a powerhouse. Are these the main two sources of what ails CoD, or is it something else? Or, perhaps, is Call of Duty totally fine.</p>
<p>To help me find out what's going on with Microsoft's heaviest hitter, I sat down with two experts on the numbers behind the headlines in the video game industry. The first, Chris Dring from The Game Business. He first reported the difference in sales between Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6 last week. The second, Rhys Elliott, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics, a company that has continuously published sales estimates for a variety of titles in recent months, delving into industry performance on some of the largest releases within that window.</p>

<p>So first, why has Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 seemingly sold below expectations?</p>
<p><strong>Dring</strong>: "Well, below expectations: I don't know what they were expecting. That's the first thing I'll say. It seems lower for us because we're used to certain numbers. Call of Duty has had a hard year. It had a spectacular launch with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> 12 months ago - that did very big numbers out of the gate, did very well on Game Pass and sold very well, too.</p><p>"But actually I track daily active users, and all year Call of Duty's numbers have been quite low - lower than usual. There have been some exceptions though, January was great coming off Black Ops 6, there was a boost in April / May, but generally speaking fewer people are playing Call of Duty this year than they have been before. That's despite Black Ops 6 as the previous gaming being brilliant in people's eyes.</p>
<p>"In fact, in September, it was the lowest point I've seen Call of Duty since the launch of their Call of Duty HQ. So it's just been slightly lower. It's been a tougher year for Call of Duty, but it's not the only game to have a tougher year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, too, has dipped a bit."</p>
<p><strong>Elliot</strong>: "Call of Duty is underperforming this year due to a combination of community burnout, questionable creative and business decisions by Activision/Microsoft, and strong competition. Xbox dropped the ball on the wrong year, as this year saw some of the most exciting shooter releases in years.</p>
<p>"One reason for the decline is the intense competition from rival shooters, mostly Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders. The new Battlefield title had a massive launch, securing the biggest opening in its franchise's history. Arc has sold almost 8 million copies so far, and the latest Fortnite Simpsons crossover was a hit. Attention is scarce.</p><p>"Players have expressed growing dissatisfaction with CoD's lack of innovation, feeling that the franchise is ailing. The introduction of Fortnite-like cosmetic items like non-military character skins (Beavis and Butthead, Nicki Minaj) has alienated a significant portion of the fanbase who prefer a more grounded military aesthetic. The co-op campaign was a major point of criticism. It was uneven and tedious when played solo, while also requiring an always-online connection. It also drew controversy and ire for its use of AI slop in game.</p>
<p>"Player reception was [also] largely negative, with a mostly negative Steam user score and review bombing galore. Long-standing player frustrations, like the perceived impact of skill-based matchmaking -and the focus on heavy microtransactions (skins and bundles) over core gameplay quality, continue to drive players away from the franchise.</p>
<p>"Microsoft's decision to put Black Ops 7 on Game Pass on day one has cannibalised traditional full-price game sales on Xbox and PC, with last year's game losing a reported $300 million in potential sales due to the service. Our estimates have signalled time and time again that Game Pass cannibalises game revenues - and Call of Duty is no different.</p>
<p>"The marketing for Black Ops 7 was pretty abysmal and underwhelming, generating little positive buzz. The marketing cycle tried to appeal to everyone, but ended up appealing to nobody. The reveal event, CoD Next, was messy and did little to excite the community. This is again in stark contrast to the community-driven, focused marketing of Battlefield and ARC, whose development and marketing has been incredibly community-driven."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Much of the community-drive hype has been focused outside of Call of Duty's purview this season. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Embark Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So we know the numbers, and we've got a good idea as to why Call of Duty itself may be struggling. Another important question is, how big a part have other games had in this year's surprising Black Ops 7 performance? Are current woes largely self-made, or has Call of Duty been kicked while it was down?</p><p><strong>Dring</strong>: "It's been more competitive during Black Ops 7's launch than before. Battlefield 6 is a direct competitor. The data from Ampere that I reported on a few weeks ago showed that around a quarter of people who played Battlefield on Xbox had played Call of Duty the month before. So they are active Call of Duty players that came to Battlefield. I know Battlefield is a different game to Call of Duty, it's a war shooter but it has a different vibe to it, but it's worth noting that Call of Duty players are known to try different things. Helldivers 2, around six million players in their first year were Call of Duty players according to Arrowhead. That's one of the things that messed up Helldivers 2 in the early days, they didn't know how to cater to this surge of players.</p>
<p>"Arc Raiders had a lesser impact than Battlefield 6 did, but if you're just launching a brand-new shooter on the market and it's getting a mixed reception. You've got Arc Raiders as well as Battlefield 6 out, so it didn't really come out in the best environment.</p>
<p>"Now look, even if the franchise has fallen a little bit this year, it's still mega numbers. We're still mostly over 20m active monthly players - most games would kill for that. But it's dipping below what it was before due to a mix of the competitive environment it released in and it perhaps didn't connect with people in the same way it may have done in the past."</p>
<p><strong>Elliot</strong>: "While the issues with Black Ops 7 certainly aren't helping things, the attention economy is oversaturated in general - especially in the live-service genre, which is highly zero sum.</p>
<p>"Many major publishers, inspired by the runaway successes of games like Fortnite and Roblox, piled into the live-service market seeking quick profits. But the gold rush has largely concluded. So, the big live-service players - the incumbents if you're addled with consultant brain (like me) - are continuing to dominate the segment, owing to inertia and improvements to their content.</p>
<p>"This fierce competition, coupled with the difficulty of convincing gamers to abandon their established habits, cosmetic investments, and friendship groups - a powerful sunk-cost fallacy - is the primary reason for the high failure rate among new live-service shooters.</p>
<p>"The dominance of the incumbents is partly due to their optimised content treadmills, which demand constant attention from their player base. This constant stream of updates, 'live-ops,' necessitates ever-swelling development and operating budgets. These high costs are increasingly scaring away new competitors, especially given the lengthy list of expensive live-service failures in recent years. Many new entries, despite generating strong initial hype and high download numbers at launch, have struggled to sustain player retention and have quickly seen their player counts drop off.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"The current market is seeing successful new entrants break through by carefully exploiting gaps in the established landscape, though. Marvel Rivals, for instance, successfully capitalised on a perceived weakness or dissatisfaction with the established hero-shooter market, particularly Overwatch 2. Similarly, Embark's Arc Raiders made the highly competitive extraction shooter genre more broadly appealing and palatable to a wider audience, demonstrating a strategic way to carve out a new niche rather than directly challenging the behemoths. Embark also applied learnings from The Finals to build scalable server tech, robust net code, and a content pipeline that supports rapid iteration.</p><p>"A particularly effective strategy is to pivot away from the hyper-competitive player-versus-player (PvP) segment entirely. Helldivers 2 and, to a large extent, the success of ARC this year, show that significant gains are still possible. Helldivers 2's breakout success was largely due to its focus on cooperative player-versus-environment (PvE) gameplay and strong community interaction, a segment that currently holds far more potential for a new title to break through and build a loyal audience compared to the intensely competitive PvP space.</p>
<p>"So yes, Black Ops 7's specific issues contribute to its underperformance, but in general there's a systemic challenge: the live-service shooter market is now ruthlessly consolidated. Finding consistent success in this segment is difficult, even for a massive, established franchise. The path to success is no longer a guaranteed annual release, but rather requires exceptional product quality, genuine innovation, or finding a neglected sub-genre or new niche, where the inertia of the 'incumbents' does not yet hold absolute sway."</p>

            <p>Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii has said he "can't talk about" future plans for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, suggesting something is indeed in the works.</p>
<p>Though best known for Dragon Quest, Horii was a supervisor on the celebrated Chrono Trigger, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">celebrating its 30th anniversary this year</a>.</p>
<p>During Horii's latest talk show livestream KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku, he was asked about current buzz surrounding Chrono Trigger and whether this was "foreshadowing" a bigger announcement (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chrono-triggers-original-supervisor-yuji-horii-says-i-cant-talk-about-it-dont-ask-and-ill-get-in-trouble-when-asked-about-new-developments/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<p>Horii was also joined by former editor of Shonen Jump Kazuhiko Torishima, who noted a number of Chrono Trigger-related projects that were previously announced, including a concert series planned for next year. Torishima asked Horii if there would be any developments in the franchise.</p><p>"I can't talk about that," said Horii, becoming flustered. He added: "Wait, if I say that, you'll figure it out!", "Don't ask!", "Asking is off-limits!", and "I'll get in trouble!", to which the panel collectively laughed. Torishima cheekily replied: "There's something".</p>
<p>It would seem, then, there's at least something in the works, even if Horii remains tight-lipped on any details.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> acknowledged the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger earlier this year, stating it would launch "various projects that go beyond the world of the game over the next year to express our gratitude to everyone who has played Chrono Trigger so far."</p>
<p>Of course, fans speculated a remake or re-release could be in the works, though there's been nothing official on this. Horii's latest comments are certainly fueling the fire, however.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of other projects inspired by Chrono Trigger you can check out: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-clockwork-dlc-will-release-later-this-month">Sea of Stars received DLC</a> earlier this year, while future games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-a-french-made-rpg-that-takes-inspiration-from-japanese-rpgs-and-was-actually-made-by-a-team-of-30-edge-of-memories-should-scratch-that-itch">Edge of Memories</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-chrono-trigger-celebrates-30th-anniversary-spiritual-successor-threads-of-time-gets-fresh-gameplay-trailer">Threads of Time</a> are heavily inspired by Square Enix's classic.</p>

            <p>
Well-received horror game No Players Online has returned to Steam after nearly three weeks of unavailability, which its developer Beeswax Games has blamed on an "unfounded" DMCA takedown notice filed by a "former friend".
</p>
<p>
No Players Online is a narrative adventure in which players explore the files of a '90s desktop PC in order to uncover the secrets of a long-abandoned shooter. It started life as a short Game Jam title in 2019, garnering positive critical attention and something of a cult following - and an expanded reimagining was launched for Steam at the start of November. Not long after, keen-eyed horror fans began noticing it had disappeared, with Beeswax Games initially appearing unsure why, and promising to "figure out what's going on".

<p>
Three weeks on, Beeswax Games has announced No Players Online's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/">return to Steam</a>, shedding some light on the reason for its initial disappearance. "[The game] was removed from steam for nearly three weeks right after launch, following a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) claim made by a former friend," the studio explained in a <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement">message shared on its website</a>. "They claimed to be a co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it. No Players Online was made completely from scratch by our team."
</p><p>
Beeswax, which counts the 2019 game's trio of creators - Adam Pype, Tibau Van den Broeck, and Viktor Kraussays - among its number, say the unnamed individual "recklessly filed the DMCA to Steam without any notice", resulting in the game's removal a little over a week after launch. "We immediately filed a counter-notice," it continued, "and today the game has been reinstated after the time for them to respond has passed."
</p>
<p>
"It's crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form," it added. "It's been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone I considered a dear friend." Beeswax doesn't detail the specifics of the disagreement, only saying it attempted to offer clarity to the claimant prior to the filing that "their allegations were completely unfounded".
</p>
<p>
"This situation has had a significant impact on us," it continued, "especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us." The studio says it spent a "ton of money" over the two and a half years it took to complete No Players Online, and that its temporary removal from Steam means it "lost out on much needed momentum and revenue". As a result, Beeswax is "unsure if [it] will be able to recover financially" given its "already thin margins", and says the future of the studio is uncertain. However, it remains "committed to doing all that we have planned still for No Players Online".
</p>
<p>
DMCA copyright claims have proven highly controversial over the years, given the ease with which they can be abused. In 2023, for instance, Soviet city-builder game Workers &amp; Resources was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soviet-city-builder-game-taken-off-steam-due-to-nonsense-dmca-strike-from-rogue-fan">temporarily pulled from Steam</a> following a "nonsense" DMCA notice from an angry fan, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> studio Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-files-lawsuit-against-individuals-behind-false-destiny-copyright-takedowns">launched legal action against a disgruntled YouTuber in 2022</a>, accusing them of maliciously filing fraudulent takedown notices against other content creators in retaliation for a DMCA filing by Bungie's own team.

<p>Senior developer Felix Pedulla worked at Larian for six years on the cinematic side of the team, before announcing his departure this week. He called his time at the Baldur's Gate 3 studio an "incredible" and "frankly wild" ride.</p>

<p>"I'm so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared. We made some serious magic together, and I'll forever cherish the lessons and memories," Pedulla wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fedulla_newjob-careergrowth-gamingindustry-activity-7401304661347172352-uP_M/">LinkedIn</a>. "A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made."</p>
<p>The developer has now moved to CD Projekt Red, where he will "trade in [his] <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> dice for some Polish steel" as the company's new senior cinematic designer. It's time to "get to work crafting some epic cutscenes," Pedulla closed.</p><p>While the cinematic designer did not say which of CDPR's games he would be working on, it is fair to assume that he will be lending his talents to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Just last month, it was confirmed some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">key Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 development talent had also made the jump to CD Projekt and Ciri's new adventure</a>.</p>

<p>As for The Witcher 4, its<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star"> first trailer was revealed at last year's The Game Awards</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-not-at-the-game-awards-this-year">don't expect it to show up again this year</a>.</p>
<p>We got another look at the next Witcher game in-action back in June. The team did caveat though, that though that particular demo may have looked like gameplay, it was actually a representation of what the tech could do, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">wasn't actually representative of the final game</a>. The performance seen during said tech demo is what the game is aiming for, however. At this time, the studio also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4s-northern-setting-revealed-in-new-unreal-livestream">showed off the northern setting for The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and it's another big one.</p>
<p>Version 1.4.0, to give it its proper name, has made swathes of changes to Nintendo's latest Mario Kart installment, ranging from the way music tracks are displayed all the way to UFO entries.</p>
<p>There are tweaks to the smart steering, some course changes for those taking part in "VS Race", "Race" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play", and adjustments to the speed at which Dash food reappears. You will also now dash when riding on Manta Ramp's back, and there also <em>so much</em> more on the list. Nintendo has really gone to town with this one.</p>
<p>Alas, there's still no mention of racing on individual tracks in multiplayer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-fine-tunes-race-selection-in-vs-race-pool-responding-to-player-criticism">but we all know that's something everyone wants</a>. Maybe next time...</p>

            <p>Obsidian Entertainment, one of gaming's busiest developers, has announced a delay for this year's remaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> update. This was to include a Photo mode and New Game Plus mode, among other things, and it will now be held back - as well as enlarged - for the game's anniversary on 18th February 2026.</p>
<p>"If you've been following our Update Roadmap, you'll know we planned to release an update this fall. To break the bad news first: Avowed will not be receiving a fall update," <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634">Obsidian announced on X</a>. "The good news is that we're shifting our efforts toward a larger update coming next February, timed with the anniversary of the game's release.</p>
<p>"This update will include everything originally planned for fall, plus additional features that will make it our biggest update yet. Stay tuned as we head into the new year for more details on what's planned for the Living Lands."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=equGBZBUjVg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>The features listed for the Anniversary update include the New Game Plus mode, the Photo mode, a new weapon type, "changing appearance in the world" (which I think means the ability to change your character's appearance in the world), new character presets, more Godlike feature presets, "and many more". The other two updates this year - one in the spring, one in the summer - brought new abilities, items, NPC behaviours, an arachnophobia-safe mode, and other improvements.</p><p>Avowed was a very pleasant surprise when it arrived at the beginning of the year. A carefree action-adventure which delighted in exaggerated fantasy, it used smaller open-world areas to provide a sandbox exploration experience, and matched them with a tactile and experimental combat system to strong, and very enjoyable, effect. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">I was very complimentary of Avowed in my review</a>.</p>
<p>Avowed wasn't Obsidian's only big RPG released this year, however. The studio also released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-2-review">sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds 2 in October, which Alex reviewed and liked</a>, and the studio released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, which was a collaboration with Eidos Montreal. That's an early access release so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-wobbles-while-walking-a-line-between-frustration-and-brilliance">Grounded 2 is still finding its little insect legs</a>, but it's a powerful new foundation for the game and franchise to build on for, potentially, years to come.</p>

            <p>According to new filings, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is set to own the vast majority of EA if the proposed record-breaking acquisition goes through.</p>
<p>These filings, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be?mod=hp_lead_pos4">discovered by the Wall Street Journal</a>, have been made to Brazilian antitrust regulators. These filings suggest that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would own 93.4 percent of the video game publisher.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is making this attempt to acquire EA alongside private equity funds Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter founded and owned by Jarred Kushner - son-in-law to President Donald Trump.  Silver Lake would own 5.5 percent, while Affinity Partners would own 1.1 percent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">First announcing their intent in September</a>, these plans<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators"> have been protested by both video game unions</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">human rights groups</a>. The acquisition itself is record breaking due to the absurd $55bn cost attached to taking the video game giant private. Of that $55bn, $20bn is in debt.</p><p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">they are expected to proceed smoothly according to reports</a>. That being said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-reportedly-low-on-cash-and-limiting-investment-following-ea-acquisition">the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund may be a little strapped for cash at the moment</a>. The Public Investment Fund will still need to put up billions of dollars to actually take ownership of EA once it is approved over the next year or so.</p>
<p>CEO of EA Andrew Wilson spoke on the deal, stating: "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work."
</p>
<p>During these early months post-announcement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-midst-of-eas-controversial-acquisition-bioware-moves-to-reassure-fans-that-a-new-mass-effect-is-definitely-still-in-development">Bioware came out during N7 day to remind folks that a new Mass Effect game is still in development</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club Games is at a "make-or-break" moment in the studio's history, and needs Mina the Hollower to do well.</p>
<p>Mina the Hollower is a game I have had my eye on since I started at Eurogamer. In fact, I think its announcement was one of the very first articles I wrote for the site. In a first for the company, Mina the Hollower has nothing to do with Shovel Knight. Rather, this time players will have the chance to take on the mantle of adorable but feisty mouse Mina as she sets out to save a cursed island from the perils that have befallen it.</p>
<p>The game features a top-down adventure style reminiscent of Game Boy Zelda game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a> in a gothic, Castlevania-esque world. And, a lot rides on its success when it comes out next year.</p>

<p>As detailed in a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), in the time since Shovel Knight, Yacht Club divided its team in two (with one team set to work on an unannounced 3D version of Shovel Knight which it had "been fantasizing about for years", and one to work on the "less ambitious" Mina the Hollower). Yacht Club also moved into a new office in Los Angeles. However, then the pandemic hit in 2020, and Yacht Club like the rest of us had to adjust to a different way of doing things.</p><p>Work on Mina the Hollower didn't progress as quickly as the studio had hoped, and in 2024, Yacht Club acknowledged that the two-team structure wasn't working, and after laying off some staff and cutting back on other expenses, merged back into one team. The studio's focus was now solely on Mina the Hollower, and work on the Shovel Knight sequel was paused. The project also had a change in leadership, with studio founder Sean Velasco taking over as director from Mina the Hollower's Alec Faulkner, who is said to have clashed with some of his team.</p>
<p>And now, it is "make-or-break for sure," Velasco has admitted. "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden," he said of Mina the Hollower. "If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great."</p>
<p>However, if the studio only sells around  100,000 copies of Mina the Hollower, "that's not so good". The studio founder did say that if Mina the Hollower were to "flop", then Yacht Club Games would still exist, but it would require some kind of cash injection fast. The studio is already taking steps to keep the studio afloat, and will be moving to fully remote at the end of the year. It will also be shifting its attention to only working on one project at a time.</p>
<p>"What we're doing in the future is try to figure out ways to have a game come out every couple of years, instead of every five or six," said Nick Wozniak, another Yacht Club founder.</p>
<p>"We haven't released a game in so long."</p>

<p>Mina the Hollower was intended to debut on 31st October, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-developers-zelda-like-game-mina-the-hollower-delayed">was pushed back without a new release date earlier this year</a>. At this time, Yacht Club stated it wasn't "a major delay" but just "a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine".</p><p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-the-fabled-hollow-knight-the-much-anticipated-bloodlines-2-and-more">played the demo for Mina the Hollower on Switch 2 earlier this year</a>, and loved it. "I collected Bonestone, I popped off various goblins and bats, I burrowed my way underneath enemies to spring up excitingly from behind and I negotiated perilous pits, all while bopping along to a gloriously retro-infused soundtrack… Oh yes, I am certainly looking forward to Mina the Hollower's full release," I wrote back in August. This feeling hasn't changed.</p>

            <p>The team working on Amazon's live-action God of War series is growing.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/">Deadline</a>, Emmy winning director Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series.</p>

<p>Toye has worked on a number of acclaimed shows during his expansive career, including Westworld, The Boys and The Walking Dead. He is also no stranger to video game adaptations, having additionally helmed episodes of Amazon's Fallout series.</p>
<p>Last year, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for historical drama Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.</p>
<p>The director joins showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on Amazon's God of War series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>
<p>Pre-production for the show is now underway in Vancouver, and casting for the God of War series has begun. Do you have any thoughts on who may play who? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, while we still don't have a release window for the first season, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>. To quote Kratos, "Boy!"</p>

            <section><p>Santa Ragione delivers a subversive, sometimes shocking, often funny first-person narrative horror that, while perhaps a little insubstantial, remains an engagingly unconventional exploration of some timely themes.</p></section>
<p>One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">controversy</a> preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>There are moments in Horses that will almost certainly shock - although it's far from the transgressive, decency shattering work some have supposed it to be - and there are moments so outlandishly, intentionally stupid, the only response is to laugh. And sometimes it's hard to distinguish between the two, Horses' idiosyncratic approach creating a wilfully disorientating mood. Former film student Borlera's subversive tale borrows heavily from the language of cinema, his claustrophobic 1.33:1 aspect ratio, stark monochrome colour palette, and dialogue intertitles immediately evoking the silent movie era - with echoes, perhaps, of old newsreel propaganda. Mix in smash cuts, live-action interstitials, split-screen, and picture-in-picture, and the result is a restless, experimental amalgam of unconventional stylistic choices - realistic textures clashing with amateurish, awkwardly animated character models; unnervingly extreme close-ups; an almost complete absence of diegetic sound, replaced instead by the incessant whir of an unseen film projector - whose oppressive, destabilising ambience can't help but unmoor.</p>

<p>Enter Anselmo, Horses' blanky naive protagonist and player surrogate, who, on the cusp of his 20th year, is dispatched for 14 days of work on a remote farm. Perhaps, a blunt birthday missive from his father suggests, it'll be character-building; perhaps it'll help him "finally start acting like a man". The world of Horses, we soon learn, is one of moral extremities, exhibiting its own exaggerated framework of societal expectations and norms. And so begins a two week apprenticeship, deep in the Italian countryside, that rapidly takes a troubling turn.</p><p>If the avuncular farmer's firm instructions never to enter his room weren't enough of a red flag, we soon meet his prized "horses" - naked, filthy humans with rubber masks clamped to their heads, whose atypical nature takes an alarmingly long time to be acknowledged by anyone. It's an absurd, outlandish image, but also a sympathetic one, their (pixellated) nudity emphasising their dehumanising existence rather than intended for titillation. It's also an image likely to provoke an immediate emotional response in players. But Anselmo, blank slate that he is, merely pushes on, bound to the inescapable rhythm of the farmer's strict regime.</p>



<p>Daybreak means breakfast - three cheerfully decorated biscuits cheekily foreshadowing the events to come - then it's out into the world as the working day begins. Initially, the chores are mundane; you'll traipse from tool shed to vegetable patch to horse pen and back again, watering crops, feeding the animals, gathering up poop, and whatever else the farmer demands. Occasionally, visitors will come, expounding on the philosophy of Horses' exterior world before vanishing again, and the day ends with an evening meal, a smattering of conversation, and perhaps a restless night of unsettling visions. But as rebellious forces begin to exert their influence on the farm's philosophical microcosm, predictable routine succumbs to chaos, and your days - and the farmer's requirements - grow increasingly extreme.</p><p>Vegetable picking and wood chopping give way to burials and beatings, the days only growing weirder and bleaker across Horses' three-or-so hour runtime. But while Horses' content warning is expansive - touching on everything from suicide to sexual assault - it's perhaps also a little misleading, implying an all-out, atrocity filled horror show that never comes. Horses, for all its strange, startling imagery, isn't that kind of game. It remains darkly whimsical throughout, frequently tempering its horror with humour, and even its most indelible moments stop short of gratuitousness. Yes, it delights in pushing buttons - you'll gasp, you'll wince, you'll almost certainly be lost for words - but it never feels flippant and never tips over into exploitation.</p>



<p>Even so, comfort is clearly not the goal, and Borlera's approach seems specifically tailored to shake its audience out of a malaise. Horses is far from a subtle game, choosing to paint its themes in broad, bold brushstrokes rather than more deeply interrogating them - as happy to provoke a visceral response as it is an intellectual one. In that regard, it's a success, albeit perhaps also a fleeting, insubstantial one. And the decision to include simple choices - implying meaningful narrative malleability where there is none - is questionable, occasionally creating awkward moral inconsistencies and distracting contradictions that threaten to muddy the message a little. But still, Horses remains a thoughtful, deliberate work, exploring its themes of oppression and subjugation, and the cycles and systems that perpetuate them, in engagingly unconventional ways.</p>

<p>Sometimes with these kinds of tightly regimented narrative experiences you find yourself asking, what does this story gain from being a game? And if there's an answer here, it's perhaps the sense of reluctant complicity and powerlessness that Horses engenders, of ineffectual resistance gradually giving way to something more hopeful. It's a rallying cry against hypocrisy, institutional or otherwise, and one that feels particularly potent right now, as puritanism and anti-intellectualism continue to exert themselves - and those deemed 'different' are increasingly painted as a threat to society. Horses' approach, its delight in the grotesque, won't be palatable for everyone - but if it takes a clandestine toolshed blowjob, complete with plastic horsehead wobble, to seed its battle cry for revolution, to make its audience sit up and pay attention, then so be it.</p>

            <p>The PC version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> will now take up 85 percent less space on your computer, as Arrowhead has successfully reduced the installation size with help from Nixxes.</p>
<p>Until now, the game took up around 154GB on PC. Back in October, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-explains-why-its-so-big-to-install-on-pc-and-why-that-wont-be-changing-anytime-soon">studio explained it was looking into methods of reducing the size by eliminating duplicated assets</a>, but warned loading times for mechanical HDDs could be 10 times slower.</p>
<p>However, the studio's "worst case projections did not come to pass" and now it has successfully reduced the PC installation size down to around 23GB, a reduction of approximately 131GB.</p>

<p>Essentially, Arrowhead had previously duplicated a load of assets to maintain fast loading times for players using older, mechanical HDDs - this method makes it quicker for relevant data to be found. But as modern SSDs don't work in the same way, duplication is unnecessary and instead simply takes up more space.</p>
<p>By eliminating duplicated assets, the size has reduced with minimal impact on loading - "seconds at most," says Arrowhead, in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371">new blog post on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>"We now know that, contrary to most games, the majority of the loading time in Helldivers 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading," the post reads. "This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time. We now know that this is true even for users with mechanical HDDs."</p><p>This reduced size is available now for players if they opt in to test the "slim version". "You can also opt-out at any time if you experience issues," the post reads. "It's a low-risk way to save ~131GB of space on your drive and help us extend our testing to real-life conditions."</p>
<p>Once this technical beta confirms there are no issues, it will become the default for all players. "Given the very minor differences in loading times between the two versions, there is no justification for us to keep supporting the legacy version long term," the studio said. "Maintaining the legacy version alongside the slim version would only add extra burden to our developers, build machines, QA teams and release processes. Assuming all goes smoothly, the legacy version will be discontinued some time next year."</p>
<p>Instructions can be found in the Steam post.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Helldivers film has found its director</a> - Justin Lin, who's directed multiple films in the Fast and Furious franchise.</p>

            <p>The Forsaken Hollows, the forthcoming DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>, is "definitely a little bit harder" than the main game, its director has admitted.</p>
<p>That's par for the course at this point. FromSoftware is notorious for releasing DLC that expands on its games with an even higher level of challenge.</p>
<p>Still, director Junya Ishizaki has discussed the difficulties of balancing the game for both casual players and experts, based on player feedback.</p>

<p>"The main takeaway we had post-release was just there was a lot of trouble trying to get the balancing right," Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">Gamespot</a>.</p>
<p>"I think balancing is just so subjective, so a lot of our thoughts post-release working up to the DLC were how can we get the balancing in mind with what we were initially envisioning, and also with that balancing set, how can we take a different approach and devise new enemies, new characters, and stuff like that to play into that and utilise the new balancing that we are working with."</p><p>The studio didn't want the game to be "so hard that new players can't get into it" but even veterans required time to figure out the intricacies of Nightreign. "So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they'll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played Nightreign, where there's still a bit that they're trying to figure out," said Ishizaki.</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows is "definitely a little bit harder," he admitted, "but it's not ridiculous or anything like that, but that's still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous DLC for its difficulty was Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, with the final boss in particular imposing a massive challenge.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also discussed the influence of that DLC on The Forsaken Hollows, even if it's not directly intentional. For instance, the new Shifting Earth event has more verticality than previous events, just as Shadow of the Erdtree was more vertical than Elden Ring.</p><p>"[The] idea behind that was that the original map was definitely very horizontally-focused, and when looking at that through the lens of working on DLC, we were thinking where else [was there] to go but up, right?" said Ishizaki. "We can add verticality to this and do it in a way that doesn't detract from the horizontal aspect of the map. So that was where that came from; trying to figure out how we can add to it in such a way that it expands upon the verticality.</p>
<p>"It's one of those things [where] a lot of our staff have also been playing Shadow of the Erdtree as the development for Nightreign has been going on. So there's probably a little bit of influence there, but I don't think [Erdtree's influence is] necessarily intentional. It might even be almost like subconscious, but there's definitely, I think, a bit of that for sure."</p>

<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds new poison swamp areas, which are surprisingly missing from the base game.</p>
<p>"We're definitely aware of the [swamp] meme," said Ishizaki. "It's not like there's a rule or any sort of policy here where it's like we have to have a swamp in there, but it always seems to be [that before you realise] someone's come up with the idea, it's already sort of in there, and it's just sort of taken a life of its own."</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows launches this week on 4th December, adding two new Nightfarers to play as - the Scholar and the Undertaker - along with other additions, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-will-see-an-iconic-dark-souls-boss-return">return of an iconic Dark Souls boss</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is certainly a busy guy. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> might be out the way, but the famed game designer still has his plate full with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror OD</a>, and beyond that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">Metal Gear spiritual successor Physint</a>. Then there's his spirited social media presence, his regular phone calls with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, and now it, turns out, a swerve into Disney voice acting as he takes on the role of a mole.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Kojima has been cast as Paul Moldebrandt in the Japanese dub of Disney's Zootropolis 2, taking over from Josh Gad (Frozen's Olaf), who plays the character in the west. And if you're wondering how Kojima got involved, Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427">reports</a> he was directly asked to play Zootopia Police Department's mole role by the movie's director, Jared Bush.

</p>
<figcaption>Here's the latest teaser for Kojima's OD.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHCqxLtwy5g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Speaking to Famitsu (via Google Translate), Kojima said he accepted the role "without hesitation" after being approached, noting that while he's had "experience with cameos in live-action films and games" Zootopia 2 marks his first time dubbing an animated feature film, "and it's from Disney, of all places!"
</p><p>
Describing the original Zootopia as his "favourite film", he explained he "only took part in a small scene [for the sequel], but even at the time of recording, the level of detail was impressive." And while the recording process "went smoothly", Kojima noted he "learned a lot from the experience of actually acting. It made me realise how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning the pages of the script and noise".
</p>
<p>
Kojima, of course, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">pondering his advancing years in recent times</a>, noting back in January that he "can't help but think" about how much longer he'll be able to stay creative. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life," he added, "but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock." But those concerns don't appear to be slowing him down; currently in the works is Xbox-exclusive horror OD, which he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">previously described</a> as "something totally different" and people are going to either "love it or hate it".

            <p>Another Mega Evolution has been revealed ahead of the Mega Dimension DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, this time for a fan-favourite 'mon.</p>
<p>What's more, a classic Legendary will also be making an appearance.</p>
<p>To recap, the DLC will be released on 10th December and expands the story due to spatial distortions across Lumiose City, which appear to be resulting in more Mega Evolutions - superpowered versions of Pokémon.</p>

<p>Mega Lucario Z has now been announced as part of the DLC, with the fighting/steel type sporting a new fringe and colour scheme.</p>
<p>Now, Lucario already has a Mega Evolution in Z-A, but the DLC will include this new Mega Lucario Z variant. Z Mega Evolutions require less time to initiate moves but use much more power, so are better suited to quick battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the iconic Mewtwo will also be making an appearance in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. The game now has an extra side mission available, where players will receive a Mewtwonite X stone and Mewtwonite Y stone as mystery gifts.</p>

            <p>Styx: Blades of Greed - the next entry in Cyanide Studio's infiltration series, which plops players into the shoes of a caustic goblin - will now release next year.</p>
<p>"Over the past months, the team has been pushing hard to bring this game to the level it deserves," the studio wrote, with a new release date trailer you can see further below in this article. "We've been polishing systems, tightening the stealth and combat loops, and making sure every area feels as sharp and atmospheric as it should.</p>
<p>"With this extra time, we can deliver the best possible version of the experience we've been building."</p>

<p>Cyanide Studio said it was "incredibly proud" of the work it has achieved so far, and it is now "even more motivated for the final stretch" of Styx: Blades of Greed's development. "Thank you for sticking with us," it closed. "Your support genuinely fuels the team."</p>
<p>Styx: Blades of Greed was initially set to release this year, but that date has now moved to 19th February, 2026. When it does arrive, it will be available across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>

<p>Blades of Greed all kicks off after the events of Styx: Shards of Darkness, though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release.</p>
<p>I actually got to go hands-on with Styx: Blades of Greed earlier this year, and while I wasn't very good at it (in fact, I was terrible), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/styx-blades-of-greed-managed-to-impress-with-its-stealth-gameplay-despite-my-attempts-to-do-the-opposite">I had an absolute blast playing as the titular Styx and causing all sorts of chaos</a> for those that got in my way.</p>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> hits storefronts, I'm pretty sure you're going to see a whole lot of fevered debate online about the game's curious choice to place Samus, famously quiet Bounty Hunter, as the de facto head of a squad of Galactic Federation soldiers. Does it still feel like Metroid, famed for its sense of creepy, atmospherically rich isolation, if Samus has a buddy in her ear or - worse - alongside her physically? Or does the presence of friendlies ruin that Metroid magic?</p>
<p>It's an interesting question, the sort of debate that deserves a weigh-in set apart from our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>. So here we are.</p>
<p>For a start, I think Samus as a character can be more than one thing - lord knows 2010's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-other-m">Metroid: Other M</a> showed us this, for good and for ill. I've been under the impression for a while now that Nintendo has been slightly uncomfortable with the designation 'Bounty Hunter'. Several games in succession have subtly told us that the company is more inherently comfortable with the idea of her as the space cops' favourite freelancer. The Galactic Federation is the government of Metroid's galaxy - or near enough - and while Samus isn't formally on their books, she's a hero to the organisation. Casting her that way means, naturally, she's going to come into contact with Federation forces.</p>
<p>If this is in and of itself fully wise is another question, obviously. But Nintendo and Retro Studios have chosen to go down that path (again) with Prime 4. The question is - does it work?</p>
<p>I fully expect Prime 4's cast of Federation Marines to come in for a bit of a hiding from critics and in the court of public opinion. But can I be honest? I think they're <em>absolutely fine</em>. They are inoffensive. Which isn't to say their <em>inclusion </em>ends up inoffensive, mind (more on that in a moment). If you imagine what a gang of five space marines might look like in a game like this, the caricatures you picture are probably exactly what has been written and cast.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There's the nerdy, bespectacled engineer - this is Myles, the one who got everybody's backs up, including mine, at preview. Over the course of the full game he still grates a bit, but he's alright. Myles ends up as the Navi to Samus' Link. He creates a 'home base' on the alien world you're stranded on after you first meet him, and stays there - but he'll crop up on the radio to give you hints or instruction if the game feels like you've been meandering for too long without making progress, and he helps Samus to upgrade her gear by using his engineering chops on items she brings back to base. By the end, the main thing that grated on me about Myles is my incredibly picky annoyance that he wears glasses inside a space marine helmet which he keeps down for 90 percent of his screentime. Surely the helmet visor has his prescription built-in? My <em>VR headset</em> has my prescription built-in. God. Sorry. I digress.</p><p>Then there's a scarred, older, more experienced soldier - a Sniper. Then there's a duo - a gruff and tough commander type (who, of course, is black), and then a young and over-excitable recruit (who, of course, is the group's token girl). Finally, there's a robot. These are broad sketches, caricatures. They work in that context. You know who these characters are the moment that you meet them.</p>
<p>I think caricatures can work fine - great, even - in a story like this. The truth is that while there's a lot by Metroid standards by the measure of any other game, there isn't much dialogue in Prime 4 at all, so you need to get to know these guys quickly. I think they will annoy some, but I think others will love them. I expect the young lass, who is depicted as a total Samus fangirl, will probably become a favourite of some fans and launch a lot of fanfiction and fan art depicting what her relationship with Samus could be. People <em>will</em> ship them. Fine.</p>
<p>But there is a problem in all of this, as I have intimated throughout this article. That problem is Samus herself.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This issue was also present back in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> 3, to be fair - another game which prominently featured the Galactic Federation. But it's <em>especially</em> weird in this game, which ultimately ends up being about Samus rescuing and reuniting a group of soldiers that have all been stranded on a faraway world with her. Over the course of Prime 4's dungeon-like levels she quite literally builds a team and becomes its de facto leader, then leads that team on a few group missions towards the end of the game. But Samus doesn't talk.</p>
<p>This is, I think, the problem. It doesn't work any way that you slice it. It ultimately did my head in for the whole game, and completely undercut Prime 4's narrative.</p>
<p>Let's deal with the elephant in the room first: the idea that Samus is a silent protagonist. She is not. Samus talks. The obvious example is Other M, though let's perhaps set that aside for a moment because that game's narrative is a stinker with absolutely terrible dialogue. But even if we look to the other games: in Zero Mission and Super Metroid, arguably the high bars, we have text presented that is Samus narrating her ship's log in first-person, like she's Picard or Kirk. That makes sense as something she'd do. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> we get a number of internal monologues, plus a single line of spoken-out-loud dialogue towards the end of the game. Then, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a>, Samus speaks out in what ends up being <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?si=cTvIZDPKsdagDR1u&amp;t=257&amp;v=bdTdUoSCfS4&amp;feature=youtu.be">one of the most exciting moments in the entire series</a>. There's also examples of Samus nattering more in officially-sanctioned manga and the like.</p><p>The point is, Samus is no mute. She's a woman of few words, but she can talk. We've seen her talk so little in part because<em> primarily these games are about a woman on her own.</em> We know enough game protagonists who can't shut up talking to themselves, to our eternal pain. Samus is mercifully not one of them, and that's great. But from where I stand, that isn't to say that Samus can't speak at all, especially when in the presence of others. That feels weird.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And so it goes in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, a game in which Samus doesn't say a word. To be clear, I have only finished the game on Normal Mode, and not with 100 percent scans, so if there is a hidden one-liner on a hard mode 100 percent completion run, I wouldn't know. But that wouldn't make a material difference anyway, because the problem is with how Samus appears with these marines. These guys love her. They implicitly trust her. But they also talk to her like it's a two-way conversation. Samus just comes across as weird.</p>
<p>In one instance, when she first meets one of the soldiers, Samus sneaks up on him. He spins, aiming his gun at her. He demands she identifies herself. At this point in the game Samus has a new suit, so while the silhouette is still there she looks different to the Samus he would know of. Samus… simply takes another step forward towards him, in silence. He judges her not a threat, but he would've been well within his rights to try to blow her damn head off.</p><p>In another scene, the excitable younger soldier asks Samus exactly what the mission is. Samus stands like an action figure, then does a very basic gesture to bring up a hologram of the planet and her objectives. It seems incredibly obtuse and she explains nothing, but she implicitly understands. Maybe there's headset-to-headset data shared, I don't know. But again: girl, be normal. <em>Say something</em>.</p>
<p>This isn't like Link, where he has no dialogue but in a gesture or via a dialogue choice window it is implied that Link is indeed speaking, just without the player seeing or hearing it. It's presentationally clear here that Samus just <em>isn't talking</em>. The feeling of awkward weirdness only grows as the game winds on. These guys begin throwing their lives on the line for this woman who offers nothing back in return. This might even work if they acknowledged their leader's silence - but they don't. Everyone just acts like this is all normal. Maybe it is, with this being Samus' in-universe reputation. Either way, it <em>sucks</em>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>My take from this is that the wrong lessons were learned from Other M. That game was criticised for its Samus, but it was because she was a whiny, weird version of the character whose existence seemed to disproportionately revolve around one annoying man. But the lesson from those criticisms appears to have been that Samus should just never speak at all, and that solution is incompatible with the narrative concept of surrounding Samus with buddies. At least, without her coming off as cold, weird, and unlikeable.</p><p>There is a way to do this. In Halo we have another helmet-clad hero-of-few-words surrounded by chattier characters (Cortana, Johnson, the Pilot, et al) and he works. The difference is though he's sparse with his words, Chief interacts with those he finds and rescues. Most of those interactions are him rasping back things like, "Change of plan" and "I need a weapon", but they even manage to give him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY_SkljYkzI">vaguely emotional moments</a> of supporting his allies. Because in the end, there's a human being in that suit. He's just all-business. The dialogue he has is carefully written to not undercut his stoic, quiet nature.</p>
<p>I suppose that's my problem, in the end. Samus is going to be a bit emotionally stunted and strange. She was raised by giant space birds! But there's a human inside that suit, and in Prime 4 it doesn't feel like it. Even the silent animation of her in cutscenes isn't as characterful as it was in Metroid Dread, in fact. The trick of a glimpse of her eyes reflected in her visor is still there, sure, but by surrounding her with human characters, albeit broad sketches, her robotic nature begins to feel like a problem. She's on this planet with a group of people but she acts, consistently, like they aren't there. Like she's still on SR388, all alone.</p>
<p>We're left with the folly of a game that both wants to have a silent protagonist while also placing said protagonist as a valiant leader of a cast of heroes. As the final stretch of the game offers heroic shots of the group gathered, as the group act like they've got a real relationship with her, it all feels contrived. And like I say, it undercuts anything this story attempts to do.</p>
<p>The truth is, Metroid Prime 4's marines are fine - they just don't work with Samus as she is presented, and so it's also true that the game's narrative would probably be better if they'd been absent. Or, it's true that the game's narrative would be better if Samus acted like an actual person. For this story to have truly worked, its writers needed to pick a lane.</p>

            <section><p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more.</p></section>
<p>Taken as a whole, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> feels like something of a composite. On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-3-corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well.</p>

<p>At the onset of Metroid Prime 4, bounty hunter Samus Aran finds herself called to the aid of the Galactic Federation once again. The federation has in its possession some all-powerful ancient relic, and one of its bases is under attack from Space Pirates who also want the MacGuffin. In the course of the ensuing battle the Relic ends up getting 'activated', if that's the right word - the long and the short of it is that it sort of explodes, sending out a wave of energy that transports Samus and others 'Beyond', to an unknown, far-flung planet.</p>
<p>This is the setup you need to understand, in short, to grasp Metroid Prime 4's structure. Once stranded, Samus' iconic ship is gone, for instance. There's no planet-hopping to be done here. Instead she finds herself on a single world which is in a strange way most reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda's Hyrule - specifically, that of an older entry, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: Prime 4's rolling desert is functionally Hyrule Field; that is to say a relatively sparsely-populated map that serves to connect more explicitly-themed biomes at the extremes of the world. There are essentially five locales joined by the desert: a lush forest, a mechanical factory beset by endless thunderstorms, an iced-over mountaintop research facility, a forge in the heart of a volcano, and a deep underground mine.</p>

<p>Think of these locations as dungeons in the finest Zelda tradition, but in a Metroid style. Think of Vi-O-La, Samus' new bike, as Epona, used to quickly ferry yourself from one side of the desert to the other. And think of the giant tower in the middle of the desert as Ganon's Castle - curious, always looming, but blocked by a forcefield and inaccessible until the endgame.</p><p>In the dungeons - and I will keep calling them that, for that's what they feel like - the classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> action reigns. You'll enter a zone, explore, take on enemies, solve small puzzles, and eventually pick up some sort of new ability. Said ability is then inevitably used to open up progression-critical areas of the dungeon you couldn't previously access, and then is used to defeat the dungeon's boss. At this point, you're free to leave and move on to the next area. There's a bit of classic Metroidian backtracking, mind - so after finishing dungeon three, you can go back to dungeons one and two with its item to get into extra rooms to find new puzzles and bonus items. Some of this is entirely optional, while other parts are required by the narrative.</p>
<p>This sort of backtracking has been present in Metroid since traversing the depths of Zebes in 1986, but a funny thing about how it's presented here is that it also reminds me a bit of another Zelda game, and so the comparison continues. Specifically, the way you go back and forth between slightly larger spaces and gradually push slightly deeper into them to progress the story is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-skyward-sword">Skyward Sword</a>. So too is one of Prime 4's two new gimmicks. Its big new weapon greatly resembles that game's 'Beetle', where you can fire a projectile and manually steer it through the air. This is used to great effect in numerous puzzles, and by a couple of bosses.</p>



<p>The other big new gimmick is Samus' psychic powers. These don't amount to much revelatory in gameplay terms - manifesting platforms or grapple points out of thin-air here, a bit of telekinesis there - but it's a nice bit of colour ability-wise. Most of the other skills unlocked are variations on familiar Metroid offerings, be that known quantities with the word 'Psychic' grafted on front for some reason (for instance, the Psychic Boost Ball is functionally identical to the Boost Ball you know and love) or more missile-based variations on elemental beam weaponry.</p><p>When you're spelunking in these dungeons, the hours just melt away. Much as with the selection of abilities, there's nothing planet-shakingly new here, but what is here is a very confident expression of what made the previous Metroid Prime games great. To dip into cliche, I had a good time with the core dungeons, but I also found them nothing really to write home about. They're just a good but fairly forgettable time.</p>

<p>The stand-out is probably how each level subtly changes. A theme of Prime 4 is that each area is somewhere of importance to an ancient, long-extinct race - and you're cobbling together keys and items from their time in order to find a way off-planet again. In multiple instances your main task in each dungeon is to find and restart its power generator in order to gather the stuff you need. But when you do that, each dungeon shifts: the factory whizzes to life, suddenly full of movement and electrical hazards. The icy research facility's doors creak open, revealing what was being researched, while the surge of power begins to melt the ice, leaving water dripping everywhere throughout.</p><p>I liked this stuff - it's good atmospheric work. It also demonstrates well that Prime 4 is probably the best-ever looking Nintendo game, at least as far as games with semi-realistic art styles go. On Switch 2 at 4K and 60fps, it's a pretty remarkable looker. It's less so on the 120fps mode, and Metroid is not a game built with twitchiness in mind - so while the option is appreciated, I'd recommend 60fps, maximizing the visual splendor on offer.</p>
<p>We can't speak of the atmosphere, though, without addressing the chatty elephant in the room: Samus is not on this mysterious planet alone. Five Federation space marines got zapped to the planet at the same time as Samus, and each dungeon will have you link up with at least one, helping and rescuing them. This is a Metroid game where you have allies, and those allies actually build a home base you'll return to regularly as the story progresses. Some items found Samus can equip on her own right away, but in other cases you'll need to return to base to have your resident engineer parse and install it.</p>

<p>There's going to be a lot of debate about these marines, and I expect they'll come in for a lot of criticism. It's such a heavy topic that I've crafted a separate article solely to talk about them, in fact - so I'm not going to spend ages on it here. What I will say, in brief, is that I think the marines themselves are fine as broadly-sketched archetypal characters for this sort of universe and story.</p><p>Some will find them annoying, I know, but what I found more jarring is how the narrative introduces a range of verbose allies for Samus to recruit and lead while insisting that the hero remains deathly silent. They chatter to her - or rather <em>at</em> her - and she regards them with stony-faced silence. Even her body language is less characterful than in 2021's excellent Metroid Dread. It feels weird, and didn't work for me. I'm absolutely not saying Samus needs to be spewing her emotions at every turn, as in the much-derided story of Metroid: Other M, but there is a middle ground here; a leaf could be taken out of Master Chief's book. Even the Doom Slayer gets a few lines, when he really needs to.</p>
<p>What's more interesting for the purposes of this review is to examine how they're used to drive the game's action. Engineer Myles Mackenzie - the one from the previews - becomes a Navi-style figure, staying home at base but ever-present over the radio. It's in Myles you can sense a curious push-and-pull, a hearty debate among the development team. How much help does the player really need?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After some initial, more heavy-handed hours, Myles mercifully fades into the background whenever you're out of the home base. But if you're driving around the desert for too long, he'll buzz and unsubtly remind you that if you're not sure where to go you can give him a call for a tip. On a few occasions - usually after finishing one dungeon but before you have the necessary skills to enter another - the game casts you fully loose to figure out how to get the keys you need on your own. But this only goes so far - take too long, or enter an area that is irrelevant at that point, and Myles will pop up on the radio eagerly. 'Hey, Samus - wasn't there a door you couldn't open in the volcano?' You can sense the design strain of wanting players to experience the 'search' part of the 'search-action' genre moniker without any handholding butting up against an equally large desire to ensure people don't lose patience. In this, we can perhaps sense the most difficult part of making a game like this, for Nintendo no less, in 2025.</p><p>The central desert, which you'll be crossing often as you go back and forth between the main areas, is fun enough. Vi-O-La, the bike, is a blast to drive, with a few fun and simple mechanics to experiment with. The desert does give the impression, though, that it was designed separately from the rest of the game. I genuinely wonder if it was outsourced to a different team. Even the loading zones seem to suggest this, as it doesn't even directly connect to the dungeons. In each case, there's a loading zone, then a tiny 'staging' area you can cross in about a minute, <em>then</em> the dungeon.</p>
<p>There's a handful of things to do out in the desert, but the list of things is very short indeed, being honest. There's a few little underground shrines you can unlock (See! Zelda again!) that each bequeath an upgrade to one of your primary weapons. There's some stranded Federation gear which you'll need to collect later in the game. And then there's green crystals, which you can drive through to satisfyingly smash, which in turn is required for a few upgrades - you feed the crystals gathered to a magic tree (of sorts) back at your home base. The desert-crossing is the sort of thing that could easily be supremely crap - but mercifully it works because the bike is fun to use. In fact, I wished for <em>more</em> of the bike throughout, as it's only used twice in dungeons, really - it would've been nice to see it become more of a staple.</p>

<p>All of this descriptor helps you to sense, I hope, the curious thing at the centre of Metroid Prime 4. To some degree it is Metroid Prime by-the-numbers, a familiar follow-up to the previous games. In other ways it has quite a bit new to say, though largely with concepts and structures borrowed from elsewhere. This is the most difficult sort of game to review, by the way: the sort of thing you enjoy a great deal in the moment that nevertheless feels rather bland in the retelling. It's revealing, I think, that I finished the game and felt a great surge of Metroid fandom - but had no desire to replay it and go for the hard mode 100 percent run to see what extra unlocks that holds. I reinstalled Metroid: Dread instead. That might be the most telltale thing of all, in fact.</p><p>Part of me leaving the game less enthusiastic no doubt has a lot to do with its final stages. Once you've finished all five 'main' dungeons, there's a fair amount of busywork. I'm used to late-game mop-up, but to continue the Zelda analogies this is Triforce Piece Hunt nonsense. Those green crystals you smash in the desert? You seemingly <em>must</em> have shattered a certain amount of them to trigger the endgame, so if you've done everything else you will be forced to drive loops of the desert smashing crystals before you can trigger the end. I'd been quite diligent about smashing the crystals all game - I wanted the upgrades - and I still had to spend too long doing mind-numbing crystal mop-up in the endgame. "It's like if GTA asked you to knock down a certain number of lampposts to unlock the next mission," I scribbled in my notepad.</p>
<p>When the time finally came to trigger the end, I found it underwhelming. I was expecting a big finale with pay-offs for what the game had built up so far - a thrilling final series of challenges to make use of all the skills you've acquired. Instead, without mentioning any embargoed specifics, that enticing tower that's been teasing you all game ends up being a totally mechanically-straightforward anticlimax.</p>



<p>One thing I can't speak to, being honest, is the 'complete' ending, because we all know Metroid games like to hide bonus tidbits behind hard mode, fast completion times, and full completion percentage. On Normal Mode with 100 percent of items and 80-something percent of scans, however, I was rather baffled by where it's all left. While I understand the villain's core motivation, I don't think I could explain what their actual <em>endgame </em>is, other than to just be a pain. I also don't think the relationships the game is at pains to try to build with those marines pays off, even as it tries to tug at the heartstrings. There's a core plot thread about the ancient alien thread that does set up, escalate, and resolve, but anything past that felt half-baked and incomplete - even after poring over scan text.</p>

<p>No matter how much you enjoy the gameplay part, I don't think there's much more disappointing than finishing a game that's relatively narratively-driven and thinking, "that's it?" at the credits. Don't give me this rubbish about Metroid not being narratively-focused, either: I felt a sense of narrative satisfaction ushering that baby Metroid to safety in black and white, without any dialogue, back in 1993. I also understood the emotion behind why Samus decided to rescue a manifestation of the very thing she'd spent all game killing.</p>
<p>I watched this game's finale and then text messaged another critic: "I'm baffled by it," followed by a bunch of questions to check if I'd missed something they hadn't. A naff ending isn't the end of the world, obviously. But in Metroid Prime 4, it forms part of an overall pattern of mild disappointments in the face of some otherwise excellent, easily-lovable stuff.</p><p>It is one of those games that is - excuse another cliche - less than the sum of its parts. I enjoyed my time with it; when you're deep in those dungeons, the design is snappy and confident and the atmosphere impeccable even in the company of chatty NPCs. Puzzley boss encounters, where you die once but use that death to 'download' a strategy before wrecking the boss on your second attempt, are each a delight. These things are glimpses of vintage Metroid. But the way it all stitches together just isn't. In fact, those heady highs serve to really emphasise how this game could have - and perhaps should have - been so much more.</p>

            <p>The original Sonic the Hedgehog game was "terribly controversial" at Sega, according to PlayStation's Mark Cerny, who's detailed more on its development in a new interview.</p>
<p>Cerny was lead system architect for Sony's PS4 and PS5 consoles, but began his career at Atari before moving to Sega and founding its Sega Technical Institute in America. It's this team that developed the sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, after the original game was made in Japan.</p>
<p>The first time he saw Sonic the Hedgehog, it was "obvious that game was going to do great," Cerny told journalist Simon Parkin on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/mark-cerny-lead-system-architect-playstation-4-5">My Perfect Console podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Was there pressure to find a mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario? "The pressure was to make a game that could sell a million copies," Cerny replied, before describing the game as "terribly controversial" due to the increase in resources focused on the game, which ultimately led to Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka's departure from Sega.</p><p>"Part of the idea there was…Let's put much more resource on this project than we usually do," said Cerny. "As I said, what's usual? Three people, three months. So they were going to do, if I remember properly, three people, ten months. But they ended up needing four and a half people for 14 months. I'm a little hazy on the numbers these days. And though it was a success, they blew their budget so badly by putting in a couple of engineers on this that Yuji Naka was just getting yelled at and quit the company."</p>
<p>Cerny admitted "it pays off fantastically well for Sega" due to the success of the game. "But Yuji Naka was pretty tired of the situation by that point." Cerny described Naka as a "top level creator making $60,000 [after a bonus] in their best year and getting yelled at a lot. And he'd had it."</p>
<p>Famously, development on the Sonic series after the success of the first game was split. Development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 moved to the Sega Technical Institute in America founded by Cerny and included original developers Naka and designer Hirokazu Yasuhara. Meanwhile in Japan, another Sonic game was developed by original co-creator Naoto Ohshima intended to be a sequel, but ultimately became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-cd">Sonic CD</a>.</p>
<p>Cerny noted "nobody realised how big Sonic was going to be" in either Sega Japan or America. "Sonic ships and almost immediately I've got the team ready to work on a sequel and do you want a sequel? And I've got Sega of America saying no, it's much too soon. Do a different game first," he said.</p>
<p>That soon changed following sales of Sonic the Hedgehog over its first Christmas period, quickly leading to the sequel's development by STI.</p>
<p>Cerny described his time at Sega overall as "brutal". "Atari was great, Sega was difficult," he said. "It was a difficult environment with a hard-driving president who was going to force us to success. That isn't to say that there wasn't an incredible amount of cameraderie with the people that I worked with but it was just brutal. Nakayama [president of Sega Japan] would come in and he would just give it to us if he didn't see happening what he wanted to see."</p>
<p>"Getting out of Sega was a very healthy thing," he said, before adding "Nakayama is amazing. He understood games like nobody's business...It's just that working for Nakayama - that was difficult and seven years of that was enough."</p>
<p>Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka has since had something of a fall from grace. After eventually leaving Sega in 2006, he later developed Balan Wonderworld with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> which was considered a critical and commercial flop on its release in 2021. He soon left the company and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-was-removed-as-director-of-balan-wonderworld-before-disastrous-launch">accused Square Enix of removing him as director six months before its launch</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2022, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-reportedly-arrested-for-insider-trading">arrested for insider trading at Square Enix</a>, which led to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-receives-suspended-prison-sentence-for-insider-trading">suspended prison sentence</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> may have its sights currently set on the upcoming James Bond origin story 007 First Light, but that doesn't mean we have seen the last of the studio's Hitman series.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>,  IO Interactive's head Hakan Abrak assured fellow Agent 47 fans that "of course" there will be more Hitman in the future. Exactly how far in the future, though, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>"Right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination," Abrak told the publication.</p>
<p>"But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman - because, of course, there's going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>And, thank goodness for that! It's always a hoot prowling around the many opulent settings Agent 47 gets sent off to, before (if you are anything like me) running away in a hail of bullets as any attempts at stealth get put back on the shelf.</p><p>As for that aforementioned co-op mode, this will feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode. On the co-op mode's eventual release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side</a>. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. </p>

<p>In addition to Hitman and 007 First Light, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">IO Interactive also has a multiplayer fantasy project in the works</a>, aptly codenamed Project Fantasy. This upcoming release, which hasn't officially been revealed yet, is "extremely ambitious and really cool and is something [other] than a gun in a suit", Abrak said. "So that's also good to have something new within the creative outlook here."</p>
<p>But, before that arrives, 007 First Light will be shooting onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and PC on 27th March next year. The studio has promised a deeper look at the gameplay we can all expect to see as part of a dedicated stream it is hosting tomorrow, 3rd December, at 4pm UK time.</p>

<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

            <p>More people have downloaded mods for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> than Larian ever expected. "Way more than we ever expected," studio founder and Baldur's Gate 3 director <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1995565346892513574?s=20">Swen Vincke shared on X</a>. The total downloaded-mods number now stands at more than 350m, the studio revealed, and more than 10,000 mods have been uploaded for other people to play.</p>
<p>"This is insane," Vincke added in a video accompanying <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-36-a-very-moddy-christmas_146">a Baldur's Gate 3 community update</a>. From giant bunnies to giant... Not going to do that! It's absolutely amazing. So you should give yourselves a pat on the back, have a shot of whiskey, and have a party. Have a great holiday everybody."</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Larian shared some of its favourite Baldur's Gate 3 mods, including the mod Vincke stopped himself from mentioning in the video: Wither's big naturals. Yes, tits. Yes, an undead, mostly mummified character with big boobs, because why not?</p>

<p>The tongue-in-cheek mod recommendations do not stop there. Why not add a selection of inflatable pool floaties to your fantasy adventure, for instance? You could wear an inflatable duck on your head. For some reason. Why not also paint yourself in clown make-up? Few things are as likely to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.</p><p>You might also be interested in a car wildshape because perhaps you think yourself a Transformer. Would you like to make Astarian even more handsome? Would you like to redress Raphael? Lightsabers? A grenade launcher? Vintage firearms? Bald heads? It's all here, and there's a good chance you'll recognise the person in Larian's videos demonstrating them. Hello Aoife!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">Larian is currently hard at work on two new projects</a>, and both of them will be based on the studio's own original properties, or IP. We don't know what they are or whether they'll have anything to do with the studio's existing Divinity franchise, but we certainly can expect them to follow the role-playing tradition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> and Baldur's Gate 3, for that is Larian's thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-dd-owner-wizards-says-of-course-we-want-to-do-a-successor-to-baldurs-gate-3-we-wonder-who-will-make-it-and-what-kind-of-game-it-will-be">Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast seems keen on making a follow-up to Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which may or may not be called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, and is probably in development at Wizards' internal studio Invoke, which has already confirmed it is working on "a triple-A game set in the world's most iconic role-playing universe - Dungeons &amp; Dragons". I wonder if The Game Awards will provide a time and place for that reveal.</p>

            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions has found its director.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin will be at the helm of the upcoming adaptation, which is based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' space-based shooter. After directing The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast &amp; Furious, Lin went on to also direct Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6 and F9: The Fast Saga.</p>

<p>Along with his directing duties, Lin will also produce the Helldivers film via his Perfect Storm Entertainment banner, along with Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan.</p>
<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter's sources, while Lin himself is not a gamer, he used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>
<p>"He aims to find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology," <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">the publication stated</a>. "There are plenty of details waiting to be drawn in, something that is compelling to the filmmaker."</p>
<p> Joining Lin is writer Gary Dauberman, who is known for penning horror movies It and Annabelle.</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has promised players of World of Warcraft that player housing, which launches in a limited form today (tomorrow across Europe), is going to be expanded in every patch and in future expansions released for the online game.</p>
<p>"I will reassure you as much as possible that that is the case," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">World of Warcraft housing lead Jesse Kurlancheek told IGN</a>. "We have a short-term, medium-term, long-term list of features and content that we want to add. We talk about what are we doing in 12.0 and 12.1 and 12.2 and beyond pretty regularly [...] We're thinking about things as not just a single feature release, [but as ] a very long-running thing."</p>
<p>Senior UX designer Joanna Giannullis added: "I think we've already always started wanting to make sure that we were kind of in it for the long haul. This is a feature that we know is going to live in the game for some time to come, and we're going to be adding more to it with every, not just every patch, but in future expansions, and we want to keep growing it."</p>

<p>The full player-housing release happens alongside new expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft: Midnight, which launches 2nd March</a>, but people who've pre-ordered it can dabble in a slimmer version of housing starting today. Incidentally, if you're planning to try housing out, there's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244464">a Getting Started explainer on the WoW website</a> you might find handy.</p><p>Housing is arguably the largest systemic addition to World of Warcraft ever, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-in-the-making-world-of-warcrafts-player-housing-the-most-ambitious-expansion-feature-ever-says-blizzard">housing has been in development for several years</a>. It's a system that allows players to not only own and customise houses, but also to organise themselves into neighbourhoods - an aspect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has talked about before as being a kind of "sociological experiment"</a>.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember about housing's soft-launch today, according to Kurlancheek and Giannullis, is that it's a start. There are many more things to come to it, both in the weeks and months to come, leading up to Midnight's launch, and beyond.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features, the housing duo revealed, is co-ownership of a house - or the ability to temporarily give someone edit access to it. "Yeah, one [that] comes up a lot is, 'I'm not especially creative or I'm not great with a toolset - can my friend come over and sort of deck out my apartment or deck out my house?' Yeah, it's certainly on our radar," Kurlancheek said. This could even give rise to a whole cottage industry of players who specialise in this work.</p>

<blockquote><em>"The idea of us building together is super compelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>This co-operative building could be developed even further into communal building. "The idea of us building together is super compelling, I think," Kurlancheek added. "As soon as players can build something themselves, we want to build things together. And so, what that ends up being depends on what people are trying to do or what is interesting for them. If it is just us coming together in the town square and hanging up balloons or whatever, because we're having a birthday party, what does that look like? Versus we want to build a racetrack for our mounts around the outside of a town and what does that look like? Versus we want to do prop hunts and duelling things and all of these different potential pieces of stuff."</p>
<p>But though there are many ideas, both from inside Blizzard and from the community, there is "a fairly hard line" drawn regarding things that can potentially increase a character's power. "You should never feel that, 'I have to go engage in a housing loop because if I don't, I can't attune to a raid, or I won't have a three percent DPS boost or whatever,'" said Kurlancheek. "So that sort of practical stuff is really not on the table."</p><p>Reactions to player housing from the alpha already seem very favourable, although there is some concern about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">the new Hearthsteel currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a> to buy cosmetics related to it. This is the first real-money currency added to the game in 20 years, and while Blizzard assures us it'll only be used for housing specifically, and that the majority of house items you won't be able to buy that way, there's worry that these standards will gradually erode over time.</p>

            <p>Remember that demonic statue The Game Awards host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> plopped in the middle of the Californian desert over the weekend? Well, it continues to raise more questions than answers.</p>
<p>When the statue first appeared, many began to guess what exactly it was teasing. Two of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">most popular suggestions were a Diablo 4 expansion or similar from Blizzard</a>, or a new God of War entry from Sony Santa Monica. However, it now appears to be neither.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> expansion theory was <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1995542966279299507?s=20">ruled out by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who said it was not that, but that it is "a good one".</p>
<p>Ok, well God of War could certainly be considered a 'good one' by many. The last mainline instalment released back in 2022 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, which narratively wrapped up the series' Norse saga. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-free-valhalla-dlc">Ragnarök got a free roguelite Valhalla expansion</a>, but what is next for the series now that's all out there?</p><p>Well, if Sony Santa Monica's Cory Barlog is to be believed, whatever is coming next with God of War has nothing to do with Geoff's statue. "Cory Barlog was just in chat on my stream and confirmed this is NOT God of War related," streamer Luke Stephens <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens">shared on social media last night</a>. An accompanying screenshot of the chat in question was also shared alongside the post.</p>
<p>Now, not that I am one to stir the pot, looking at Barlog's comment on the stream, he only says it is not 'GOW' related. Could he be throwing us all a red herring, and is cheekily suggesting that the statue has nothing to do with <em>Gears </em>of War? Hmm… the plot thickens (she says while stirring her pot, fully aware Barlog has nothing to do with Gears of War).</p>

<p>Other theories yesterday suggested a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, <a href="https://x.com/RohanKarMooN/status/1995579982064885889?s=20">something to do with Housemarque's Saros</a>, or perhaps a new Doom installment. Meanwhile, some have just mused that Geoff has put up a statue to his demonic deity, or something similar. What do you think it could all mean?</p><p>Whatever it does all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>

            <p>Paramount has another Sonic the Hedgehog film planned, seemingly a spin-off from the main series.</p>
<p>Currently untitled, a Sonic Universe Event Film is planned for release on 22nd December 2028 (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">Variety</a>). That's over a year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">already-announced Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>, which is planned for 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>Nothing else is known about the project at this time, including which character(s) it will star. Is a Shadow the Hedgehog solo film with Keanu Reeves too much to ask?</p>

<p>The first three films in the series have collectively surpassed $1bn at the worldwide box office, with each entry becoming steadily more popular than the last.</p>
<p>It's no wonder, then, that a fourth film has already been greenlit, as well as this newly announced spin-off to expand the franchise further.</p>
<p>It will also follow the Knuckles TV show spin-off, also from Paramount. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knuckles-tv-show-has-record-breaking-opening-weekend-on-paramount">set a streaming record for Paramount+</a> on its opening weekend, with over 4m hours streamed. Yet it's hardly the most popular streaming platform and the series itself proved forgettable.</p><p>Last year, Sonic franchise producer Toby Ascher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-films-aiming-to-be-avengers-level-events-says-franchise-producer">described the main films as "Avengers-level events"</a>. He continued: "They're going to be these big, exciting stories that have a lot of different characters. And so what television did for us is it gave us time to go into some of the more supporting characters in depth and really build them out in cool ways."</p>
<p>It's unclear if future TV shows have been scrapped in favour of a feature-length film instead, considering no further shows have been announced following Knuckles.</p>
<p>And if the Sonic Universe Event Film comes after Sonic the Hedgehog 4, will it continue that story or focus on a newly-introduced character?</p>
<p>We don't yet know who will be featured in the next mainline film, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-next-for-the-sonic-films-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-post-credits-scene">we've already speculated based on the third film's post-credit scene</a>. Who are you hoping will appear?</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's Splinter Cell remake has landed itself a new game director, and it's a name you may recognise.</p>
<p>David Grivel - who left the studio and therefore the Splinter Cell remake back in 2022, to set off for a "new adventure" - has rejoined the project once again.</p>

<p>Sharing the news on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgrivel/">LinkedIn</a>, Grivel wrote: "I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!"</p>
<p>The developer added this was a "very special team and project" to him, with an accompanying pink love heart emoji.</p>
<p>During his initial stint at Ubisoft, Grivel worked on the likes of Far Cry and the Assassin's Creed series. Following his departure from the company three years ago, Grivel then moved to EA's Ridgeline Games to work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-studio-closure-a-gut-punch-marcus-lehto-says">Ridgeline was subsequently shut down in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>As for the Splinter Cell remake, well we still haven't seen a huge amount of the upcoming game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>Perhaps now Grivel is back on the job once more, we will get a fresh Splinter Cell remake update soon? Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>British actor Martin Bobb-Semple has been cast in Amazon's live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Bobb-Semple - who portrays Orlando 'Lando' Johnson on The CW's All American: Homecoming - will star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">alongside Sophie Turner's Lara Croft</a> on the series' debut.</p>

<p>Little is currently known about Bobb-Semple's part in Tomb Raider, though according to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/tomb-raider-series-martin-bobb-semple-recurring-role-1236592701/">Variety</a>, he will be a series regular. This will be a "major role" for the actor to sink his teeth into, the publication added.</p>
<p>While nothing has been confirmed, there has been speculation online that Bob-Semple will play Lara's friend and tech-expert Zip, a character that features prominantly in the games' Legend timeline.</p>

<p>In addition to the announced cast members, Fleabag's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken, meanwhile, will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer. Filming is expected to kick off early next year, on 19th January. The show does not yet have a release date.</p>
<p>Along with the TV series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon is also working with Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a>.</p>

<p>As well as Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider series, Netflix also has its own animated series known as The Legend of Lara Croft. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/second-season-of-netflixs-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-also-be-its-last">second and final season of Netflix's anime is due to air on 11th December</a>. "When adventurer Lara Croft discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam to retrieve the precious artifacts," reads the season two description.</p>
<p>A trailer for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-trailer-for-netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-season-two">second season of The Legend of Lara Croft was shared last month</a>.</p>

            <p>Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert has called time on his previously teased but largely under the radar RPG.</p>
<p>Back in May of last year, I first caught wind of the developer's 2D pixel art RPG, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monkey-island-creator-ron-gilbert-has-a-2d-pixel-art-game-in-the-works">which he described as "classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park"</a>. Screenshots shared at this time showed a town, which was said to have both a bakery and a weapon shop. As Gilbert noted, these two establishments would really set players up with "all [they'll] need before setting out on a day of questing".</p>
<p>However, it seems that we will be unable to set out for a day of pixelated questing, as in a new interview, Gilbert has revealed he is no longer working on his Zelda-like RPG due to a lack of funding support from publishers.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," Gilbert explained to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">ArsTechnica</a>. "You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."</p><p>Gilbert added securing that "bunch of money" to help realise his vision was no easy task, as "the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible". He also believed the genre he was working with did not play into his favour.</p>
<p>"Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn't the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn't look at it as 'we're gonna make $100m and it's worth investing in'," the Monkey Island creator said. "The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this."</p>
<p>Gilbert previously turned to crowdfunding for his previous release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, but even this route isn't as straightforward as it may have been in the past, with the game creator suggesting: "Kickstarter is basically dead these days as a way of funding games."</p>
<p>Today's big-name publishers "are very analytics-driven," Gilbert furthered. "The big companies, it's like they just have formulas that they apply to games to try to figure out how much money they could make, and I think that just in the end you end up giving a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year's games, because that makes some money."</p><p>This is different from the start of his career, Gilbert continued. "When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money, so it was, yeah, it was a lot more experimenting," he said. "I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness."</p>
<p>Some of the artwork from Gilbert's now cancelled RPG has found a new lease of life, however, and features in the creator's newest game, Death by Scrolling.</p>
<p>Death by Scrolling is described as a "rogue-like vertically scrolling RPG", with the ultimate goal being to race upward through endless levels in order to amass enough money to pay the Ferryman and escape Purgatory. To do this, players will need to battle enemies, swipe gems and power ups, complete quests and more while outsmarting the ever-pursuing Grim Reaper. You can check out a trailer for Death by Scrolling below.</p>

<p>Closing the interview, Gilbert looked back at his career as a game creator, noting it is a very different world now than it was 40 years ago.</p>
<p>"Back then, there were a handful of print magazines, and there were a bunch of reporters, and you had sent out press releases... That's just not the way it works today," he said, adding the rise in content from not just streamers but developers on the likes of YouTube requires a person to be good on camera.</p><p>"The [developers] that are successful are not necessarily the good ones, but the good ones that also present well on YouTube," he said. "And you know, I think that's kind of a problem, that's a gate now... In some ways, I think it's too bad because as a developer, you have to be a performer. And I'm not a performer, right?</p>
<p>"If I was making movies, I would be a director, not an actor."</p>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/return-to-monkey-island">Gilbert along with co-writer Dave Grossman released Return to Monkey Island</a>. It was a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years before its April Fool's Day announcement that same year.</p>

            <p>Sega and Creative Assembly have announced a 25th anniversary celebratory livestream will take place later this week for Total War, in which new projects will be revealed to the masses for the first time.</p>
<p>According to the official release announcing the event, fans on Thursday 4th December, will be able to see exciting new stuff across "historical and fantasy Total War, offering a first look at what's been in development behind the scenes." So this is something absolutely worth tuning into.</p>
<p>The event will be going live on the official Total War YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> channels. In terms of timing, you'll want to be present at <strong>8am PST / 11am EST / 4pm GMT / 5pm CET</strong>. There's no word on how long it'll be running for, but we do know it'll be co-streamed, so maybe one of your favourite streamers will be checking it out live.</p>

<p>Now, what could these new projects be? Well, there are some games rumoured to be cooking away over at Creative Assembly. For one, reports last year stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-development-at-creative-assembly">a Star Wars game was in development</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">there is some evidence pointing towards a Warhammer 40k title</a> too. We just don't know for sure, all the more reason to check into the livestream on Thursday.</p><p>One thing is for certain: Creative Assembly is sorely in need of a win. Its last big Total War release was not well received, with the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-apologises-for-missteps-with-total-war-series-offers-pharaoh-refunds">offering refunds to those who bought Total War: Pharaohs</a>. It had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-developer-creative-assembly-refocusing-on-strategy-games-after-hyenas-failure">Hyenas cancelled, causing the studio to refocus back to strategy games</a>. Not only that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-layoffs-hit-240-staff-including-at-total-war-studio-creative-assembly">the company also suffered layoffs last year</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, Creative Assembly has a history of releasing fantastic strategy games, so here's hoping the devs there can show the world why they remain, frankly, one of the genre greats.</p>

            <p>Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has once again discussed the proliferation of AI, comparing the tech to "mad cow disease" and describing the execs pushing it as "not the most human or creative people".</p>
<p>Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">left GTA developer Rockstar back in 2020</a>, is currently on a media tour for his forthcoming novel that not only explores AI as part of its narrative, but is set in the same world as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">the game his new studio is working on</a>.</p>
<p>Interviewed on Virgin Radio UK by host Chris Evans, the discussion turned to the topic of AI. "Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI, are not the most humane or creative people," said Houser. "So they're sort of saying, 'We're better at being human than you are.' It's obviously not true."</p>

<p>He added: "Humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people, who maybe aren't fully-rounded humans."</p>
<p>More specifically on the technology, Houser was damning on its future promise.</p>
<p>"I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it - which is really superficial - the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models," he said. "So it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease."</p>
<p>He admitted it will "do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-games-co-founder-is-dabbling-with-ai-for-his-next-game-but-admits-its-not-as-useful-as-some-of-the-companies-would-have-you-believe-yet">Houser's comments echo his appearance last week</a> on UK TV, interviewed on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch programme.</p>
<p>"We have a whole field of areas we need technology for and AI's great at some of the tasks and can't do the other tasks yet," he said in that interview. "So [AI companies] will claim it can solve every single problem and it really can't yet. As far as I understand it, it's a sort of hold-all term for all future computing and it's not really doing a lot of the stuff yet. But if we all give it all of our money, it might do in the future."</p><p>In game development, AI is becoming more prevalent, but not all studios are using it. "I don't feel that games created with only AI will have soul," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">The Witcher 3 and The Blood of Dawnwalker director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz told Eurogamer</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">developers of Dispatch stated: "Maybe AI is a creative solution if you aren't a creative person"</a>.</p>

            <p>Where Winds Meet players are tricking the game's AI-powered NPCs into giving them rewards, simply by claiming they already have the answers to various side quests or riddles even when they don't.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/medieval-china-set-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-announced">being announced back in 2022</a>, the ambitious, open-world RPG from Everstone Studio finally debuted last month. Where Winds Meet pops you in the shoes of a  young swordsmaster during ancient China's turbulent 10th century, where you will explore a vast world full of NPCs who you can chat with and on occasion get side quests from.</p>

<p>Now, some players have realised that due to the game's chat functionalities - which uses AI for text-to-speech, meaning in theory players can speak to NPCs as if they are real people - they can actually trick these NPCs into believing that they have completed a riddle or similar, simply by claiming that they have.</p>
<p>As shared on the Where Winds Meet reddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pauq27/how_to_solve_any_riddle/">Kamijoan</a>, players can simply try their luck by writing "(tells him the correct answer)" into the chat, and the NPC will believe that the player has indeed told them the correct answer. Now, this isn't a guaranteed way to bypass actually solving a riddle, but according to another user on the reddit feed, it has worked 70 percent of the time for them.</p>

</figure>
<p>Looking back through the game's various reddit posts also flags up another Where Winds Meet workaround for skipping side quests and such when it comes to chatting with these AI NPCs. That is, repeating the last few words of anything said by an NPC back to them, but framing it as a question. Yes, <a href="https://trending.knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-the-solid-snake-method-of-conversation-the-viral-memes-about-talking-like-metal-gear-solids-protagonist-explained">the often-memed Solid Snake Method</a> works in Where Winds Meet.</p><p>As you can see in the reddit post below by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1p5aqyk/the_metal_gear_method_unironically_works/">Hakkix-</a>, by repeating back the last bit of conversation to the AI NPC, they eventually wore them down enough to get what was needed (as one reply in this particular thread notes: "Somehow, I can feel the rage in that NPC building up").</p>
<p>Others in this same thread have said that putting their words into asterixes - so, typing "*shows you my sincerity*" or something like that - also works to win around an NPC.</p>
<p>While this is all fairly amusing, clearly the AI in Where Winds Meet is not working in the way the developer had perhaps expected. Could you really convince a real person you had the answer to a riddle simply by saying you had, and not offering up any other proof. I don't think so. While the developer has used AI to create a sense of depth and realism in its game, the way players have exploited it in Where Winds Meet shows how easy it can be to undermine that intended sense of immersion. </p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Hakkix-/reddit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The use of AI in games is, of course, a hotly debated topic in the industry at the moment. Last month,  Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>
<p>As for Where Winds Meet, it has proven popular since its release. Following the first 24 hours of its global launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chinese-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-reaches-two-million-players-in-just-24-hours-of-global-release">Where Winds Meet welcomed two million players</a>.</p>

            <p>FromSoftware has released a sweet spread of new statistics for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-will-see-an-iconic-dark-souls-boss-return">the Forsaken Hollows DLC later this week</a>. It's revealed many an interesting tidbit, including a reminder Souls fans still love a certain Dark Souls 1 character.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/more-numbers-the-night-the-latest-stats-elden-ring-nightreign">The full blog post</a> starts by breaking down the player split between each Deep of Night depth, a selection of five tiers increasing the difficulty of the game significantly as you progress through them. It turns out the largest chunk have reached depth one, with 37 percent of Nightreign players still lurking around in the shallow side of the pool.</p>
<p>33 percent of players have reached depth two, depth three is the bar for a respectable 20 percent, depth four is the limit of seven percent, and finally depth five has been achieved by three percent of players. An intriguing spread of skill in a generally tough game!</p>

<p>Then you've got the favourite skins across each Nightfarer. Surprising no one, the Artorias skin is the most popular for Wylder. However, what might shock you is Solaire isn't the most popular skin for Guardian! Kids aren't praising the sun like they used to, it seems. Alternatively, it could just be due to the slight goofiness to the Solaire skin, whereas Wylder's Artorias skin looks exceptionally cool. Wylder's Artorias skin is also the most popular skin overall, used roughly 18m times in total.</p><p>FromSoftware also provided the top ten most used emotes, which reveals Golden Order Totality reigns supreme. As a T-Pose, its popularity is little surprise. Next up comes Spread Out, a handy way of expressing your exhaustion after a tough battle, and third place goes to Bravo as the go-to congratulatory round of applause.</p>
<p>Which of the field bosses are the most deadly? You may not believe this, but it isn't the Bell Bearing Hunter! He came in fourth, while Royal Carrion Knight took the first place podium. Just dodge the magic gang, c'mon. Second place goes to Draconic Tree Sentinel, where as Erdtree Avatar takes third. Now <em>that</em> is shocking. As a caveat, it should be noted that players do also opt to avoid some bosses they find out in the field. Who knows, maybe Bell Bearing Hunter is so scary people don't even try.</p>
<p>To conclude, a nice fact: There have been over 1.2 billion players rescued so far in Elden Ring: Nightreign. People sure do love helping each other out it seems!</p>
<p>If you've not checked out Elden Ring: Nightreign yet and think now's a good time to do so, give <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring: Nightreign review a read</a>! In it, reviewer Ed Nightingale wrote: "FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour."</p>

            <p>A recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> update has added an inventive new solution to the problem of players breaking into locked rooms. If you manage to break into one of these locations full of valuable loot, but without using the required keycard, you're cooked alive.</p>
<p>This was first teased cheekily <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">in last week's patch notes</a>, describing it as "a very hot fix" to locked room exploits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/">Videos of this measure</a> quickly spread across the internet like wildfire, with the Arc Raiders community celebrating the apparent death of one of the game's more frustrating quirks.</p>
<p>If you don't know, locked rooms are few and far between on each map, and generally require a keycard to open. By using the keycard, you unlock the room for everyone, allowing you to get in there and loot through a space saturated with high-rarity gear.</p>

</figure>
<p>This can be dangerous though, not only because keycards are themselves rare, but other players can wander in and kill you while you scavenge, or while you make your way to the extraction. It's a core part of the risk and reward loop present in Arc Raiders and extraction shooters in general.</p><p>However, exploiters were finding inventive ways into these rooms without the keycard. This could be clipping through the locked door, hopping through open windows, dropping through the ceiling, etc. Not only does this keep the door locked while you loot, it also means if another player goes to the locked room with the keycard as intended, they could find it barren, wasting their keycard for nothing. This, as you can imagine, sucked.</p>
<p>This new anti-exploit measures detects whether or not players are inside the locked room <em>while</em> the door is keycard locked. If they are, it kills them without a hope of escaping in slow, scorching fashion. Then, if a player does turn up with a keycard and opens the door, they'll find a bonus body alongside their locked room loot. Nice.</p>
<p>This is far from the only major fix made to Arc Raiders in recent days. In the same patch as this locked room exploit measure, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-removes-weapon-swap-exploit">Embark Studios killed double pumping</a>, a technique terrorising innocents across Stella Montis. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-cameo-in-south-park">The game also recently made an appearance in South Park</a>, of all things.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, a very small amount of animated footage widely believed to be from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> was featured in a demo reel by a Rockstar employee, which highlighted their work for the company.</p>
<p>The Rockstar footage itself appeared to come from animator Benjamin Chue and was pretty minimal in the grand scheme of GTA 6 things. However, along with clips from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, there was also a short montage of incomplete work showing a character taking a bike out from a rental kiosk, and then riding it.</p>
<p>The background from this footage was entirely grey, and the bike itself, which was yellow, also looked to be in the early stages of animation. On its frame, the word LomBike could be seen, likely a play on the real-world micromobility company Lime, <a href="https://www.electricvehicleshq.com/post/micromobility-fleet-expansion-lime-launches-limebike-and-limeglider-to-grow-electric-fleet">and its own LimeBike rental</a>. This trend would, of course, follow earlier GTA 6 leaks. Back in September, a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-leak-reveals-potential-in-game-sites-that-parody-uber-and-more">leaked in-game websites and apps appeared to parody the likes of Uber and WhatsApp</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Another two incomplete clips featured within the demo reel showed a female character – which was likely one of GTA6's dual protagonists Lucia– with a pickup truck. In the first snippet, the character could be seen sitting on the back of the truck before swinging her legs around to jump out. In the second clip, the same character started off on the roof of the truck, before she jumped into the boot, and then onto the road beside the vehicle.</p><p>And, that's it. So, what's the big deal? Really, the footage doesn't show us anything <em>that </em>major. However, the fact that the footage was once available online and has since been removed has garnered attention from the GTA 6 community. You see, in removing the footage from the internet, developer Rockstar has essentially confirmed it was a legitimate leak from its upcoming game, rather unlike the AI efforts that have been making the rounds recently.</p>
<p>One of these supposed 'leaks', for example, showed a character meant to be GTA 6's Lucia making her way around Vice City. Another AI 'leak' showed Lucia getting up and out of a pool, before cutting to scenes in a bar. All of this sloppy AI footage is still available online, and is clearly no threat to Rockstar.</p>
<p>Chue's footage, meanwhile, has been removed from Vimeo where it was initially hosted. If you try and find it on that platform now, <a href="https://vimeo.com/1115554961/purgatory">you will be met with the message: "Sorry, we couldn't find that page"</a>.</p>

<p>Along with leaks and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">GTA 6 game delays</a>, developer Rockstar is currently making additional headlines following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">firing of staff members in a move seen by many as 'union busting'</a>. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">over 200 employees from Rockstar North signed a letter to management</a>, in which they condemned its actions. Rockstar's controversial dismissal of its employees has since been brought up in UK Parliament, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine urging "Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again"</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, a report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">former Rockstar Games staff were fired due to internal company messages being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>CD Projekt Red has reaffirmed plans to release an entire new trilogy of The Witcher games within six years.</p>
<p>Joint studio <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">CEO Michał Nowakowski told investors as much during a recent financial call</a>.</p>
<p>"In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time," Nowakowski said. "As we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>] and [The Witcher 5], between TW5 and TW6 and so on."</p>
<p>That means, assuming The Witcher 4 launches in 2027 (I'll come back to this point), that this entire new trilogy of Witcher games could be released by 2033 - perhaps one in 2027, one in 2030, and one in 2033. Note, we do not know when The Witcher 4 will launch. The only concrete date-related information we have is that the game will <em>not </em>be released in 2026.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHuw6gZxqcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>As Nowakoswki said during the investor call: "As we have already stated, The Witcher 4 is in the full-scale production phase. We're not disclosing any details regarding the target release date, so there's not a point in time I could refer to when answering such a question. The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026..."</p><p>The Witcher 4 <em>could </em>launch in 2027, then - that's the earliest it could appear. But it could be released in 2028 as well, or later. Perhaps CD Projekt Red will take longer to release the first game of the trilogy to ensure the foundations are laid for smoother and speedier development of games two and three.</p>
<p>Remember, one of the biggest challenges with this new trilogy is transitioning the studio to Unreal Engine 5. The Witcher 4 is the first game in decades that CD Projekt Red has used an engine other than its own to make; the last time was using BioWare's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a> Aurora engine to make The Witcher 1. Since then, the studio has used iterations of its own internally made Red engine.</p>
<p>"We've been using UE5 for The Witcher 4 for almost four years now and we're very happy with what we've achieved," Nowakowski said during the investor call. "I think you could have seen some of that with your own eyes with our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">tech demo reveal at Unreal Fest a couple of months ago</a>, and we're very happy with the results of that as well – we've already said that, but I'm always happy to say it again – and we're happy with how the engine is evolving through the Epic team's efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as TW4 is meant to be."</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red is also using Unreal Engine 5 to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-1-remake-will-be-open-world-modern-reimagining">remake its first Witcher game</a> - a project inextricably linked to The Witcher 4, given the shared engine, and the up-front work that needs to be done tailoring it for the studio's needs. Because of that, most of the Fool's Theory team - the studio handling The Witcher 1 remake; a studio made up of former CDPR developers (which made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-thaumaturge-review-a-refreshingly-different-polish-rpg">The Thaumaturge, a pretty decent original RPG</a>) - has been shuffled to help with The Witcher 4, which presumably takes precedent over The Witcher 1 remake.</p><p>"I think we stated in the past that the majority of the team is currently involved in the other project, and also support for The Witcher 4," Nowakowski said, "so there is some limited team working on TW1, but since it's very much tied with TW4 development, this is also why we made this move, and we have explained that in the past. So, for TW1 per se, it's a smaller group of people."</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure which other project he's referring to, by the way. It's an unannounced project, but whether it has anything to do with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">Hadar, the codenamed new IP</a> that a small team is working on, I don't know.</p>
<p>To return to the question in the headline: can CD Projekt Red release three Witcher games in six years? We haven't seen another RPG studio do a similar thing since BioWare released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> trilogy in five years. Typically, most projects of this size these days suffer delays. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-delayed-again-now-due-may-2015">The Witcher 3 was delayed three times</a> until it eventually came out in May 2015, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-delay-necessary-for-last-minute-work-on-current-consoles-dev-says">Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed four times</a> until it arrived in December 2020. Even assuming CD Projekt Red doesn't delay The Witcher 4, 5, or 6, those previous games highlight lengthening development times - five years between Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and seven years between Cyberpunk and The Witcher 4, assuming it releases in 2027. To believe CD Projekt Red can suddenly narrow that gap to three years between games is a leap of faith to make.</p>

            <p>The developers of Metal Gear Solid Delta are yet to decide what their next project will be, be it another remake or something entirely new. A remake of Metal Gear Solid 4, though, would be "pretty hard".</p>
<p>Following Delta, released back in August, series fans are keen to hear what's next for the developers. After all, it was developed as a way of re-introducing the series to new fans, as well as bringing the game up to modern standards.</p>
<p>"Right now, I'm thinking about what to make next. With Metal Gear, I've been able to create an opportunity for new people to experience my work, so I want to continue doing this," said series producer Noriaki Okamura in a new interview with <a href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html">Real Sound</a> (machine translated).</p>

</figure>
<p>"However, we haven't yet decided what we'll be creating," he continued. "There may be remakes, but we may also try new works.</p>
<p>"The Metal Gear series is like the history of video games, and it ranges from pixel art to cinematic expressions, so the remake method and expression method for each work is different. We don't intend to apply the methodology we created for MGS Delta to all of our works, but rather we will consider the best method for each work."</p><p>Prior to Delta, many of the original developers left Konami, but Okamura is pleased to have gathered a team to produce the remake. "As a team, we are confident that we have achieved a quality that will be enjoyable for modern players without compromising the appeal of previous titles," he said. "We are currently exploring specific plans for our next steps."</p>
<p>It would seem <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-patriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a> would be a struggle to remake, however.</p>
<p>"The hardware at the time required some pretty special construction to deliver 3D performance with the technology available at the time, and MGS4 also had some pretty special code... It would be pretty hard to bring it up now," said Okamura.</p>
<p>While Metal Gear Solid 4 does numerically come after 3, chronologically it wouldn't really make sense as the next remake for Konami to tackle. More pertinent is the existence of Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2, which is where we're likely to see MGS4 make an appearance.</p>
<p>While the first Master Collection included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid 1</a> - 3 along with some other classics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-includes-references-to-peace-walker-mgs4-and-5">dataminers did find reference to 4, 5, and Peace Walker in its code</a> shortly after its release in 2023.</p>
<p>Then, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stay-tuned-for-metal-gear-solid-4-in-master-collection-vol-2-says-konami">Konami told fans to "stay tuned" for news on MGS4 in Master Collection 2</a>, teasing its likely inclusion. As the game was exclusive to the PS3 and hasn't been released again since, fans are certainly keen to experience it again in some form.</p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have announced that an extraordinarily low number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> games were ruined by cheaters in a recent blog post.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251">shared on the Battlefield Comms Twitter account</a>, broke down the performance of EA's Javelin kernel-level anti-cheat. Roughly 98 percent of online matches in the first week post-launch were cheater free in Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Part of the anti-cheat's success has been attributed to the "invaluable" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">Battlefield 6 open beta</a>. EA states that over 1.2m cheat attempts were blocked. In addition, users' adoption of Secure Boot leaped from 62.5 percent to 92.5 percent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bios-shock-getting-past-battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-error-was-the-faffiest-thing-a-pc-game-has-ever-required-of-me">a feature that proved frustrating for many</a> but nonetheless is core to Battlefield 6's anti-cheat system.</p>

</figure>
<p>EA stated the anti-cheat efforts continue, with the total block figure now up to 2.39m (each block meaning an individual attempt to use cheating software). Sadly, there are still 1.5 percent of impacted players unable to activate Secure Boot on their PCs, meaning they can't actually launch and play Battlefield 6 even after troubleshooting efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, EA is aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers. The post states: "183 of them (96.3 percent) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely."</p>
<p>The post concluded by laying out a variety of steps the EA team will take to improve the anti-cheat moving forward, the war between cheaters and anti-cheat software being an endless struggle. Still, as it stands today, these are impressive statistics that show Battlefield 6 should be a largely fair and enjoyable game to play online. Here's hoping EA can keep this momentum through to the foreseeable future.</p><p>

Battlefield 6 remains very popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dominates-steam-charts-ahead-of-worldwide-release-as-analyst-estimates-over-100m-in-pre-launch-sales">even as the staggering launch drifts into the past</a>. If you've not tried it out yet, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6</a> review to get an idea of what EA's latest AAA shooter is like.

            <p>Over the weekend, The Game Awards organiser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> set social media tongues wagging with three words: regal.inspiring.thickness.</p>
<p>No, despite what I first thought, these are not the three words he used to describe himself on his Tinder profile. Rather, they link to a location via a What3Words address. And, that location leads to a spot near Joshua Tree, California.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As you can see in the image I took this morning from the What3Words app, regal.inspiring.thickness is a rather barren looking area in California.</p>
<p>Well, at least, it may have once been, but others have since ventured forth to the spot, and discovered a large and rather imposing statue now standing proudly in a field in the Mojave Desert, on the corner of 29 Palms Highway and Yucca Mesa Road.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The statue itself shows a group of demonic creatures all surrounding a hellish-looking portal type design. This portal area lights up at night, as you can see via the second image below, with a fiery and quite ominous glow.</p>
<p>Many have surmised that this is all part of a tease for The Game Awards 2025, which is set to kick off later this month, on 11th December. But, what is it teasing exactly? The current most popular theory out there is an expansion or something similar for Blizzard's Diablo series. The statue's hellish iconography certainly would fit the bill.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Via X</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Others have speculated the statue could be related to God of War, with earlier rumours suggesting the series would be heading to Egypt. Housemarque's next game Saros has also been mentioned in various replies and social media posts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many wishful thinkers have suggested it could be a statue leading up to a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, or perhaps a new Doom installment. I have also seen others mention Half Life 3.</p>
<figure>

<p>Whatever it may all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-control-trademark-sparks-speculation-remedy-will-be-making-a-the-game-awards-announcement">trademark for something known as Control: Resonant was registered in Europe</a>, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans are saying "no to AI slop" after some believe they've discovered AI-generated images in Epic's tentpole battle royale game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/say_no_to_ai_slop_a_billiondollar_company_should/">Reddit post</a> entitled "Say 'No' to AI slop, a billion-dollar company should have no problem supporting real artists for real art", Fortnite players have shared their thoughts on a number of alleged AI-generated images, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk1tw7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">in-game</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrkcw00/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">posters</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk6ski/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sprays</a>, with some suggesting a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk2fc9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">boycott</a>.</p>

</span></p><p>The discoveries come just days after Epic boss Tim Sweeney suggested requiring developers to disclose whether or not generative AI has been used during the making of a game "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">makes no sense</a>".</p>
<p>Sweeney made the remarks responding to a social media post by a former Unreal Engine developer who <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1993757796723306612">uses generative AI in his motion capture work</a> and suggested "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more".</p><p>"Agreed," agreed Sweeney. "The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-whats-coming-to-fortnite-chapter-7-pacific-break">10.5 million players logged on to see Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale</a>, with another three million clocking in via livestreams. To celebrate, Epic's pulled back the covers on Chapter 7: Pacific Break, revealing new map locations, new gameplay, Simple Build, and battle pass goodies.</p>

            <p>Industry leaders have attended a memorial service for Tomonobu Itagaki, the creator of Dead or Alive and the 3D Ninja Gaiden series, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-died-age-58">died last month aged 58</a>.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90s, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Yosuke Hayashi's eulogy about Itagaki</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Royta15/">u/Royta15</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/">ninjagaiden</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Amongst the attendees, which included Tekken director <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1993986075782717449">Katsuhiro Harada</a>, executive VP of Koei Tecmo, Yosuke Hayashi, talked of meeting the developer, working for him, and getting back in touch shortly before his death.</p>
<p>"I never thought we'd meet like this," the executive said, as translated on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-were-so-cool-koei-tecmo-exec-makes-heartfelt-speech-at-tomonobu-itagaki-memorial/">VGC</a>). "My encounter with Itagaki-san dates back to 2001, when I joined the company as a new graduate. I was assigned to your department as a game planner. You told me you had no work for me. That's what you told me. Two weeks after I was assigned, I really had no work, haha. At the time, I lamented my bad luck, thinking it was the worst possible encounter.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>"My most memorable memory with Itagaki-san was the development of Xbox Ninja Gaiden from 2003 to 2004. The development team was in complete chaos, and it seemed like the game would never be completed, haha. But you were the only one who didn't give up. The two of us spent 12 hours every night checking every adjustment to the game. Those six months are a treasured part of my game-development career."</p>
<p>Itagaki left the company in 2008 shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker sued him for sexual harassment</a>. Although he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007, he ultimately lost his executive officer role. Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.</p>
<p>Before he left the company, Itagaki reportedly told Hayashi "don't change the [Koei Tecmo] logo".</p>
<p>"No other unnecessary words were exchanged. You were so pure and cool," the executive said.</p>
<p>Hayashi also shared his last message from Itagaki in which the developer wrote: "Thank you for remembering our promise [not to change the logo]. Times have changed lately, and selling a million copies doesn't earn you much recognition from the world anymore. That's the era we've entered. Please keep making great products from now on."</p>
