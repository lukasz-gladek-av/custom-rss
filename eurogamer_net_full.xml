            <p>It's been another strange, difficult, and yet somehow also brilliant year for video games in 2025. Triple-A releases have been sparse again, compared to the boom times of old, with a great big <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>-shaped hole left in the final few months of the year. And yet once again, every gap left by the established order has been filled twice over with something brilliantly new.</p>
<p>If there's a lingering truth to video games, it's that they will persist through just about anything. It might feel like the world is shifting around us, but people continue to want to play great games, and people continue to want to make them. And so despite everything, here we are, with another year of sensational, joyous video games across genres, sizes, platforms, studios and locations.</p>
<p>Here are Eurogamer's picks for the 50 best games of 2025 - narrowing it down to just that was as difficult as ever. Enjoy! And if you feel like reminding us how wrong we are (fair, as ever), don't forget we've got the readers' top 50 results now live, too. Congratulations on making it through another year, a huge thank you, as ever, for reading here on Eurogamer, and we wish you all well into 2026 and beyond. </p>

<p>Fantasy role-playing games always seem as though they're under a great deal of pressure to be grown up or edgy, to smear black murky face-paint over themselves and eschew bright colours in favour of darkness. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, refreshingly, was not this. It was overloaded with colour and bursting with a sense of escape and adventure - values that sometimes seem lost in our grungey gaming world. And playfulness; there's a gaminess to Avowed's nature that seemed almost childlike - a desire to get out in the world and play in it. Like the sea breeze that rushes around the island you explore on, Avowed was a breath of fresh air. <em>- Bertie</em></p>

<p>Co-op games with a deep story are all the rage now, don't you know. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> is a flashier and more crowdpleasing entry in this spin-off genre of games you can play with a friend/child/colleague/family member who doesn't need to be able to 360 no scope, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-voyagers">Lego Voyagers</a> is perhaps the more refined game. It's brief, it doesn't feature any hammy dialogue, its puzzles are light, and there are no mind-bending visual tricks, but it's so very touching. I'm sure the game's ending, built up to exquisitely over the last quarter or so of the adventure, won't hit the same for everyone - I played with my son, who took it completely differently to how I did - but for those old enough to have lived, who know the complex journeys our lives take us on, it's for me the biggest slam dunk finale of any game I've played this year. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Konami</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Metal Gear Solid: Delta was a remake done right in 2025, a truly heartfelt recreation of an all-time classic that added just enough new features and gameplay iterations to keep things fresh, while not treading on the toes of the original masterpiece. A museum restoration in video game form, save for some unfortunate performance woes that sadly hindered its overall appeal. Bringing back original voice actors for some select new lines, and packing in all bonus content in one lovely package. Metal Gear Solid: Delta is, I hope, the start of a series of similar restorations of Konami's best series.</p>

<h2>47. Two Point Museum</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> <em>PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Sega</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let's just say I was apprehensive about Two Point Museum. Developer Two Point Studios' debut title, Two Point Hospital, was lovely stuff, a wonderful (if very intentionally familiar) riff on Bullfrog Games' fondly remembered 1997 classic Theme Hospital. Its follow-up, Two Point Campus, captured the same winning sense of whimsy, but deviated so little from the formula that, only two games in, things were starting to feel tired. I was beginning to worry Two Point Studios might be a one trick pony, but I was wrong. This year's Two Point Museum is an absolute banger, and easily one of the finest management sims I've played in ages. It's certainly of a piece with its predecessors, but far more ambitious and inventive too.</p><p>It's got all the usual management stuff as you battle to ensure the smooth running of your slowly expanding museum, but it's constantly chucking in new ideas. Just when you think you've got a handle on things, finally accustomed to the comfortable rhythms of, say, setting up an elaborate security perimeter or sending staff out on expeditions, it suddenly turns into an aquarium sim, or a weird ghost hotel sim, or something entirely different again. It's great, full of the usual wit and whimsy, but strategically rich and wonderfully satisfying too. <em>And</em>, its customisation tools are surprisingly extensive, so if you're a beautification fiend like me, you'll be in your element here too <em>- Matt</em></p>

<h2>46. Horses</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> <em>PC</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Santa Ragione</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a shame the controversy surrounding Horses' release ended up overshadowing the game itself, because writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - developed in conjunction with Saturnalia studio Santa Ragione - is a bold, fascinating debut. It's also, unfortunately for me, not a particularly easy thing to describe. This is a game where surreal, slapstick comedy collides with arthouse experimentalism (think live-action interstitials, picture-in-picture, smash cuts, and split-screen) to create a destabilising ambience that serves its tale of oppression, hypocrisy, and revolution well.</p><p>All this unfolds across two weeks on a farm where humans are kept, masked and naked, in filthy captivity. It's a grim sight that, for a long time, goes completely unacknowledged, creating a yawning void of unease you're simply forced to live with as you spend your days performing simple tasks - gardening, woodchopping, and so on - to satisfy the farmer's demands. It's not long, however, before outside forces make their presence known and Horses rides full-tilt, gleefully and with purpose, into the grotesque. You'll gasp, you'll laugh, you'll squirm; but its shocks are comparatively tame (it's certainly nowhere near as explicit as, say, the porn games you'll find on Steam or the Terrifier movies Epic Games is happy promoting to children in Fortnite, <em>wink</em>) and it's all in service of an experience with something genuine, meaningful, and urgent to say. That's a pretty good deal for £3.99 - <em>Matt</em></p>

<h2>45. Tiny Bookshop</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Nintendo Switch/Switch 2</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Neoludic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The premise of neoludic games' Tiny Bookshop is simple. You're tasked with running your own bustling bookshop from a small wooden carriage attached to the back of your car, allowing you to visit various locations in this sleepy seaside town to sell your books and get to know the townsfolk while doing so. You'll even get to provide your own book recommendations - and possibly write your own book! - along the way.</p><p>Tiny Bookshop combines two of my favourite things: video games and books. It was a delightful surprise to stumble upon such a combination, and it ultimately saw me start reading more again; the book recommendations I gave to townsfolk bled into real life (yes, the books featured in-game are <em>real </em>books), and saw me seek out more book recommendations from both my real-life friends, and based upon what my favourite in-game characters were reading.</p>
<p>Despite being a single-player game, there's a real sense of community to be found within - and as a result of - Tiny Bookshop. Your second-hand bookstore quickly becomes the talk of the town, and it soon becomes your job to help townsfolk with their personal issues, beyond providing them book recommendations. It goes to show just how literature - and most media, really - connects us; it gets us talking to and later, confiding in one another, and Tiny Bookshop really emphasises that fact, all while being a cosy management sim about selling books. - <em>Kelsey</em></p>

<h2>44. The Outer Worlds 2</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms: </strong><em>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fallout: New Vegas turned fifteen years old just a few months ago, and the legend of that game's role-playing prowess has only grown in that time. It's difficult to beat, though it's fair to say that The Outer Worlds 2 is the closest that New Vegas developer Obsidian - or indeed perhaps anyone - has come to channelling the energy that made that game special.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 is in some ways a gentle iteration on its predecessor, but in other ways it offers a counter. The two games are in conversation, in a sense. There's a conscious choice to lean into more hardcore role-playing, headlined by the decision to rip away respec while still committing to a game design where you <em>will</em> constantly come across doors you can't open, dialogue you can't broach, and so on. That's okay though - it is part of the intentional design. You're meant to be making choices. You're meant to be building a character, playing a role. Fantasies can be embraced in this; there is as much joy to playing an idiot or a lucky klutz as there is a super-genius.</p>
<p>Add in snappier-feeling combat, amusing and engaging writing, and a good amount of <em>heart</em> and you end up with a game that perhaps isn't earth-shattering or breathtaking as some bigger-budget peers are - but it's still brilliant, and home to a thoughtful streak of role-playing design that is rarer than it should be. <em>- Alex</em></p>

<h2>43. Expelled!</h2>

<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Inkle Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There obviously is no magic bullet for developing any sort of game, but I reckon that with 2021's Overboard!, Inkle did rather crack the code for how to make a <em>dead satisfying, dead simple</em> visual novel. Expelled! Is a light sequel to that title, porting its problem-solving action from a ship to a strict 1920s boarding school that hides numerous secrets. Yes, it's a murder mystery narrative, but it's one that delightfully thrives on lying, cheating, stealing - and generally being the sort of bad person this school purports to <em>definitely not raise</em>. A time loop mechanic means the story gradually unfurls over 'runs', with new twists warping the narrative as events repeat. It's glorious. <em>- Alex</em></p>

<h2>42. Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> <em>Switch 2</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / TPC / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has done more for my love of the series than any other Pokémon game in the last 10 years. In my eyes, the formula had ground to a halt: the aging Pokémon outlook had begun resting on its laurels, I thougt: Game Freak was struggling with making battle mechanics that seemed sophisticated on the Game Boy work in the era of online play and HD grpahics, and the creature design had begun to get a bit trite. So why not change it all up: take all the ideas we know and love from the series and wrangle them into something more action-oriented. Take the designs and stick with a more considered art style. Make the game smaller, but more dense. The reduction of scope annoyed some people, sure, and your little city might have some ropey graphics gluing it all together, but the heartbeat of Lumiose City and the attention it lavishes on the Pokémon that populate it shows off how lived-in this world can feel when Game Freak has the time (and inclination) to spend hours looking at the minutiae, rather than the bigger picutre. If this is a taste of the future of Pokémon, then I think the series is in good hands, after all. - <em>Dom</em></p>

<h2>41. No, I'm Not a Human</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong><em> PC</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Trioskaz</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The gameplay loop for Trioskaz's No, I'm not a Human is one we've seen before: it's the end of the world and you're presented with a distinct cast of uncanny characters seeking safety in your home, and therefore must decide who to trust and who to turn away. It's a lot like Papers Please in that sense, but No, I'm not a Human is much darker in style and tone, testing your psyche and provoking anxiety throughout.</p><p>Laden with hallucinogenic visuals and thoughtful dialogue, No, I'm not a Human captivated me immediately, so much so that even after I'd reached my first three endings - which were the most dire of conclusions, of course - I had to keep going. And continuing the story from where I'd last left off was no slog either, as every new start is an opportunity to learn more about the strangers knocking on your door and change their fates.</p>
<p>Be careful who you let inside your humble abode, though. One wrong move in No, I'm not a Human, and yourself - or your new-found friends, if you could call them that - can quickly meet unfortunate ends at the hands of the Visitors: mysterious, human-like creatures who'll stop at nothing to gain your trust. Good luck out there. - <em>Kelsey</em></p>

<h2>40. Kirby Air Riders</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms: </strong><em>Switch 2</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sometimes less is more. Other times, you want the kitchen sink. Kirby Air Riders is that rare thing that somehow inexplicably offers you both of those things. The result is magical.</p>
<p>Air Riders offers 'less' in terms of its raw mechanics - a racing game with automatic acceleration, and near one-button play where a single input allows you to brake and drift. This is the sort of game that even the most game-illiterate person can enjoy, but scratch beneath the surface and there is incredible depth and strategy - and an absolute <em>shed load</em> of content, which of course is where the 'more' comes in. The ensuing madness is surely an acquired taste, but if it lands well for you, you're in for a <em>very good time</em>.</p><p>I suppose what I am describing is just inherently a Masahiro Sakurai game - for this is indeed from he, the Smash Bros. originator. Air Riders takes the formula that made Smash special and applies it to a racing game, which in turn utterly sings. The fact that it's a sequel to a game that in my opinion was one of his weakest makes it all the more impressive. - <em>Alex </em></p>

<h2>39. Ghost Town</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> <em>PC VR, PSVR 2, Meta Quest</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Fireproof Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>2025 was the year I started to fall a little bit in love with VR again after some time away, and that, in no small part, was thanks to Ghost Town. If you've played developer Fireproof Games' acclaimed The Room series, there's a fair bit of that - and the studio's beloved puzzle boxes - here, as protagonist and ghost hunter Edith Penrose navigates a brilliantly evocative London of 1983 in search of her missing younger brother. As a VR puzzler it's great, combining interactivity and physicality in a way that pulls you deeper into its world - but really it's the latter, a beautifully convincing creation, that proves the real draw here.</p><p>Ghost Town trades The Room's occult Victoriana for propulsive urban fantasy adventure, wrapping its puzzles in an ambitious, engrossing tale of magic and the mundane told with real cinematic flair. It's wonderfully written, authentically voiced, and gleefully unpredictable, ricocheting from the grimy streets of London to the craggy seclusion of the North Sea, from the earthly realm to planes beyond, and always with an eye for an imaginative set-piece. This is the point it's tempting to tumble straight into spoiler territory and ramble on about all the brilliant bits that've stayed with me. But instead I'll just say that if you have the means, do check it out. It's bloody great <em>- Matt</em></p>

<h2>38. Atomfall</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms: </strong><em>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Xbox One, PS4</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rebellion / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Atomfall is one of a handful of games released in 2025 that really gave me a terrible first impression, before going on to be a delightful change from the norm. It's essentially an open-world survival adventure, set during an alternate history England in the 1960s, with a splendid mix of absolute dire circumstances and British sense of humour. While the opening was a little too hardcore and relied rather too much on stealth for my liking, dropping the difficulty down a little meant I could wander the beautiful landscapes and discover the stories being told by an enjoyable cast of characters. Atomfall encourages you to figure things out rather than straight up telling you what to do, and this results in a game that you feel at home in by the time the credits roll onto the screen. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<h2>37. Old Skies</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms:</strong> <em>PC, Switch</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Wadjet Eye Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you're a point-and-click fan, you'll likely already be familiar with developer Wadjet Eye Games' remarkable body of work. But if not, an introduction! The studio's been releasing wonderfully sophisticated, beautifully written adventures for nearly two decades now. 2018's Avowed, for instance, is a stunning achievement; an extraordinarily ambitious RPG-inspired spin on the genre, delivering a malleable urban fantasy adventure in which whole chapters can shift depending on who you chose to be and the characters you bring along. By comparison, this year's Old Skies is a little more restrained, but it's still an enormously rewarding experience as it gamely leaps across genres and time.</p><p>It's the far-flung future and reality is in constant flux thanks to the commodification and corporatisation of time travel. Enter ChronoZen agent Fia Quinn, whose day job involves accompanying tourists as they galavant into the past. It's a brilliant set-up, and Wadjet Eye approaches it in an anthology like fashion, each time jaunt tackling a new genre - romance, mystery, farce, intrigue, subterfuge, and even a spot of murder - as Old Skies bounds back and forth in time. As you go, the usual point-and-click rhythms are given a deductive spin that leans convincingly and enjoyably into detective work. And it explores the temporal possibilities of its premise too, building puzzles around paradoxes and other clever things. It's brilliant stuff, gradually trading bleak existentialism for something deeply human: an unexpectedly moving tale of love, loss, and legacy <em>- Matt</em></p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot this year about the effect time has on our feelings for a game. Reactions are strong but it's the place a game nestles in our memory that defines how we remember it - or not, as the case may be. To me, Citizen Sleeper 2 has become about connection and friendship, and that warming glow we feel when we see trust reciprocated. That perilous moment when we make ourselves vulnerable and feel as though we could fall but are caught. Citizen Sleeper 2 is these moments - many of these moments, firing like synapses across its universe. This is the best kind of space adventure where a rag-tag crew becomes a found family. It's enough to warm the depths of the void itself. <em>- Bertie</em></p>

</figure>
<p>Do you like revenge stories? Do you like thunder and mud and blood and rage? Do you like to mostly know exactly what is going to happen, but still relish seeing it unfurl, slowly and with joyful, savage excess, before your eyes? You will quite like Ghost of Yōtei, I suspect. There are no surprises here, but the vision is clear as day, the performances some of the finest from a triple-A cast this year. Atsu claws and snarls her way through Yōtei, actor Erika Ishii hunting down wrongdoers with Clint Eastward inevitability. Combat has been expanded, with new weapons adding a kind of four-point, rock-paper-scissors-kusarigama system of counters and weaknesses. You can now create slightly more focused builds with your armour. You can still grapple-hook ledges and sneak through long grass, in that breezy RPG-lite way. And you can still enact gloriously savage pain, through one of the finer swordfighting systems out there. And cor, is Sucker Punch's version of historical Japan still a looker. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>I'm not sure if Blades of Fire will appear in that many Game of the Year lists, but my love of this game hasn't diminished since I reviewed it back in May. If anything, I've thought about it more since playing other games that simply haven't held my attention to the degree this did. Once I was over an initially very rocky opening, I was locked in and didn't look back. Mercury Steam's soulslike action game has multiple problems aside from that less than stellar intro, but for delivering a thrilling sense of adventure and a much-needed original spin on combat, it ranks right at the top of my personal favourites from 2025. <em>- Tom O</em></p>

<h2>33. Lushfoil Photography Sim</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms</strong>: <em>PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S</em></p>
<p>Take a moment out at the end of another hectic year to enjoy this: a photography game that feels like a holiday, an exploration, and an escape. It's astonishingly simple stuff. Grab your beautifully simulated SLR and head across a variety of beautifully realised environments hunting for photo opportunities. Pick your angles and your moments, and don't think too much about scoring or finding the one perfect snap in a scene. Instead, just let your mind and your eye wander. From Italian lakes to Japanese forest temples, solo designer Matt Newell's game is a visual delight. Secrets abound, but the greatest of these is that the sheer act of giving you a camera frees you from so much of the other busywork that games often chuck your way. - <em>Christian D</em></p>

<p>By Azura, by Azura, by Azura - it's the grand champion of western RPGs! The Oblivion remaster arrived this year <em>almost</em> by total surprise, that shock factor spoiled somewhat by some hefty leaking in the run-up. But still, what a treat to go back to this one again. Oblivion may have shed some of the complexity and outlandishness of Morrowind, but in doing so it also shed the intimidation factor. This is really the genesis of all modern - especially western - open world RPGs today, and frankly it's still a lesson in how that structure should be done. It's a little systemic, it's relentlessly full, but it also, crucially, <em>hides</em> its fullness from you until you go out there to find it. The remaster took a bit of the joy out by removing the excessive bloom and truly hideous NPC faces, but the once-painful levelling system has been smartly reworked. It's about as close a remaster can get to a remake, and yet one evidently handled by developer Virtuous with genuine care for the original. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Peak is the co-op climbing game that falls into the category of what many may call 'friendslop'. Friendslop, depending on who you ask, is typically seen as a derogatory term used to describe low-budget co-op games with even lower price tags attached, for you and your friends to play for a week and then never again. While I'm not the biggest fan of the term, I understand why it came about, having not played the likes of Lethal Company or R.E.P.O since the weeks they launched.</p><p>But Peak is what many might describe as the 'peak of friendslop', ridiculous as it sounds, and it ultimately saw the term 'friendslop' being used in a much more endearing manner. It's a testament to just how great Peak is; it has a staying power that many other games of its ilk have yet to master.</p>
<p>For just a few quid, you and your friends take on the role of scouts. Your collective goal is to work together to ascend a mountain and escape this desolate island after your plane has crashed here. The premise is that simple, but Peak has such charm to it that it's hard to put down. Developer, AggroCrab, nailed replayability - which is what many 'friendslop' titles ultimately lack after the novelty wears off - with regular updates that added exciting items, biomes that change weekly, and a beloved mascot, Bing Bong, that fans quickly became enamoured by. On top of that, witnessing your friends scream in panic as they fall from a mountain to their death simply doesn't get old. - <em>Kelsey</em></p>

<p>What a year it's been for movement in games. Sword of the Sea is a specific kind of indie game - you could argue it is, in a way, a game from a few years ago. It's mournful and wordless and has you noodle your way around a beautiful, post-extinction world. But the joy of it is less in the atmosphere, which is still utterly lovely, if less surprising than it once was; it's just in the sheer playing of it. This time you're doing your noodling on a sword that is also a surfboard, snowboard, skateboard, whichever suits and which is never less than breathlessly cool. Motion in Sword of the Sea is supreme. You whistle and glide and do little jumps off rolling sand-waves just because, hey, that's surely what they're there for. You scream down mountainsides and bounce on jellyfish. Sometimes all I want from a game is the sheer sensation of playing it. Just something that feels perfect in the hands. Sword of the Sea could not feel better. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

</figure>
<p>Another Assassin's Creed? That was my first thought when Shadows released earlier this year, but what an addition to the series it was. I never gelled with this series since the first few games, but Shadows pulled me back into why it was enjoyable in the first place - stealthy assassinations, twisted plots, and a story bigger than it first appears. The split between Yasuke's tank-like combat and Naoe's ninja skills felt slick. The difference between both characters was clear from the beginning, but their story worked almost seamlessly.</p><p>Let's not forget the environment either, a highly detailed and thought-out portrayal of feudal Japan gives plenty to explore, as well as opportunities to pull off high-stakes assassinations. Need a breather? There are Sumi-e Ink dawings, Rangu poetry and much more to find.</p>
<p>Not only does Shadows create the ideal footing for newcomers to the series, allowing them to find their preferred style though either Yasuke or Naoe, it also holds a few surprises and delights for veteran fans too. - <em>Marie</em></p>

<p>The realm of multiplayer survival and crafting is pretty busy these days, but there's still room for a game as characterful as this. The science fiction storyline and underground research centre setting puts it somewhere between Half-Life and Stranger Things, while the chunky retro visuals make it an overwhelming nostalgic kind of delight. In principle it's another game about hanging out online with your pals and hitting stuff - no problem with that, of course; it's a noble genre. But in reality Abiotic Factor's a little more stylish and self aware than you might be expecting. And, crucially, it's utterly in love with the excesses of this particular blend of genres.

<p>The 2D brawler experts at Lizardcube needed something memorable to work on after that perfect update of Streets of Rage. Luckily, Shinobi has provided the ideal project for their talents. Here is a game about being swift and air-current light as you dash around beautifully drawn environments on a mission of revenge. The controls are precise, the violence has that balance of impact and restraint that the subject material calls for, and the sense that a video game classic is getting the most respectful of updates is endlessly apparent. Combos and specials provide a little texture to the headlong pelt of the campaign, while never giving you too much to think about, and that move where you dance over a baddy rather than lamping them is just the absolute best. - <em>Christian D</em></p>

<p>There was a lot of debate this year about whether or not we should let Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles recieve nominations for Game of the Year accolades: it's a remake of a 1997 game, after all, and doesn't even include all the War of the Lions content that many people insist forms the best version of the title. They're wrong. You're all wrong. This core game, remade and rethought in HD with better UI and some of the stranger kinks ironed out, is a beauty. The story is probably one of the best in the whole Final Fantasy canon, and the tactics-based gameplay simplifies a complicated genre down to its most essential parts, oiling the gears and making it quick, satisfying, and compelling. Remaking this game without really touching any of the fundamentals goes to prove how something like this can remain as perfect, as-is, even nearly 30 years later. Of course FFT deserves a place in the best of the year list... because, simply put, it's already one of the best of all time. - <em>Dom</em></p>

<p>For a couple of months in the middle of the year I was borderline obsessed with Rematch. It was all I played, warts and all. The game, online 3, 4, or 5-aside football arcade football in which you controlled just one of the players, felt janky and buggy around launch, but it had the magic juice. While it was easy to come across as a clumsy dope while learning the ropes, with the basics learned Rematch became very hard to put down.

<p>Battlefield was well and truly back in 2025, making an enormous splash in the FPS space with an explosive return to form. Many of the faults of past entries left by the wayside, that first month or so truly stole the limelight from competitors in the genre, breaking records handily. It, to me, is the perfect example of a well-rounded package. All components of the game are made well enough that you can point to pretty much any aspect of the experience - maybe that campaign aside - and come away happy. The fluid class system, the crashing audio design that pulls your ears and drops them right into the action. One can only hope Battlefield can stay in top form moving forward. - <em>Connor</em></p>

<p>Now there's some distance between Mario Kart World and its release, which really was a game and an entirely new console, and with months of multiplayer under my belt that simply wasn't possible to amass for the review, my thoughts are pretty much exactly what I thought in June. This is a game that feels and looks brilliant, and has delivered some of the most unbelievable online multiplayer moments I've ever experienced, but also made some odd choices with regard to its make up as an open-world racer. As a result I have played Mario Kart 8 Deluxe more than I have World since its release, as I simply prefer the classic Grand Prix set up it offers. The open world in the Switch 2 game also never quite wowed me, even though it's a delight to explore and full of wonderful details. A great game, then, but one that hasn't yet emerged from the shadow of its peerless predecessor. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<p>It's hard for me to believe that Elden Ring's multiplayer spin-off, Nightreign, came out this year because I feel like I have been playing it for years. That feeling is no doubt helped along by all the familiar foes - from both Elden Ring and the Dark Souls series - that you find yourself up against in this three-player romp.</p><p>While Nightreign's buffoonery may be lost on FromSoftware's solo veterans, it's been a blast of epic proportions to play with friends and strangers alike, in what is a rare opportunity to work as a team to take down bosses without the use of mods. The shared moments of success are a real treat, and something you don't often otherwise experience in FromSoftware's dark fantasy endeavours.</p>
<p>That being said, it's also a real pleasure to see the developer experimenting with its games, and Nightreign ultimately makes me look even more forward to whatever FromSoftware has up its sleeve for in future. - <em>Kelsey</em></p>

<p>Psychonauts developer Double Fine is 25 this year. That's two and a half decades of wonderful games and bold creative swings, and Keeper suggests the studio's well is far from dry. This is the tale of a lighthouse turned sentient, teetering across a landscape both strangely familiar and inarguably alien. And by jove has Double Fine worked some magic here, creating an adventure of real wonder and beauty, boldly rendered with explosions of iridescent colour and intricate painterly swirls. It's an impeccable union of art, animation, and sound that frequently left me in awe.</p><p>Slightly complicating this effusive praise is the fact Keeper takes a little while to find its footing, struggling to hit a comfortable rhythm early on - both in terms of puzzling and pace - that not everyone will be willing to overlook. But then it hits its stride and something magical happens. Keeper becomes a game of glorious reinvention, and I barrelled through the whole thing in a single spellbound sitting. It's not often I'm overcome with emotion in games, but that bit with the fish? That did it. <em>- Matt</em></p>

<p>All hail the rattly white van, perhaps the most wonderful companion in a whole 12 months of video games. And the anthropomorphic thumb riding in the back isn't half bad either. Promise Mascot Agency is perhaps the greatest pure delight of 2025, a game about restoring a derelict town that is also a game about escaping your past and remaking yourself, that is also a game about running a talent agency, that is also a game about that brilliant freakin' van. This is an open-worlder that reminds you that open world games are really pretty special when their scattered tasks are offered up with character, wit and a sense of playfulness. Growing your stable of mascots is a pleasure, fixing up abandoned shrines is oddly wholesome, and, again, the van you get to ride around in? Marry me. - <em>Christian D</em></p>

<p>Not to repeat myself, but it's the turnips that got me first. I kind of already knew that jack-o'-lanterns were originally carved from turnips - it was one of those random bits of trivia I'd picked up somewhere along the way - but developer Spooky Doorway's brilliant The Séance of Blake Manor turns that fact into a feature. This is a supernatural detective mystery steeped in Irish history, lending its tale - of dangerous psychic meddlings in a remote, rain-lashed corner of Connemara, circa 1879 - a wonderful air of authenticity. But more than that, it's just enormously <em>clever</em>; an elaborate hunt to solve the disappearance of a young woman named Evelyn Deane in the three days before calamity strikes, which can only be achieved through proper detective work.</p><p>Its huge cast is in constant motion, moving around the titular hotel with the passing of every hour, and it's up to you to gain any advantage you can - through clue hunting, canny interrogation, library research, social engineering, or simple subterfuge - to eliminate suspects and solve the crime. Spooky Doorway's manor, which you'll explore in first-person, is like a vast clockwork machine; an ever-shifting world of colourful characters, surprising stories, unexpected motives, and ancient horrors that creates a mystery as richly atmospheric as it is gripping <em>- Matt</em></p>

<p>With the first game's exposition out the way, Kojima was free with Death Stranding 2 to focus on telling a story. It's still got beach dimensions, demonic oil whales, baby powers, and enough acronyms and trite names to fill a dictionary, but there's heartfelt human drama here too about the power of connection in a desolate world. What's more, with some of the first game's gameplay edges smoothed out, this sequel is a far more approachable experience, while still offering blockbuster moments and phenomenal visuals, not mention a finale that is pure camp. Of all this year's triple-A games, Death Stranding 2 is the weirdest and most divisive, and that deserves to be celebrated. Nobody does weird like Kojima. <em>- Ed</em></p>

<p>The great remix of Tetris gets a Tetris Effect remix of its own. Lumines was already a kind of Tetris 2.0, reimagining tempo and rhythm in the way Tetris Effect did for it so spectacularly a few years ago. You must sort falling blocks, albeit combinations of blocks, always in a 2x2 square, so that they match up in your big pile of terror below. But now there's Burst - the Effect part, kind of - that adds an active mechanical twist. A meter builds until you can activate it, and suddenly you're thinking optimisation - how can I get the most out of this? - and relief - how can I use this to clear that horrible stack as quickly as possible?! Like so many games of this kind, where a single limited mechanic looms over your play, it becomes both oppressive and revolutionary, an added pressure and a boon. Throw in the Effect-style soundscapes and shifting, diffusing, trancelike visuals and, yeah. Cor indeed. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Arc Raiders proved to be a real underdog hit this year, and it's easy to see why. It's a bubbling cauldron of enticing design with a layer of thick skin of quality floating almost entirely across the entire package (save for one aspect you can probably guess). For me the audio work in this extraction shooter is superb, be it the subtle movement of birds triggered by player proximity, or the thundering of bullets leaving a Bettina. The stakes are high, the matches are tense, and the community has an interesting pacifistic quirk to it that's been a joy to monitor. - <em>Connor</em></p>

When you collect a powerful combo of passive items and balls, and the level is absolutely chock full of projectiles bouncing off enemies in their dozens, the game transforms into a firework show that lit up the tail end of 2025 for me.

And I see Robotron, if only because Christian Donlan has trained me to first think "Robotron" and then walk backwards from there - and even if Geometry Wars is, in a way, a different branch on that tree.</p><p>Sektori's sensory overload is its obvious strength, as with any brilliant shooter like it - fall through the spiralling tunnel of overwhelm and out the other side you'll find pure focus, The Zone, flow. But the less obvious magic is the way this game shifts as you play it, reshaping itself between each run, snaking out between your fingers whenever you think you've finally managed a half-firm grasp. So many connections bursts forth into your mind as you play this game and somehow at the same time, it feels like nothing else.  - <em>Chris T</em></p>

Following another round of early access success, Hades 2 branches off in ways I never considered from the first game, adding more depth, more boons, more weapons, more routes, more songs, more sexiness.

Along with sidekick Pauline, Donkey Kong Bananza managed to combine a surprisingly heartfelt story and bright Nintendo colours with one particularly big and welcome surprise (no spoilers here).

Break free of your hellish confines, defeat demonic authority, eat the moon - and do it all by skating. Hell yeah. Skate Story is one of the most extraordinarily stylish games of this year, but it's a bit more than that. It's a singular game, the type of thing that can only come from a miniscule team - in this case, essentially its solo developer, Sam Eng - where the vision is intimate and personal. The flow is sublime, even if the camera can get a little claustrophobically close compared to more mechanically-minded skating games. The tricks are rad. The vibes are radder. In the first hour I blasted through a giant statue head called the Philosopher who kept shouting INTRIGUING when I performed extremely mediocre stunts. Beyond that lies a story of fragility and resilience, the comedic and the profound, and a resistance to be tamed. It can't get much more 2025. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>It's not often a nearly 25-year-old series - particularly one that only just managed to wrestle itself back from the brink after a long hiatus and years of uninspired sequels - dares to be this bold. But here we are with Silent Hill f; a game that asks itself the question, what even <em>is</em> Silent Hill? The answer, it turns out, isn't the titular town, but rather a philosophy? A state of mind? A vibe? I'm honestly not sure, but Silent Hill f certainly knows. In switching out modern day North America for 1960s Japan, there's so little familiar here (beyond, of course, the ever-present fog) it left me feeling adrift for the first few hours. But then, just like that, it clicked - for me, in a shocking moment of cruelty where, all at once, entire new depths of character were revealed - and suddenly it couldn't be anything <em>other</em> than Silent Hill.</p><p>It might mostly be a game about whacking monsters in claustrophobic spaces (and, for what it's worth, I enjoyed its convincingly unwieldy combat quite a bit), but there's a devastating emotional authenticity to Silent Hill f - a chilling slide into helplessness - that's considerably more horrifying than anything its creatures can muster. And as reality convincingly collapses around you - disappearing into a contradictory confusion of memories you can<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-is-the-first-game-in-four-decades-to-convince-me-new-game-plus-is-worth-my-time"> only hope to untangle with repeated playthroughs</a> - you've no choice but to follow.

A game hasn't quite captured me like this since Elden Ring, and I believe a lot of that is down to just how thrilling exploration is. You don't know if the next room holds a shiny new Tool to use, or a boss with rhythms to learn, or a perilous platforming section. With some luck, you might even encounter a new lovable NPC that you'd put your life on the line for (thinking of Sherma right now).</p>
<p>Ultimately, Silksong isn't just a game full of whimsy, incredible artwork, and expertly crafted boss fights, but a real testament to the imagination - and the skills used to apply that - of Team Cherry too. I can't wait to see what the Silksong DLC, Sea of Sorrow, entails, but here's hoping it doesn't take another seven years to arrive! - <em>Kelsey</em></p>

<p>While I 100 percent believe Hazelight's Split Fiction precursor, It Takes Two, to be the better of the studio's recent co-op hits, I still came away from Split Fiction with a big grin on my usually grinless face. What makes this fantasy/sci-fi adventure such a hit is its incredible co-op mechanics that reach glorious heights at the end, delivering the kind of video game spectacle that you want to tell everyone about. Some of the writing is a little on the nose, the main characters' stories (if I'm being harsh here) lifted from daytime TV drama, but there's some magic in the gameplay when Spit Fiction is firing on all cylinders - enough to make me overlook weakness elsewhere and bask in the sheer creativity of it all. <em>-Tom O</em></p>

<h2>5. Dispatch</h2>

</figure>
<p>I thought I was kind of over the whole superhero thing. I have been bored of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for years now, and the games I play generally don't tend to feature capes and super powers. Well, at least they didn't, until Dispatch arrived in October.</p><p>Described by developer AdHoc as a "superhero workplace comedy", Dispatch places you in the role of Robert Robertson, a regular guy who thanks to a mech suit is able to help others in a superhero-y sort of way. However, when the suit gets damaged, Robert becomes a dispatcher for other superheroes, and the result is an emotionally engaging episodic comic book of a game, with characters you will genuinely find yourself caring deeply for. When I finished, I honestly felt like I was saying goodbye to some dear friends. I had brawled with them, I had laughed with them, I had cried with them, and I had danced with them. I had also failed with them, but one thing Dispatch has really emphasised is that that is ok. We are allowed to be flawed. And actually, there is something really endearing about those flaws.</p>
<p>There is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now talk of a second season of Dispatch</a>, and by golly, I really, <em>really </em>hope we get one. - <em>Victoria </em></p>
<h2>4. Despelote</h2>
<p><strong>Platforms: </strong><em>PS5, PC</em></p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Panic / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Oh, Despelote. One of the greatest intro sequences I've ever played, and one of the most fascinating endings to go with it. Despelote - not really a proper word, as I understand it - is a kind of portmanteau that roughly translates to "this is a mess", or a hot mess, or something like it. A pseudo-authobiography, which sounds fancy, it's really a retelling of a specific slice of it creator Julián Cordero's childhood as Ecuador, his home country, secured a historic qualification for the 2002 World Cup.</p><p>In it, you'll boot a football - usually nicked from some older kids, or made makeshift from whatever vaguely bootable object you can find - around the streets and parks and playgrounds of the sepia city of Quito. But after a short while there's a turn, and one it would be desperately wrong of me to reveal to you. I can say why it's so special though. Despelote is a game about football, sport, the uniting power of them first, and that's glorious enough on its own. But then it becomes a game about what it means to remember, or for a specific moment to be memorable. And one about childhood, coming of age. And then one about the act of creation, of documenting and retelling. So many things, in just a few hours. And so many ways in which it bends the rules, breaks from form, surprises just as you think it's settling into shape. If what you value most is games that push this medium forward, that shift in your hands, that arrive to you undigested and in need of breaking down in the mind over time, this is arguably the finest release of this year, and probably of many others. To play it is a dream. A beautiful mess, like life itself.  <em>- Chris T</em></p>

<h2>3. Baby Steps</h2>

</figure>
<p>I laugh at the memory of Baby Steps because it raises what I think is an amusing question: do you need to like a game to love it? Look at the beloved Souls series: do players always like those games, or are there moments when they wish they'd, to put it simply, get in the bin? There were moments when I wished Baby Steps would get in the bin, but I never hated it. Rather, I admired it. I admired the unbending creative vision. You will fall, you will feel frustrated, but if you can pick yourself up and try again, perhaps you will also feel something else. Profundity in a onesie - I don't think anyone expected that.</p><p>And actually, it's not as mean as it seems. Underneath the nihilistic exterior and the donkey people waggling their willies around is a game that cares. A game with depth and meaning. An adventure of purpose. There's nothing else like it. - Bertie</p>

</figure>
<p>"Turn-based games are back!" said the people who just didn't know where to look for them. It's resulted in plenty of tired comparisons with Final Fantasy and discourse around the future of the genre. But still, Expedition 33's combat is truly where the game shines the most and it's certainly boosted the genre's popularity. It's part turn-based, part rhythm game, demanding exact timing for its parries and dodges on top of considered strategy. Between the varying combat styles of its cast of characters, its weapon scaling, its levels of ability and buff customisation, Expedition 33 has such depth to its combat it's enough of a foundation for the entire game. It's been rightly praised for its surreal visuals, its emotive performances, and the French synth-classical fantasy of its score. But above all, Expedition 33 is for RPG nerds - like its very director - who love to spend hours min-maxing to one-shot a boss. For me, no other game has quite offered that same satisfaction all year. <em>- Ed</em></p>
<hr>
<p>One of my favourite games of all time is Final Fantasy 8; there's something about the world, the ever-encroaching sense of doom as you approach the fourth disc, the conspiratorial way the story unfolds, the hidden phantom of a timeless big bad that's shaping the history of the world to her whim, and the sort-of innocent camaraderie of your team of traumatised orphans that just resonates with me. No surpirse, then, that Expedition 33 has found a home in my heart. You can tell director Guillaume Broche took his cues from the PS1 FF games, with 8 in particular having very visible thumbprints on this European fantasy world. I honestly thought games like this were a product of the past - yes, we still get gorgeous turn-based RPGs these days (just look at Metaphor Refantazio and the Shin Megami Tensei series), but Clair Obscur managed to pair phenomenal battle gimmicks on top of a world that remains intriguing and hostile until its very last breath, all whilst balancing some delicate and considered character work alongside it. I was floored by how the game managed to keep changing up how battles worked, right up into the final act. I was captivated by the world and still found secrets tucked away, even on a second playthrough. I was smitten with Esquie, just like everyone else. This is a game that remains on everyone's lips for a reason, and I can't believe it's a product of 2025. <em>Dom</em></p>

<h2>1. Blue Prince</h2>
<p>Platforms - PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Raw Fury</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sometimes, a game comes along that completely blows your expectations out of the water, and for me this year that was Blue Prince, the puzzle adventure from Dogubomb. Blue Prince pops players into the shoes of Simon P. Jones, who must locate a hidden 46th room within the mansion known as Mt. Holly Estate in order to secure his inheritance. That may all sound like a simple enough task, but what Dogubomb has done here is lace what may at first seem like a straightforward puzzle with a mystery-infused sub layer. Blue Princes teases its secrets out slowly, but the end result is absolutely worth it. Even months later, I still often find myself thinking about it. What an experience. What a game.  - <em>Victoria</em></p>
<hr>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Dogubomb/Raw Fury</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To me, Blue Prince carries the essence of invention. In my mind I see it on the table of a workshop - perhaps the workshop from the game? - being shaped and fussed over for many nights, many years. The heart purposefully obscured by intricate workings and puzzles and misdirections, with layers that shed treats like a parcel passed at a party. Small and seemingly simple, but dense, weighted by the years of thought projected onto and into it.</p><p>To be surprised by an idea in 2025 is to be delighted by it, I think. I have not played a game that uses this idea before. But what makes Blue Prince special is the way the idea has been nurtured and worked and accompanied: coloured with atmosphere, deepened with story, propelled by intrigue. These are the sorts of things a protective creator insists on. As such, this game obsessed my partner and me for months because we had to see what was in Room 46. Blue Prince became a shared, social pursuit, a collective memory. And the more we explored, and the more the game's mysteries unravelled, the stronger its grip became.</p>
<p>I believe games like Blue Prince are only achievable from a place of singular determination. They come from one person's obsession - one inventor's mission - to create something the world has not seen before. In Blue Prince, Tonda Ros has done exactly that. <em>- Bertie</em></p>
<hr>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Dogubomb / Raw Fury</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If Clair Oscur was the beating heart of video gaming in 2025, with its deeply human apocalypse, Blue Prince was the brains. There's a chilly detachment to developer Dogubomb's fiercely cerebral first-person puzzler - one reflected in the drab mountain skies of its setting, the cold interiors of its mansion, and the stark lines of its art - that can be a little off-putting. It doesn't help either that, beyond its first wisp of a challenge - to find that elusive Room 46 - it initially seems doggedly, impenetrably withholding.</p><p>And to be honest, I <em>hated</em> Blue Prince at first; my early hours were spent lost and confused across countless repetitions, as I blindly played cards from my drafting deck and carved a directionless path through the endless locked doors of its wilfully confounding mansion. But then, just as I was about to give up and move on, something - a certain recurring something - caught my eye. And with nothing else to lose, I grabbed a notepad, made a few exploratory scrawls, and everything changed. Suddenly I was locked into its wavelength, and just like that mysteries and secrets began bursting forth from all directions.</p>
<p>Blue Prince's mansion is a remarkable construct; a vastly intricate, enormously rewarding enigma seeded almost imperceptibly across its many peculiar spaces. And the brilliance of it all bears out across the endless notes and photos I took as my journey continued: of books and conspicuous bits of architecture, of maps, music sheets, and mysterious symbols, even - in moments of desperation - random bits of vaguely suspicious furniture. And flicking back through it all now, everything laid out before me, it's easy to appreciate Blue Prince's magnificent structure, and marvel the intricate web of threads hidden within.</p>
<p>It is, I think, easy to mistake Blue Prince's chilly ambience for a chilly attitude, but when I think back on my time spent exploring its mysterious chambers, the memory I have is an unexpectedly warm, fuzzy one. For all its quirks and contrivances, I can't remember a single moment when it felt superior, or hostile, in the way some particularly clever puzzlers do. Rather, Blue Prince feels like a puzzle that <em>wants</em> to be solved, more like a mutually respectful battle of wits - Dogubomb perched over my shoulder, quietly encouraging me along - and one that, in the end, both of us somehow won. - <em>Matt</em></p>

            <p>Rainbow Six Siege is still struggling today after hackers gave out "billions" in in-game currency, forcing Ubisoft to briefly "intentionally" shut down the game.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft has not shared much of the details, players reported that the hackers banned - and unbanned - thousands of players, took control of the ban feed, gave all players 2 billion credits and renown each, and unlocked every premium skin for all players without charge.</p>
<p>Hackers then banned dozens of fake accounts "so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean" on-screen, as seen below.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft says the issue is now resolved, the game's service page suggests issues persist right across the board.</p> <div>

<p>After <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808">notifying</a> players of an "incident" on 27th December, the publisher "intentionally shut down" both Siege and its Marketplace "while the team focuses on resolving the issue".</p>
<p>It also confirmed that while it had rolled back erroneous transactions, "nobody will be banned for spending credits received" and reminded players that the ban ticker had been turned off in a prior update.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.

</p></div>
<p>"An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but is not related to this incident," Ubisoft added. "We are working very hard to make sure this is resolved and players can play again.</p>
<p>"A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes," the team added in a subsequent update on X/Twitter. "The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible.</p><p>"Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this."</p>
<p>Then, on 28th December, Ubisoft launched a "soft launch", which only opened the game to a "small number of players only" while it completed live tests. Yesterday, 29th December, tests concluded and the game opened up to all again.</p>
<p>As a consequence, however, players experienced queues whilst connecting, and while players who didn't log in during the affected period should see no changes, those who did "may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks".</p>
<p>The Marketplace remains closed "until further notice".</p>
<p>"We appreciate your patience as we work hard to investigate the cause of these known issues and ensure the whole community can get back to playing Siege," Ubisoft said in its latest official <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005702094913671606?s=20">communication</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, however, the game's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">service status page</a> suggests "unplanned" outages persist, with connectivity, authentication, in-game store, and matchmaking all listed as "degraded" or showing a complete "outage" across every single platform (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen systems). It's unclear why at this time. </p>

            <p>Former Rockstar technical director, Obbe Vermeij, has commended <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian Studios for walking away from the hugely successful Dungeons &amp; Dragons series, calling it a "bold move".</p>
<p>Reflecting on the difficulties of moving on from critically-acclaimed properties - much like when he himself moved on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> in 2009 after games like GTA 3, GTA 4, Vice City, and San Andreas - Vermeij spoke to <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/">Games Hub</a> in a wide-ranging interview, intimating Larian had made a "risky" decision.</p>

<p>"It's quite cool to see Larian Studios, who just did Baldur’s Gate 3, and they've said, 'we don't feel like Baldur’s Gate 4. We're just gonna do another game'. And you know, good for them.</p>
<p>"But it's a bold move. It's not obvious. It's very risky. It's easier to just keep on doing what you’re doing.</p>
<p>"The reality is if you have a studio that has one mega successful game, it just doesn't make sense to do any wild changes," he added (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/baldurs-gate-4-larian-turned-down-rockstar-lead-respect/">TheGamer</a>), suggesting that it was tempting to "put [whatever weird ideas you have] into GTA rather than just launching an entirely new game".</p><p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">Larian is set to host an AMA in the new year to follow up on its use of generative AI</a>, following a huge backlash earlier this month. In a statement, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies" and the company's successes "come from empowering people to work in their own way".</p>
<p>It follows backlash against the company after Vincke told Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">the studio is using generative AI</a>, but its newly-revealed Divinity game won't include any AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Vermeji is now working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3044790/Plentiful/">Plentiful</a>, a sandbox god game where you can sculpt the land, redirect rivers, and guide your people "through a perilous Stone Age".</p>

<p>That release date has been eagerly anticipated. The game was first revealed back in 2023 at a Sony showcase, but since then, details have come in drips and drabs, with a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-trailer-shows-fresh-gameplay-but-its-still-without-a-release-date">Year of the Snake trailer shown at the start of this year</a>.</p>
<p>As for how it plays? Ed went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">hands-on at Gamescom in 2024</a> and loved its fast and stylish combat, stressing that no, it is <em>not</em> a Soulslike.</p>

            <p>2025 has gone by in a flash, hasn't it? Well, apart from the days I've spent tabulating all your Game of the Year votes and presenting the results here - that has felt like an eternity and I think has given me permanent neck pain. But, let's not worry about that. I'm sure you'll agree it was worth the sacrifice.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll skip down to the bottom to see the winner (maybe you've already done that before reading this - it's your life), but you might like to know that your Game of the Year earned more points than the No.2 and No.3 games combined. Well done <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Welcome Tour, you did it against all the odds!</p>
<p>I joke, obviously (although it did receive some votes, it didn't make this Top 50). Eurogamer's own top 50 list of our staff 2025 Best Games will follow soon, but today it's all about you. Now, remember to head to the comments and argue for days about it all. Have fun!</p>

<p>"Nothing like a huge time sink and a game you can have on in the background whilst watching TV (as long as you're in profit). beautifully paced it's a real comfort game watching your village develop into a city." -Metal Gear Simon</p>

</ul>
<p>"It was just a really fun cozy game. I spent about 80 hours and I'll probably never play it again and that's fine. The time I did spend was great and well worth the price." -Da_bubbarator</p>
<h2>48. Skin Deep</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Annapurna Interactive/Blendo Games</cite></span></figcaption>

<ul>
<li>Developer: Blendo Games</li>
<li>Platforms: PC</li>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skin-deep-review">Skin Deep review</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"If we're basing GOTY on how many times a game made me cackle with glee, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a> is the runaway winner. Even without that metric, this is a masterclass of pure, untethered systemic game design - where every level is tailored to encourage creativity and playfulness. Match that with Blendo's idiosyncratic humour, visual design and smash-cut heavy storytelling, and you've got the wonder that is Skin Deep." -maccydee</p>
<h2>47. Hell is Us</h2>

<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hell-is-us-review">Hell is Us review</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"I had little interest in this on the surface, the trailers gave me a knock off amalgam of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> and Demon Souls feel. I was very wrong, this game while not completely unique eschews a lot of the modern AAA "quality of life" features like maps, and direction indicators, and trusts that you the player will figure things out. It has some of the most compelling puzzle designs, world building, and general theming I've played in years and while the combat is a bit basic everything else works so very well. I hope a lot more AAA games take this as a good example for not always needing to sand down the friction points in their games. Sometimes the friction points are fun." -splayer88</p>
<h2>46. Despelote</h2>

<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despelote-review">Despelote review</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"A game of remarkable intimacy and intelligence. While it primarily presents itself as a remarkably vivid portrait of a very particular place and time, it's hard to grasp the true nature of Despelote until its final few sequences. Suddenly the game reveals itself as a thoughtful work on the very nature of autobiographical art and storytelling - the clash of fact and fiction that is necessary to tell a nostalgic tale rooted in personal experience. It does so with some of the most electrifying formal tricks of the year." -maccydee</p>

</ul>
<p>"I noted that the reviews were a little mixed, but I knew as soon as I saw a screenshot of a cell-shaded European landscape that I was going to play this. I'm a sucker for all things road cycling, and while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-bike">Wheel World</a> perhaps didn't do a lot to portray how much suffering is involved in even the lowliest of amateur races, it captured the sheer joy of free-wheeling downhill past vineyards and windmills absolutely perfectly." -fleabitmonkey</p>

<li>Developer: Nihon Falcom</li>
<li>Platforms: PC, PS5, Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>"I was kind of worried this would be awful, ruin the original, be an action game, or turn it into a total slog. Instead, they seem to have captured and preserved everything about the original while making it snappier and beautiful. It's a fascinating, surprising remake for not being all that surprising, and not completely reinventing the wheel like some other efforts to modernize classic RPGs by turning them into bloated budget action games." -jesse_dylan</p>

</ul>
<p>"Bloober's follow-up to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake is such a well-written and intriguing story that wrapped around some great level design and performances. It might take a while to really get going, but once it does, I couldn't stop playing. Don't get me wrong, the first half of the game is fun, but the last half of the game has some of the best level design I've even played through, and the mysterious story takes on whole new layers in new game +. A few underwhelming bosses can't stop Cronos: The New Dawn from being one of my favorite horror games." -Sente Graphs</p>

<p>"The game I wanted Journey to be. A visually stunning and joyous experience that doesn't really need much more explanation. "4 hours long and highly polished" really needs to be a gold standard for developers to aim for." -Duckbum</p>

</ul>
<p>"Call me a sucker for a Mafia story but I do love them. Oftentimes you see the ending coming from a mile away, and this one was not a surprise in the least, but I liked the characters - even the ones I didn't enjoy - and it was just wonderful playing a more focused game that didn't have you do a million and one things to progress. Its recreation of Sicily is also absolutely stunning and a joy just to walk around in. Lastly, has there ever been a (male) game character as attractive as Luca Trapani?!" -Joshua#5367</p>

As I look back months later, I've put more time into this than anything else this year, derailing my playthroughs of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Age of Imprisonment and more. The gameplay hook is ridiculously addictive, the botched runs are often hilarious and it's just all round a superb time of making some wonderful hype moments in the FromSoftware playbox. The character designs are absolutely peak and the Nightlords are epic. I look forward to what they can cook up with The Duskbloods." -[STARS]TyranT #9295</p>

There's nothing "new" here and it's not the Skyrim-lite that I think some wanted. But oh boy is it fast, tight and lots of fun. Loved the combat, loved the party dynamics. There were decisions throughout this game that I thought about for longer than I ever do in most RPGs. The general quality of life throughout felt great and it was the perfect length for me. Was expecting a 6 or 7 out of 10 - and maybe it is in reality - but for what I was after it was much, much more." -raxshasa</p>

I look forward to all the clones largely made by AI arriving over the next few years." -MarcusJ</p><p>"I've always thought that episodic games had massive potential, and handled correctly they could be great. AdHoc Studios made them Super. They've blurred the line between TV show and video game and the result is a binge worthy series with great pacing, an incredible cast, and truly funny writing.

<p>"My multiplayer days are behind me (or so I thought). Too reaction heavy, too time consuming, too toxic. And yet something about the look and sound (oh my the sound! Of course it's ex-Battlefield devs on this) hooked me in and I haven't been able to leave since. I haven't enjoyed a multiplayer shooter like this for literal decades. It's genius. Funny, scary, tense, exciting. Just enough nudge to keep you playing but nothing too soul demanding. All built around these perfect 20 minute raids. It's the little details that make it. The echo of your own footsteps. The agonising, noisy wait for an evac. The chu-chick, chu-choonk of every slow reload. Years of expertise and testing have gone into it and it shows. But it's the community that makes it. I've howled with laughter at some of the voice chat and generally comical behaviour of my fellow Raiders. Far more so than I've cursed the odd back-stabbing one. What a game" -Taffer #2026</p><p>"Over the last 20 years I've read so much about 'emergent gameplay' and how certain games aspire to create non-scripted setpieces and and stories. For my money, Arc Raiders is the first game to properly deliver on that promise. Its clever combination of extraction mechanics, fantastic PvE gameplay and a genuine social experiment in how you interact with other raider squads should you encounter them, throws up some incredibly emergent and fun moments." -captain-T-dawg</p>

<p>"A heartwarming game to play with your loved ones which at the same time pushes technical and game design boundaries like no other game in 2025 did.

<p>"The reduced friction (earlier access to vehicles, less fiddly combat) is what allowed me to warm up to DS2 much faster than the original. But it was a moment of pure hopelessness that won its place in my heart. Half way up the game's central mountain, an avalanche obliterated my truck, my character, and a cargo of materials and stray packages I'd been building since the start of the game. I was left with no choice but to lug my precious few remaining items to the top of the mountain on foot. Half an hour of hiking and one classic Death Stranding 2: On the Beach needle drop later, I made it, with a renewed love for the hardships that make the series so unforgettable." -JCC </p><p>"For a game that's central theme is about letting go of grief in order to move forward, I didn't want this game to ever end. Spending over 240 hours in its world, absorbing as much as I possibly could before heading into that insane finale, is something I'll never forget.

<p>"KCD2 is among the best-realised worlds I have ever experienced in a game. The production quality is off the chart, the story is magnificent and it held my attention for the 100 hour span. Truly an incredible achievement of a game." -Wrathbone</p><p>"KCD2 is quietly ambitious in a way so many other bigger releases aim to be but aren't. Playing it back to back with the Oblivion remaster that released at a similar time really shows how much Warhorse have not only captured the open world magic of a Bethesda-style RPG, but expanded and improved on it to create a tactile, believable and lived in world on an impressive scale, while discarding many conventions around simplifying and dumbing down game mechanics while still creating a snappy and approachable game.

<p>"The gameplay is absurdly tight, and this combined with the extreme maneuverability given all the special moves makes you feel like the character is being controlled directly by the player's brain rather than your brain controlling your hands which push buttons on a controller. And it's just so ridiculously fun. That's why it works being rather difficult, because when I lose to a boss I can't wait to get back into it, just because the game is so incredibly fun to play on a moment-to-moment basis. And then of course the art, animation, music, and sound design create such strong vibes. They are not just great, they are extremely cohesive and expressive. Everything comes together cohesively and synergistically to create an incredible and unique experience that is simply more fun than any other game this year." -Mark T</p>

<p>"I can't find a single negative thing to say about this game. The story, art direction and music are excellent, the gameplay is immaculate, it reinvents the JRPG-style turn based combat in a compelling way, all the characters have depth and real motivations... I could go on for hours. Playing it was as great as eating a still warm, freshly baked baguette filled with oozy camembert. A classic." -carloorlac</p><p>"It's been a while since a game has completely blown me away and that's exactly what Clair Obscur did. It felt like a game that had everything I would want. The story was excellent, with plenty of twists and turns (some pretty wild!), the acting was outstanding to go along with it. The art style was lovely, in particular featuring my favourite ever over-world map. And the soundtrack is just an absolute all-timer. Then we get to the game itself, with for my money, the best iteration of turn-based combat out there, making every encounter exciting, and with the impressively deep Picto and Lumina system, allowing for some absolutely wild builds in the end game." -Zombie-Hamster</p>
<p>"Possibly the best game of the last decade. Clair Obscur shows what happens when an AA studio has a vision and delivers passionately on it. Dripping with French style, amazing music, and a top tier voice cast. This is absolute cinema." -RealStyli</p>
<p>"It's just wonderful. I could talk about the narrative and the setting and the characters and talk about how it made me think about my relationship with art and my relationship with death and how death is inevitable and that it's when you die that's important and how it made me cry three times, and that would be covering half of what makes the game so great. But mechanically it's fantastic, too. Every party member has such wildly different mechanics, and they synergise in the most fun way. It's a game that isn't just happy for you to break its systems, but actively encourages it. There are bosses in here that I was only able to beat by building my party in such a way that they simply never had an opportunity to attack. At the same time, if one was skilled enough, they could take down any boss purely by parrying and counter attacking and never levelling up a single character. It's absolutely marvellous." -2much</p>

            <p>Peak developer Aggro Crab has hit back at "friendslop" haters, insisting there's a place for co-op games that "deliver a specific experience", especially as they can be "very cost-effective for indie production".</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/peak-lead-knows-youre-a-friendslop-hater-but-remember-these-games-arent-trying-to-be-game-of-the-year-these-are-games-that-emphasize-teamwork/">GamesRadar+</a>, studio head Nick Kaman said that while these games may "forego traditional quality markers", some players just want to hang out with their friends and have fun – and that's what "friendslop games put [...] at the front and centre of the experience".</p>

<p>"There's backlash because sometimes these games forego traditional quality markers like polished graphics or story, but these games aren't trying to be Game of the Year, they focus on delivering a specific experience and that can make it very cost-effective for indie production," Kaman said.</p><p>While he acknowledges that "like with any hot genre, you get a lot of fast-follows and low-quality attempts flooding the storefronts", he reckons "it's mainly just fun to be a hater, especially when a term like 'friendslop' is so juicy".</p>
<p>"There's a real desire to connect and hang out in online worlds, and friendslop games put that at the front and centre of the experience," Kaman added. "These are games that emphasise teamwork and communication, as opposed to just testing your individual skill in a group setting."</p>
<p>Peak – which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds – is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p>
<p>It's been so successful, in fact, that it has spawned so many clones, the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smash-hit-co-op-climber-peak-sells-another-million-as-studio-outlines-future-update-plans">indie hit </a>would rather its community <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop">pirate its own game than play a "microtransaction-riddled" ripoff</a>.</p>

            <p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD Projekt, has acquired 100 percent ownership of GOG, the DRM-free digital games store.</p>
<p>Although GOG was co-founded by Kiciński in 2008 and was already part of CD Projekt via Sp.z.o.o., the acquisition sees Kiciński take full ownership, although he insists the game platform will continue to "operate independently, supporting gamers and developers through its DRM-free philosophy".</p>
<p>"The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever," the company said.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>GOG is entering a new chapter.</p><p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD PROJEKT and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p><p>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever.</p><p>Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library…</p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>"CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership. I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering - making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much," Kiciński said.</p><p>"As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026."</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, added: "With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move. For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it's going into very good hands - we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG's co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes."</p>
<p>As part of the deal, GOG has signed a distribution agreement with CD Projekt, including a plan to release all CD Projekt Red's upcoming games on GOG.</p>
<p>GOG is, of course, one of few digital distributors that permitted Santa Ragione's controversial horror, Horses, to go on sale. Following Valve and Epic Game Stores' decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-responds-with-additional-context-following-horses-steam-ban-controversy">ban developer Santa Ragione's narrative horror game Horses</a>, rival storefront GOG weighed in, saying it wanted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them-steam-rival-gog-weighs-in-amid-horses-ban-controversy">"to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and [give creators] the space to bring their artistic work to them</a>."</p><p>GOG also fights to preserve games. Announcing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">Preservation Program</a> in November last year, the company said it wants to maintain the compatibility of games with modern and future systems. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">GOG also joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects</a> (EFGAMP) as it continues to push for game preservation.</p>

            <p>If we're plotting out the year based on unexpected obsessions, mine were (in no particular order) weird Italian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s, an unhealthy appetite for unnecessarily elaborate physical media collector's editions, folk horror in literally any form I could consume, and, apparently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>. According to Steam's usual end-of-year thing, the exploratory space sim is by far my most played game of 2025, accounting for - somewhat incredibly - nearly 20 percent of my total playtime.</p>

<p>That'd seem like a lot for any game, but it feels especially surprising given No Man's Sky is on the cusp of its tenth anniversary, meaning I've somehow been tootling away in its procedural universe for the best part of a decade. That's quite an achievement; I genuinely cannot think of a single other thing that's held my interest for so long - apart from maybe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9aM9Ch97U8">Carl Poppa</a>, but that's a weird musical anomaly even I can't adequately explain.</p>

<p>Carl Grimes' rhymes aside, it really has been a banner year for No Man's Sky, with developer Hello Games continuing to let its fancy run wild as it fills in the universe-sized gaps around its space sim's ambulatory core. Back in January, the happy wanderers and sightseers among us got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-storm-ravaged-gas-giants-and-trillions-of-new-planets-in-another-major-overhaul">significantly more dramatic, realistic terrain generation</a> to admire, as well as gas giants and ocean worlds. And nearly 12 months on, I still don't find those fathomless, watery depths of suffocating darkness and unseen horrors any less terrifying - which I very much consider a win.</p>

<p>And things only got wilder from there. Never in a million years would I have expected 'being able to dig up prehistoric fossils and turn them into skeletal museum displays' to be on my 2025 No Man's Sky bingo card, but that's exactly what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-latest-update-lets-you-dig-for-prehistoric-bones-and-assemble-them-into-weird-skeletal-displays">March's paleontology update</a> brought. Even now, I find myself making a quick stop-off when I spy a fossil bed, determined to collect 'em all. Then, of course, came the real banger: the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-adds-fully-customisable-multi-crew-spaceships-you-can-build-and-fly-with-your-friends">ability to create fully customisable multi-crew spaceships</a>. People went wild for this one, building everything from spacefaring Homer Simpsons to flyable floating cities - and No Man's Sky <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-boss-so-happy-as-sim-celebrates-highest-steam-player-count-since-launch-and-fans-go-wild-with-new-ship-customisation">celebrated its highest Steam player count since launch</a> as a result. My ship building efforts, if you're curious, stalled at 'unwieldy toaster' but it's <em>my</em> unwieldy toaster and I love it all the same.</p><p>All this stuff's been great - and No Man's Sky's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">recent The Game Awards win for Best Ongoing Game</a> feels more than deserved - but when I think back across my year in space, it's not the flashy new features that immediately leap to mind. Rather, my memories all concertina down to a single happy moment, repeated again and again: cresting over a hill and discovering the procedural stars have aligned to create a vista of perfect undulations; of tree-pocked hills and swaying meadows, of oceans lapping against mountains lost in the fog - a stretch of untouched sci-fi beauty to appreciate in a brief moment of tranquility before moving on.</p>



<p>Somewhere along the way, No Man's Sky has, I think, become my comfort game, a calming digital respite - with its peaceful seclusion and ambient procedural beats - from whatever bullshit the world's got in store for us next. And as much as I enjoy the busy buzzing of Hello Games' peripheral additions, I love the fact the simple, soothing act of <em>wandering</em> - of gentle traipsing and languid laser pointing - has, when you really break it down, stayed at No Man's Sky's heart. I'm currently working through the Expedition events I missed earlier this year, and squished so close together, there's little hiding that they're essentially the same thing repeated again and again. But I don't care; it's another excuse to log on and amble with vague purpose, so I fire the next one up and I'm in my happy place again.</p>

<p>Recently, I had a lovely time putting the finishing touches to my long-in-the-works desert base, mooching around planets and collecting resources before heading home to unleash the full force of my decorating prowess, happily lost in a revery of rug placement (the base looks great, by the way, but I wouldn't recommend visiting in a storm if you value your framerate). And still Hello Games continues to fill in the spaces around me in wonderfully unexpected ways. The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">next big thing</a>, Light No Fire, draws tantalisingly closer, but whatever that means for No Man's Sky, here's to another year of wandering through this most unpredictable of space sims.</p>

            <p>I think a lot of Dispatch can be distilled into a single moment at the beginning of the game when the player comes face to face with a penis. There it is, dangling visibly between the legs of an unclothed, toxic-drenched super-villain you're about to fight. The camera all but centers on it. There's no way you can miss it unless you've flipped the nudity switch off, in which case it's replaced by an even more conspicuous black box that only amplifies the naughtiness of the part hidden within. But most people don't turn nudity off because they're expecting boobs. That's what we usually see. In Dispatch, however, it's a penis we see waggling unavoidably on our screens.</p>

<p>This is "100 percent the meta-joke" by the way - misdirecting people with a nudity slider and then showing them a penis. That's what narrative director Pierre Shorette told me in an interview recently. He said: "Being able to see streams where people leave it on and then they're like 'what the fuck!' and freak out to hit pause and turn the censors back on: it's very funny. People are uncomfortable around dicks." And though it's a crude joke, it highlights how Dispatch steps beyond boundaries to do things differently.</p>

<p>Here's another example, and I'm sorry if it spoils another moment for you but, again, it's from early in the game and of little consequence. So: there's a superhero in the game called Phenomaman, who's clearly modelled on Superman - a being from another planet blessed with extraordinary powers like super strength and speed, and flight, and who's seemingly invincible - and you've just kissed his ex-girlfriend and you're telling him that fact. A risky situation. He's depressed and he could crush you like a bug - and not a hardy bug at that. You confess, then, and brace for the worst. But Phenomaman doesn't do what a character like this probably would in 99 percent of stories like it. There's no confrontation. Instead, he kisses you. He walks right up to you and kisses you. I don't want to say why so as to preserve some of the mystery around it, but the reasoning is totally unexpected and inspired - two words I'd use to describe so much of Dispatch.</p><p>But the boundary-crossing goes beyond just surprising players. There's a qualitative step here that pushes the writing and presentation closer towards something you might expect from an animated TV show, with modern, naturalistic dialogue that fizzes around and sparkles with a sense of wit. Scenes have the feeling of those rehearsed a hundred times to eke out every available gag and dramatic decorative opportunity. There's a slickness to Dispatch I find irresistible. Moreover, there's a game here. People often patronise experiences like these as being interactive TV only, and okay, broadly speaking, that's the area of game we're in. But there's substance: a layer of strategic puzzling, of literal dispatching - sending your team of heroes on missions - that absorbed me for hours, as I tried to level up and discover new synergistic character combos.</p>

<p>Describing Dispatch in familiar gaming terms sells it short. To say to someone, "This is a Telltale-like episodic series about superheroes working out of an office," makes it sound stuffy and boring. And it is far from that. Those are its gaming components, but where Dispatch is so startling, so full of verve, so colourful and entertaining, is in how it's been brought to life. The impeccable craft of it. The humour rippled through it. It's in the game's pursuit of the unexpected and in our subsequent joy of surprise. Dispatch is a prismatic burst of entertainment, one I have no hesitation in recommending to everyone I know, game-literate or not, by way of showing them what games are capable of.</p>

            <p>I think these days, after years of Nintendo outright eschewing the console power rat race and focusing instead on different ways to play and honing their core craft, we forget that Nintendo is still a pretty sharp company in terms of <em>technical</em> innovation. Raw power went aside with the Wii, but the company's dedication to tinkering around the edges to create stand-out original experiences in other ways remained - or perhaps even intensified. There's been a lot of examples over the years, of course, from clever game design innovations to zany peripherals - but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has to be one of the finest showcases of that thinking from Nintendo in years.</p>
<p>It's not that Bananza is really demonstrating all-new technology, obviously. Right from the preview period I was jokingly calling it Red Faction Gorilla, so similar is its worldview and technical execution to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-faction-guerrilla-was-an-open-world-game-with-purpose">an Xbox 360 title from fifteen years ago</a>. But what you have here is a remarkable expression of that sort of world destruction technology and design - and in true Nintendo fashion everything done is carefully placed in service of fun, imagination, and satisfaction.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>The structure of Mario Odyssey is lightly reproduced, with precious bananas swapped out for Moons and players given a suite of open-ended sandbox levels within which they can do the bare minimum to progress or dig deep to clear each stage out. Except here, the digging is literal - Odyssey's brilliant-but-cute gimmicks swapped for something more all-encompassing, with Banadium Gems hidden in every nook and crevice of each map, and DK's skill set built around ripping said map to pieces. Sometimes, less is more. This game is that writ large: design brilliance through design purity. DK is a big strong lad about smashing stuff. He doesn't need anything more outlandish than that.</p><p>Gathering all of those bananas requires not so much puzzle solving, but careful thought about the mechanics at your disposal and how best to deploy them for whatever specific micro-task is at hand. In this you get an easy-to-play game that even a real beginner can pick up but with real satisfying depth for those who want to really dig deep into the game's mechanics. The perfect Nintendo game is always like this - with a Pixarian ability to thread the needle with winks, nods, and challenges for the grown-ups all while providing an overall package that even very young children can enjoy. It's just brilliant.</p>
<p>There's a vision of Nintendo as a slightly insular company - and while Nintendo indeed always 'does its own thing', but it does so with its eye on others. And so one can see in Banaza shades of the destructive and creative play spaces of Minecraft and the like in much the same way as one can sense the influence of Skyrim on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>.</p>
<p>It's curious too how one half of the game's directing duo is a relative outsider - Kazuya Takahashi's last credit prior to Bananza was on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a>, where he directed the main game's quests and then fully led the actually rather underrated multiplayer expansion. I personally imagine this as demonstrative of how Nintendo (and, to an extent, Japanese development in general) is shifting its approach to employment. Years ago it would've been relatively unthinkable that a newcomer could arrive from another company and, no matter the previous seniority, step right into leadership on a flagship game. But here you get that. Admittedly this is likely so that the Odyssey leads (that game's director served as producer here) could likely carry on thinking about Mario's future - but between them, Takahashi and Mario veteran Wataru Tanaka provide a fresh feel from the shared director's chair.</p>
<p>There's another shift, too. <em><strong>Endgame spoilers ahead</strong></em>.</p>



<p>What a nostalgia bomb, hey? After years of ignoring most of Donkey Kong made outside of Japan, we finally get a game that doesn't just pay lip service to DK's proud years coming out of the UK - it goes further, showing an active adoration of that time.</p><p>I'm not just talking about returning villains, familiar music, and a trip to a location from the Mario universe here - I'm talking about all of Bananza's original stuff too, which all oozes a sort of Rarewarian energy that Japan has never really bothered to worry about before. Vibes are always difficult-to-impossible to articulate in text, though suffice it to say that Bananza just feels of a piece with the Rare-era DK games - and not just because the underground's various inhabitants are all googley-eyed creatures.</p>
<p>Pair that love of the past with a surprising sense of narrative style and you get something that hits difficult to the usual Japan-made platforming fare. I'm not sure if that story ambition comes from existing in a post Mario movie world, or from hiring a guy who worked on Final Fantasy, or somewhere else entirely - but it's there. I punched the air as old foes returned and classic musical refrains tugged at the memory centers of my brain. And I had a lump in my throat when a teary-eyed Pauline said goodbye to DK in (one of) the game's ending(s). I can't think of a Nintendo title that achieved that for me, other than a couple of Zelda endings.</p>
<p>Anyway, I ramble, as one is want to do in this sort of gushing thing. Bananza is far from a perfect game, as I outlined in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Eurogamer's four-star review</a>. One can see where it falls short of Odyssey-level greatness and see plenty of opportunity for improvement. I also dare say there are certainly on-paper 'better' games this year, as you'd expect - we've given out a few five-star reviews. But sometimes, that slightly imperfect game just speaks to you more. It weasels its way into your heart and becomes an absolute favourite.</p>
<p>Bananza is that for me. And if this is the template for the future, I can't wait for the next Mario - or to see what's next for DK and Pauline. And, if we're tugging at my heartstrings, I wouldn't mind a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a> either. Could 2026 be the year? I hope so.</p>

            <p>I'm going to spoil the opening of Despelote here - an opening which I think, as you can probably tell, is pretty glorious. It's not a spoiler so much as a contaminator, a finger on the scales of something it'll feel wonderful to go into unweighted. So go away right now if you want to experience it for yourself.</p>

<p>So, Despelote's opening sequence. There have been other moments that hit me with more force this year - several of those in Despelote itself in fact, later on - but maybe none that some up my love for a game like this one. You begin in a game of football - specifically, video game football, retro video game football, a top-down, Subbuteo-like game on a deeply grainy, black-and-white TV screen, the thunk's of each kick landing with a kind of analogue fuzz, the ball itself, a white speck, barely visible amongst all the artefacts and grain.</p>
<p>And then, a little match. And then the moment. Some dialogue, on-screen in speech bubbles but coming from off-screen, to the side, your periphery. On-screen not in a deliberate way but a distracting way, like you can't help but dial in to this conversation happening from all around you, can't help but read, when you realise it's you being talked about too, when you're also trying not to get done over in retro FIFA by Peru. And then the screen moves, and you're pulling back, gradual and continuous, the screen smaller, more distant, your childhood home pulling into view while the game itself continues in your hands.</p>

<p>It's a lovely trick. Despelote is a game about childhood life - specifically, the developer's childhood life - at the height of World Cup fever (really, World Cup Qualifier fever) in Ecuador circa 2001. And this moment then is childhood absorption and hyperfocus in a single movement of a virtual camera - a rare case of a video game making the most of its lack of physical camera, in fact, using the language of camera-based media without the restrictions that come with it. You are out of the TV and into the world, and then - ha - real TV, real football on the screen instead. Real Ecuador, your national side, are playing with actual, archival footage, as your parents do that "parents who don't know football but watch it when the national team plays" thing and add some charmingly un-specialist commentary of a near miss.</p><p>It might not sound like much, but I love this moment so dearly. Despelote is full of these little tricks, barely even tricks, really, if you're not paying attention. It loves to play with the form, to do a little bait-and-switch with the task at hand, or the boundaries of the world, the structure and rules of the game. It continuously makes rules and breaks them, adopts an unspoken language and switches into another. With every slow pull-back is a message: your childhood world is expanding. Or contracting. Or being all-consuming, in the way those big, childhood moments you can still remember now always seemed to be.</p>

<div>



<p>Screens are a recurring theme in Despelote.</p>

</div>

<p>Despelote is a game that understands the bigness of life. The way that a football tournament played thousands of miles away is life and death to a child, that awkwardness and rejection at a teenage party is life and death to a teen, that successfully making a game, recording and documenting the truth of a place too rarely shown on screen, of your hometown, probably feels like life and death to a developer on a microscopic budget. Through moments like these, Despelote talks to you about what it means to remember or misremember, to attempt to capture a place as it is or was, to try to do a community justice. It's inextricable, as a result, from the people who made it, who are doing the remembering and the documenting and, in places, reckoning with their failures or limits in doing so as well. It's a game that bumps up against the outer boundaries of what games have managed to do so far as a medium, and which shows over and over just what it is they're capable of in the right hands.</p>

            <p>A guide writer talking about how her favourite gaming related moment of 2025 was uncovering secrets? Who saw that coming… Seriously though, let me tell you about a little downside of my job: if we're covering a game, or considering doing so, I have to spoil everything for myself for planning purposes. End-game boss? Spoiled. Every collectible location and what happens after you've collected every magic hat or whatever? Spoiled. Plot twists, because I might as well go all in at this point? Spoiled. If I don't learn it before the game comes out, I'll certainly know about it shortly after release thanks to research. (I learned what happened to Zelda in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a> via Google Trends. <em>Google bloody Trends</em>.)</p>

<p>So it is an understatement to say I was happy when it was announced that Chapter Three and Four of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> - something I had been waiting four years for - were being released the day before the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. There was absolutely no way I had the time to cover them. Not in the slightest! It guaranteed I could enjoy finding the hidden eggs all by myself.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, however, I must first establish two things. Firstly, minor spoilers for Deltarune ahead. (Look how nice I am compared to Google.) Secondly, when I'm talking about eggs in Deltarune, I mean literal physical eggs you can find in-game. Not an easter egg. We good? We're good.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Eggsample 1. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/tobyfox</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I played Deltarune Chapter One back when it was called 'Survey Program' and all that was really known about it was how it was a new game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tobyfox">Toby Fox</a> (developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>). There I was on Halloween night, not conducting the dark arts, but being mystified as the game transformed from what is essentially a survey to a world filled with familiar Undertale faces to being thrust into a Wonderland inspired setting. I spent a lot of time backtracking - completely lost to the desire of cracking the game's ribs open so I could taste everything - when, during an area transition, the world fell away.</p><p>The thin path fenced in by foliage that had existed here during all of my past visits was gone. Instead, I was faced with a single tree. Unsure of what to do and unwilling to leave what was clearly a secret area, I investigated. Behind the tree, hidden by its leaves, I found a man and he gave me an egg. I left the area and, despite all of my attempts, could not revisit that tree. I did find a fridge to put the egg in, though.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Eggsample 2. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/tobyfox</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When Chapter 2 arrived in 2021, finding the hidden egg was one of my top priorities. I knew they were going to build into something important. Deltarune is from the creator of Undertale after all: the game where every mechanic is tied to either the plot or world building. Fox wouldn't include these eggs - not easter eggs as we typically know them, but a clear reference to them - without it building to something. Thankfully, I wasn't overthinking this as chapters Three and Four paid off my trust in Fox, but man did I have to work for it.</p>
<p>Chapter Three's egg hunt is the most elaborate in Deltarune so far. I honestly thought I'd missed it and was mentally preparing myself for a second playthrough when, literally five minutes before the final boss, I picked a jokey line of dialogue which sent me to a room of 'Clear Egg Importance'. What followed was a recipe of backtracking, puzzle solving and returning to a puzzle because I missed something. All caramelised with a dash of sheer luck. The relief I felt when I saw that now familiar tree was joyous. The laugh I let out when I realised I needed to complete a cryptic dialogue tree to get my egg was loud.</p><p>After the gauntlet Chapter Three put me through, I didn't mind at all that finding Chapter Four's egg was far easier; relying more on paying attention to the environment than anything else. It didn't stop finding both eggs from being a rewarding process, either. I truly felt like I was uncovering something the game was actively trying to hide from me as I investigated anything that felt a little bit off or a tad unfinished, pulling the threads until I unravelled the prize. The fact that I avoided being spoiled made my success all the sweeter, especially since I now have a solid theory of what the eggs are building up to.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Eggsample 3. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/tobyfox</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like I'd hoped, Fox is using the mechanic of hidden easter eggs to tell part of Deltarune's story - be it an optional addition for those willing to pick the game apart. The areas containing the egg man and his tree have transformed from simple spaces to almost surrealist retellings of Kris' (the character you control) childhood. Kris has the ability to hide information from the player, so these insights into their past only intensify my drive to find each egg. I have a feeling collecting all of the eggs will offer some added context to the events of Deltarune and I'm looking forward to learning what it is.</p>
<p>Tying a collectible hunt to the story like this is the best way to get me invested. Far better than, say, hiding hundreds upon hundreds of seeds about a map  with the ultimate reward clearly being a pile of feces. It's exactly the kind of secret hunt I was looking for this year too. Now I have to know what Kris is hiding and who the egg man is! (I highly doubt it's Frank Reynolds.) True answers are still a way off, but I'll bide my time watching Deltarune lore theory videos until Chapter Five hopefully arrives in 2026.</p>

            <p>Out in space there are objects that orbit one another for so long, and at such a stately pace, that when they both eventually arrive at the same point, they don't collide with some kind of awful explosion. Instead, they just touch. They graze. They fuse. It's all very gentle. And then, over time, the two objects become one.</p>

<p>This is kind of how I feel about Blendo Games, the studio run by Brendon Chung, and immersive sims. This is the genre that's all about taking things slowly, revelling in the atmosphere, reading the notes and the emails, going through drawers, and then picking your approach forward from multiple potential paths that are laid through the environments.</p>
<p>For years, us Blendo Spotters have felt that Chung has had a really good immersive sim in him. Games like Gravity Bone and Thirty Flights of Loving kind of pretend to be immersive sims, but they're really linear cinematic games that are lofted above other games with similar ambitions because Chung seems to really understand the cinema he's riffing on. There's a chase at the end of Gravity Bone which is Road Runner, Midnight Run, Raising Arizona and the best bits of Thomas Pynchon combined. There's a party in Thirty Flights that is as dreamy as anything the French or the silent greats - or the silent French - ever came up with. And the jump cuts! You never saw such jump cuts.</p>

<p>Then there's Quadrilateral Cowboy, which brings Blendo a lot closer to making a game where you have choices and you can properly screw things up. It's a beautiful thing, but it's also a game about hacking, and the hacking comes to dominate my memory of the experience. A great game, but not quite an immersive sim.</p><p>I wrote much of this in my review of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a> earlier this year, but I'm returning to it again because, over time, I think that for me at least this stuff is the purest pleasure that Skin Deep offers. I have watched this designer and this genre approach one another for well over a decade. I have watched them circle, arrange their orbits, and now, finally, they have become one thing.</p>
<p>And what a thing they have become. To do the video game maths, Skin Deep is Deux Ex with a bit of Die Hard, a bit of 2001: A Space Odyssey, a bit of Splinter Cell Conviction and a bit of a dozen other things I can't call to mind right now. But it's also 100 percent Blendo. This is that rare kind of studio that is able to make its inspirations feel like creative choices. Deep cuts! Splinter Cell Conviction, ffs! In 2025!?</p>



<p>You play as a kind of insurance agent all-round badass who is dispatched into deep space to connect with ships that are being robbed. It's stealth, because you're better taking foes down without being spotted, but it's also Road Runner stealth, because you use bananas to trip enemies up and then their heads pop off and you have to flush them down the toilet before they regrow their bodies.</p><p>I could go on with the examples: the pepper you can spray, the fact that you can ride dazed enemies and ram them into walls, the fact that one level is a library and the next will be an observatory, the fact that you're rescuing cats and pulling glass out of your feet to heal and phoning in fake all-clears on a radio so as not to give yourself away. But the point is this is a compact immersive sim. Each level gives you a handful of enemies, a handful of familiar toys to take them down, and a bunch of novel elements that come from the detailing of the environment itself. You read notes and emails and logs and all that jazz to understand where you are and how things work. But you also read them because they're beautifully written and characterful and deliver a sense of a world that is so richly imagined and so thoroughly imagined that the developer only has to give you pieces of it in order to delight you.</p>
<p>As such it's a sort of virtuous circle: the Blendo stuff feeds into the immersive sim stuff, giving you oddball locations and strange opportunities, and the immersive sim stuff feeds back into the Blendo stuff, encouraging the developer to flesh out the environments and write little letters to the audience that are filled with lore but also hints and clues and all that jazz.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Annapurna Interactive/Blendo Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And the sense throughout is that this is all so harmonious. It just fits. Skin Deep is the game that Blendo was meant to make, and it's the game that a lot of us have glimpsed in all the developer's other games, going back to oddities like Flotilla as well as straight-up bangers like Gravity Bone.</p><p>I spoke to Brendon Chung earlier this year for a magazine piece and was delighted to learn that he had such a comfortable budget on Skin Deep that he was able to work with collaborators. And being a decent fellow, he went as far as to credit each level designer in-game at the start of their particular mission. Sure, all games should do this kind of thing, but it's still wonderful to see when someone chooses to do it.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>What fascinated me the most about this is that, despite having all these voices in the game, all these hands on the code, it's still a Blendo joint to its core. One of the things that is great about games is seeing handwriting that stays the same from one game to the next: the way an Arkham game likes to stage the approach to a boss fight, say, or the way that material physics from a Pixeljunk game turned up in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> game because Nintendo hired the person who did them.</p>
<p>And with Skin Deep this sense of reading familiar handwriting is everywhere. Here are the ideas and the influences that I've spent two decades getting to know. And they're richer and joined by new stuff and filled with the work of other people, but the whole thing is also clearer to parse than it ever has been. What a game.</p>

            <p>In a loud world where everyone is battling to be heard, it's easy to forget that the quiet and smaller moments of kindness hold the most power. A lot of the time, it's easy to think that keeping to yourself is the easiest way to deal with things, whether you're dealing with your own pain or trying to find the right way to navigate someone else's. It's never easy to know what to do, we're all trying our best - after all this is all our first time being human. But one truth remains:a little kindness goes a long way. Winter Burrow, the intrepid little mouse game, shows this more than anything else I've played in 2025.</p>

<p>Other than the need to survive without freezing your little tail to death or looking for your Aunty after she was snatched up by an Owl, most of your actions in Winter Burrow are born of the mouse's kindness. From reuniting a remorseful Toad with their stubborn Tadpole and making them both listen to each other, to helping a nervous Hedgehog navigate loss - your small, seemingly innate, acts of compassion and kindness have an everlasting impact.</p>
<p>A little way into the story you meet Moss, a nervous Hedgehog missing their partner Pinesap who's not been seen for an unnerving amount of time. There's an air around them that they already know the truth, but can't bring themselves to think of that or their world will crumble.  Before you can begin looking for Pinesap, you spend time doing multiple smaller tasks for Moss to try to piece together what happened to their partner. After a few devastating clues, the answer becomes glaringly obvious - and the steps you've just taken for Moss end up holding more weight than they did before.</p>

</figure>
<p>Those small acts of kindness helping Moss out, from tracking down a missing heavy key to locating Pinesap's Wollen Hood, eventually add up to help Moss process the news no one wants to hear - their favourite person is gone. Grief can be all-consuming, whether you're grieving the loss of a loved one or the loss of your health, perhaps something that meant a lot to you, no matter what you grieve the feeling is the same - it can swallow you whole, leaving you very little strength to claw your way back out again.</p><p>After learning the truth about Pinesap, it's clear that Moss was close to falling into that all-consuming void and would have if it weren't for you. Caught in a loop between knowing the truth while denying what they know by holding on to the small strings of hope they have left.</p>
<p>'Don't abandon old Moss', a simple request on the surface but one with a much deeper meaning after learning Pinesap's fate. Moss doesn't want to be alone, and soon learns that they don't have to be. Your few minutes a day of compassion give them their life back - Moss eventually figures out how to be themselves again.</p>

<p>It's not just Moss though - all of the NPCs you meet are so caught up in their own lives that they've unintentionally become isolated and are trying to figure things out on their own. Bufo is lost in wondering about their runaway tadpole Pollywog, Willow is deep in their research, and Aunty became too worried about the outside world to venture out. Without you, they all would have remained separated, trying to cope with things alone - not knowing that there was another option.</p><p>And that's what Winter Burrow highlights so well when you look at many of the characters you meet, choosing to talk to them and not just listening, but choosing to hear them changes their lives for the better. It's easy to forget that the smallest actions have the biggest impact, and that sometimes all anyone ever needs is to be seen.</p>
<p>Whether it was for the day, or for a lot longer than that, Winter Burrow proves that a few small acts of kindness go a long way.</p>

            <p>We love a biome in video games. Even the word is one I inherently associate with video games, in spite of its origins as a piece of proper grown-up geographical terminology. Within that gloriously over-the-top thematic pantheon… is there anything better than a good old fashioned Christmas level?</p>
<p>I differentiate a Christmas Level from a Snow Level, by the way. There is a difference. While snow levels <em>can</em> be lovely and inviting, there's no guarantee of cosiness.</p>

<p>There's little cozy about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-metroidprime-gc">Metroid Prime</a>'s Phendrana Drifts. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-2-among-thieves-review">Uncharted 2</a>'s winter sequence is <em>definitely</em> not warm and fuzzy. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic 3</a>'s Ice Cap, sharpened shards of ice and avalanches try to murder you. Sure, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-legend-of-zelda">Zelda</a>'s Snowpeak Ruins balances that winter huddling and dungeon-spelunking threat nicely. But my favourite is actual true Christmas levels, because those ones are <em>always</em> cosy, I think. At least, the good ones.</p>
<p>The best of them, for my money, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>'s Freezeezy Peak, a wonderful little pocket of winter wonderland action. Coming roughly halfway through Banjo and Kazooie's adventure through Gruntilda's Lair and its attached worlds, this level isn't supposed to be easy-breezy, and nor is it. But even as it provides an appropriate challenge, it's just… welcoming.</p><p>There are few levels that go all-in on a theme attached to a specific time of year to this extent, perhaps out of worry that a game can be played all-year round and thereby shouldn't specifically evoke Christmas or what have you. Banjo goes all the way in on this, though. Freezeezy Peak is the most flagrant, but it is true that when I think of Halloween in games, Mad Monster Mansion is always high on the list. For summer seaside vibes, Treasure Trove Cove comes to mind. This is a game that always hammered its level themes, a clear belief visible on the part of its developers that there was no such thing as <em>too much</em> when it came to its theming.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>So here you get not just a casual snow level like the contemporaneous Cool, Cool Mountain from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>, but a specifically festive charm assault. From the moment Grant Kirkhope's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsVNLCGB1Uk">brilliant theme for the level</a> kicks off, you're told: this isn't just a snow stage. It's a <em>Christmas stage</em>. It does its all to evoke that cheery spirit.</p>
<p>The entrance to the level is shaped like an Advent Calendar, with our heroes trotting in through one of its doors. Inside the stage, you're suddenly sledding, tracking down Christmas presents for the neglected children of an irresponsible father too busy cutting about on his sled to look after his kids, and completing a series of platforming and combat challenges to quite literally decorate a tree with twinkling lights and then turn them on.</p>
<p>I really do believe that it is probably the best Christmas-themed level of all time.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Piece out. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rare</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are other games that also capture Christmas well, of course. The way it drapes a violent action story in the trappings of the holiday, Die Hard style, is the best thing about the otherwise ill-advised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-4-review">Dead Rising 4</a>. The same is true, to an extent, of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales-review-blockbuster-gaming-at-its-breeziest-and-best">Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-origins">Batman Arkham Origins</a>. Thinking of Christmas <em>in</em> games, I fondly remember the holiday period's depiction in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bully-scholarship-edition-review">Bully</a>.</p><p>I also - showing my age - remember being wowed by 'Christmas DLC' for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonicadventure-dc">Sonic Adventure</a> on the Dreamcast, which just consisted of overlaying some Christmas Music and haphazardly slapping Christmas trees in the stages. That update coming over the internet did feel bloody magical in the year 2000, to be fair. And I also think of Elf Bowling, a weird freeware PC game where Santa Claus bowls, with elves as the pins. The elves would taunt and moon you if you missed. Sometimes the pinsetter would decapitate them. Which, to be fair, doesn't feel too Christmassy.</p>
<p>But, yes. The best of them, to me, is Freezeezy Peak. Which is funny, really - Banjo-Kazooie came out in the summer, and so when I was growing up I almost certainly never played this game or level <em>at</em> Christmas - but lordy, this level impressed itself upon my mind. I'm sure you have similar experiences - I'd love to read them in the comments below.</p>

            <h2>25th December</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing. This week it's not about what we've been playing, but what we hope to be playing on Christmas Day (you're reading this now, but we wrote this back in June or something as we plan ahead).</p>
<h2>Sektori - Whatever I can get my hands on</h2>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>I've bought my son <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> and Civ 7 for his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, so I'm hoping I can get some time with the TV to give Geometry Wars-alike Sektori a proper go. Chances of this happening? Well, not high. Maybe I'll get some time to try it on the Steam Deck, but given I'll likely also be cooking lunch and suffering from sleep deprivation, maybe I'll settle for a few rounds of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> with the family and hope I don't disgrace myself. Happy Christmas, everyone!</p>

<h2>Tiny Bookshop - Switch 2</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Neoludic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Aside from playing the annual game of making sure no tiny bits of kids' toys get scooped up with wrapping paper, tossed in the bin and lost forever (RIP the toy spoon), I'm really hoping to be playing Tiny Bookshop at some point over the Christmas period. A management game about owning a small bookstore by the sea? It sounds glorious to me, books and the beach? Ideal. I'm always drawn to management games, but ones with a cosy vibe will always pull most of my attention.</p>
<p>After hearing nothing but good things about it from the rest of the guides team, I am ready to get stuck in (hopefully!).</p>

<h2>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - PC</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sandfall / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While I'll no doubt end up buying far too many games in the Steam Winter Sale and playing those to death instead over the holidays, my plan is to get through as much of this year's gaming backlog as possible, starting with The Game Awards 2025 winner, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p><p>I did play Act 1 of Expedition 33 back when the game came out, but I dropped it after getting stuck on Act 1's final boss... and now I fear going back to it. The holidays are my opportunity to restart my save and finally go see what Act 2 and 3 are about, provided I don’t let any other games get in the way first.</p>

<h2>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Switch 2</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Gaming is essential at Christmas. No, not for playing with family - for <em>escaping </em>them. Just me?!That's why I always like to have a handheld game available, so I can sneak away after too much food and drink, put some headphones on and ignore everybody. And what could be better for some escapism than thwacking and smacking a load of moblins as the Zelda series' titular princess? It's proving incredibly cathartic.</p>
<p><em>-Ed </em></p>
<h2>Soulframe and Warframe too probably, PC</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Digital Extremes</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Christmas holidays are the perfect time to jump into a game you missed, or one you've foolishly left by the wayside. For me, that's Soulframe. It's this true fantastical gem I've only managed to sink a few hours into since gaining access to the Preludes servers.</p><p>From the tiny amount of time I've spent exploring it, the game appears to be a weird one. Not in a bad way necessarily, but it's something I've yet to figure out properly. Or rather, it's not had a chance to sink its hooks into me just yet. Here's hoping a few days free will remedy that.</p>
<p>Other than that, I also need to drop some time into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a>'s latest update: The Old Peace. There's a lot of depth to it I've yet to explore fully. Between these I'll see my family and friends I suppose.</p>

<h2>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, PS5</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Christmas games for me are one of two things. The first is a really brilliant, cerebral game I really should have played to something like completion by now (<em>coughBluePrincecough</em>), which I finally have the headspace and the free time and the roaring fire available to properly settle into. The second is a big, simple-minded open world triple-A map-marker-athon with an unchallenging Platinum trophy. And the second always wins.</p><p>Enter Star Wars Jedi: Survivor! I love this game, despite reviewing it and saying it was just quite good. I stand by that - it is quite good! But it's quite good in the perfect way. I finished the story way back with the review, but like the first I have this quiet urge to go back and mop up the map, gobbling up lightsaber parts and differently-coloured ponchos and clicking my fingers to make BD-1 throw me a little healing snack. Plus, Star Wars always felt a little bit Christmassy to me, anyway, and the Star Wars Jedi games have that earnestness and silliness and authentic warm-heartedness that has always been the thing that made Star Wars great. I look forward to revisiting this quite good game more than many masterpieces.</p>

<h2>Lego City Undercover - Switch 2</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Lego / TT Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I love Lego. My husband loves Lego. Lego loves Christmas? So, to the surprise of no one, our children also love Lego, and I have been playing through Lego City Undercover with my son again these last few evenings. I jokingly call it "Baby's first GTA", because really that is what it is. No car is safe, even if I am on the right side of the law. I see a car I like, Imma going to drive it. And then crash it into a wall a few too many times while driving here, there and everywhere, for it to burst into bricky ruins. Oh well, on to the next one.</p>

<h2>Super Metroid - SNES (via Switch 2)</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Painting a picture here, this is how my Christmas Day will go. I'll be woken up early (though not as early as some, mercifully - maybe seven?) and will immediately go through the chaos of present swapping and unwrapping with my immediate family. Then we'll abscond to another person's house, which means I don't need to cook. That's a godsend. It'll still be bedlam, though, with four dogs from three different households winding each other up and about six adults vying for the attention of an over-excited kid while said child's parents (of which I am one) try to avoid them and leave them to relatives in order to extract a tiny slice of peace. Plus it's a day of being social, and getting gradually more and more tired and drunk. After dinner I will happily fall asleep for a bit, in part out of fatigue and partially to escape the noise, until my wife gently wakes me and tells me that it's hometime. It will be a nice day. It'll also feel like I've run a marathon, just with consuming a kilogram of gravy halfway through.</p><p>My point being - I'll be <em>bloody lucky</em> to get anywhere near a video game before Christmas evening, except for helping my daughter out with her new Switch 2. But given there's no Doctor Who to religiously sit down for this year, that claws me back an hour or so in the evening. So I'll probably settle in and play a comfort food game as the night settles in - a bit of Balatro, perhaps, or some more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pba-pro-bowling-2026-is-an-earnest-accurate-sports-sim-that-feels-like-it-fell-out-of-2010-i-love-it">PBA Pro Bowling</a>. Or, oh - I know! Flying back from The Game Awards I finished Metroid: Zero Mission on Nintendo Switch Online. I'll probably hop to Super Metroid next. A replay of that should help to wash away some of my complex feelings about Prime 4, too... See you next year.</p>

<h2>Avalon, board game</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>This newer edition of Avalon is so much nicer than the old one, and it has more rule permutations.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Every time I go to my brother's house, which I am on Christmas Day, we end up playing Avalon. We're borderline obsessed as a group. To the uninitiated, Avalon is like Traitors, or Werewolf, more accurately. It's a game about hidden baddies who are trying to upset the game for the goodies. In this case, there's no murder, but the baddies can fail the quests you need to succeed on in order to win. And if they do, they win. There are all sorts of Arthurian permutations to this, to the rules, such special characters like Arthur and Mordred and Percival and so on, but what I've outlined is the essence of the game. Which is to say: it's a game about accusing other people of lying.</p><p>This is endless, and rather precarious, fun. It never fails to amaze me how much of a base instinct it is to defend ourselves from attack. It's an impulse rather than a conscious thought. Moreover, it never fails to amaze me how adept we are at fitting observed patterns to suit our needs. Did someone's eye twitch? Guilty. Did someone laugh the wrong way? Guilty. Someone not saying much? Guilty. It's astonishing what one can convince oneself of. I say "precarious", though, because the person it's easiest to notice a behaviour change in is a partner, who is usually someone you spend a lot of time with. But to bring this to everyone's attention is, well, the precarious part. I suppose it depends on how much you're prepared to risk to win...</p>

            <p>The year is over! Or near enough. Sound the refrain that has become all too familiar over the last few years: What a: year for videogames/nightmare/success/disaster. This might be the only time on Eurogamer I can get away with using the old cliche 'mixed bag', hey. As everyone else is putting their minds together to come up with awards in a range of arbitrary categories, we thought it was only right that we did the same in celebration of this strange old year and some of the great, funny, wild, stupid, and bad things that have happened in it - with our tongue firmly planted in our cheek.</p>
<p>As noted, 2025 has been a year that has been pretty great in terms of the act of playing video games - we've had new hardware, indie darlings, even some bangers from big-name publishers. But it's also been a mess of AI gen nonsense, terrible losses of jobs and with them talent from the industry, and an unending cavalcade of disasters outside of games - which, to be fair, does lend positives to locking oneself inside and playing video games. </p>
<p>Anyway, in honor of all that - here's some acknowledgements of things that stood tall in 2025 to us, in this tradition imported from our sister site <a href="https://www.vg247.com/">VG247</a>. Once you're done experiencing 2025's delights, maybe take a trip down memory lane with their <a href="https://www.vg247.com/vg247s-alternate-game-awards-2024">2024 awards</a>?</p>
<h2>Best Logistical Execution: Nintendo Switch 2 Review Units</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Asleep at the Switch? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here's a look behind the curtain. In the run up to release, Nintendo confirmed that there would be no pre-release review access to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> console. We got to go hands-on with the machine and its key launch titles at the grand reveal events - but the media wouldn't be getting the machine itself early. This was due to "important features and updates" that would only be available in a day-one patch, Nintendo said.</p><p>This isn't ideal, obviously. Our job is to talk to you about the newest games, and we can't talk about them properly until we've played them. Some readers are eagerly awaiting coverage. Others are letting off party poppers on X, hollering that Nintendo is finally cutting the Evil Games Media out. And in the end none of it really matters all that much anyway, 'cos god, it's only video games and you're probably buying Mario Kart anyway, even if it's not a 5/5.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for Nintendo's decision to not send out hardware, the company has to be credited at least in the UK for what happened next. We were always going to get Switch 2 units from Nintendo to help cover their games, especially since machines used to review pre-release games need to be set up in a particular way that not everyone might want to do to their personal machines. But Nintendo meant it: we could have the machines when they launched. <em>As soon as they launched</em>.</p>
<p>A natural assumption would be that someone would just rock up and chuck a box on your porch at some point on June 5th, launch day. But Nintendo UK went a step further: arranging a one-to-one courier direct from their offices to the media's front door. Two members of Team Eurogamer and colleagues across the British media found couriers walking up their driveways at 12:59pm on June 4th - <em><strong>one minute</strong></em> before the Switch 2 officially went on sale in New Zealand, at midnight on the 5th. These couriers were so on the money that they must have been sitting around the corner waiting for the clock to strike one - so that Nintendo's word about no machines until it was officially available <em>somewhere</em> in the world rang true. That must have been a logistical nightmare to arrange - but it was definitely making the most of a suboptimal situation and for us, scrambling to cover the year's biggest launch, it was much appreciated.</p>
<h2>Hospital Pass of the Year: Xbox Game Pass Lady</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>We hope she's OK. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hospital-pass">Cambridge Dictionary</a>, a 'Hospital Pass' is a British term for being put in a difficult position. It can refer to roles in sports likely to take a heavy tackle, but in Britain it's most often heard politically: a stony-faced minister forced to trot out on telly to defend something awful has been 'given a hospital pass', in British political parlance.</p><p>In that finest tradition, we must extend our congratulations to the unidentified articulate woman put front-and-centre of Xbox's official video titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_6I0MkhJfQ">What's new and what's changing with Xbox Game Pass</a>", the video put out on October 1st to essentially announce a bunch of price rises and changes that fans weren't going to take well.</p>
<p>Xbox's usually very chatty and eager-to-appear executives were all rendered mysteriously unavailable to appear in this particular video. They may have just been busy. Or it might've been because this was destined to be the sort of video where the top comment reads, "Nobody can kill Xbox better than Microsoft themselves". Another top comment reads "A slap in the face to loyal fans". Surely, the biggest and most impressive hospital pass of the year has to be the one delivered to the soul who became the smiling assassin delivering that thump to the face.</p>
<h2>Best Dogged Diligence: Firaxis for Civilization 7</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>You can't spell Cccccccivilization without seven 'c's. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One game that isn't really in the talks for Game of the Year as much as one might have expected pre-release is Civilization 7. The thing about Civ is that I'd call it one of the world's first 'living' games - ever since 1996's Civ 2, each base game has been just that - a basis that has been built on over subsequent expansions. I don't think any recent Civ has launched with a quality to match the series' formidable reputation - that has come over time.</p><p>But even with that said, Civ 7 has doubtlessly been the rockiest. It took some big swings - some necessary, some less so. Some were successful… some, yes, less-so. But Firaxis has to be credited for what has followed: an absolutely blistering pace of patches, fixes, changes, feedback, iteration, and so on - moving more quickly than they ever have to make changes and improve the game.</p>
<p>Civilization 7 still has a long way to go. But Firaxis' work on the game over the half year and change since its release is certainly one of this year's greatest displays of diligence in the face of furious fans and torrid Steam reviews - and should be applauded. I hope, over the coming year, they can go all the way and chisel this into another all-timer. At which point all those who held fire can grab it for a tenner.</p>
<h2>Studio of the Year: Obsidian</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Aim for the moon. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> Early Access, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> - seldom does a large-scale studio, especially one at a publisher the size of Microsoft and in the modern context, have a year like this. But Obsidian Entertainment appears to have cracked the code to some degree - smaller and perhaps less forcefully bombastic games, but more often - iterative, thoughtful, and clever in their use of resources.</p><p>It's true that none of these games was ever going to be in the running for outright game of the year - but the thing that Obsidian has perhaps most cleverly zeroed in on is that perhaps not every game <em>needs</em> to be fodder for fawning wows at how it's pushing the medium forward or what have you. Sometimes all we need are cosy, welcoming, engaging video games with some damn good role-playing. It's an incredible run - and long may it continue.</p>
<h2>Worst Trend: All this AI Bollocks and all of its implications</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Can't spell 'precarious' without AI. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Look. This Generative AI thing isn't going anywhere. Of that I think we can all be absolutely certain; to some degree this technology is going to stick and remain a part of our lives. But in the sprint to be 'first' to this technology… Honestly, <em>what are we bloody doing</em>? The planet is boiling, you can't build a high-end PC without handing over a million pounds as hardware prices explode (and how will this impact a theoretical next-gen? We dread to think), and it sure looks like a not-insignificant chunk of the world economy is not happily floating along in an increasingly precarious-looking bubble.</p>
<p>All this is said without even mentioning the moral implications around art, jobs, and the human touch in product design. Or, indeed, the absolutely honking discourse that emerges when those things are raised. Even if you think there will be uses for this technology that can have a positive impact on development timelines, working conditions, or whatever else - the cost right now hardly seems worth even the greatest, most outlandish promises on the table.</p>
<h2>Number Crunch of the Year: Xbox</h2>

<h2>The Deathloop Award for Best Game Only Journos Liked: Baby Steps</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>At least we'll all remember this game. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Baby Steps is a misunderstood masterpiece of game design and meta-narrative that you all assumed was “rage slop”.</p>
<p>Look, Nate is going to fall over, often, with horrific consequences for your progress, your nerves, your basic sense of self worth. But Nate is not falling over because the game is treacherous, Nate is falling over because his feet are going exactly where you tell them to. Every time you mess it up, every time you fall back down the mountain, it’s not because the system has failed, it’s because the system is working exactly as designed. There’s definitely a metaphor in there somewhere.</p><p>Baby Steps is a genius game about games that plays you like a fiddle because it knows how to exploit all the assumptions you make in order to set traps for you. The pavlovian conditioning that decades of open world games have reinforced, where you expect to be rewarded for showing up to places. You expect a dopamine hit for checking out a pile of rocks that is just a pile of rocks. And it hurts, the hole where that dopamine isn’t. It hurts!</p>
<p>In a much more compelling, endearing, and hilariously funny way than any Soulslike has managed, Baby Steps forces you to embrace inadequacy. I’m not being facetious when I say I think it is the Game of the Year in 2025. And it’s not a forgettable, mid-as-hell experience like so many of the biggest games of a given year are: it's a true piece of art. It makes you question so many things about the medium that you take for granted, or just have come to accept. And it makes you feel. Physically feel, in your chest, in your gut. And not all of those feelings are good. In fact, it dares to make you feel bad. There are so many intoxicating layers to it. It’s a true millennial odyssey, an examination of open world game design, a piss-take of Death Stranding, a piss take of YOU. It has crushed my spirit and I can only admire it for that. Do I recommend it? God no. But you should play it anyway, if only to experience a rare, pure, undiluted hit of intent.</p>
<h2>The Nathan Drake Award for Cognitive Dissonance: Summer Game Fest in Los Angeles</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Uncharted ground. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Summer Games Fest was pretty good this year. I don't just mean the livestream - though that was decent - but I also mean 'Play Days', the in-person campus where members of the industry and press gather for a catch-up and to see the latest upcoming <em>stuff</em>. It was definitely a step down from 2024 - this year's Play Days Campus could be comfortably fully-explored in a day, proof positive of a slightly 'down' year - but it was nevertheless fun. While the madness of 'classic' E3 will in a sense never be supplanted in our hearts, there's a lot to be said for the comparative tranquillity of the Play Days Campus, which lets you do more work while doing a lot less damage to your body and mind.</p><p>Anyway, remember in the 2010s when we'd constantly talk about the 'cognitive dissonance' of playing a nice guy like Nathan Drake who is a soft sweetheart in cutscenes but mows down hundreds of men with wives and children in gameplay? That's the most common type of tonal discordance in games, but at SGF we got another in the form of Los Angeles burning just a few blocks from the Play Days Campus as protests against ICE escalated across the city. At one point, you could see plumes of smoke rising in the near distance from inside the SGF Play Days Campus. At another point, two Eurogamer writers sat in a pub as the protests surged past outside, a panicked PR worried about the group of media they were chaperoning getting stuck between protestors and police.</p>
<p>It all makes all that video game stuff feel rather frivolous, doesn't it? A sense of guilt about that fact - us lot fiddling about with preview builds while the city was on fire with rage - pervaded, too. And while maybe it was just a quieter year for games being ready to be shown, perhaps this mood is another part of why the campus felt quieter - and why subsequent events, like The Game Awards, felt to have lower international attendance. What a year, eh?</p>
<h2>Wingman of the Year: Death Stranding's Norman Reedus for Age Verification</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>We're just Norman men, innocent men. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As Britain continues on the bizarre trajectory where a nominally left-wing government drives forward a load of weirdly right-leaning and vaguely dystopian policies, people could be rest assured that at least one man would have their back: Death Stranding's Sam Porter Bridges, aka Norman Reedus.</p><p>When "robust" age check systems were rolled out across the internet as part of the new Online Safety Act, the logic was that you'd have to submit a photograph of yourself staring double-chinned down into the laptop camera if you wanted to do something as outlandish as read your social media DMs. Or use Discord. Or Reddit. The list goes on, stretching far beyond the raunchy sites it's primarily designed to block.</p>
<p>But in an amazing quirk of said robust systems, whatever neural network was scanning and cataloguing your face seemingly couldn't see past Death Stranding's (admittedly very good) character models: so you could boot up photo mode and show some age verification screens Norman Reedus' gurning photo mode expressions in order to bypass the age filter. So: annoying, inconvenient, <em>and</em> ineffective! I suppose that's British governance in a nutshell, really. At least Reedus and Kojima have our backs, ey?</p>
<h2>Healthiest Genre: MMORPGs</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>23 years young!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There has been no sadder year to be a MMORPG fan than 2025. In 12 months we've seen multiple cancellations, layoffs, and the outright closure of a handful of studios. If any big winners exist, they've been ancient games that have somehow weathered the storm. World of Warcraft still exists, at least until Microsoft puts an AI-generated gun in its mouth and pulls the handle.</p><p>Microsoft's layoffs led to Project Blackbird getting cancelled, Amazon's sudden departure from first-party publishing has left New World's marooned, and the once-cancelled Lord of the Rings MMO somehow cancelled again. Netease has itself been an MMO serial killer, smothering Jackalyptic's Warhammer MMO, clobbering Fantastic Pixel Castle to death, and near-fatally wounding T-Minus Zero.</p>
<p>As a result MMO fans have flocked to old faithfuls, games so long in the tooth that they've become part of the furniture. Old School RuneScape has seen a recent spike in players, as has Eve Online, Warframe, Guild Wars 2… Final Fantasy 11 teasing a new zone cementing an era of nostalgia is firmly here. Making an MMO today instead of some live service gacha slopathon is a hard sell, especially when said slop is starting to sour. The typical age of the MMO fan also trends older. Chances are if you remember how to get Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Windseeker you are an old wanker, sorry.</p>
<p>Will the suffering end with New Years fireworks? No. Highlights to look forward to in 2026 include Blizzard rolling out The Burning Crusade yet again to the emphatic elation of the truly depressed, and Maple Story Classic for the same crowd, only quirkier. Fantastic.</p>
<h2>Best Weaponized Nostalgia: Donkey Kong Bananza</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Monkey business.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There has seldom been a game that clearly understood the assignment as perfectly as Donkey Kong Bananza, at least as far as pleasing long-time fans goes. But in a classic Nintendo fashion, Bananza holds back on a lot of its nostalgia. It's almost like Nintendo wants to prove a point: we don't <em>need</em> to do this. We can make a great game without any of this nonsense. And so they do.</p><p>Here's DK in a new setting, with a new cast of characters. Even a passing appearance of Diddy, Dixie, and Rambi is held back until roughly the mid game, almost as if to prove a point. But as Bananza wears on, the point is proven. So the dam is allowed to burst. And if you're a thirty-something with certain childhood memories, you'll probably have tears in your eyes. Bravo.</p>
<h2>Best sign Next Year will be just as messy: Nvidia's planned GPU supply slash</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>What can possibly go wrong?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The good, the bad, the ugly - sometimes you finish a year and it feels like we're ready to hit reset and load a new save, or whatever other clunky gaming analogy we're going with next. Sometimes you finish and it feels like nothing is really going to change. Like the nega-zone that was New Year during the pandemic, finishing this year it feels like… we're all treading water, still. Right?</p>
<p>We're all still waiting for GTA6. All of the real world problems feel to have not moved on at all. And that AI thirst is only intensifying, which does indeed have a knock-on effect.</p>
<p>Right at the death of 2025's news cycle, the news broke that Nvidia is allegedly <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344177/nvidia-plans-to-reduce-rtx-50-production-by-up-to-40-in-early-2026">dramatically reducing the supply</a> of its current-generation GeForce graphics cards for the first half of 2026 by as much as 40% compared to 2025. This isn't a natural demand contraction - it's a direct response to the price hikes in key components as part of the current AI-driven crisis. But this is key for games. If this is a wider trend, this could have a knock-on effect on everything - the timing of next-gen of both consoles and PC GPUs, the availability of existing hardware… and pricing, of course. Strap yourselves in, folks! 2026 is almost here!</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2025-umamusume-pretty-derby</link>
            <guid>https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2025-umamusume-pretty-derby</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2025-umamusume-pretty-derby<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>Of all the games released this year, all the triple-A blockbusters and genre-defining smash hits, nothing shook me as much as Umamusume: Pretty Derby. I won't deny that it was once a game I was embarrassed to be playing. But now? I'm all in, dude. I'm an English 27-year-old who is invested in Japanese horse racing. And if you too can push past your misgivings, you'll find one of the better strategy games released this year.</p>

<p>First, an explainer. Umamusame is at its core a horse racing management game. You start off with a horse full of malleable potential like burning steel. The fact that this horse is a singing, dancing, anime girl is besides the point, pal. You've got precious few days to train them up and get them ready for the races. You raise up several skills, build upon relationships with supporting characters through rigorous training, and earn fans through good performances on the track.</p>
<p>Hidden beneath the cutesy aesthetic is a war waged in the mind. You think you can win the URA Finale with faith alone? Faith paves the road to the glue factory. A few hours with Umamusame: Pretty Derby had me looking up YouTube guides, noting down when key events started on the calendar, and micromanaging everything. <em>Everything</em>.</p>
<p>Let me offer a glimpse at what I'm talking about. You don't just bring a horse to a career run, you bring support cards. The types of cards you want to take depend on the horse you're using. Let's say you're blessed to get my personal favourite horse Mihono "Cyborg" Bourbon - you'll want Speed support cards, some stamina, and wit too. The cards you pick are critical for early bonuses to key stats. He was voted 1992 horse of the year, by the way. Named after the French Dynasty, destined as he was for greatness - and an anime adaptation, no less.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a trailer for Umamusume: Pretty Derby.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>When you actually start your career, you need to pick and choose which stats are the most optimal to train every turn. Speed is king and the more of it you have the better, but Bourbon excels at medium-distance races. This means you'll want at least 800 Stamina to avoid losing steam later in your career. Front Runners want to invest time in Wit, too, so they can prevent mistakes during races and preserve Stamina further. Training everything but Wit takes up energy, so you have to account for rest time.</p><p>It gets pretty darn complicated, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Did you know the horses go on a trip to the beach in July and August? While at the beach, skill training is automatically boosted to max level, so you want to ideally train every day you can while there. That means you'll want to plan ahead so you enter beach training with maximum energy. I have on more than one occasion quit a run through a horse's career early because I forgot about when beach training starts.</p>
<p>If this all sounds like nerdy nonsense, it kind of is, but it's the meat you dig your teeth into. Mastering this juggling act is exhilarating in its own right, learning by heart when certain events happen, where to position your horses, what skills are best to learn. Tactically picking certain skills for a horse so that once their career is finished, they can pass on that skill to a future horse to enhance their own abilities. A deep chasm is what Umamusame is, begging to be explored.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The world went absolutely bananas over this character, representing a real-world horse people sent grass too en masse. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Cygames, Inc.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Though that's only one side of the coin, one metal door on the starting gate. The racing itself is sublime, I can think of few other words to describe it. It's made in a tower at Cygames HQ, filled by evil wizards. Seemingly they shoot lightning at each other and from charred remains discover the secret to making anime girls running the most tense, <em>hypest</em> thing in the world.</p>
<p>Did you know that Umamusame: Pretty Derby has cinematic close ups during its races? The regular angle is pulled-back, so you can see the position of all the horses. But at key moments it will zoom in at horse-level to show just how close a horse is to overtaking, or how tight a lead actually is. When the race is about to end, the UI fades out and the camera is fixed to the finishing line. This means you see the horses coming in from a perspective that makes them look closer together than they actually are. Then the orchestra's tempo doubles. Then you realise, heart palpitation-inducing as it may be, it's a devious trick that just brings the whole thing home.</p><p>There are caveats of course: Umamusame: Pretty Derby is a gacha game and as such is designed to suck money out of your wallet. It doesn't really matter how good a game is, to those susceptible to such monetisation practices. The best support cards and horses are contained in limited-time banners that do tempt you into spending real money on gambling. There's no way around that.</p>
<p>Still, if it's something you can ignore or at least establish a healthy relationship with, I've got to say Umamusame: Pretty Derby is a real eye-opener. It took home a trophy at The Game Awards this year for a reason. If you had told me a year or so ago that I'd know a number of specialist facts about long-dead race horses I'd not have believed you.

            <p>Back in May, FromSoftware stepped outside of its comfort zone and did something it hasn't done before: it released a multiplayer game. Sure, the Dark Souls series and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> both feature the ability to summon friends and invade foes, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> is FromSoftware fully committing to co-op play, and in the process delivering the most playful game in its history.</p>
<p>Nightreign is wholly different from what we're used to from the esteemed soulsbornering developer, aside from the familiar bosses and pointy weaponry. It's fast-paced, it's more challenging than ever, and it ultimately feels like a playground of possibilities for what FromSoftware can do and where it can go, as well as a celebration of its previous work. For me, it's a platform for experimenting with new build styles, weapons, and spells, and all the different possibilities for achieving success. I can't get enough.</p>

<p>For the first time in a FromSoftware soulslike, Nightreign begs that its players work together (unless you're some sort of beast who can solo these bosses, in which case, hats off to you). As a result, the game isn't for everyone. While I have enjoyed the co-op mods for From's previous games, and therefore was immediately onboard with Nightreign, a level of apprehension from players who wanted another brutal single-player experience was understandable. I get it. Embrace it, though, and Nightreign provides a highly-replayable, roguelite experience that keeps you on your toes. One that you can enjoy with friends and strangers alike, and one that is deeply satisfying - especially when an Expedition goes exactly to plan and you take down the formidable Nightlord at the end of it. Some of the best moments I've ever had in gaming have been in Nightreign</p><p>Take one of my most recent runs for example, which I don't think I'll ever be able to top. Queuing up with two strangers in a desperate bid to take down the DLC's final boss, we all wound up playing the same character, Undertaker. Not the best team composition I'll admit, but that didn't stop us. The Nightlord at the end of this run didn't know what had hit it, but after a run full of successful boss takedowns and celebratory emotes, that's when disaster struck; with just a slither of the boss' HP to go, one of my allies was downed.</p>
<p>This isn't an unfamiliar scenario, and usually, the remaining players will finish off the boss and everyone gets to walk away happy. This time, however, myself and my remaining ally both knew that - after such a fine display of teamwork - we couldn't end this fight without our fellow Undertaker. As if communicating telepathically, we immediately diverted our attention to our ally, allowing us to conclude the fight and celebrate together. It's rare that queuing with strangers is as fun - and triumphant - as this run was, but when everything goes to plan and Nightreign's RNG is on your side, it creates one of the most epic feelings of satisfaction.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bandai Namco</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm in admiration of the amount of experimentation that goes into and is encouraged in Nightreign, and what this means for FromSoftware's future. The developer has pushed combat to its limits, providing players with an arsenal of Skills and Abilities (akin to a hero shooter), kitting them out with the ability to climb (basic, but so important), while also forcing them to learn the importance of consumable items and their passive effects. Something I'd very much neglected in FromSoftware's other games but will never ignore again.</p><p>Nightreign is a live service-lite game - one that has everyone neatly tucked into a single package - but ultimately requires updates and DLC to increase its longevity and revenue, and I see this as not only an avenue for continued experimentation with the series, but a stage in which FromSoftware can test out various aspects of combat and see how this could apply to its other projects. And if FromSoftware's next mainline release can build upon the new elements that have been threaded into Nightreign's combat, I'm sure we're in for another banger.</p>
<p>Will we finally be able to climb in future installments? Will sprinting, at long last, be a toggle? Will more multiplayer features be weaved throughout upcoming games, ending the need for seamless co-op mod? Ok, that's getting a little too hopeful, but you can no doubt see what I'm getting at.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Nightreign is also a means for the experimentation of players as much as it is for its developers, if not more so. It's allowed me to play around with different builds and weapons at an exhilarating pace (and without needing to farm Larval Tears). Each class has a different kit and different stats they scale with, and if you wish to try all of them you're forced to step outside of your Strength build sanctuary and into the shoes of a spell-slinging witch, a spirit-summoning doll, or a katana-wielding beast.</p><p>I've used weapons I'd never dream of touching in Elden Ring and have discovered new favourites (Envoy's Horn, my beloved), while also discovering a new-found love for dual-wielding daggers at every opportunity possible (instead of my usual Greatswords, Katanas or Sacred Seals). I've more recently grown obsessed with hammer builds - despite previously detesting their slow speed - with my love of new Nightfarer, Undertaker, seeping into my Elden Ring runs. Turns out the Rotten Battle Hammer can make light work of bosses. Who'd have thought it? Not me and my usual Dexterity/Faith builds, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Right now, FromSoftware fans can anticipate Duskbloods on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2026, an eight-player PvPvE game. But for now, I can't see an end to wanting to see where Nightreign and its many possibilities may take me.</p>

            <p>Danganronpa, a game series I can never reliably spell, has just passed 10m sales, maker <a href="https://www.spike-chunsoft.com/news/danganronpa-series-surpasses-10-million-units-shipped-worldwide/">Spike Chunshoft has announced</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/danganronpa-and-the-surprising-joys-of-clumsy-queer-representation">Best described by a 2023 Danganronpa Pride Week article</a> as "a Battle-Royale-meets-Ace-Attorney visual novel series that is, quite frankly, insane," Danganronpa began in 2010 on PlayStation Portable. Since then it's had three mainline series entries, two spin-offs, and is preparing for a new game, Danganronpa 2x2, next year. This will feature a new scenario and a revamped one from Danganronpa 2.</p>
<p>In the Danganronpa games, you play as high school students who are forced to kill each other by way of a bear plushie that likes to monologue. Gameplay combines debating with sharpshooting. It's a bizarre mix.</p>
<p>"Entertainment media has us geared to believe that we're always safe in the company of those we're familiar with, despite clear evidence of the contrary," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-danganronpa-so-viciously-appealing">a separate article about Danganronpa, which explored the series' vicious appeal</a>.</p>
<p>"Danganronpa ups the ante by presenting another variable to that thought. What do you do when you can't trust the people in charge, or those who stand as sterling examples of our community? What then? Where does that leave the middle-classed and the ordinary?</p><p>"Building on careful layers of paranoia, Danganronpa is a game about archetypes being stripped down and dissected, a game about the degradation of a supposed utopia, and a game with surprisingly good writing. And a game that's certainly worth picking up."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-stokes-fallout-5-fires-as-second-tv-season-begins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has stoked the Fallout 5 fires by saying the franchise is "the one we're still doing the most work in above anything".</p>
<p>His comments partially relate to online multiplayer game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, which has been an ongoing project at the studio since its <a href="http://a/">very wobbly release in 2018</a>. Its existence means that while Bethesda hasn't released a mainline single-player Fallout game since 4 in 2015, Bethesda has had a Fallout team working continually since then. But the team hasn't solely been working on 76.</p>
<p>"I will say, first, looking at 76, we've never stopped developing Fallout. We've had a full team on Fallout for a long time. So, Fallout, as a franchise, is the one we're still doing the most work in above anything," <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/23/bethesda-talks-fallouts-future-and-lessons-learned">Howard told Game Informer</a>.</p>
<p>"Now, the majority of our internal studio is on Elder Scrolls 6. We are doing other things with Fallout that we haven't announced, and you know, there'll come a time for that. I get the sort of anxiety from fans, like, 'Well, what else? What else? Feed me!' But, look, we're working on stuff, and we do like to wait. And so, I think there'll be a moment to talk about that, and we want to make those special moments for our fans."</p>

I suspect Howard and team will leave it later in Fallout 5's development to properly announce the game; we could have another <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>-like scenario where there are only several months between announcement and release.</p><p>It's also important to note how much has changed at Bethesda Game Studios since it released Fallout 4. Fallout 76 - a multiplayer game - was a significant departure for the studio, and Starfield represented the studio's most ambitious project yet as a completely new IP. Moreover, both games were not instant hits and required significant additional work after they came out. Such things change a studio, as studio director Angela Browder pointed out.</p>
<p>"I think every one of [our past games] is a learning experience, right? Let's take Fallout 76 – yes, we learned how to make multiplayer; we also learned what it means when you ship a product that doesn't necessarily hit really well right away," Browder said. "And we learned about investing and listening to our players and strengthening who we are and what we are, our own ability to resiliency and adversity, all these kinds of things, right?</p>
<blockquote><em>"We also learned what it means when you ship a product that doesn't necessarily hit really well right away"</em></blockquote>
<p>"When you talk about Starfield, we made the biggest thing we've ever done in our entire lives: we made space. I'm scared of space, I think space is really scary, but we made space! Everything that we learned by putting space into Starfield goes into Elder Scrolls 6. It's all learning.</p>
<p>"We are better developers for having made a multiplayer game, we are better developers for having developed our own IP now, because it's new muscles," Browder added. "It's tested us in a different way. It's taught us a lot of things that we never could have known otherwise. And I do think even as we go into titles that are IP we've made before that we classically understand, we're still better developers for having done it, because your brain thinks differently once you've done those kinds of things. And I think it's only going to make every title we do better."</p><p>Bethesda has collaborated on the Fallout TV series since then, too, of course, the first series of which aired last year, the second series of which began this month, and a third series of which has already been greenlit. And it's very good - very faithful to the almost absurd nature of the games, which juxtaposes a kind of relentless upbeatness next to a ridiculously brutal and unforgiving world. Todd Howard has already said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">Fallout 5 will take place in a timeline that acknowledges the TV series</a>, set either after the events of it or during it.</p>
<p>There's never been a better time for more Fallout, then. The question is simply when it will arrive. The sweepstakes are open - get your guesses in now.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been on everyone's lips this year. Coming from a new studio with only a relatively small number of developers, on its release the game won scores of praise across the industry. It is fair to say it is a beloved title, and at this year's The Game Awards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 made history becoming the most awarded game of all time</a>. It scooped up a record nine accolades, including the coveted Game of the Year.</p>
<p>One of the many reasons people fell in love with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is its characters. From Gustave and Maelle, and of course Esquie, each character brings a magnetism and warmth to the role, and even those with less noble goals are still an endearing addition to the cast. But, while each character is unique, many were brought to life by the same motion capture actors. One such actor is Maxence Cazorla, who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso. He also voiced Esquie.</p>
<p>Cazorla grew up in the south-west of France, and always knew that he wanted to be an artist. Then, when he was 15, he watched Blood Diamond with Leonardo DiCaprio, and  "something shifted" inside him. "I suddenly knew that this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life," Cazorla tells me. "From there, I bought my first camera and started making short films, putting myself in front of the camera alongside friends and family. That's really how everything began."</p>

<p>Cazorla first heard about Clair Obscur in summer 2023, thanks to his friend and fellow actor Estelle Darnault. Like Cazorla, Darnault also performed multiple roles in Clair Obscur, including Lune, Sciel and Sophie, as well as several other female characters. "She sent me an Instagram link to Sandfall's casting call. They were looking for English-speaking actors based in Paris for a video game RPG project called 'Project W'," Cazorla recalls. "What's funny is that Estelle and I both applied without mentioning that we knew each other, so Sandfall had absolutely no idea we were friends, and yet we both ended up being cast on the project. It was also the very first time we got to work together."</p>
<p>Cazorla was asked to send in an audition tape, where he tried for the roles of Gustave, Verso and Renoir. Soon after his tape was recieved, he was then invited to Sandfall's studio in Paris, where he was again asked to audition for the same three roles. It was here Cazorla first met Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's director and creator Guillaume Broche, along with Sandfall's entire cinematic team.</p><p>"Just before the audition, they showed us an early trailer of the game. I immediately fell in love with the universe. Being a gamer myself, I instantly knew this was the kind of game I would have played anyway, and suddenly the idea of actually embodying one of the characters felt completely surreal," Cazorla remembers. Three weeks later, he found out he had been cast as Gustave, little knowning how much his life was about to change.</p>

<p>Cazorla was initially only set to play Gustave in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and he wrapped up his side of the performance in "a few" months. "I really thought my journey in the game had come to an end. I remember feeling a bit sad, knowing that Estelle and Charlotte would continue working on the project," the actor recalls. However, soon after he had finished his work with Gustave, Cazorla received another call from Clair Obscur's director asking if he would be interested in returning to perform the role of Verso. Of course, Cazorla said yes, and that's "when the real physical work began".</p>
<p>"I had to clearly differentiate the characters, not just emotionally, but physically as well, their posture, their walk, the way they moved and occupied space. Even though the characters would later be voiced by other actors, it was essential that they were instantly distinct," Cazorla tells me. "From that point on, everything changed. All my interactions with the other characters shifted completely. The way they looked at me as Gustave disappeared, and we had to rebuild everything from scratch. In the end, I spent most of my time on the project embodying Verso."</p><p>Cazorla calls Verso "a very special" role for him, adding he was "by far the most difficult to crack" thanks to Verso's many complexities. "Most of his performance lives in subtext, in what he doesn't say," the actor explains. "Guillaume and I spent a lot of time sitting down together so he could give me all the context I needed to truly understand the character and bring the necessary nuance, to convey all of his layers through a single look."</p>
<p>Eventually, Cazorla finished Verso's performance capture as well, but little did he know, his work was still not done. Clearly enamoured with the actor's performances until now, Clair Obscur's director soon asked him if he would consider performing the capture for Renoir. "That came with both excitement and a lot of pressure, knowing that Andy Serkis would be voicing the character," Cazrola admits. "Still, I accepted without hesitation. It's not every day you get to do performance capture for a character voiced by one of the most influential figures in motion capture."</p>
<p>Looking back on his three performances, Cazorla says he "gave everything" he had to each character, and left "a small part" of himself in all of them.</p>
<p>"I owe a huge thank you to Guillaume Broche for the trust he placed in me throughout the entire adventure," he says. "His vision and passion pushed all of us to give everything we had, and I'm incredibly happy that players can feel that heart and passion today when they play the game."</p>

<p>2025 has obviously been an incredible year for everyone involved in bringing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 to life. Along with those already mentioned awards wins, the game has sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">over 5m copies worldwide across all formats</a> as of October, but that number is now obviously going to be higher still. The success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has even been publicly acknowledged by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>Reflecting on the last year, Cazorla admits he "never imagined" this amount of attention and admiration. In fact, he believes everyone involved was "caught off guard by the success" of Clair Oscur. "We never approached the project thinking about success or awards," he says. "Everyone simply gave the best of their craft in service of the story, and I believe players genuinely felt that."</p>
<p>I ask Cazorla if there is one particular moment from filming for Clair Obscur that stands out to him. He tells me about his very first day of shooting. "Putting on the motion capture suit for the first time and discovering this entirely new way of acting and storytelling was unforgettable," he says. "It was the scene where Gustave wakes up next to the waterfall at the beginning of Act One. That moment is forever engraved in me.</p>
<p>"Back then, I had no idea that this adventure would change my life so deeply."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>So, what's next for Cazorla now? After what has no doubt been a whirlwind year, which has included flying over to LA for The Game Awards earlier this month, will he be taking a break? "For the first time in my career, I find myself at a crossroads where I actually have a choice about what comes next," he smiles. "I do have upcoming projects that I can't talk about yet due to NDAs, but after 18 years of not being able to fully live from my craft, I'm deeply aware of how fortunate I am to finally be able to look toward the horizon.</p>
<p>"Whether the future leads me back to video games or into cinema, we'll see. At this point, nothing really surprises me anymore. As long as I get to act, I'll be happy."</p>
<p>Our time is coming to an end, but before he goes, Cazorla wants to thank everyone who has played Clair Obscur. "The love, the support, the messages, and the stories they share with us mean everything. More than ever, I realise that without them, none of this would be possible, and even speaking to you today is partly thanks to them," he says.</p>
<p>"By watching and sharing the behind-the-scenes videos I posted on social media, they've allowed me to reach a wider audience and continue living my dream," the Clair Obscur actor tells me, before closing warmly:</p>
<p>"For that, I'll always be grateful."</p>

            <p>The promising James Bond game 007 First Light has been delayed. Danish developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> announced the release date change this afternoon, signalling a two-month shift to 27th May 2026. First Light had been due to launch in March.</p>
<p>"007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/007game.ioi.dk/post/3mao7ytthlk2t">wrote IOI CEO Hakan Abrak in a statement</a>. "As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.</p>

            <p>A key former member of the Grand Theft Auto team has said Rockstar toyed with ideas for many non-American settings for the series, including the cities Tokyo, Rio, Moscow and Istanbul.</p>
<p>Of them, Tokyo apparently came the closest to being realised. "We had ideas about GTA games in Rio de Janeiro, Moscow and Istanbul. Tokyo almost actually happened," Obbe Vermeij, former technical director at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a>, who worked on GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, told <a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/article/obbe-vermeij-interview-2849146/">GamesHub</a>. "Another studio in Japan were going to do it, take our code and do GTA: Tokyo. But then that didn't happen in the end.</p>
<p>"People love having these wild ideas," Vermeij added, "but then when you've got billions of dollars riding on it it's too easy to go let's do what we know again, and also America is basically the epicenter of Western culture, so everybody knows the cities, even people who haven't been there. They have a mental image of the cities.</p>
<p>"I think it's unlikely it's going to be in Bogota next time, especially since there's just more and more money involved as the project gets bigger. It doesn't make sense to set it in some leftfield location for novelty. GTA: Toronto? It just wouldn't work."</p>

<p>I wonder if the Torontonians and Bogotanos know they live in leftfield cities...?</p>
<p>Jokes aside, GTA has rarely, if ever, been set outside of US-adjacent cities, with most of the games based in and around Los Santos (loosely Los Angeles), Liberty City (loosely New York), and Vice City (loosely Miami). There was once a London-themed expansion for Grand Theft Auto 1, set in the year 1969, but that's as close as it got.</p>
<blockquote><em>"I'm afraid we're stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let's just get used to it"</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-did-grand-theft-auto-never-return-to-london-as-a-setting-one-of-the-biggest-reasons-was-guns">Rockstar co-founder and former GTA lead writer Dan Houser recently explained</a> that the series kept coming back to cities like Miami and New York and Los Angeles because they're melting pots of activity, where extreme wealth rubs against extreme poverty, and where glitz, glamour and organised crime can all be found. Other major cities might have that, but do they also have one other key ingredient - guns?</p>
<p>"You needed guns," Houser said, "you needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly from an outsider's perspective, but that was so much about what the thing was that it wouldn't have really worked in the same way elsewhere."</p>

<p>When pushed on whether the series might ever be set in Europe, Obbe Vermeij answered, "It’s just not realistic. I would love it, and if games still took a year to make then yeah sure, you can have a little fun, but you're not going to get that when there's a GTA every 12 years.</p><p>"You're not going to set it in a new location. You don't really need to either because the technology changes so much. Nobody is going to say that they're not going to play GTA 6 because they've already played Vice City. That doesn't make sense. It's completely different.</p>
<p>"They'll revisit New York again. They'll go back to LA or maybe Las Vegas," Vermeij added. "I'm afraid we're stuck in this loop of about five American cities. Let's just get used to it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6 will take us back to fictional Miami</a>, or Vice City as it's called, but in the present day rather than the 80s, as in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-vice-city">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</a>. GTA 6 will tell a story based around dual protagonists Lucia Caminos and Jason Duval, marking the first time a GTA game has had a playable female lead. GTA 6 will be released in November next year.</p>

            <p>EA shareholders have approved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">the proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms, leaving only the US government in the way of what would be the largest corporate buyout of all time.</p>
<p>This acquisition, first announced back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>Critics of the fund and of this proposed deal argue that it's also used for washing the country's reputation, as Saudi Arabia has been heavily criticised over the years for human rights abuses.</p>

<p>This acquisition would be made if approved with the assistance of Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter founded and owned by Jarred Kushner - son-in-law to President Donald Trump. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">This same firm was also involved in the hostile takeover attempt of Warner Bros Discovery</a> earlier this month, though it reportedly pulled back amidst criticism of Kushner's involvement.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-reportedly-low-on-cash-and-limiting-investment-following-ea-acquisition">will be a little low on cash after this acquisition if it goes through</a>, perhaps marking the end of the spending spree its been doing over the past few years.</p>
<p>Prior to this approval by shareholders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">it's widely believed that the buyout won't be heavily contested</a>. However, the increasing amount of sway Saudi Arabia has in US industry has not gone entirely without pushback. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators">Video game unions have been vocal in their opposition</a>, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">have human rights groups</a>.</p>

            <p>I am pretty confident in my ability to judge video games. I've been playing them (increasingly badly over more recent years!) for almost 40 years and writing about them for over 20, so it's rare that something blindsides me. But that's exactly what happened with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blades-of-fire">Blades of Fire</a>, the action soulslike adventure from Mercury Steam. I loved the studio's Castlevania rethink, Lords of Shadow, but was so-so on its output since, including the Nintendo-published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a>. My expectations for Blades of Fire were low to moderate. Incredible, then, that I've not played another game released this year that I enjoyed more.</p>
<p>My early time with the game actually made such a negative impact on me that had I not been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blades-of-fire-review">reviewing</a> the game it's highly likely that I'd have given up and moved on to something else - I'm a big believer in cutting your losses, rather than ploughing more and more time into something you aren't enjoying. The combat felt unfair and unforgiving, the characters dull and generic, and the visuals rather uninspired with a distinctly last-gen vibe. Given the soulslike nature of the combat and experience, I tried and failed to progress meaningfully through the first proper area time and time again. I was frustrated and rather annoyed at myself for essentially offering up a chunk of my own time to play a game that I hated.</p>
<p>And then, to my great surprise, it clicked.</p>
<p>Blades of Fire is an adventure game at heart, full of obscure paths to take, bridges to cross, and towering steps to climb, all taking you somewhere - maybe not where you really needed to go, but a location worth exploring to find something cool, or simply to take in the view. That early impression of a bland game couldn't be less representative of the one that unfurls in front of you. This is the kind of fantastical world that begs to be poured over, remarked at, and enjoyed. All for nothing, of course, if the gameplay you're forced to endure while in it does little but frustrate.</p>

</div>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjLvrgsvdpI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>The key to overcoming this proved to be rather simple: meet the game at its level, rather than what I expected. So, yes, while Blades of Fire is a soulslike of sorts, a genre I have routinely failed to get a real sense of satisfaction from, it's also got some obvious rules that must be obeyed - and it's these that I think helped get me on the hook. I was so primed to approach the game like I had countless others, simply not expecting a radical departure from the norm, that I'd failed to see how Blades of Fire was offering something different, something the developers clearly thought worked better for their game than simply porting over the required muscle memory from other genre titles.</p><p>There's a reason people joke about Ubisoft open world games having a formula. While they clearly aren't carbon copies of each other, you broadly know what to expect and generally there's little to no friction. I'm not arguing that these games don't have valuable roles to play, appealing as they do to many many millions of players, but if you've been there and done that multiple times over, you, like me, might start to long for something different.</p>
<p>Initially Blades of Fire felt cumbersome and clunky, but this was my preconceptions rebounding off some very clearly outlined rules that I simply hadn't taken seriously - this was something different, I just hadn't realised. Enemies each offer up different vulnerabilities and weaknesses, whether it be due to their general makeup or armour, so it's essential you learn which weapons to use against each, but also how to break through stubborn foes, and which direction to attack from.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>I love the world design of this game. It's a joy to explore. | <span>Image credit: <cite>MercurySteam</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's no comfort in Blades of Fire, no rhythm to fall into as you coast along. Even 30 hours in a lapse in concentration can cause real problems, but the effort is worth it. Few games have ever given me such a sense of exaltation, of discovery, and that attribute that is hard to break down into a term other than to say "pure video game".</p><p>In truth the game's combat isn't a kind of "eureka!" moment - it isn't a wholly new discovery that will change video games forever, but the dev team believed in this alternative approach and shaped the whole game around it, including the novel weapon forging system (something I didn't love, but I still appreciate the attempt to take a different path to what had gone before). Blades of Fire surprised me, not only in that it ended up being one of my favourite games of this generation, but also in how it felt unlike most other games I've played.  That's a rare feeling in the world of high-budget video games - and make no mistake, while this isn't triple-A in the vein of the Marvel's Spider-Mans of this world, there's no doubt its budget would give smaller indie studios a coronary.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>No matter your thoughts on it, Death Stranding embodies everything video games should strive for.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's funny, the other game I think will stick with me more than any other from my 2025 playlist is Death Stranding, a game I finally built up the stamina to play in part thanks to the praise this year's sequel had lavished upon it. It too isn't bothered with conventions outside of the very basics of what makes a video game that is broadly accepted by the mainstream. Kojima's breakaway from Metal Gear Solid and Konami baffles me at every turn, throwing concepts out there like confetti at a wedding, baffling character names that border on parody, and deeply serious themes that, if they'd come from anyone else, might have slipped into the ridiculous. I'm not even a Kojima fan as such, but there's no doubt that the industry would be weaker if his blockbuster avante garde style didn't exist.</p>
<p>Death Stranding is a more refined game than Blades of Fire, and it also takes more risks because it can - its creator is as much of a celebrity the games industry has ever had, and has a personal fanbase Mercury Steam and other dev studios can only dream of - but both highlight how important it is to have a vision, not a focus tested design doc with all the rough edges smoothed out and the actual magic of video games brushed aside. I don't mind if every idea doesn't land - I'd much rather play a game that takes some risks, than one which doesn't try anything original at all.</p>

            <p>Two of the lead Dispatch creators believe Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul wouldn't have agreed to be in the game had he realised how much work it would actually be.</p>
<p>Aaron Paul plays the central role of Robert in the game, the player character, so he features throughout. His acting commitment, then, was not slight.</p>
<p>"It was gruelling," narrative director Pierre Shorette told me recently. "We were worried he would never work with us again because it took so long. It's like water torture, a drip here and there. We'll call him after eight weeks of not speaking, like, 'Hey, we need you for four hours.' It's like, 'Fuck, I thought I was done with this.' We just had to keep bringing him back across two years because he's in basically the entire fucking game."</p>
<p>"I think if he knew what this was going to be," game director Nick Herman added, "he wouldn't have done it."</p>
<p>"He would have said no for sure," Shorette agreed. "For sure."</p>

<p>Originally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">Dispatch studio AdHoc had been talking about getting Rahul Kohli to play Robert</a>. "But we had and have a cool casting director that had a great relationship with [Aaron Paul], and I think he did respond to the script," said Shorette. "He was feeling it." Aaron Paul had also been in dark animated comedy Bojack Horsemen, which has tonal similarities to Dispatch. "He responded to that aspect of the game," Shorette said. "Thank god too, because I don't know what this is without him at this point."</p><p>Shorette went on to reveal that he had actually spoken to Aaron Paul fairly recently, around the time Dispatch was released, in October/November time. "I was like, 'Hey dude, I feel empty. You're famous and successful - do you ever feel this way?' And he immediately called me. It was a cool big bro move."</p>
<p>It was during this conversation that Aaron Paul told Shorette that he'd been approached in France by people - fans - who'd played Dispatch and apparently loved his work in it. Aaron Paul has moved to France, by the way, according to Shorette. "And I think he got approached a couple times on the streets of Paris," Shorette said.</p>
<p>"That happens all the time [for him] but it's usually someone calling him 'bitch' across the street referencing Breaking Bad, obviously. People were hitting him up while the game was still coming out episodically like, 'Hey, love you in Dispatch,' And he was shocked that it reached France and that it kind of popped off."</p>
<p>"Think about how long he's been in the zeitgeist," Herman added. "People <em>only</em> walk up to him for Breaking Bad. For someone to come up and say, 'Hey, this video game that is coming out right now: I love you in it' - it just doesn't happen for him."</p><p>And remember it's just Aaron Paul's voice in the game, albeit his very recognisable voice - not his digital likeness or captured performance. "I think that's when it clicked for him, like, oh this is real," Herman said. "This is a thing that popped."</p>
<p>The ramifications of that success, of Aaron Paul being praised on the streets of Paris for his work in the game, are that he's much more likely to agree to be a part of whatever AdHoc does with Dispatch next which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">will probably be a Dispatch Season 2</a>. "I think probably, if we're being real, it kind of needed to do what it did for him to be interested in doing it again," Herman said, laughing.</p>
<p>Dispatch has been a studio-defining success for AdHoc, which had been struggling for several years to get the game signed and released. Eventually, a partnership with role-play mega-group - and now gaming brand - Critical Role paved the way, and the game quickly captured an audience and raced to 2m sales. Now AdHoc will need to decide what comes next for Dispatch while also making <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/critical-role-working-on-its-first-video-game-which-will-be-set-in-exandria">a game based on the D&amp;D adventures of Critical Role</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> fans are starting to suspect that generative AI cosmetics have been added to Battlefield 6, in spite of previous statements by senior EA staff stating that wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>This controversy stems from a player card sticker included in the Battlefield 6 Windchill Bundle, a package of cosmetics offered this festive season to players of the military FPS. One sticker, called Winter Warning, features an assault rifle with a snowflake background. This assault rifle seems to be quite the futuristic weapon indeed, as it has two barrels attached. Double the fire rate, surely?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/">This was spotted by user Willcario on Reddit</a>, who titled their post 'Remove this AI s**t from the store', writing: "Two barrels on the M4A1, sure. I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at BO7 and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them".</p>

</figure>
<p>This led to a bit of holiday investigation from Battlefield 6 players, who went back through the library of similar cosmetics to try and find additional examples of AI use. There's no smoking gun here, but some did point to another sticker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ps4ze4/there_are_a_lot_of_things_that_dont_really_pass/">featuring a bear with ten claws as a possible naughty bit of technological tomfoolery</a>. On one paw the bear has four claws, whereas the other paw has five. A bit of perspective magic at work, or the shadow of Sam Altman casting an evil spell on EA? Who can say.</p><p>What's interesting though is that previous statements by senior staff at EA have outright crossed out the possibility of generative AI assets showing up in Battlefield 6. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">In an interview with BBC News Night</a>, VP general manager at EA DICE Rebecka Coutaz stated that while generative AI was "very seducing" to use, it would only be used in the proprietary stages of game development to " allow more time and more space to be creative". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">A similar sentiment to Larian's CEO earlier this month</a>, who also got hit by plenty of backlash.</p>
<p>So is this a case where temporary AI assets slipped in, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">has there been a change in AI strategy in the months following EA's move to privatisation</a>, or is this a simple case of artist error. Sometimes I still write in Americanised spelling, so maybe an artist could be on autopilot and draw two barrels on a gun? We don't know.</p>
<p>EA nor any of the Battlefield Studios have responded to these accusations as of writing.</p>

            <p>"It's OK to make a small game," said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-ok-to-make-a-small-game-says-astro-bot-director-on-its-aa-level-success">Astro Bot director Nicolas Doucet at this year's GDC</a>. For many, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> was 2024's Game of the Year, a game that may have been made by a PlayStation-owned studio, but according to Doucet was based on smart AA-sized ambition.</p>

<p>"A lot of choices we made with Astro Bot could be labelled as AA... like the size of the team, the size of the game, there's no voice, it's not open world, but that doesn't really matter," he said. "We could still make something that gets people really happy."</p>
<p>In some ways, he could very well be describing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Sandfall Interactive has, a year later, proven once again that small games can be critically successful and find their audience.</p>
<p>Of course, "small" is a relative term, and it relates to the size of the team as well as the game itself. There was plenty of discussion this year about the number of developers who worked on Expedition 33 (a core group of 30, but with outside help) and whether it should even be labelled as an indie game from an indie studio, considering the support from publisher Kepler and investment from Microsoft.</p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">I spoke with the game's director Guillaume Broche</a>, he described the studio to me as a "small art house, where we make games that we love and want to play". The core of the game was initially Broche's singular vision that was maintained throughout development. What's more, the JRPG style of the game lent itself to a manageable scope; said Broche: "the kind of game I really love, they tend to take a lot of shortcuts - like JRPGs - and so the general game also matches very well with the size of the team. We would have struggled a lot more, of course, if we'd done a big open world with thousands of quests."</p><p>Size-wise, Expedition 33 pales in comparison to its RPG contemporaries - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, as one example - yet this was intentional. It may not include tonnes of puzzles or dungeons or minigames, but when the team tried this it "broke the rhythm that we want for the game and made it less tight," said Broche. "I think it would have been great for the length of the game, because people would have been stuck for hours. But overall, we wanted something that is shorter than traditional RPGs and more packed in terms of rhythm and cutscenes and story and the battles."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Clair Obscur has won acclaim from the French president, too. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sandfall Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This tight focus, I think, is ultimately the game's strength. There's lots to like in Expedition 33, from its surreal painterly aesthetics, to its now award-winning performances, and its musical score fusing classical styles with pounding synths and French flair. But combat is at its heart - part turn-based, part rhythm game - and by paring down the overall scope of the game, it allowed Sandfall to focus on its strengths.</p>
<p>The result is best-in-genre combat with a tonne of depth, not just in party makeup and the varied playstyles of its cast, but the wealth of options for ability and buff customisation with the Pictos system. At its core, Expedition 33 is a game for RPG nerds who love spending hours tinkering away on builds, before parrying with perfect timing in an extravagant display of empowerment. Combat is your primary way of interacting with the game's world, but it's strong enough to carry the whole experience.</p><p>Altogether, Expedition 33 is an impressive game in itself, worthy of the praise it's received all year. But it also represents a hopeful future for the industry. Where AAA studios are chasing trends with big teams and big budgets, inevitably stumbling into banality in an effort to appease the masses, resulting in layoffs and live-service failures, Expedition 33 by contrast has a clear sense of direction, a bold, distinct vision, and a whole load of passion.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Indeed, it's clear Broche and the development team are as passionate about the wider genre as they are their own game. He described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">Xbox 360 exclusive Lost Odyssey as "the last game that made me cry"</a>, while fans of Expedition 33 have already spotted plenty of references to JRPGs past and present in both the base game and its new expansion. And while there are of course plenty of passionate developers out there, Broche's openness about his love of the genre has absolutely struck a chord with audiences.</p>
<p>It reminded me of Larian CEO Swen Vincke at 2024's The Game Awards before presenting Astro Bot with the top prize. "The studio made their game because they wanted to make a game that they wanted to play themselves," said Vincke in his speech, describing the magic formula for a winning game. It wouldn't treat its developers or its players as numbers to exploit, and it wouldn't be made to increase market share. It would, essentially, be a game made from passionate creativity. "Above all they cared about their game," said Vincke, "because they love games. It's really that simple."</p><p>His prediction was proven absolutely correct when Expedition 33 won this year's award. A small team, a focused vision, and a passion for the craft of video game development. The success of the game has proven this is what players respond to. Let's hope it's a positive indication of the direction the industry is heading.</p>

            <p>Do you need a new Pokémon T-shirt? Don't answer that. Could you be convinced to buy a new Pokémon T-shirt if a nice one popped up? Well, prepare yourselves, because trendy Japanese high street clothing company Uniqlo has announced a new Pokémon collab for 2026.</p>
<p>The range is scheduled to arrive late March, according to <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/eu-at/en/spl/ut/pok%C3%A9mon-ss26">the Uniqlo website</a>, and features seven unique designs - some for adults, some for kids (often differentiated by the base colour of the T-shirt). I think the standout adult design is a blue-ish Snorlax T-shirt with a sleepy character design on the left side of the chest, and the words "Snorlax woke up!" underneath it. Though there's a grey Gengar T-shirt with the character smiling wickedly in the middle of the chest that I can imagine going down well.</p>

</figure>
<p>The best kids' T-shirt, and I don't know why they don't do these in adult sizes, is a sunshine yellow (or Easter yellow - is that a real colour?) Pikachu design. Kids and adults both get a watercolour-style white T-shirt with cute little Bulbasaur, Charmeleon and Squirtle character designs across the middle and the words "I have only 3 left, but you can have one! Choose!" underneath. I think this is a quote from one of the games when you get your Pokémon at the beginning? It could even be the original Pokémon game. I am really stretching my Pokémon knowledge here.</p>

<p>Pokémon turns 30 years old next year - I'll look away while you turn to dust at that realisation - and the official celebration date is 27th February, apparently. But Pokémon arrived a few years later in the west, not touching down in the UK until 1999. I know this because I investigated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-pokemons-arrival-in-the-uk-changed-games-workshop-forever">the story of how Pokémon significantly upset Games Workshop's operations</a> when it did arrive. It's unlikely competition, I know, but it transformed the house of Warhammer's operations forever.</p>
<p>The Uniqlo adult T-Shirts are €19.90, and the kids' T-shirts are €12.90. Maybe see if you can squeeze into one of the smaller ones?</p>
<p>Uniqlo is no stranger to Pokémon collabs. Earlier this year it released an eye-catching and very, perhaps, knowing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-uniqlo-know-what-it-was-doing-with-this-pokemon-magikarp-t-shirt-slogan">Magikarp design that referenced the creature being an "expert splasher"</a>.</p>
<p>This year saw the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Nintendo Switch - another of the in-between and slightly off-at-a-tangent Pokémon Switch instalments. It was a bit uneven but, overall, Chris Tapsell liked it. "Lumiose City could do with work, but Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a much more tightly focused - and delightfully goofy - return to better form. At least by modern Pokémon's standards," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A review</a>.</p>

            <p>Sometimes you just know. A few seconds into Sektori, through an alluringly vague tutorial and out the other side into your arrowhead cockpit, dropped into the little starting play zone of pent-up ecstasy, a diamond shape of refining, refracting kinetic potential, winding up, coiling, taking shape… yes. You know. This thing is about to blow your mind.</p>

<p>Really there's no need to be so high-minded about it. Sektori is exquisite but I'm also just plain old hooked on it. I can't stop. I should be doing something else - hell, I should be writing about something else - and instead I'm getting hypnotised and mesmerised and probably even baptised in the light of this pounding thunderbolt of a video game. It's so good I can't do anything else. It's so good I don't think <em>you</em> should do anything else. Drop everything and play it.</p>
<p>"Drop everything" doesn't carry quite as much weight, of course, when we're at the time of the year when the things you're carrying are probably large handfuls of Malteser Reindeers (an elite Christmas chocolate by the way. Sektori-tier Christmas chocolate) and if you're lucky something liquid and vaguely mulled. But still, stop whatever pretend-important work you're doing in these last few non-days of the year and get this thing in your hands. I say it because, gosh, if ever there was a time to play this game it's now, where there's a chance, if you're luckier still and have some time off over the holidays, that the inevitable obsession might not become totally destructive.</p>

<p>In what I've seen elsewhere on Sektori, there's a lot of effort going towards trying to categorise it. It's Geometry Wars via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resogun">Resogun</a> via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a> via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tetris-effect">Tetris Effect</a>. Maybe some Nex Machina, maybe some Robotron - which was a fair bit before me, sorry, but still the original fountain from which all these games flow. This all makes sense because it's from a bloke called Kimmo Lahtinen, who worked at Resogun, Nex Machina and Returnal developer Housemarque. But also: trying to describe it as a combination of games is to do it all wrong, when this is a game wherein so many neurons fire so quickly. Stop thinking! You fight off squads, swarms, hordes of geometric enemies, purifying the screen of worming, spinning, whirring little pronged and prickled foes like civilisation's last white blood cell. And you do this by shooting, shooting, shooting, faster and harder and everywhere at once, never stopping, never blinking, until this orgiastic spectacle outruns your very eyes.</p><p>So yes, obvious, brilliant genealogy behind this one of course. But there are twists, and they're fantastic. In the main 'campaign' mode I've been engulfed by personally, for instance, you can pick up golden yellow sparkles from amongst the noise to pause it, momentarily, and choose from a selection of three cards. Some cards are really decks, which add more cards to the future pool from within a specific category for when you next get a pickup. Others are just the cards, i.e. upgrades on their own. Others, golden again, are extra special upgrades, which I suggest you often (but not always) choose.</p>



<p>Then there's the system of live, on-the-fly upgrading you perform as you go. Shoot enemies to drop glimmer. Collect enough glimmer to fill a bar, fill the bar and you get a blue sparkly pick-up to collect. Collect that, and rather than an upgrade point, you <em>move</em> the cursor on the list of upgrades up to the next one. So first is speed, then your score, then your dash, your shield, your rockets and, last, your blaster. Naturally, the ones that take several pickups before you get to them are broadly the most powerful, but even ploughing a load of points into speed can be a big advantage from the off.</p><p>Between the two systems you get something glorious. Sektori is - <em>gasp!</em> - a roguelike! And heaven forbid it's technically even a deckbuilding roguelite at that. Where are you going? Come back! The emphasis is on the "technically" here, because Sektori is still a score-attack twin stick bullet hell shooter at its core. These systems simply enhance it, adding variance and verve. They also do something else quite special. Watching your enemies, your pickups, the glimmer, yourself, your bullets, the moving stage - the stages move by the way, self-destructing or re-forming around you, with insta-kill lethality, and varying greatly, with the outrageously powerful soundtrack, from one run to the next - <em>as well as</em> the little menu, miniscule in the top left, is a skill in itself. And a decidedly twin-stick skill at that. Between it and the periodical choice of cards, you're essentially building a playstyle on the fly, and doing so while never actually stopping to contemplate it. So just as this genre is all about seeing multiple things in a moment, multitasking beyond any normal range of multitaskability, Sektori is the evolution of it: see strategy. See the fifth dimension as you move between two on the screen.</p>

<p>Sometimes this is purely reactive. I've taken a few careless early hits and need to build around shields and dashes, for instance. But inevitably you must gamble and stick it out to upgrade your offenses, if not only for the outsized advantage they provide but the sheer, extraordinary joy of watching them in action. All this strategy, this calculated risk-taking, happens amidst impossible busyness. It's a testament, really, to what the genre itself can do. This genre - whatever the genre is at this point, that includes all those games above - is ultimately about proving the extreme, unconscious focus of which the human brain is capable, proving that a secret layer of awareness exists, beneath the intentional surface.</p><p>The first few times you play it - on 'Experience' difficulty! For people who don't want too much challenge! The cheek of it! - it will seem insurmountable. You won't even notice the symbols off to the sides, let alone understand what they're for. Then slowly, slowly, furiously and repeatedly, you'll learn. You'll get a SEKTORI - collect all the letters, Tony Hawk style! - and max out your missiles and kill that bastard robo-snake, and see the kaleidoscopic beauty of it all, and realise the mind can do wonderful, extraordinary things.</p>

            <p>Vince Zampella, co-creator of Call of Duty and legendary studio head, has passed away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/">According to a report by NBC4</a>, Vince and a passenger died while driving out of a tunnel in Los Angeles' San Gabriel Mountains. The car collided with a concrete barrier, resulting in a fire. The passenger, ejected from the car during the crash, died at the hospital. Zampella died at the scene.</p>
<p>Zampella, known for a trailblazing career in the video game industry, famously co-founded the Call of Duty franchise. He'd later go on to found <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a>, the studio behind beloved games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. Recently, Zampella led the charge on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s development, a game that would go on to make waves in the FPS space this year.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5TCS-pDmqk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>Following news of his death, many industry professionals have come forward to eulogise Zampella. Stig Asmussen, former game director on the Star Wars Jedi series at Respawn, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stasmussen/">wrote their own farewell on LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>Asmussen wrote: "Truly saddened today. Still processing, like a lot of us. Vince was my friend, and he made me a better person. " Daniel Suarez, senior vice president at Respawn Entertainment, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7408986800335065089/">stated</a>: "The industry has lost a Titan and a Legend. Rest in peace, Vince Zampella. I will forever be in awe of the games you helped create, thankful for the opportunity you gave me at Respawn, and for the friendship and laughs we shared over the years. Words cannot express how much you will be missed."</p><p>Respawn Entertainment itself <a href="https://x.com/Respawn/status/2003243956021195138">released a statement</a> on the matter of Zampella's death. Posting on social media, the company noted: "We're heartbroken by the passing of our founder and dear friend Vince Zampella. Vince was a titan and legend of this industry, a visionary leader and a force who shaped teams and games like Call of Duty, Titanfall, Apex Legends, the Star Wars Jedi series and Battlefield for our community in ways that will be felt for generations.</p>
<p>"His impact reached far beyond any one game or studio. We will remember Vince for how he showed up every day, trusting his teams, encouraging bold ideas, and believing in Respawn &amp; Battlefield. Most importantly, he championed what he believed was right for the people behind those studios and our players because it mattered. We will miss him greatly. Our hearts are with his family, friends, and all who love him."</p>
<p>EA too stepped forward and paid homage to Zampella, <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-vince-zampella-battlefield-boss-and-call-of-duty-co-creator-killed-in-car-crash-2000655216">in a statement provided to Kotaku</a>. The company wrote: "This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince's family, his loved ones, and all those touched by his work. Vince's influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching. A friend, colleague, leader and visionary creator, his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment and inspired millions of players and developers around the world. His legacy will continue to shape how games are made and how players connect for generations to come.</p>

            <p>Before we tell you what <em>we</em> think, and before we reveal what <em>you</em> think, we thought we'd do something a little bit different as part of our usual end-of-year games-of-the-year celebrations. What, we wondered, do the people who actually <em>make</em> the games think? As so we've chatted with the developers behind some of our favourite 2025 releases to find out which new games have resonated most with them as the year has gone on.</p>
<p>And the results were illuminating, ranging from knockabout mountaineering and sci-fi cloning to carpark racing and 90s internet sleuthing. For some more top-calibre picks, read on.</p>

<p><strong>Gabe's pick: </strong>Peak (available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">Steam</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What is it? </strong>Peak, from developer Aggro Crab and Landfall Games, took the gaming world by storm when it was released back in June, selling over 1m copies in just six days, before going on to sell considerably more. It's not hard to see why it proved popular either; this knockabout co-op climbing game - in which up to four friends must work together to scale a mysterious, possibly magical mountain - is as hilariously chaotic as it is charming.</p><p><strong>Gabe says,</strong> <em>"Peak was famously made in three months, and it shows. The game feels thrown together in a lot of ways, and is full of bugs. To me this is also its greatest strength. The random jumble of geometry that makes up the levels gives it a real route-finding feel that I've only felt in other climbing games that embrace randomness (see also: [fr0g] clan official server 24/7 zk map (for stranger), Stratocubulus). I love that its levels aren't didactic, and that it has a loose grip on how you find your way up. I also love feeding my friends poison."</em></p>

Ghost of Yotei continues the series' great swordplay and heartfelt storytelling, but it's not quite business as usual. The big change is the departure of previous protagonist Jin in favour of lone wolf mercenary Atsu, who players join on her single-minded mission to punish the Yōtei Six, the ruthless gang who slaughtered her family.</p><p><strong>Lee says,</strong> <em>"The game I connected most with this year is Ghost of Yotei. As both a big Kurosawa admirer and a fan of the first game, I really enjoyed my time in this world. Getting lost in the stunning landscape on horseback was my favorite element of the game. The wind is a character in this world, both mechanically (helps the player know where to go) and aesthetically; it's always present and means that every frame of this game feels alive. I turned on the optional Watanabe mode, replacing the game's score with some great low-fi beats; the perfect soundtrack for my meandering exploration."</em></p>

<p><strong>Oli's pick:</strong> The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy (available on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/The-Hundred-Line-Last-Defense-Academy-2787024.html">Switch</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/">PC</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Part visual novel, part tactical RPG, developer Too Kyo Games and Media Vision's The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy follows the adventures of entirely ordinary Tokyo teenager Takumi Sumino, who, after a surprising event, is recruited into the Last Defense Academy. And so begins a battle - with a little help from 14 fellow students - to protect his new school from marauding monsters, keeping it safe for the next 100 days.</p><p><strong>Oli says,</strong> <em>"The most important thing a game can do is Surprise and Delight the player. Hundred Line loads up a double-barrel shotgun of Surprise and shoots you in the face. You bleed Delight all over the floor. The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is a work of genius. It plays with narrative form. It settles you into tropes and then breaks said tropes over its knee. The story branches are bursting with juice and you want to slurp up every drop.</em></p>
<p><em>"The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is made by lunatics, for lunatics. Every time I play, I think to myself, ‘Is this okay? Is it okay for video games to be this good? Is there any point to me still making video games when a video game this good exists?' The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is a masterpiece made by developers at the top of their game."</em></p>

<p><strong>Jon's pick: </strong>Type Help (available on PC via <a href="https://william-rous.itch.io/type-help">Itch.io</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Inspired by the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/her-story">Her Story</a>, William Rous' Type Help tasks players with exploring the files of an old computer in an attempt to figure out what happened to its owner and perhaps even solve the gruesome mystery of Galley House. Type Help can be played for free on Itch.io, but an expanded version <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3641000/The_Incident_at_Galley_House/">comes to Steam</a> next year.</p>
<p><strong>Jon says,</strong> <em>"Type Help has a really smart deductive interface but its best idea is in the structure of the narrative itself, which gets tighter and tighter as the story progresses.</em></p>
<p><em>"Database thrillers in the Her Story model often have a problem towards the end, as the player is left to mop up missing pieces despite having the bulk of the story in place, but Type Help manages - through its foul means - to wrangle a climax and denouement. (Only, listen, you have to play it without a spreadsheet, like a real gumshoe.)"</em></p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Rematch probably isn't the game most people would have guessed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> and Absolver studio Sloclap would make next, but what is football if not tactical movement and barely constrained violence? Rematch, more specifically, is an online multiplayer football game where up to 5v5 matches play out in third-person for a more arcadey, immersive take on the sport.</p><p><strong>Pierre says,</strong> <em>"My favorite new game release of 2025 is Rematch - it's by far the game I've played the most this year. After over three years of development during which I had to wait for the weekly test sessions to be able to play the game, it feels really great to be able to find teammates and opponents whenever I feel like kicking the ball. In Rematch, a single mistake can cost you the win, so I sometimes get frustrated (both against myself, and against my teammates), but the highs far outweigh the lows: the satisfaction of a well-placed pass, the joy of playing seamlessly with your team, the pressure of a tense overtime, the rush of a critical goal... all these are moments unique to Rematch, and are why I love playing it so much."</em></p>

<p><strong>Mark's pick: </strong>Parking Garage Rally Circuit (available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2737300/Parking_Garage_Rally_Circuit/">Steam</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Pretty much everything you need to know about Walaber Entertainment's Parking Garage Rally Circuit is there in the title, but if we're going to get granular, it's a retro-inspired arcade racer - styled like a Sega Saturn game - that sees players careening across big US cities. The twist, though, is its races take place entirely within repurposed parking garages. It's officially described as a sort of Rally and circuit racing hybrid, featuring "tight simple controls and arcade physics" - and if you're the competitive type, there's split-screen, online multiplayer for up to eight players, and leaderboards too.</p><p><em><strong>Mark says,</strong></em><em> "In the distant past, before Fireproof and all the spooky puzzle games we make there, a bunch of us got our start at Criterion working on Burnout. I've always kept my eye on the arcade racing scene and though it's been mostly dormant, it seems like there's a bit of a resurgence going on at the moment.</em></p>
<p><em>"One of my favourites of this little renaissance is Parking Garage Rally Circuit, a game that feels so authentically retro it's like it was lost down the back of the sofa for 30 years - a Saturn disc dusted off and uploaded straight onto Steam.</em></p>
<p><em>"It's a chaotic game of drifting tiny cars though busy carparks (and other places) wrestling for first place while avoiding obstacles. It's quick and snappy fun with a lot of depth to its drift and boost driving model; a classic one-more-go arcade experience."</em></p>

<p><strong>Treasa's pick: </strong>The Roottrees are Dead (available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2754380/The_Roottrees_are_Dead/">Steam</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> This acclaimed "genealogical mystery" from developer Evil Trout begins somewhere in 1998, when several members of the renowned Roottree family - together worth billions - are killed in a plane crash. Their money is to be redistributed among the remaining family, but there's a problem - it's not entirely clear who's a blood relative. That's where you come in; armed with a PC and your lightning-fast dial-up modem, you'll need to scour photos, books, articles and more in order to deduce exactly who connects with who, and who belongs where on the family tree.</p><p><strong>Treasa says, "</strong><em>The Roottrees are Dead is a smart and engaging deductive game that blends the mechanics of two of my favourite games, Return of the Obra Dinn and Her Story, very elegantly with the addition of a nice note-taking system for people like me who need notes but lose everything. It's thinky, fun, and engaging, feeling a lot like the board game Modern Detective which I also love. The illustrative art style is nostalgic and reminds me of the old Nancy Drew and Hardy Boy books I grew up with. It's cosy, intriguing and easy to fall into a deductive hole with."</em></p>

<p><strong>Tonda's pick:</strong> Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo (available on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pipistrello-and-the-Cursed-Yoyo-2771463.html">Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP2011-PPSA25769_00-0244902112206471">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/pipistrello-and-the-cursed-yoyo/9N9LK61WS2CH">Xbox Series X/S</a>, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870350/Pipistrello_and_the_Cursed_Yoyo/">Steam</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Developed by Pocket Trap, Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo is officially a "Yoyovania". More specifically, though, it's a top-down exploration adventure that sees its bat protagonist - self-described yoyo master Pippit - navigating a sprawling city in order to bring down rival crime bosses and win back the trust of the Pipistrello family. It's got combat, platforming action, and puzzle-solving - much of it built around Pippit's yoyo tricks - and some pleasing retro vibes too.</p><p><em><strong>Tonda says,</strong></em><em> "2025 has been a watershed year for indies, and while I have a lot of personal favourites, if I had to choose just one, it would have to be Pocket Trap's brilliant top-down adventure, Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo. Imagine a hero wielding a yoyo in lieu of a sword, and instead of gaining new attacks, he learns yoyo tricks. Tricks that transform the combat, and the platforming, and allow you to solve puzzles in so many clever ways. But perhaps the most impressive trick of all is winning our hearts along - No wait, it's 'walk-the-dog'. That's definitely the most impressive trick."</em></p>

<p><strong>What is it? </strong>Frostpunk developer 11 Bit Studios' The Alters is a strange beast, combining elements of survival, adventure, and base-building into an intriguing sci-fi whole set on a hostile planet. At the heart of all this is Jan Dolski, the sole survivor of an ill-fated space expedition, who has little chance of survival without a crew for his mobile base. That's where things get interesting; by utilising the properties of a substance known as Rapidium, he's able to simulate alternate outcomes of his past choices and bring the Jans that took different paths to life. Expect tough moral dilemmas, a branching narrative, and more.</p><p><strong>Dave says,</strong> <em>"Normally, base-building games aren't my thing, but I gave The Alters a whirl because I am a fan of the publisher's previous work (Thaumaturge and Indika were both sublime). What I didn't expect to find was one of the most emotionally affecting stories I've ever experienced. We all wonder how our lives could've changed if we made a different decision, and Jan Dolski gets to experience that first hand.</em></p>
<p><em>"In lesser hands, this could've been just a cute gimmick, but The Alters deftly turns it into an absolutely fascinating character study. A character study that is intricately wrapped in a tight and addictive gameplay loop. I simply <em>had</em> to gather enough materials to get Jan and his Alters through another day so I could continue talking to them. One hour of play would quickly turn into eight without me even noticing. My heart soared when the final credits rolled, but sank a bit because I didn't want it to end."</em></p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong> You're the young heir of Mt. Holly manor in developer Dogbomb's acclaimed puzzler Blue Prince. But before you can claim your title, you'll need to prove yourself. The challenge is simple - find the elusive Room 46 - but the solution is anything but. Each day, you'll probe a little deeper into the mansion, drafting cards from a deck to shape its ever-shifting layout. Every room holds its own secrets, leading to yet more mysteries, and it's up to you to peel away the seemingly endless layers as you slowly puzzle your way toward the truth of it all.</p><p><em><strong>Andrea says,</strong></em><em> "I'd choose Blue Prince, because it's the only game I actually managed to finish this year. After Horses was banned in 2023, I finally listened to my mom and became a teacher, a decision that turned out to be devastating for my free time.</em></p>
<p><em>In a way, it was the perfect setup: Blue Prince is a game that asks you to navigate aimlessly, to move without a clear map, trying to understand what you're doing wrong and what the system expects from you. An experience uncannily similar to both teaching and figuring out what exactly Steam didn't like in our game. Cathartic!"</em></p>

<p><strong>Gareth's pick: </strong>Many Nights a Whisper (available on PC via <a href="https://deconstructeam.itch.io/many-nights-a-whisper">Itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3541130/Many_Nights_a_Whisper/">Steam</a>)</p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong> Created by Deconstructeam (the studio behind The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood) and Selkie Harbour, Many Nights a Whisper is a meditative third-person game in which you're tasked with completing an ancient archery ceremony. Performing it correctly grants years of prosperity to your people, but failure could lead to calamity. The problem? All this is determined by landing a single impossible shot. Over its short hour-or-so runtime, you'll receive guidance from your mentor and speak to the townsfolk to learn their dreams. "Weigh their whispers," Deconstructream teases, "and decide whether to grant their wishes."</p><p><strong>Gareth says,</strong> <em>"Sometimes it feels a little like games might be calcifying, hardening around established genres and conventions, settling into the same set of compulsion loops, and then I play something like Many Nights a Whisper. It's a game that feels ‘gamey' in the purest sense, a staged situation that tasks you with performing an act with skill and intention, and yet it also feels like a poem, a debate, a moment. It scaffolds its simplicity - make one single shot from a sling - with such carefully chosen complications. You choose what weight to put on the shot, what it means, by accepting the wishes it will grant. You choose a potential future, and then beckon it into being, or not. My own whispered wish is that games never forget this discursive power: to stage a moment that reveals the world."</em></p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong> After 18 months in early access, Hades 2 finally got its hugely anticipated 1.0 release this year, and - surprising nobody, given the quality of its award-winning predecessor - it was worth the wait. On a basic level, Supergiant Games' sequel offers more of the same sublime roguelike dungeon-crawling action, but it's been expanded and finessed in all sorts of interesting ways. That makes for a cracking journey as Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld (and sister to original Hades protagonist Zagreus), attempts to defeat Chronos, the titan of time.</p><p><strong>Nick says,</strong> <em>"It's tough seeing as there are so many great games, and it was the year in which [we were crunching]. I've played a little bit of everything, but I haven't really destroyed or demolished anything. I think probably the game that got me the most was Hades 2; I love everything Supergiant does, and if you love Hades, it's just like three times that."</em></p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong> You are a demon made of glass and pain in developer Sam Eng's Skate Story, but your freedom awaits if - as per your deal with the Devil - you can catch and swallow the moon. It's a quest full of strange characters and tortured souls, buoyed along by blistering visuals and a stellar soundtrack. But also, as its name suggests, lots and lots of skateboarding. Sometimes you'll bound around mini-sandbox levels completing eclectic requests, other times you'll careen relentlessly forward through gorgeously choreographed - and genuinely thrilling - set-piece stages. And with over 70 tricks to learn, plus board upgrades and nifty sticker customisation, there's a lot to keep you busy as you attempt to escape the Underworld.</p><p><strong>Matt says,</strong> <em>"Another solo developed project that I've been following the progress of for a long time. It bleeds style so effortlessly, the game's art direction is so consistent, and the soundtrack is such a great fit. I've only just picked it up but already know it's my favourite of the year. It plays really great as well, I can tell all the aspects of movement and input are very fine-tuned. I'm also a fan of games that embrace a low-fidelity appearance, with natural camera shake, lens distortion, motion blur - it does wonders for this kind of game. And I love the camera animation that plays when you fall off and crash, chef's kiss."</em></p>

            <p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> released, there has been much discussion about the game's performances. While all are exemplary, and saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">Jennifer English and Ben Starr receive nominations for Best Performer at this year's The Game Awards</a>, there has since been debate over what exactly it means to be nominated in this category.</p>
<p>You see, another Clair Obscur actor to receive a nomination at The Game Awards was Charlie Cox, known for the likes of Daredevil and Stardust, who provided the voice of the game's protagonist Gustave. However, the character's motion performance was done by French actor Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Back in November, Cox said while he was of course delighted to see his contribution to Clair Obscur recognised, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-charlie-cox-thrilled-by-game-awards-nomination-but-says-gustaves-mocap-actor-deserves-the-credit">as much of the applaud needed to go to Cazorla</a> as well. "Any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process," Cox said. I recently had the oppertunity to sit down and chat with Cazorla about all things Clair Obscur, and of course our conversation soon turned to Cox's comments.</p>

<p>"First of all, it was an incredible honour for me that Charlie spoke publicly and acknowledged my work. I was deeply moved by his humility and generosity," Cazorla told me, before he shed more light on the process of bringing Gustave to life.</p><p>"We started by doing the performance capture without any particular constraints, approaching it like a film, learning the lines, playing the scenes, and following Guillaume's direction," Cazorla said. "Once the shoot was done and the scenes were integrated into the game engine by the cinematic team, that's when the voice actors stepped in and recorded their performances."</p>
<p>He added that his part in Gustave's overall character and Cox's "happened at different stages of the process", something that "is very common in game production". Cazorla explained once the physical side of the performance was locked in, Cox then went into the studio to record Gustave's lines. "I only discovered the final result months later, directly in the game," Cazorla shared.</p>
<p>"In the end, it's really the combination of these two performances, along with the incredible writing and development work, that gave birth to the character."</p>
<p>But, how did Cazorla feel to not receive a nomination for his part in Gustave's character development? Does he feel awards shows should change how they recognise performances generally?</p>
<p>"When it comes to a potential motion capture category, I think it's a delicate subject, because every game is built differently," Cazorla replied. "In this case, Clair Obscur is a game where many of the characters are created through collaboration between two actors. For example, Maelle with Charlotte Hoepffner and Jennifer English, Lune with Estelle Darnault and Kirsty Rider, Verso with Ben Starr and myself. Other games might have a single actor doing full performance capture, and some projects even involve stunt performers, motion capture actors, and voice actors all contributing to the same character."</p>
<p>As such, Cazorla believes "the fairest way to celebrate performers" is to "celebrate the character" instead.</p>
<p>"That's something the DICE Awards already do, and I think it's a very intelligent approach. If you reward Gustave as a character and his impact on players, you acknowledge Charlie Cox for the voice, myself for the performance capture, but also the writers who shaped his personality, the character artists, and everyone who contributed to bringing him to life."</p><p>Closing, Cazorla said: "Video games are, by nature, a collaborative art form, and characters resonate because many artists give them their soul. Celebrating a Best Character category feels more logical to me than isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible."</p>

<p>If you want to hear more from Cazorla , my full chat with him is going live in the coming days. Here, the actor discusses how he found out about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, his audition and meeting the team at Sandfall, performing the motion capture for several of the game's characters, and much, much more. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>New details have been revealed regarding the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-file-class-action-lawsuit-over-cancelled-kotor-2-dlc">Knights of the Old Republic 2 false advertisement lawsuit</a> for Switch consoles. This includes an argument made by one expert brought in by Aspyr who stated that the fan-made Restored Content mod the missing DLC was based on had "no economic value".
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-kotor-ii-lawsuit-saga">This information comes from Game File</a>, which broke down the legal battle between developer Aspyr and an individual who sued the company after DLC advertised in a trailer for the Switch version <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-kotor-2-switch-dlc-cancelled-after-third-party-objection-says-aspyr">was cut from the full release</a>.</p>
<p>This report claims Aspyr made several arguments in an attempt to curb the lawsuit, which ended in a settlement earlier this year. These include the claim that the tease for the DLC couldn't have been widely seen, as it appeared at the end of a YouTube trailer. Aspyr's own lawyers argued: "Many YouTube viewers skip [videos] after the first five seconds."</p>

<p>Aspyr also reportedly brought in additional documents in April, including expert testiomy from former Blizzard product manager Frank Gilson. He explained the restored content mod the DLC was based on was fan-made and offered for free. It therefore had no "economic value", a belief that stemmed from the fact the community creates these mods and doesn't charge for them. </p><p>The lawsuit would progress further onto even more colourful topics, including accusations of demonic possession, stemming from a claim that an Aspyr attorney yelled at his client: "as if possessed by a demon". This framing was rejected by the attorney in question, who said he raised his voice so he could finish his sentence and return the conversation to "productive discussion".</p>
<p>There was also the claim it could take decades to learn the appropriate email address in order to get the rights to make a Star Wars game. This comes from a redaction of certain email addresses in documents filed this April. These were redacted as: "[...] they reveal a key trade secret; the identities of the right persons to work with at Lucasfilm to secure access to Lucasfilm intellectual property. Those contacts reflect years, sometimes decades, of work cultivating relationships and revealing them would cause Aspyr lasting business harm."</p>

</p>
<p>While this particular chapter in the Kotor saga was a bit of a messy one, there is hope for fans of the series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-from-knights-of-the-old-republic-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson">During The Game Awards, Fate of the Old Republic</a> was revealed, alongside the news that Casey Hudson would be involved. Hudson was famously involved with the original Knights of the Old Republic game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>.</p>

            <p>The rebooted 2013 Tomb Raider made its Switch debut just a matter of weeks ago, and thanks to the "passionate response" from the community, port developer Aspyr may now consider bringing the trilogy's final two entries to Nintendo's platform as well.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy kicked off when the team at Crystal Dynamics dropped an inexperienced and somewhat naive Lara Croft on the storm-riddled shores of Yamatai. Her story then continued in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, which took Lara to Siberia, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, where the trilogy concluded in the sweltering jungles of South America.</p>

<p>Of course, many Switch players are now wondering if these last two entries in the most recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> will eventually make their way to the platform as well, and allow them to finish Lara's rebooted arc.</p>
<p>"We have definitely seen this question," <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/aspyr-explains-how-it-approached-the-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-tomb-raider-definitive-edition-patches-planned/">Aspyr told Nintendo Everything</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-fans-might-get-the-entire-tomb-raider-survivor-trilogy-thanks-to-their-passionate-response">Nintendo Life</a>). The studio added it has already reintroduced Nintendo players to the classic era of Tomb Raider with its remasters of the first six games in the series.</p>
<p>"We've successfully brought back the classic era (1-6) and now the 'origin story' of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms," Aspyr said when asked about future Tomb Raider ports of Rise and Shadow.</p>
<p>"We can't announce anything at the moment but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities," the studio closed. So, would you like to see Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider arrive on Switch consoles?</p>

<p>Along with Tomb Raider 2013 arriving on Switch, this month has been a rather exciting one for fellow fans of Lara's. At The Game Awards, two new games were also announced to be in the works. The first - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">a remake of the original Tomb Raider known as Legacy of Atlantis</a> - is due to be released next year. Then, in 2027, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">all-new series entry known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst will arrive across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam</a>.</p>
<p>There is also Amazon's live-action show still to come, with filming beginning next month. Cast members so far include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver as a character called Wallace</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">Jason Isaacs in an undisclosed role</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has announced the Octopath Traveller series has surpassed 6m lifetime sales, shortly after the release of Octopath Traveller 0.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OCTOPATH_PR/status/2002923293331140952">Revealed on the official Octopath Traveller X account</a>, this milestone coincides with steep discounts across all entries in the series. Octopath Traveller and Octopath Traveller 2 are available right now at a 60 percent reduction in price.</p>
<p>The Octopath series has proven a successful gambit from Square Enix. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveler-review">The original release back in 2018 proved a smash hit critically</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveller-sells-1-million-units-worldwide">quickly soaring past 1m sales</a>. Roughly a year later, it came to Steam, adding additional fire to the game's momentum.</p>

<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mobile-game-octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent-due-this-year">Octopath Traveller: Champions of the Continent released in Europe and North America</a>, adding controversial gacha mechanics to the series.  Then, in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveler-2-announced-for-nintendo-switch">Octopath Traveller 2 was released</a>. This too proved popular among RPG lovers, iterating on the original and garnering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-some-missteps-octopath-traveller-2-is-a-little-more-refined-than-its-predecessor">a new wave of positive critical reception</a>. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-june-titles-announced">also had a stint on Xbox Game Pass</a>, offering a nice boost.</p><p>Fast forward to this year and we've got Octopath Traveller 0, a recreation of the aforementioned Champions of the Continent without all the oozing microtransactions. It's not perfect by any means, but remains a pleasing RPG experience despite its faults. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveler-0-experiment-failed-square-enix-rpg">Eurogamer's Dom Peppiatt described the game as</a>: "an interesting experiment in trying to make a traditional game out of gacha elements, it's just not a very successful one."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> has popped up on Wired's (fantastic) Tech Support series (did you know that we're closer in time <a href="https://youtu.be/E7oEq6CE78g?si=dhAH__k4FyEl0vzp&amp;t=9">to Cleopatra than Cleopatra is to the beginning of ancient Egypt</a>?) answering questions about – well, himself, in the main.</p>
<p>While the web series has featured game developers before - including Dead Space creator and Sledgehammer Games co-founder, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEXdJU9ZUX8">Glen Schofield</a> - this interview was purely about Kojima himself and how he sets about writing, making, and even assessing his own video games.</p>

<p>Kojima said a number of interesting things - including how important it is that you feel "the creator's love" in games, and encouraging player experimentation - but also opened up about his well-documented love of movies, the future of gaming, and how he tries to make a world that "makes you want to stay and play".</p>
<p>He also said that he doesn't "have" experts that offer specialised science or history knowledge, which is why he studies "daily", reading literature, watching documentaries and news specials, as well as researching things online or at the library.</p>
<p>"If you're watching and thinking, 'I'll be Kojima's right-hand man!' please contact me," he joked.</p>
<p>There's also a fascinating behind-the-scenes look into how he personally tests and tunes his games, including listening with both headphones and speakers, tweaking difficulty, and "fixing story pacing issues".</p>
<p>"It's a very crucial stage," he said. "Not many do this, I think."</p> <div>

<p>Kojima also popped up on <a href="https://x.com/NetflixJP/status/2001789572586574127">Netflix Japan</a> recently, too, interviewing the Duffer Brothers at what seems to be Kojima Productions' office. In it, the brothers admitted how much Japanese culture impacted them, particularly games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill, which "really influenced the whole look of the Upside Down and the other dimension".</p>
<p>They also mentioned Metal Gear Solid, but that may have been because Kojima was the one interviewing them.</p>
<p>"Those [games] were all discussed in the room," they said. "It was filtered through the lens of how we remembered seeing them and playing them for the first time when we were young and filtered through our experience, but they were just as much a part of Stranger Things [as influences from The Big Three, John Carpenter, Spielberg, and Stephen King]."</p>

            <p>The Indie Game Awards has withdrawn two awards previously given to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, not because of the debate about what does and doesn't constitute an "indie" game, but because a representative of Sandfall Interactive had agreed that no gen AI had been used in the development when, in fact, it had.</p>
<p>"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself," the nomination commitment explained. "When it was submitted for consideration, a representative of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p>"In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI art in production on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-claims-xbox-wrapped-2025-isnt-happening-this-year-due-to-marketing-budget-constraints<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>While every site you've ever visited in 2025 seems intent on summarising your year even for things you absolutely don't need to be summarised (the cards I completed in <a href="https://asana.com/year-in-review/log-in">Asana</a> this year? Uh, no thanks), there's one wrapped message you probably won't be getting this year: Xbox.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary">WindowsCentral's</a> Jez Corden, who recently suggested that the Xbox summary isn't just late this year, but may not be coming at all.</p>

<p>"Some of you have been asking me if Xbox would be doing its own Year in Review' style recap of your gaming habits for 2025," Corden wrote. "My sources suggest that Xbox is not doing a 'Wrapped' this year. And there's potentially a good reason."</p>
<p>As for what those good reasons are? Corden says next year will kick-off a "confluence of major anniversaries not just for Xbox, but some of its subsidiary properties too".</p>
<p>"Xbox is having its 25th anniversary, alongside Halo itself. Blizzard is also having its 35th anniversary, and Bethesda is having its 40th anniversary too," he stated. "Xbox was launched as a brand on November 15, 2001. Blizzard launched in February, 1991, and Bethesda launched in June, 1986.</p>
<p>"As such, a lot of the 'marketing budget' that would've typically been allocated to something like an Xbox Wrapped is being poured into efforts to celebrate these major milestones for Xbox, its brands, and some of its games."</p>
<p>Sony's 2025 Wrap-Up and Steam Replay 2025 are already live, by the way. If you've yet to see yours, head to the <a href="https://wrapup.playstation.com/en-gb">official website</a> for PlayStation, or pop over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/76561198023003792/2025">Steam</a> to see what's been keeping you busy there this year.</p>
<p>It's been a tough year for Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">with thousands of layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">cancelled games</a>, including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-us-console-unit-sales-just-reached-an-all-time-november-low">flagging hardware sales</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">even its tentpole shooter, Call of Duty series, is struggling</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, however, reports, Xbox will be hosting one of its Dev Direct streams in January, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/well-have-more-stuff-next-year-after-being-somewhat-absent-from-the-game-awards-xbox-boss-teases-a-dev-direct-for-january-2026">"we've got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show"</a>. That means we can probably expect updates on the upcoming Fable game and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> series, and perhaps a couple of updates from other games that come under the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> umbrella.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will not be returning to iOS in Japan next year "as promised" because, according to Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, Apple has allegedly launched "another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking".</p>
<p>In a series of messages posted to X/Twitter, Sweeney explained that whilst Apple had been "required to open up iOS to competing stores", it has instead introduced additional fees, including a 21% "junk fee" on third-party in-app payments, 15% for purchases made on the web, and a "new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/">announced</a> earlier this week that it would be making changes to iOS in Japan, including new options for developers to distribute apps and process payments, acknowledging that the changes have been implemented to comply with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA).</p>
<p>"Sadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised," CEO Sweeney wrote. "Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores [on 18th December], and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.</p>
<p>"Apple chose poorly. Again."</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, he added: "They're charging a competition-crushing 21% junk fee on third-party in-app payments, and 15% for purchases made on the web (a practice the US District Court already found to be illegal in the contempt of court proceeding that Apple lost and the 9th Circuit Court upheld)." He then linked to a page on <a href="https://t.co/QDtWekKflY">Apple's website</a>.</p><p>"They're introducing new anticompetitive warning screens meant to mislead customers into believing their privacy and financial security are at risk when dealing with Apple competitors. They're imposing a new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores, and intend to surveil all transactions within them using a mandatory reporting API."</p>
<p>He closed on calling the changes "an egregious Apple imposition on distribution and payments they have no involvement with, and a practice the US courts already found to be illegal and upheld on appeal".</p>
<p>"Obviously, real competition won't happen, and consumers won't benefit, when Apple abuses its position between users and competitors to obstruct honest dealing between them," Sweeney concluded. "This is another sad day in the history of relationships between platform makers, developers, and consumers, and we will be raising our complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission."</p>
<p>It's the latest in the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method</a>, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut. The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple in May by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">"in wilful violation" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing"</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney has previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case</a>.</p>

<p>"Over the last few days, we’ve been rolling out a set of changes across multiple Breakthrough maps, starting with our earlier test on New Sobek City," the team explained in a social media post.

<p>Interestingly, the team is transparent that these change may not "perform well", but did commit to roll[ing] back some or all of these changes as our focus remains on steadily improving Breakthrough overall".</p>
<p>The team closed on thanking players for their "patience, support, and feedback as we continue to tune the mode", hinted further updates would be coming in the New Year, and wished everyone "happy holidays".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pba-pro-bowling-2026-is-an-earnest-accurate-sports-sim-that-feels-like-it-fell-out-of-2010-i-love-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>There's a lot more to ten-pin bowling than meets the eye. What to most people is something you do while half-cut during a boozy night-out or take your kids to for a birthday hides a chilling secret: it's actually a <em>very</em> complex sport. Video games have generally treated bowling as the former, though - that's why the greatest-ever bowling game is one that is played with extremely broad motion controls and requires gleefully little thought.</p>
<p>Better can and has existed, though. This year, better gets an upgrade in the form of PBA Pro Bowling 2026, which as the title suggests is the officially-licensed video game of the Professional Bowlers Association. In terms of ambition, this game wants to be to bowling as EA and 2K's efforts are to golf. Working with what is obviously a much smaller budget because the sport has a much smaller target audience, I'm actually quite impressed by what the game has to offer.</p>
<p>Now, I don't think that you need to actually have a fulsome knowledge of the internal mechanics of a sport to review a simulation of that sport, but I'd argue that <em>it helps</em>. So it is here that I must briefly confess that despite being in my mid-thirties, I frequently have the hobbies of a pensioner. I have been ten-pin bowling since I was about twelve, picking up the hobby from my grandfather - we'd compete in doubles leagues - and then carrying on long after he was no longer able to play. I still bowl in a private league with my mates every year once the weather turns cold and golf becomes inhospitable - and though my best-ever average (192, for what it's worth) now eludes me, I'd describe myself as still <em>pretty good</em> with a decent knowledge of the game's mechanics. There's currently seven different bowling balls stacked on shelves in my garage. My wife is a patient woman.</p>
<p>I honestly think the above - laying out my credentials - is all pretty important to this discussion. Plus, it's Christmas, so sod it, I'm into this, I'm writing about it. Anyway - if you look at PBA Bowling 2026 from a few steps back, I'd say what you'll get out of it is a sports game that somewhat looks and feels like it dropped out of a past era - something that might've shipped in the 360/PS3/Wii era, when things like pro darts and bowling were getting games more regularly.</p>



<p>There's some character models of the world's most famous pro bowlers that have that proper 360-generation uncanny valley going on, for sure. There's a ropey but ambitious character creator, and some astonishingly cheap-looking menus. But, honestly, none of that really matters: it's what's under the hood that drives the game. If you know the mechanics of the sport and understand what you're looking at, what's under the hood is immediately impressive for a game of this size.</p><p>In this sense, I can say that PBA Pro Bowling 2026 isn't suffering the same problem as <em>actual</em> bowling, where dubious corporations buy out bowling centres, fill them full of disco lights, ticket redemption arcade games, and karaoke booths - all style - but then allow the actual bowling lanes to go to rack and ruin. No substance. PBA Pro Bowling 2026 is the opposite, in video game form. It isn't the most stylish thing - but it is substantive.</p>
<p>If you don't know about the ins-and-outs of bowling, well… it's more than just a load of balls. There <em>are</em> a load of balls, obviously - the game's pro shop has over a hundred, each with their own unique look, style, and properties. The ball material, its weight, the surface finish, the shape of the core inside of it - all of these things have an impact on the ball physics in real life, and therefore do also in the game's simulation. I was quite impressed that I was able to find all but one of the balls in my current real-life arsenal in-game, and found that they all broadly performed exactly as I'd expect them to from my real life experience.</p>
<p>Away from the realm of balls, though, there's more. Bowling lanes are lined with oil, in  recognisable patterns, where the oil on certain areas of the lane will be thicker than in others, and then eventually peter out entirely. In pro bowling, oil patterns are literally <em>named</em> - so a pro will know the difference between a 'Badger' and a 'Scorpion', or what have you. The lay of the oil impacts how the ball travels down the lane, most prominently on the 'breakpoint' - the spot down-lane where the ball transitions from skating on the oil to spending its traction on bare wood to hook. That's how pro bowlers get those crazy hooking and spinning balls - they know what they're looking at.</p>

</figure>
<p>But there's more to it than that! Oil is obviously not permanent, so as you bowl the balls will physically move the oil around the lane - the pattern which was pristine on frame one will 'break down' over the course of games. In a three-game series, the lane might be a total difficult pig with nightmarish ball control by the third game.</p><p>All of this is simulated to an alarmingly good degree in this latest PBA title, which boasts a new engine over the previous edition, which shipped four years ago. You can of course press a button here and do something impossible in real life - visualise the position of the oil as it shifts in a heatmap down-lane. Fold in an overhauled pin physics simulation too (this seems a touch lively, if you ask me) and what you have is a painstakingly realistic-feeling title. "This is no arcade game", PBA 2026's Steam listing states. And that much is true. If <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> is Mario Kart, then yes, this is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a>. On a shoestring.</p>
<p>The simulation is deep, but the relative simplicity of the sport is represented in simple back-and-forth stick controls for bowling approach, swing, and spin - much like the up-and-down control you see in a lot of golf games. It works well. Finding the right 'line' and then racking up a bunch of easy strikes doesn't feel as satisfying here as doing it in real life, sure - but it definitely evokes that moment.</p>
<p>That simulation is the core of the package, but obviously there's a good amount of ways in which that setup is then used. There's quick play features, online play, a career mode, and a surprising amount of twists on the sport available.</p>



<p>I imagine most people will spend the lion's share of their time in the career mode. This is delightful in its stripped-back simplicity. From a very basic menu you select matches across 'tiers'. The first tier is your local leagues in your created character's home town; as you advance through the tiers, you're eventually playing the pros on the national stage. (Yes, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKQOXYB2cd8">"Who do you think you are, I am?!"</a> bloke is in the game.) Between matches you unlock new tiers of gear - clothing and balls - and can gradually build out your look and load-out with the cash you earn.</p><p>The matches you'll be selecting from across the career aren't just basic bowling matches, either. There's one-on-ones, team-based matchups, and 'ladder' tournaments. Once you get sponsored by one of the brands, you'll represent that brand in 'Battle of the Brands' events. All of these things are staples of the real-life PBA tour.</p>
<p>There are some zanier things, of course. I love a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g-7JjTGbJk">Strike Derby</a> - a format that is about speed <em>and</em> skill. In two minutes you have to score as many strikes as possible. If your rack gets headed with a golden pin, which happens at random, a strike is worth two. That's in. There are spare pickup challenges, where you face off against another pro attempting to nail spares that gradually increase in difficulty, right up to the famed 7-10. And there's duck-pin and candlepin/stick bowling, offering a totally different distraction to the main sport.</p>

<p>The career mode does its best to lightly teach you the core concepts of bowling - but it also seems to be quite knowing that its core audience is probably people who have at least a basic handle on its concepts, if not from playing then from watching televised competition. The career mode is also forgiving in that it doesn't have an ever-marching calendar. It's an escalating series of challenges arranged across an expanding map of the US - so if you fail an event, you can simply keep trying until you nail it.</p><p>The simulation combines with the ambition, for me, to just make something very loveable. They didn't really <em>need</em> to make thirteen different venues, some of which are 1:1 recreations of real life centres, but they did. Other times, shortcomings frustrate. Some of my favourite pros are women, and you can create a woman for career mode - but not a single famed female bowler is represented in the game's 32-strong roster of pros.</p>
<p>The commentary is great, until you realise just how repetitive it can be, and find it lacks the nuance of real-life. These commentators know the result the second the ball leaves your digital hand, so there's none of the eager reaction to an unusual pinfall or what have you. Bowling commentary has a reputation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/q1oMKTP76us">for being gloriously memeable</a>, but that doesn't really exist here. The same is true of the crowds, who cycle through the same "Whoaaaa…!" noise of excitement as the ball slams into the pocket way too much. Again, I'm reminded a bit of older sports games of past generations here - but to be fair, there's no EAFC, Madden, or even MLB-level funding here. What is here works - and there's plenty of room for future entries to improve.</p>
<p>Being honest, it does all feel quite cheap and of a bygone era. But it's also earnest and lovely. One also has to be realistic - this is a video game simulation of a sport that is in and of itself struggling, with leagues shrinking and centres forgoing regular custom to chase once-a-year visitors who buy a lot of drinks. Thereby this game's audience is limited, and so its budget must also be limited. I think what has been accomplished with that budget is quite impressive - and certainly full of a glowing love for this unique little sport.</p>

            <h2>20th December</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing. This week Bertie swears he didn't touch the pills, Kelsey screams (or is that a laugh?), and Tom goes up North.</p>
<h2>Sektori, PC</h2>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Sektori - Official Launch Trailer" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcTAuqglcBo?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>'It's like Geometry Wars on pills' was the first thought that came to my head, not that I'd know what that's like of course. But the Geometry Wars similarities are massive and immediate: fly a little ship around with the left thumbstick and shoot with the right stick, and survive huge, screen-filling, kaleidoscopic waves of enemies in contained areas while a soundtrack thumps like a heartbeat in your ears. Yes please; I've missed you Geometry Wars.</p>
<p>But there's more here, too. There are layers of nuance. There's strategy in how to spend the upgrade points you collect as you play, and levels break apart and reform around you, dynamically creating pockets of safety and danger, with teleports linking them. There's a powerful dash ability to factor in, and ways to chain it, and there are boss battles separating arenas of play. Like Geometry Wars, then, but also uniquely itself. Here, even the menus pulse to the beat. Sektori is irresistible.</p>
<p><em>-Bertie</em></p>
<h2>Advent calendar - cardboard, pen and paper</h2>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Remember last year when my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-advent-calendars-tricksy-trials-and-ages-of-dragons">husband surprised me with an escape room advent calendar</a>? Well, I loved it so much, this year he did it again. This time, I am trying to escape a very raucous penguin party in the South Pole. You see, this pesky lot has plundered my supplies and commandeered my patrol boat, which is all very inconvenient as I am sure you can imagine.</p><p>This advent calendar is a tad harder than last year's, and includes some red herrings which, if you fall for them, lead you to the wrong door and a penalty point. So far, I have got two penalties (damn, that's annoying!). Just kidding, they are all part of the fun, and I am loving my evening ritual of tearing off doors to then fold/glue/manipulate/turn them into a different shape or angle so I can continue making my way to freedom.</p>
<p>How will I finally escape from these partying penguins? There isn't <em>too </em>much longer to find out… assuming I don't get too many more penalties.</p>
<p><em>-Victoria</em></p>
<h2>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Switch 2</h2>
<p>I'm in full preparation mode for the update coming in January. After restarting my island, I have a blank canvas to do what I want with. The problem is, I'm not entirely sure what I want to do with it now. I was sure I had an idea. But now, as I clear trees and move villagers in to reach a 5-Star Island, the possibilities are endless - and that excites me.</p><p>Also, it's just started snowing properly on my island and my annual 'how bad will be my next Snowboy creation' season has begun. I know you get rewarded for making the perfect one, but I've always found the imperfect creations a more entertaining use of my time.</p>
<p><em>-Marie</em></p>
<h2>Thank Goodness You're Here!, PS5</h2>
<p>I finally played this bizarre, funny slice of English life, and so far it's living up to my expectations. I'm deliberately taking my time as I fear it's going to be over in a flash and I really want to make sure I don't miss any little jokes.</p>
<p><em>-Tom</em></p>
<h2>Species Unknown, PC</h2>
<p>It's been a while since I've played a co-op horror game (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> and 6 don't count as far as I'm concerned), so when my friend suggested we try the early-access title, Species Unknown, I was eager to dive in. This four-player sci-fi horror game tasks you with going on different excursions across abandoned spaceships, where you must race to complete an objective without becoming alien food.</p><p>While the premise is nothing new, Species Unknown has a surprising amount of detail packed into its £8.50 package. It looks great, you've fully customisable characters, and you've a level of autonomy about which objective you wish to complete next. Whether that's capturing a 'specimen' or killing them, or destroying the ship they've made their home. These specimens pose different threats, have different bounties, and some of them look deceptively adorable, and what ensues as a result of this is hilarious co-op fun that will make you belly-laugh just as much as it makes you squirm.</p>
<p><em>-Kelsey</em></p>
<h2>Umamusame: Pretty Derby, PC</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>December has sadly been a little rough in the Makar household, and as such I've fallen back into bad habits. This includes ordering a little too much takeaway, drinking a little too much mulled wine, and spending a little too much playing Umamusame: Pretty Derby.</p><p>This TGA 2025 award winner still has its hooks in me, I fear. There isn't really a modern game like it. The only problem is, I can't play it on my phone. I just can't. The only phone games I play, I play at the gym. If anyone at the gym saw me playing Umamusame: Pretty Derby I would throw the dumbbells at a perfect vertical angle and close my eyes.</p>
<p>Mihono Bourbon remains my favourite - she's not especially great but I got her in the early days of the Western PC release and therefore I'm ride or die. I'll play it until New Years and then I'll sort my life out, promise.</p>
<p>-Connor</p>
<h2>Dispatch, PS5</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>AdHoc Studio</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Do you play games with your significant other? I don't. We both love video games but I fear my competitive spirit gets in the way; plus our tastes tend to differ (and he loves to troll me). Dispatch, though, has brought us together on the sofa to enjoy a game a bit like a TV show. That's down to its episodic nature, of course, but considering neither of us are particularly into superhero stuff, the hilarious writing has drawn us both in. The developers aren't afraid to "go there" - I mean, they swing in right at the start, if you know what I mean - and the actual dispatching minigame is surprisingly fun. I'm late to the party, but I can see why this is in Game of the Year contention.</p>
<p><em>-Ed </em></p>
<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Mega Dimension DLC, Switch 2</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>The Pokémon Company</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I've played a few hours of this, and regret to inform you that so far I absolutely hate it. It's as funny as ever, which is great. The characters are as goofy and out-of-pocket, the Pokémon battles are still oddly alluring despite their chaotic awkwardness, and I'm still fond of Lumiose City as a more focused setting. Unfortunately though you don't get to spend much time in Lumiose itself because you're off in the mega dimension, grinding and grinding and grinding away at incredibly naff, time-limited tasks which give you resources you can spend on items that allow you to continue grinding naff tasks for resources... eugh. I should've finished this by now and had something written on the site, but this is one of those where I'm finding it such a drudge to get through that it's taking a bit too long. I hear it gets good though! Just many, many more floating Poké Balls to smash and I'll be there soon... (TCG Pocket is still great though, at least. Mega Charizard!)</p>
<p><em>-Taps</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are reading this (well done!), come back on Christmas Day for a special festive edition of What we've been playing - the perfect excuse to spend an hour staring at a computer screen on Christmas morning instead of watching Frozen again.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> fans are concerned Jonathan Bailey, this year's People's Sexiest Man Alive, may have been recast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s MMORPG - or at least has recorded under unfavourable conditions.</p>
<p>Bailey has voiced fan-favourite cat boy G'raha Tia since the Stormblood expansion, released in 2017. But this was before he starred in the likes of Bridgerton, Wicked, and Jurassic World Rebirth, from which his fame has risen considerably.</p>
<p>This week, the 7.4 update was released for Final Fantasy 14, bringing an extension to the story and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-morello-final-fantasy-14-interview-everything-burns">new song from Rage Against The Machine's Tom Morello</a>. Yet fans have noticed G'raha Tia's voice sounds a little off.</p>

<p>"It also feels like they're minimising his speaking - he had a total of two lines in the first two quests, and at one point just emoted a thumbs up," the post reads. "He felt conspicuously silent for G'raha, someone who is way too sentimental to barely say anything at a goodbye."</p>
<p>The poster later added they think it is still Bailey, but a combination of hoarse throat and a subpar microphone "adds some gruffness to his voice".</p>
<p>Fans have also been sharing comparison videos on social media, to highlight the differences in the voice work.</p>

<p>In an interview with BAFTA last year, Bailey recognised Final Fantasy 14 alongside his other voice work, and how important the character is to the fanbase.</p>
<p>"I'm aware of how important this character is to so many people," he said. "I was so determined to not step away from this character, that when I was doing Company [in the West End in 2018] I had to record this in the day for about a week doing eight shows a night and my tongue inflamed. So I think, any die-hard fans out there, there's a few hours of playing where I sound a bit lispy, that's because of that. So I apologise."</p>

<p>As such, fans hope he is still working on the game, despite the apparent changes in quality.</p>
<p>That said, a representative for Bailey told <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-jonathan-bailey-graha-tia-voice-recast-2000654279">Kotaku</a> he "won't be commenting or participating in any interviews regarding Final Fantasy 14" at this time. Square Enix has not responded to Eurogamer's request for comment.</p>
<p>What is clear is the size of the role of G'raha Tia has certainly reduced since the highs of Shadowbringers, though whether that's due to Bailey or simply storytelling is unknown. Indeed, one criticism of latest expansion Dawntrail is that multiple popular characters don't receive enough screen time.</p>
<p>"With regards to the Scions playing a more active role only later on in the story, truth be told this is something I intentionally wanted to try out," director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Naoki Yoshida told me last year</a>.</p>
<p>"I do understand there are people who always want the Scions to be at the centre of the story, but at the same time there are people who are also requesting something new instead. So it was a conscious effort on my part to experiment and see how the balance would play out."</p>
<p>It remains to be seen, then, whether G'raha Tia or other popular characters could be written out of the game in future. No doubt we'll get answers at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-dates-announced-so-when-is-the-next-expansion-due">Fan Fest events next year</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Mintrocket has revealed more on the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> DLC In The Jungle in its latest vlog, including new locations, gameplay, and mechanics.</p>
<p>The DLC was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-in-the-jungle-announced">first teased at last year's The Game Awards</a> show, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements">back in June it was delayed until 2026</a>. It's still without a firm release date, but we now know more about what's included in its 10 hour runtime.</p>
<p>First up is the jungle village of Utara. Here, time flows in real-time, and Dave can spend time befriending villagers, gathering resources, and completing quests, all presented in an isometric view. It all sounds very Animal Crossing.</p>

<p>That view also lends itself to the new restaurant, the Bancho Grill. Rather than the fixed horizontal movement of the base game, Dave will be able to freely manoeuvre around this restaurant, with befriended villagers rocking up to eat.</p>
<p>And it's a grill rather than a sushi restaurant this time, as freshwater lake aquatic life requires cooking before eating.</p>
<p>As for the lake, expect plenty of dangers like piranhas and crocodiles, as well as tasty fish. Dave will be equipped with a new Jungle Gun that can freely transform between net guns, shotguns, snipers, and more, which should make underwater combat a little more flexible.</p>

<p>In all, it's looking like a substantial extension of the base game that sees Mintrocket experimenting with gameplay and minigames alike.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver is also heading to mobile devices next year, launching first in China and then globally. It will be fully optimised for the platform, with appropriate controls too.</p>
<p>It follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-finally-arrives-on-xbox-series-xs-two-years-after-making-a-splash-on-pc">release of the game on Xbox last month</a>, announced at the Xbox Partner Preview, meaning the game is now available across PC (Steam, Epic), PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch consoles.</p>

            <p>Ever since lead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette went on the record as saying "we definitely cut some sex scenes"</a> and teased that we may "get to see those one day", the game's fanbase has held its breath in bated anticipation. But it's not happening.</p>
<p>I spoke to Shorette and Dispatch game director Nick Herman recently and they told me that while there were once plans for a sex scene involving your chosen love interest in the game, the actual scenes themselves "never tangibly existed". As in, there's nothing to reinstate.</p>
<p>"Let's curb this here, Pierre," said Herman.</p>
<p>Shorette nodded as if in agreement, then said: "The reality is we're definitely going to put those sex scenes in."</p>
<p>"God damnit," said Herman in response.</p>
<p>Shorette laughed; if it wasn't clear, that was a joke.</p>

<p>The duo explained that the problem arose when people found code in Dispatch for an event the team didn't build out. "They could see that we had booleans for 'if someone was going to spend the night' or 'which love interest was going to spend the night'," Herman said. The love interests in the game being Blonde Blazer and Invisigal.</p><p>Shorette continued: "So after the party, that was the point in the story where that would happen." The party occurs in Episode 6, so relatively near the end of the eight-episode season, and it's a wonderful scene - one of my favourites in the game.</p>
<p>It raises the question of why the studio decided against developing the sex scenes any further, and the answer is much simpler than you might think: "Money," Herman and Shorette said almost at exactly the same time.</p>
<p>"It was just money," Herman went on. "That whole scene was like double or triple the length; the whole party was almost an entire episode at Robert's apartment. And scoping: we probably pulled like 80 pages out of this game. It was a lot of writing that had to get cut to be condensed down into something that we could produce.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We probably pulled like 80 pages out of this game"</em></blockquote>
<p>"So just to say it: those scenes were never storyboarded. They didn't go into animation. So people say 'release them': they never tangibly existed."</p>
<p>"Everything that got made, shipped," Shorette added. "We wanted to put it in, we just ran out of money is what it really came down to. So you can blame the video game industry, not us. If people believed in us, we could have made it."</p>

<p>Shorette was referring to the several years of rejection Dispatch faced as AdHoc pitched the game to publishers and tried to get it to release - a twisting, turning saga I've written about in more detail in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a>. Now, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone">the game is a big success, having sold 2m copies and counting</a>.</p><p>A limited budget meant Dispatch also couldn't deliver the breadth of choice some players wanted as far as romance options were concerned. You can't, for example, pursue a romance with any of the characters in the Z-team you lead, which is probably a good thing as far as HR is concerned.</p>
<p>It was while talking about a possible sequel and the expectations players will have for it, and for the characters in it, that Shorette said: "And want to have sex with."</p>
<p>"Good lord," said Herman again in response.</p>
<p>"We should put out a-" Shorette said, before being interrupted by Herman, who added: "-place where everyone can just have sex with everyone."</p>
<p>Shorette continued: "We'll make a Date Everything. But it has to be non-canon because it's so messy - that's the problem. You can't have a Date Everything because we have to take those seriously as relationships, not just treat this as like some fuck party.</p><p>"When you look at the relationships that we had, they're very specific and important to the story in terms of the type of characters they are. Robert is a guy that on the one hand has it together and can be supportive to someone like [Invisigal], but then also needs fucking help, you know? Which is perfect for Blazer.</p>
<p>"Malevola," he added, referencing the tall and muscled red demon woman who wears a tight top and tight denim shorts: "if we threw Malevola in there, everyone would just fuck Malevola. Demon Cindy Crawford. Muscle Mommy. It would be easy mode."</p>
<p>The success and general applause for Dispatch - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">former Witcher 3 developer Konrad Tomaszkiewicz said Dispatch was his game of the year</a> - have meant people are now clamouring for a second season of the game. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">it sounds very much like a Dispatch Season 2 will happen</a>. However, with success comes expectation and, as Shorette said, "A lot of pressure. It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>

            <p>The oft-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> is now being planned for a release in several years time, with the latest date simply being "2028".</p>
<p>Ark 2 was announced all the way back in 2020, with a rather unexpected trailer featuring Vin Diesel of The Fast and The Furious fame. So, five years later, and we still don't have a firmer release date beyond that <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">newly-announced 2028 window</a>.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, developer Studio Wildcard said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">Ark 2 had been delayed until the "end of 2024"</a>, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-survival-evolved-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-with-vin-diesel-coming-2023">once been planned for a 2023 release</a>. It has kept pretty quiet on any actual release date at all since then, though.</p>
<p>As Matt reported last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-scene-setter-and-anime-crossover-expansion-comes-to-ark-survival-ascended-this-december">the upcoming sequel didn't feature in the Ark content roadmap released earlier in the year</a>, which led many to speculate it won't arrive until sometime after December 2026. They were right!</p>
<p>As well as starring in Ark 2, Diesel is also serving as the executive producer on the project, bringing his game development skills to the test. Previous reports said that Diesel has played over 1,000 hours of the original game. Also, did you know his real name is actually Mark Sinclair?!</p>
<p>"Survive the past. Tame the future," reads Ark 2's official blurb. "Suddenly awakened on a primal world filled with dinosaurs and humans struggling for dominance, you must team-up with legendary heroes to confront powerful dark forces.</p>
<p>"Saddle up, and join the definitive next-gen survival experience with Ark 2!"</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Ark-related news, back in the summer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for Survival Evolved came under fire after it released a trailer that was clearly made using AI</a>. The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured footage such as a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team.</p>

            <p>Sony and Honda have announced its new car will include PlayStation Remote Play, so passengers can stream PS4 and PS5 games on the go.</p>
<p>The Afeela 1 will be the first car from the joint venture Sony Honda Mobility, established in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. The car will be available in California first in 2026.</p>
<p>PlayStation Remote Play will be integrated into the Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system, so you'll need a PS4 or PS5 console at home to make use of the feature.</p>
<p>The vehicles will also feature an integrated display and premium audio system with which to play games. Presumably, you'll need to take your PlayStation controller with you on the road.</p>
<p>Note this use of Remote Play is separate to streaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus games</a> via the cloud.</p>
<p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Izumi Kawanishi, representative director, president and COO, Sony Honda Mobility Inc.</p>
<p>"Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p>
<p>This is by no means the first time we've seen in-vehicle gaming. Back in 2022,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/casual-games-will-be-playable-on-a-bmw-next-year"> BMW announced it would begin offering casual gaming in its cars</a>, controlled using smartphones.</p>
<p>That same year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-rolling-out-steam-integration-in-cars">Tesla announced in-vehicle Steam integration</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tesla-pulls-steam-from-new-vehicles-as-its-new-gaming-computer-is-no-longer-capable-of-playing-steam-games">18 months later it was dropped</a>.</p>

            <p>Marathon art director and veteran Bungie developer Joseph Cross has announced his departure from the company, mere months ahead of the extraction shooter's release in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-joseph-cross-stepped-down-marathon-franchise-art-director/">First spotted by The Game Post</a>, Cross updated his LinkedIn profile and social media profiles to indicate the end of his 14-year-run at the renowned sci-fi FPS studio. He later announced the news on X with a farewell statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/josephacross/status/2001888322071990744">Cross wrote</a>: "I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon. Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you. Massive thank you to everyone who has supported through all of it."</p>

<figcaption>Here's the new Vision of Marathon developer deep dive.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>This sudden change in artistic leadership follows a plagiarism scandal that rocked Marathon, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">it was discovered the extraction shooter used artist Antireal's work without permission</a>. Earlier this month, Antireal stated the situation had been resolved: "to my satisfaction".</p>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">Ethan Gach at Kotaku contacted Cross</a> to ask if his leaving Bungie was of his own volition, or a consequence of said plagiarism scandal. Cross responded, stating it was his own choice, as well as: "I'm super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years."</p>
<p>This comes shortly after a fresh gameplay deep dive from Bungie on Marathon, which showcased a gigantic overhaul of the title. It now has a solo queue, proximity chat, more challenging PvE UESC enemies, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/TauCetiGG/status/2001727624096424106">The tagline for the game has also seemingly been changed</a>. Previously, Marathon's tagline was: "Escape will make me God", though now it appears to be "Death is the first step". Why this has changed has not been explained officially, but it's worth noting that after the plagiarism scandal a popular joke of sorts emerged online, with the game's detractors posting: "Plagiarism will make me God".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">Marathon is set to release in March 2026</a>, with all eyes fixed on whether Bungie can turn the public reception of the game around and pull a big success out of the hat after a rocky start.</p>

Weaver will play a character called Wallace on the show's release, and earlier this month stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>.</p><p>Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing -  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken, meanwhile, will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>Filming is expected to kick off early next year, on 19th January.</p>

<p>As well as Amazon's show, the game side of the business is currently collaborating with Crystal Dynamics on an all-new Tomb Raider known as Catalyst. Revealed at The Game Awards last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Tomb Raider: Catalyst sends Lara to Northern India</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">takes place some time after series entry Underworld</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-newest-lara-croft-is-frightened-about-losing-the-role-after-being-absolutely-blindsided-by-perfect-dark-cancellation">Alix Wilton Regan will portray Lara in both Catalyst and next year's Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>, which is a remake of the first game.</p>

            <p>Season's greetings, everyone. It is my sad duty to inform you all that this week is Ed Nightingale's last at Eurogamer.</p>
<p>Ed began his journey at Eurogamer back in 2021, and quickly found a home on the site as a newshound: sniffing out angles and stories that fit the homepage, the audience, and his own personal tastes. A fiend for Japanese role-playing games, Soulslikes, and all things Sonic, Ed rapidly adapted to life at Eurogamer, and rose through the ranks to become deputy news editor in record time.</p>
<p>But Ed's talents go further than just finding quick-fire news stories and moving the conversation on with unique quotes: some of the site's most notable long-reads in recent years were penned by Ed, from deep dives into<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question"> the lifecycle of free-to-play games</a> to thoughtful essays on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">the existential threats posed to the voice acting community in the wake of AI</a>, Ed can turn his hand to any of the major topics that affect games, and the people that play them, in an increasingly complicated industry. It's hard to look down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/authors/ed-nightingale">Ed's byline</a> and choose the cream of the crop, so I've let recency bias do its job in this article: you ought to take a scan for yourselves, though, to see just how much of an impression Ed makes each and every day.</p>
<p>Ed's passion for games and his sharp eye for industry trends will serve him well on the next leg of his journey through the industry. I already look forward to seeing how he will work with other teams to extol the merits of video games in his future roles. I know that he'll be as successful elsewhere as he was at Eurogamer.</p><p>I have only had the pleasure of working with Ed since I joined the site in the summer, but even in these few months I can see how influential a presence he is, and how he is respected by the team - and the industry at large. I have learned a lot from his devotion to how news works at Eurogamer from his patience and razor-sharp eye (I will internalise 'percent' versus '%' one day, I promise!), and hope that he never has to think about 'curly quotes' again once he files his last story.</p>
<p>Please join me in saying farewell and good luck to Ed, and wishing him a belter 2026 in his new role. I'll leave you with a few words from the man himself:</p>
<p><em>Thanks for having me, Eurogamer! Working here has been a dream come true for me, after reading the site for so long. I'm really proud of the work I've achieved over the past four years, from meeting some of my heroes, to the longread features on big topics, to the countless stories on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Final Fantasy. A massive thanks to everyone I've worked with during my time here, for all your support, edits, and encouragement; but a special thanks to Donlan for offering me my first freelance opportunity before I joined properly, without which I probably wouldn't have made it as far as I have. I'm looking forward to seeing what the team gets up to in future and appreciating the site once again as a fellow reader. In the words of Sonic: "I'm outta here!"</em></p>

            <p>Larian is set to host an AMA in the new year to follow-up on its use of generative AI, following a huge backlash earlier this week.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies" and the company's successes "come from empowering people to work in their own way".</p>
<p>It follows backlash against the company after Vincke told Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">the studio is using generative AI</a>, but its newly-revealed Divinity game won't include anything AI-generated.</p>

<p>"Holy **** guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Vincke responded on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the studio uses "AI tools to explore references", and its developers are hired for "their talent" and "not for their ability to do what a machine suggests".</p>
<p>Still, the debate around using generative AI has erupted in the wake of Vincke's statements, so much so the company will now provide an opportunity for fans to ask further questions in the new year.</p>
<p>"It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation," wrote Vincke last night on social media.</p>

<p>"Larian's DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill and craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make.</p>
<p>"In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes.</p>
<p>"To give you more insight, we'll do an AMA featuring our different departments after the holiday break, in which you'll get the opportunity to ask us any questions you have about Divinity and our dev process directly.</p>
<p>"We'll announce the date in the new year. In the meantime, I wish you all happy holidays!"</p>
<p>Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">revealed Divinity at last week's The Game Awards</a>, which will follow the phenomenal success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. Vincke has since declared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">Divinity will be "us unleashed"</a> and confirmed it will be a turn-based RPG.</p>

<p>Following the publishing of Bloomberg's article, <a href="https://x.com/RiotMeddler/status/2001780724853276988">Riot Games released a snippet of an upcoming Dev Update</a> as well as a brief overview of what would be changing. It did so, according to head of League studio Andrei van Roon as: "early speculation was making the rounds."</p>

<p>This video confirmed that League of Legend's vast update will include a refresh to the game's dated PC client, a full visual overhaul to the Summoner's Rift game mode, gameplay changes tied to that overhaul, changes to Runes and pre-game systems, and an improved new player experience.</p>
<p>Andrei van Roon stated more details on this League of Legends renovation will come later in 2026 at some point between the MSI and Worlds competitive events, which take place in June and October respectively.</p>
<p>League of Legends has received its fair share of bold innovations recently, including a new thematic seasonal approach as well as controversial new WASD keyboard controls aimed at making the game easier to get into for new players.</p><p>

The game has been poised to change drastically for a few years now. Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-a-behemoth-sustained-by-a-determination-to-change">deputy editorial director Chris Tapsell returned to the game</a> in the midst of a substantial damage creep adjustment. He noted: "The state of League of Legends, midway through 2022, is that it is utterly gigantic. You've probably heard that many times before - but it's also gigantic in a way that feels unusually stable. For one, this is because LoL has achieved what seems to be the ultimate goal for many video games: to expand into things that are not video games."

            <p>A new report claims that The Last of Us and Uncharted studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> recently ordered its employees to take on "mandatory" overtime, often known as 'crunch',  in order to finalise a demo for its next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic">Bloomberg</a>, staff at Naughty Dog were asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week to get back on track after several missed deadlines, but no more than a total of 60 hours a week.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In addition to the extra hours, sources at Naughty Dog said developers were instructed to come into the office for five days a week. This was up from the previous three days a week office mandate. </p>
<p>A knock-on effect of this change left many employees needing to source extra child and pet care. According to the report, studio management has told employees its in-office mandate will return to three days a week for January. Sources added this period of additional mandatory overtime at Naughty Dog came to an end this week for many, having begun in late October, though some wonder if it will happen again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the demo for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which staff were crunching to finalise for parent company Sony, was apparently completed this week. Allegedly, Naughty Dog is aiming to release the game some time in mid-2027.</p>
<p>Neither Sony nor Naughty Dog has commented on the report's claims.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog was previously the subject of a damning report in 2020</a>, again regarding crunch at the studio. At this time, it was said development on its then-upcoming The Last of Us Part 2 resulted in burnout which caused several members of Naughty Dog's staff to leave.</p><p>In 2021, the studio's then co-presidents Evan Wells and Neil Druckmann addressed crunch at the studio. At this time, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2021/08/28/naughty-by-nature-naughty-dog-leadership-reflects-on-the-studios">Wells said</a>: "I have definitely personally worked very hard over the years. I think some of that has helped me get to where I am in my career."</p>
<p>Druckmann, who remains at the studio, added: "We're looking at quality of life for preventing burnout, to employ the brain power we have in our studio, and we started coming up with working groups to talk about the areas in the studio where we can improve… Everybody has a different definition of what crunch means. And I guess for us, we think of it as, how do we look out for the well-being of our colleagues and everyone that works at Naughty Dog, which is some combination of how many hours you work and how much stress you're feeling, whether that’s something that's going on in the office or at home.</p>
<p>"We find that there is no one solution that fits everybody. Everybody has a unique situation we might need to address."</p>

<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was first announced at the end of last year, with a trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">featuring a retro futuristic energy that introduced us to Tati Gabrielle's bounty hunter</a>, Jordan A Mun.</p>
<p>While we still don't know a huge amount about Naughty Dog's upcoming release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-hate-directed-at-the-last-of-us-part-2-naughty-dog-boss-says-next-game-about-the-entirely-uncontroversial-topics-of-faith-and-religion">Druckmann revealed in March that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophecy explores the topics of "faith and religion"</a>. It will also be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-expensive-game-says-neil-druckmann">studio's "most ambitious game" it's "ever made"</a>.</p>

            <p>When Microsoft decided to pull the plug on its Perfect Dark reboot earlier this year, we weren't the only ones to be taken by surprise, with Joanna Dark actress Alix Wilton Regan stating she was "absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded".</p>
<p>In fact, Wilton Regan - who has just been announced as the new Lara Croft - said when she was told the project was cancelled, she was "as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">adding she found out at the same time as the rest of us</a>.</p>

<p>"I did not see it coming," Wilton Regan told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/joanna-dark-perfect-dark-reboot-cancellation-details/">TheGamer</a>. "We were basically recording bits and bobs throughout '23. We were also doing lots of performance capture for it in '24, and we were even recording more stuff for it in '25. To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I'd done entire chapters of this universe."</p>
<p>According to the actress - who has also had roles in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Dragon Age and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name just three - the Perfect Dark reboot had "delivered several milestones that the client was really happy with", though she was unsure how far along The Initiative was in terms of the game's overall development.</p><p>"It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded," Wilton Regan continued. "There was an ecosystem of creativity and collaboration that was in place that we lost overnight. It was really difficult, really difficult for everybody."</p>
<p>For a little while after its cancellation, those close to the project hoped it may survive. Back in September, it was reported the reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two. Allegedly, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-almost-saved-by-rockstar-owner-take-two">plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself</a>. However, it did not.</p>
<p>"That was the day I was really sad because that was the day I lost hope," Wilton Regan said. "Initially, when it made it to the press that Perfect Dark was being defunded, a lot of people reached out for comments about it, both in the media, as well as personally, friends, and professionally, colleagues.</p>
<p>"I couldn't say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn't gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping."</p><p>Wilton Regan said Perfect Dark's shock cancellation was like nothing she had experienced in her career to date. "And I guess now that I know that it can happen, you become really frightened that the same thing could happen again," she admitted.</p>
<p>While losing the role of Joanna Dark was understandably devastating for Wilton Regan, the actress was able to move her focus to other projects, notably as Lara Croft in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>, which she called her "saving grace". But, there are clearly still some scars leftover from Perfect Dark's cancellation, and Wilton Regan admitted she is "frightened about losing Lara" like she lost Joanna.</p>
<p>"I was playing Joanna over here, and I was playing Lara over here, which was wonderful and genuinely one of the most creatively exciting times of my life," Wilton Regan closed. "And I just felt so relieved that I still had Lara, but I also felt really frightened about losing Lara. I'm still frightened of losing Lara." Let's all hope that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Wilton Regan is taking over the role of Lara Croft from Camilla Luddington, who played the globe-trotting Tomb Raider lead in the rebooted Survivor trilogy. Wilton Regan's first outing as Lara will arrive next year, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. She will then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">reprise the role in 2027's Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>, which will take Lara to Northern India.</p>
<p>Last weekend, Luddington <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">shared a farewell post to the character she had embodied for 10 years</a>, writing: "The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created."</p>
<p>For more from Wilton Regan, she recently spoke to our Ed about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">how AI is impacting the future of voice acting</a>.</p>

            <p>Acclaimed LGBTQ+ developer Robert Yang has released another explicit game, this time a commentary on fishing for dates.</p>
<p>Rainbows Are Carnivores is a gay fishing and "aquaculture romance" game, in which a hunky fisherman fishes for nude men in the sea. Or, as Yang puts it in the <a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2025/12/rainbows.html">game's accompanying blog</a>, it's a game about "using your pole to catch some high quality hogs". Hog, incidentally, is angler slang for a big fish.</p>
<p>Yang has released plenty of controversial games, but is perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robert-yangs-the-tearoom-appeals-to-censors-by-swapping-cocks-for-glocks">best known for The Tearoom</a>: a commentary on '60s sodomy laws and video game censorship, in which men stand at urinals with guns for penises, while avoiding undercover cops.</p>

<p>Rainbows Are Carnivores instead includes full frontal male nudity. It's a <a href="https://radiatoryang.itch.io/rainbows">free web-based game on itch.io</a>, with the "fisherman daddy" grading his catches until finding the perfect mate - though it doesn't quite work out how you might expect.</p>
<p>As well as a commentary on modern day dating, the game is a homoerotic play on male stereotypes, as well as criticism of overfishing. As Yang puts it: "There's never been fewer fish in the sea (so far)."</p>
<p>The game is also inspired by French film Stranger By The Lake (2013), which "artfully mixes sex and violence", explained Yang. Here, Yang portrays overfishing as its own type of violence.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a commentary on dating and romance in the app era," said Yang. "If we are the 'plenty of fish in the sea', we're also using technology to overfish ourselves - industrialising romance just like we've industrialised fishing, with diminishing returns. Dating pools enclosed by dating apps are like artificially abundant lakes where most relationships die off by the end of the season like farmed trout."</p>
<p>If you've ever attempted dating apps, you'll surely sympathise with that sentiment.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Yang announced his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-controversial-and-explicit-projects-robert-yangs-next-game-is-a-sportslike-rugby-turn-based-rpg">forthcoming sports RPG Tryhard</a>. Set in New Zealand, players will manage an underdog rugby club, combining management sim elements and turn-based gameplay. Presumably, there'll be some sex too owing to Yang's oeuvre, though Tryhard is looking decidedly tamer than his previous work.</p>

            <p>Falcom, creator of the Trails in the Sky and Y's series, has revealed during a recent shareholder presentation it has begun using AI during game development, stating they are proceeding "cautiously", but that it's been used in the early stages of development nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Umisuika/status/2001526978164539420#m">As reported by Umisuika on X</a>, attending the shareholders meeting in-person, a Falcom representative stated: "We are proceeding cautiously due to legal issues. We are using AI to brainstorm scenarios and do research. What used to take 2-3 hours can now be completed in 10 minutes. AI is also used to correct typos in the scenario."</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is a rough translation from Japanese to English using Google's in-built browser tools, and therefore the intricacies of this statement could be off. Even so, it is seemingly a confirmation that Falcom is integrating AI into its workflow.</p>

<p>It is no secret that Japanese video game companies have started embracing AI en masse. At Tokyo Game Show this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of polled developers acknowledged that AI has been used in game development</a>. Sega has stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">it'll start using AI "appropriately" in spite of pushback</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">Square Enix wants AI to do 70 percent of its QA by 2027</a>.</p><p>It is far from a topic isolated to Eastern game development though. Only this week, the CEO of Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">met firm backlash following an interview in which he revealed that AI was being used at his studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">acting unions continue to stand firm against the technology and the dangers it poses to the people they represent</a>.</p>

            <p>The first episode of Fallout's second season debuted yesterday, and within its hour or so run time solved one of the biggest cut content mysteries from New Vegas, which had been left unanswered for 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Fallout season two episode one below.</strong></p>

<p>Along with introducing some new faces, the second season of Fallout also reunites us with the likes of Lucy and The Ghoul, who left together at the end of season one on the trail of disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean. Hank, meanwhile, was last seen fleeing towards a ruined New Vegas in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour.</p>
<p>And, that brings us to the first episode of season two, with Lucy and The Ghoul following the bloody trail Hank has left in his wake. This includes a little stop off at Vault 24, a cut location from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. We only know about this place because players discovered a Vault 24 jumpsuit tucked away in New Vegas' game files, which could only be found using console commands</p><p>Now, as I am sure you are aware if you have read this far, many of the vaults in Fallout - both the show and the games - were set up to conduct experiments and such within. This has included the TV show's Vault 4, which experimented with mutants, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s Vault 63, which was set up by Vault-Tec's Hugo Stolz and his wife as a research facility for various technologies that would help with setting up post-War societies. There was also that poor chap that got put into Vault 77 totally on his own save for some puppets.</p>
<p>So, what was tucked away in Fallout: New Vegas' Vault 24? For a long time it seemed likely we would never know, but, thanks to Amazon's show, we now have an answer. And that answer is… communists! When Lucy and The Ghoul step into the vault, which is now derelict and covered in vegetation, they come across skeletons strapped down in front of a propaganda video, which when they were alive would have been brainwashing the poor chaps.</p>
<p>These aren't the only skeletons that were left to rot in the vault. Lucy and The Ghoul find many more strapped down within Vault 24, with pseudo-Soviet gear about the place. "These are Americans," Lucy realises, "and the Vault turned them into communists."</p>
<p>This seems like a pretty odd thing for the Vault-Tec heads to have done, but to be fair, when did they ever do anything that couldn't be labelled as pretty odd? (Again, that poor man with the puppets). On further exploration, Lucy and The Ghoul come across someone alive down there. A Wastelander with a chip in his head like the one House used at the start of the episode, which allowed him to control a goon's mind, is sitting strapped down and clearly not of sound mind.</p><p>This mind controlling chip is what Hank went into the vault to get a hold of, though it still needs some work to perfect, as so far the only people we have seen with the chips in their heads have not lived very long… that's probably a plot thread for another episode.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. After 15 years, we now know what's in Vault 24.</p>

<p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout is releasing on a weekly basis, with the final episode airing in February of next year.</p>
<p>The team is already hard at work on season three, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">with the next series being written as we speak</a>. Filming is then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">expected to begin in summer 2026</a>, Fallout series executive producer Jonathan Nolan said earlier this month.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was the best-selling premium game in November, beating out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, NBA 2K26, and other big hitters.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4njxoc2w">This data comes via Matt Piscatella</a>, senior director at sales data company Circana. Releasing the findings on social media, Piscatella highlighted Black Ops 7's strong performance in spite of the game's mixed reception from fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>By hitting the number one spot in November in terms of combined physical and digital sales, the series has earned the number one sales spot in its launch month for 18 years in a row. It is worth noting that the other games present in November's top five best-sellers had their own launches in prior months.</p>

<p>As for other games that launched in November, Kirby Air Riders landed at the number 10 spot, though digital sales were not factored in its placement. The same is true of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which secured a spot at number 11.  Interestingly enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> was the 18th best-selling game last month, over a decade since its initial release.</p><p>In spite of this relatively positive performance in its release month, Call of Duty as a franchise <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">will be undoing some significant changes as Black Ops 7 had "not met" expectations from fans</a>. Specifically, there will no longer be back-to-back Modern Warfare or Black Ops releases moving forward.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to try the game out yet,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review"> Eurogamer's Black Ops 7 review noted</a>: "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>

            <p>The next FIFA game will be exclusive to Netflix Games, and will arrive in time for next year's FIFA World Cup 2026. It will be the first official FIFA game in four years.</p>
<p>Netflix subscribers will be able to access the game on their TV, using a phone as a controller, and play either solo or with others online.</p>
<p>The game will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive - a studio yet to actually release a game, though its website states it's also working on 007 First Light with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>.</p>

<p>"The FIFA World Cup is going to be the cultural event of 2026, and now fans will be able to celebrate their fandom by bringing the game right into their living rooms," said Alain Tascan, president of games at Netflix. "We want to bring football back to its roots with something everyone can play with just the touch of a button."</p><p>Added FIFA president Gianni Infantino: "FIFA is very excited to team up with Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026. This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA's commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games. Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football. It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for FIFA."</p>
<p>Note that this World Cup game will be available on "select TVs in certain countries" (details on the <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197">Netflix site</a>), but there are plans to roll it out further over time.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">EA ditched the FIFA brand after almost 30 years of officially licensed games</a>. Since then, it's continued with its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-really-wants-you-to-know-it-listened-to-fan-feedback-in-creating-ea-sports-fc-26-as-gameplay-reveal-addresses-critics">EA Sports FC</a> series.</p>
<p>FIFA, by contrast, has floundered in attempting to maintain its brand within the games industry, with no new  games since 2022. Back in October it announced the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fifa-lives-on-in-a-mascot-focused-five-a-side-football-game-coming-next-year">mascot-focused game FIFA Heroes</a> (see video above), and now this World Cup game with Netflix.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Santa Ragione's Horses was the subject of multiple headlines ahead of its release as Steam - one of if not the biggest digital PC storefronts - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">refused to distribute the game</a>. Then, just before its release, it was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">banned from the Epic storefront</a>. This all put the studio into jeopardy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">with founder Pietro Righi Riva telling Eurogamer it could face closure if Horses didn't sell well</a>.</p>
<p>Horses has now been out for a couple of weeks, and there is finally some good news for Santa Ragione. The studio has announced its game, in which players tend to a farm of naked humans in horse masks, has sold over 18k copies. In terms of income, that is "approximately $65,000 in net revenue", Santa Ragione said. This means the studio has generated enough to repay the loans it took out in order to finish developing the game, as well as the royalties owed to Horses creator Andrea Lucco Borlera.</p>
<p>"We are extremely grateful to players and to everyone who supported the release by sharing the game and amplifying what happened around it. Paying our debts is a success, and we are relieved," the studio said.</p>

<p>However, while of course great news for the team, this still isn't enough to secure Santa Ragione's future, and the company has not yet made enough from Horses to begin working on a new game. "If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime," the studio explained today. "Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love."</p><p>So, while the debut of Horses has "been meaningful and positive in important ways", the fragmented road to release - which along with Steam's controversial ban has also included delays, and key team members taking on additional work elsewhere - has still been damaging for the studio.</p>
<p>"While the launch of Horses compares very favourably to our most recent launches on Steam, Steam's economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles," Santa Ragione said. "These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like."</p>

<p>Santa Ragione closed today's news by taking aim at Valve, which faced 'censorship' criticisms from developers and players following its decision to not distribute Horses on Steam. Santa Ragione is still unsure of the exact specific reason that Valve decided to eschew Horses.</p>
<p>"We want to emphasise that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce," Santa Ragione said.</p>
<p>"For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly.</p>
<p>"We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases."</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-cursed-horror-game-horses-in-which-you-tend-to-a-farm-of-naked-humans-in-horse-masks-hasnt-been-cancelled">though this was delayed into 2025</a>, before it finally released in November.</p>
<p>"Santa Ragione delivers a subversive, sometimes shocking, often funny first-person narrative horror that, while perhaps a little insubstantial, remains an engagingly unconventional exploration of some timely themes," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">Eurogamer's four star Horses review</a>.</p>

<p>With the dismissal with prejudice, the case is now closed and cannot be brought back to court.</p>
<p>While the store pages have been removed, the Light of Motriam website, Discord and social pages still exist, so it hasn't been entirely wiped from the internet. It suggests the game could still come back in some form, though presumably with major changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent first revealed Light of Motiram</a> in November last year, which immediately drew comparison to Sony's first-party Horizon franchise.</p>
<p>Then, in July this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony sued Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">Tencent retaliated by saying Sony's claims of originality were "startling"</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony shot back claiming the Chinese company's defence was "nonsense"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-alleged-horizon-rip-off-is-ironically-back-in-the-news-as-company-agrees-to-halt-promotion-amid-sony-lawsuit">Tencent agreed to halt all promotion and public testing</a> of the game as the two companies prepared for a court battle. Now that will no longer be necessary, owing to this confidential settlement.</p>

            <p>The Game Awards has broken its 2024 viewership record, bringing in roughly 171m livestream broadcasts earlier this month. This is an increase of 17m views compared to last year's show.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/game-awards-2025-viewing-record-livestreams-worldwide-1236611146/">Via a report by Variety</a>, this 11 percent rise in viewers does not take into account those checking out the show on Amazon Prime Video, which offered a platform for the awards show for the first time this year. What views can be measured stem from YouTube, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram Live, as well as regional streaming services in China and India.</p>
<p><a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/thegameawards">According to Streamcharts</a>, Western platforms saw a 9 percent increase from last year's show, to a peak concurrent figure of 4.4 million live viewers. This record breaking figure is reflected on platform-specific milestones too, with YouTube and Twitch seeing significant leaps from last year's viewership statistics.</p>

<p>Co-streaming also saw an increase on Twitch, with 16,500 streamers on the platform experiencing the show alongside their fans. This was an astounding 50 percent increase from last year's figure, further cementing the show as an annual keystone within the games industry.</p><p>To compare, The Oscars (which still remains a television broadcast due to a deal with ABC) <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/oscars-moving-to-youtube#:~:text=The%202025%20broadcast%20hit%20around,were%20before%20the%202020%20pandemic.">only had 19.7 million viewers this year</a>. With that show looking to jump to YouTube in 2029 when their current broadcasting deal expires, for now at least the event, which has clearly inspired The Game Awards to an extent, seems to have been overshadowed in terms of pure eyeballs-on-screen statistics. Cultural influence is of course a whole other discussion altogether.</p>
<p>Why does The Game Awards see increasing views year-on-year? Well, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">all the reveal trailers announced at The Game Awards</a> which continue to draw eyes even from those generally uninterested in the awards themselves. For those more invested, talk around an Expedition 33 sweep was a real discussion-driver, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">as the French RPG took home a whopping nine awards in total from the Peacock Theatre</a>.</p>

            <p>Fallout 5 will be canon to the events that happen in Amazon's TV adaptation of Bethesda's video games.</p>
<p>That's coming from the studio's very own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, who when asked directly if the Fallout TV series - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-gets-new-release-date-and-you-can-now-watch-it-imminently">which just started its second season over on Prime</a> - would have an impact on the next mainline game entry, replied: "In short, yes."</p>

<p>"Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening," <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">Howard told BBC Newsbeat</a> ahead of the second season's debut.</p>
<p>"We are taking that into account," the Bethesda executive affirmed.</p>
<p>We are still several years away from Fallout 5 actually materialising, though. Along with its post-apocalyptic franchise, the studio also has The Elder Scrolls series under its umbrella (Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, nearly forgot about that one!). Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 would be Bethesda's next game after The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, which still lacks any solid release window, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">though some fans think it is coming in 2027</a>. Even so, that is hardly imminent, though I am still alarmed by how fast the new year is actually approaching, which makes me feel like I'm turning into my mother because that's the sort of thing she always says.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">Howard said development on Elder Scrolls 6 is "progressing really well"</a>. He also admitted he wished things were progressing a bit quicker than they are, but it is a process the team all wants to get right, so fair enough.</p>
<p>As for Amazon's Fallout series, its second season is releasing on a weekly basis, with the final episode being aired in February of next year. The team is already hard at work on season three, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">with the next series being written as we speak</a>. Filming is then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">expected to begin in summer 2026</a>, Fallout series executive producer Jonathan Nolan said earlier this month.</p>

            <p>A new 2D competitive platformer has just been announced, and it's coming from the same team behind an indie darling from back in 2016. Almost a decade later, the creators of SpeedRunners are back with another speedy release: Sprint City.</p>
<p>Instead of being split across several different levels like SpeedRunners was, Sprint City takes place in one single shared world that seamlessly connects nearby players. While in a party, you and your gaggle of friends will stay connected as you explore and track down challenges to take on.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if one of your friends owns Sprint City, you can join their game via your internet browser of choice and jump in to play for free. The game itself will be available on Steam in 2026, though no exact release date nor price has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Game designer and co-owner at Second Stage Studio Casper van Est has stated: "With Sprint City, we wanted to focus on what we love most in games and what we're best at, which is pure movement. It's a shared world multiplayer experience built around how good it can feel just to move around, so we worked really hard on a satisfying game feel and a visual style that never gets in the way of that."</p><p>The original SpeedRunners also took a consumer-friendly approach to onboarding,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedrunners-will-be-free-upon-its-final-release"> initially offering the game for free on Steam</a> and only charging a premium price for those who wanted to play the game online. It proved exceptionally popular on Steam Early Access a decade or so ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedrunners-has-sold-600k-copies-on-steam-early-access">selling 600k copies in short order</a>.</p>

            <p>"I won't claim to be a gamer, but I was aware, broadly, of some of the concepts present in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>," Tom Morello - singer, songwriter and political activist, and Rage Against the Machine guitarist - tells me when I ask him if he was aware of the political themes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-preview">Final Fantasy 14</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-out-on-ps4-april-2014">Since its (re)release in 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">FF14</a> has tackled issues such as anti-colonialism, class struggle, and nationalism, extolling the virtues of active resistance, open rebellion, and pushing back against the established status quo in order to defend the rights and liberties of all people.</p>
<p>It makes sense, then, that Tom Morello is getting involved with the game. Morello has collected a lot of labels in his time - anarchist, warrior-poet, human rights activist - and to me it feels fitting he's penned a song that'll live in a world as politically dense as Final Fantasy 14. The track, with the rousing title Everything Burns, is a high-octane rock belter instantly recognisable to anyone that's even vaguely familair with Morello's music (and fitting for the increasingly rock-focused way FF14 has been moving over the past few years).</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to make songs for video games," he tells me."Like, that's not the thing that I get up in the morning and think. I want to be a part of making great songs that have meaningful content, that find their way into the world in meaningful ways. And in collaborating with Caleb and with the producer Tyler Smith, we made a song that checked all the boxes for me.</p><p>"One, it's a banger. It's got riffs like crazy. It's a compelling artistic work that we hope was going to integrate well into the compositions of Final Fantasy. But, two, to me, it has to exist outside the game, as well. It has to be a song that has sort of depth and meaning and meets the moment of 2025 at this crazy political crossroads that the world is in.</p>
<p>"For me, Everything Burns is both a reflection of the world that we're seeing and a warning, irrespective of anyone touching a controller, or a computer, or playing a game. This is a song that has a life - a very vibrant life - within the game. And my hope is that it has a very meaningful and vibrant life outside of the game as well."</p>

</figure>
<p>"I could not agree more," agrees Caleb Shomo, lead vocalist and studio instrumentalist for the band Beartooth. Previously in the interview, we'd chatted about how Rage Against the Machine's music had radicalised a whole swathe of youths in the 90s (myself included), and that now, by appearing in a game built around a loyal and vocal community like FF14, Morello and his collaborators have the opportunity to do that again for a wholly different audience. "Like yourself, obviously I was incredibly influenced in my life by Tom and what happens when you get obsessed with that band and what it teaches you, and who you become and what you stand for," Shomo continues.</p>
<p>"And to be able to work on a song like this with somebody like Tom… I think the nature of the beast is there's no way I'm going to be able to do that - to have it come from my heart - and not mean <em>something</em>.</p><p>"For me, I think I've kind of had a hard time in my life standing up for myself. And that has a lot of what this song has to do at this period of time. Because I think that can be the nature of the beast when a climate gets this gnarly. And obviously it has its twists and turns, sure, but that really is what this song to me is about: the song is about empowerment.  Like, to the absolute furthest degree. And for it to have come around in the way it has, with so much horsepower, between it being with Tom Morello and in it being in Final Fantasy 14, yeah, the nature of the beast was it was just going to mean <em>something</em>. It's from deep in the heart."</p>
<p>"And that's the trick, isn't it? I mean, the vehicle is important," Morello adds, "but Rage Against the Machine isn't a great <em>political band</em>. Rage Against the Machine is a<em> great band</em> that has <em>political </em>context. And so you are engaged with the music, the powerful music and the beats and the rhythm section and the aggression, the guitar solos, etc. And then you're forced to be confronted with a set of ideas, right? I've made 22 records and that's the through line: you have songs that are compelling and then because they're about something, it matters to people here. The vehicle is this banging track that we've made. The vehicle is Caleb's compelling vocal performance and the big guitar riffs. The vehicle is Final Fantasy 14, where it's a crossover of a song that meets a particular historical moment <em>outside </em>of the game, that also meets a particular narrative moment <em>within </em>the game."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The song actually came together really quickly. Morello plays tabletop role-playing games with Jason Charles Miller, who you may know as lead vocalist and guitarist of the industrial rock band Godhead and from various appearances on the FF14 Endwalker soundtrack, and he told Morello that Soken is a massive fan of Rage Against the Machine. "[Jason and I] played together, and he learned about Soken's love of my riffs and Rage Against the Machine, and it got in the ether. Then all of a sudden, I remember getting a message that there was the [FF14 team] needed a song in the next 36 hours. This is about a year ago, right? And so I was working with producer Tyler Smith - who produces a lot of great rock and metal songs these days - and I said, 'bro, like, let's go', and we turned around a musical track very fast."</p><p>Shomo was, fortunately, off that very same day. "Literally. That same day, I was off," he laughs. "And I just happened to get a phone call from Tyler Smith saying, 'hey, you want to do this song for Tom Morello?' And I was like, 'uh, yeah, I can be available' [laughter]. A few hours later, I don't know, man, I just kind of ascended to some ethereal plane, and then a few hours later, I was bouncing down tracks and sent it to Tyler. It was insane, to say the least."</p>
<p>Morello continues: "It was lightning in a bottle. Had the circumstance not arisen on that particular day, it might have gone in a very different direction."</p>
<p>For Masayoshi Soken, long-time Rage Against the Machine fan and lead composer for Final Fantasy 14, the experience has been humbling. "I'm pretty close to death right now," he laughs. "We've been doing a lot of interviews, and he has a different, cool Rage Against the Machine shirt every time we join a call," adds Morello.</p>
<p>It's clear to see, from listening to Everything Burns and talking to the collaborators for 20 minutes, this is more than just some thoughtless tie-in fired off for publicity. For everyone involved, this is a labour of love, and a collaboration that is designed to reflect both real-world and in-game sensibilities, from creators that do not compromise on their creative vision, no matter what the vehicle is for delivery. This is a crossover that makes more sense, the more I think about it, and I cannot wait to experience the full impact of the release in Final Fantasy 14's latest raid.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Arkane Studios' Harvey Smith has reflected on Microsoft's closure of the studio last year, describing it as "a shock" after its run of successes.</p>
<p>Smith was lead game designer on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> in 2000, before eventually joining Arkane in 2008. After working as co-creative director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>, he worked on its sequel, Prey, and the studio's final, ill-fated live-service game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/redfall">Redfall</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">studio was shut down by Microsoft in May last year</a>, following the poor sales of Redfall.</p>
<p>"Every company makes the decisions they make for the reason they make them," said Smith  on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/harvey-smith-game-director-deus-ex-dishonored-redfall">My Perfect Console podcast</a>. "I don't agree with them often, but the main shock there was this studio made Dishonored, along with the Lyon studio, and then they made Prey. Then we were working on Redfall for a number of years during the pandemic and everything else. The industry exploring games-as-a-service games... It is what it is. Creative efforts are unpredictable."</p>

<p>He continued: "It was a shock at first, but who I really felt for were the people who were new, this was their first project or they'd only been in the industry for a while."</p>
<p>Smith admitted his own privilege with the situation considering his years of experience and the ups and downs he's worked through, but lamented the loss of junior staff through studio closures and layoffs for whom developing the game was a "mind-blowing experience".</p>
<p>"It was a shock," he said. "It was not a decision I agreed with. I did believe very much in the future of the studio, we were working on something super cool."</p>
<p>At least, the studio was able to release its 1.4 update to Redfall after the announcement of its closure, what Smith described as a "huge upgrade to the game". "If we had launched with that and then built from there it might have been a different story," he said, adding the update allowed the team to get "as close as we could" to the vision of the game.</p>
<p>Smith also discussed the difficulties of receiving feedback from players online, which perhaps led to the downfall of Redfall and the studio - particularly the "vitriol" on social media.</p>
<p>"I feel like video game developers get it worse," he said, comparing the reaction to games to that of artists or musicians. "You release your game, it took years to get there, maybe it flops, maybe it does ok, maybe people hate it. Even if they love it, there's a social media caustic, acidic vitriol that gets thrown at you. And every time you ship a game there's always going to be that, every time there's that vitriol no matter what you do. Then you hope that the number of people who love it swamp that, overwhelm it."</p>
<p>Before Dishonored, Smith said he worked on a couple of games at Arkane that never saw the light of day. One of those was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> game, which certainly would've suited him well after Deus Ex.</p>
<p>"We were working for a while on a Blade Runner game, which was super exciting to me. What we could have done with Blade Runner…," he said, before tailing off. Alas, perhaps we'll never know.</p>
<p>After Redfall's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-apologises-for-redfalls-disastrous-launch-we-let-a-lot-of-people-down-this-week">Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer apologised for its disastrous launch</a>. "We let a lot of people down this week," he said.</p>
<p>"Arkane's vampire thriller is muddled and deeply compromised, but has moments of real charm," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-review-a-bit-of-a-mess-but-not-without-its-pleasures">Redfall review</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 17/12/25: </strong>AdHoc's superhero workplace comedy Dispatch has appeared rather unexpectedly on the Australian Nintendo eShop for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>According to the listings, Dispatch will be available on Switch consoles from 29th January, but can be pre-ordered now for $39.55 AUS.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>I have just checked the eShop here in the UK, and at the time of writing Dispatch is not appearing in any of the search results. Rather, the main result was for SnowRunner - Season 5: Build &amp; Dispatch. The second result was for a game that places you in the role of an airport dispatcher (see image below).</p>
<p>It's a different story over on the Australian site, though, which currently states the Switch 2 edition of AdHoc's acclaimed Dispatch will include "enhanced resolution and improved frame rates" on its release.</p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie recently sat down with AdHoc studio co-founders Nick Herman and Pierre Shorette to discuss the team's episodic superhero comedy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">which includes the story of a cut Dispatch Kpop character</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>Can there really be an ethical use of AI when it comes to actors in video games? Developers are increasingly experimenting with the technology, but what does that mean for the profession of voice acting?</p>
<p>Lobbying against the practice was certainly a key part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-approves-2025-video-game-agreement-officially-concluding-its-strike">SAG-AFTRA strike that finally concluded in the summer</a>, with the new contract ensuring "safety guardrails" around AI technology. Yet while this agreement is meant to protect the livelihoods of actors, AI remains in use to voice some video game characters. Just earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">Let it Die: Inferno developer Supertrick Games admitted generative AI had been used</a> for two character voices as a deliberate, creative choice. It claimed these voices "are not derived from or modeled after any human performers, ensuring no copyright concerns", though presumably these voices still came from somewhere.</p>
<p>The most high profile recent example was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, criticised in Eurogamer's review for its use of AI voices. Embark Studios has been open about its use of AI in game development, and its previous game The Finals also utilised AI voices. For Arc Raiders, human actors trained an AI text-to-speech tool utilised for incidental NPC dialogue (but not key story points). Those actors reportedly gave consent and were paid accordingly. But despite its ancillary usage, does this set a worrying precedent the rest of the industry could follow?</p>

</figure>
<p>I wanted to understand the varying perspectives on this controversial practice, to understand more about the financial and ethical concerns of AI usage. As such, I've spoken to unions, studios, and - of course - actors on how AI is impacting the future of voice acting.</p><p>But first, why did Embark Studios choose to use AI in the first place? The studio did not respond to Eurogamer's request for comment, but ahead of the release of Arc Raiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-no-shortcut-to-making-great-games-embark-studios-cco-responds-to-and-defends-ai-use-in-arc-raiders">CCO Stefan Strandberg previously explained to Eurogamer</a> how the studio intends to be on the "forefront of emerging technologies".</p>
<p>On text-to-speech, Strandberg discussed the use of real actors. "There's something special and dynamic about putting two people together that to me, being a sound designer originally, there's nothing that can replace that in my opinion," he said. "TTS allows us to increase the scope of the game in some areas where we think it's needed, or where there's tedious repetition, in situations where the voice actors may not see it as valuable work. So it's a wide umbrella, but the experience of the game doesn't use any generative AI."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Embark used AI for some NPC voicelines in Arc Raiders. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Embark</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The use of such technology has helped Embark Studios remain a lean team, and allowed them to quickly add or alter voice lines without the need to re-record. But as Strandberg surmised: "There are no shortcuts to making great games. You need so many things in place: a clear vision, a great culture, clear goals. The vision will inform how you get there."</p>
<p>Still, text-to-speech is a form of AI that may be based on human voices, but the final result is, arguably, not human, devoid of the nuance a human actor can provide through proper performance.</p>
<p>One general assumption is that the use of this sort of AI technology is cheaper than hiring voice actors for full voice work, allowing studios to save money. Yet voice actors are already severely underpaid for their work, and US actors' union SAG-AFTRA is fighting not only for better contracts but to ensure actors are equally remunerated when AI is involved.</p><p>The union's current standard rates, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-2028%20Interactive%20Media%20Agreement%20Wage%20Table.pdf">published publicly</a>, are $1,135 for an off-camera day performer of up to three voices, or $567.50 for one voice. Additional fees can be applied, including if a role requires full motion capture, plus some actors can of course negotiate higher fees - this is just a union recommended minimum.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, the union's national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland confirms SAG-AFTRA's agreement requires actors be paid on an equivalent basis for digitally replicated voices. What's more, the union specifically bargained over real-time generation of voices using digital replicas, resulting in a minimum negotiable rate of 750 percent of scale (that would be $8,512.50 based on the $1,135 fee). As such, AI voices are perhaps more likely to be implemented for creative reasons, or speed of development, rather than financial concerns.</p>
<p>"None of this can or should be done without the consent of the performer, and we've established that firmly in our collective bargaining agreements, and frankly, outside of our bargaining agreements," says Crabtree-Ireland. "We've been working hard to get that principle established in the law, so that even in non-union settings, that minimum standard is present."</p>
<blockquote>"None of this can or should be done without the consent of the performer."</blockquote>
<p>He continues: "Our long term goal is to make sure that there's a clear respect for people's right to control the use of their image, likeness and voice for purposes of any kind of replication, especially AI. And I think we will ultimately achieve that, notwithstanding the AI regulation skittishness that some governments have, because we're not talking about regulating AI. What we're talking about is giving people the right to control the use of their image, likeness and voice."</p><p>Here in the UK, actors' union Equity also has <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/advice-and-support/rates-and-agreements?categoryId=2462&amp;areaOfWorkId=2466&amp;productionTypeId=40018&amp;tabId=null">recommended rates</a>, though these are published only to members. "It's usually the case that games companies don't engage performers directly, but contract studios who own recording spaces and equipment, and who in turn engage performers," Equity audio official Shannon Sailing explains to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"As there are no union agreements with games companies (via studios) in the UK to set minimum standards for performance work in games, the rates vary across the board. This is wrong. It's the workers - including performers - who are at the heart of creating a game, and they deserve proper pay, terms and conditions set by a union agreement."</p>
<p>The use of AI "leads to a subpar experience for gamers," Sailing adds. "No machine can capture the authenticity or emotion of a human voice actor." Still, the union understands the use of this technology won't disappear anytime soon. As such, it urges for consent, transparency, and proper remuneration for actors.</p>
<blockquote>"No machine can capture the authenticity or emotion of a human voice actor."</blockquote>
<p>What, then, of recording studios? Is AI impacting their work?</p>
<p>"I think it would be very naïve to say that AI voice isn't going to have an impact on the amount of work available to actors, but studios big and small are faced with the same dilemma every year: do more with less," says Chris Donnelly, director of audio and datasets at <a href="https://side.inc/projects">Side UK</a> - the studio behind the award-winning voicework in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Still Wakes The Deep, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, and many more.</p><p>"As creatives, we have to ensure that the call for ethical practices, strong guardrails and robust legislation is heard, as well as the financial arguments. That means fair remuneration for the actors and full transparency of how the model will be used, delivering clear and practical benefits for game developers that result in high-quality performances that gamers rightfully expect."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Side is currently setting up a global committee to support client requests for AI content across its business, Donnelly explains, and the studio already has a "human in the loop" policy for any AI-related requests. "Our overall hope is that using these technologies in an ethical way, will mean that opportunities expand, adding additional depth and immersiveness to games on top of what might have been done historically," Donnelly says.</p>
<p>He admits the use of AI is "inevitable" to keep up with the demands of players for immersive experiences with thousands of realistic, dynamic NPCs, something that simply isn't possible to record using traditional methods. "Having said that," says Donnelly, "technological progress is complicated and for Side as an audio studio, we know that this is going to change the way we work. What I do feel absolutely certain of, is that AI voices or not, artists, actors and storytellers will all still be needed to make games happen."</p><p>While unions and studios are fighting for regulation and ethical practices, it's actors themselves who must suffer the human cost of increased AI voice usage. Ultimately, perhaps, it's down to them to choose whether or not to accept contracts with AI clauses included, though if the practice grows will they even have a choice?</p>
<p>"I see why devs and publishers are tempted by new models that let them change the scope of the narrative with a few keystrokes," says David Menkin (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>). "I also get why actors are tempted by a paycheck. But when creative labour becomes data, a performance can easily stop being something interpreted and start being automated."</p>
<p>Menkin says AI must be used ethically to support and not exploit creatives. "Contracts are rarely written in favour of those at the coalface and it won't take much for this new type of tech to be abused," he says. Regulation is needed, but despite performers pushing back via unions, "nothing will effectively change without government or at least industry involvement."</p>
<blockquote>"When creative labour becomes data, a performance can easily stop being something interpreted and start being automated."</blockquote>
<p>Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect, Metal Gear Solid) similarly calls for consent, control, and compensation, adding actors "should be compensated for what would've otherwise been paid work for them, especially when that work is used to generate profits for someone else."</p><p>Hale also highlights newer actors, without the knowledge to negotiate, will make "fear-based decisions and underprice themselves", which is why union status and open communication about fair rates is so important. "It's more imperative than ever that we have each other's backs and that we're clear about where we bring value and what we receive in exchange for that value," she says, adding: "I believe having human actors may well become an important mark of quality that elevates some games above others."</p>
<p>What's more, actors can "choose not to 'other' this technology," says Hale, but "move forward with it in a conscious, collaborative, constructive way". Alix Wilton Regan (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">Tomb Raider</a>, Cyberpunk, Dragon Age) is more staunchly against AI technology.</p>
<p>"The effect is, frankly, catastrophic," she says of AI's impact, noting "the voice acting market is drying up and wages are stagnating" as the tech can result in a reduced fee. "Already, many talented performers - of all ages - can barely pay their bills," she says. "The supply of actors is growing, but the demand for actors is shrinking, as corporations look to replace us with AI."</p>

</figure>
<p>For Wilton Regan, there are no benefits to the use of AI, even for more extreme voicework like incidental grunts and yells. "I love being in the studio and collaborating with different teams as we build new worlds and characters together, so, at best, AI alleviates some minor inconveniences such as the potential for vocal stress," she says. "But it's at the cost of endangering our livelihoods. That's a horrible trade-off that no one should have to make."</p><p>Colin Ryan (Final Fantasy 14, Hades 2) believes similarly, but says he would "prefer to see investment in vocal support for actors in games". Where theatre, TV and film have voice coaches to support actors with challenging moments, "that's not an option in video games."</p>
<p>"Developers using AI as a shortcut and to further bring down costs is a massive blow to actors' livelihoods and craft," Ryan continues, adding Embark Studios using AI even for incidental NPCs sets a "worrying precedent". "For many actors starting out, getting to record NPCs is a way to break into the industry, an opportunity for them to hone their craft, and form career-spanning connections, just like it was for me," he says. "To take away these jobs and use AI to generate them shows how little they value our contribution."</p>
<p>Further, Ryan believes the use of AI voices "isn't a creative decision, it's a financial one", and while he admits it often sounds hyperbolic and alarmist, "the truth is there will be less and less commercial incentive to hire humans" as the technology improves. "As an industry we need to make the case for humans and human creativity, to ensure that actors are a valued and intrinsic part of video game creation," he says.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>However, Wilton Regan is fighting back against AI "abuse". Along with author Nolan Kelly, she's launched <a href="https://tivoice.art/">TIVA</a> (True Indie Voice Art) as an audiobook project using poison-pilling technology to ensure the work of actors is unusable for AI. Its cast includes the likes of Hale, Ashly Burch (Horizon), Jane Perry (Returnal), and Devora Wilde and Jennifer English (Baldur's Gate 3), among others. "Our hope is that the quality of this work will convince people of our value as actors and the value of our profession in the voiceover space," says Wilton Regan.</p>
<p>The project is just one example of how actors are standing up for themselves against the threat of AI, but it's clear wider government regulation on AI technology is required in addition to union efforts.</p>
<blockquote>"As an industry we need to make the case for humans and human creativity, to ensure that actors are a valued and intrinsic part of video game creation."</blockquote>
<p>Whether for perceived financial reasons, development shortcuts, or as a creative decision, video game studios are increasingly looking to AI for voicework. And as awards-season hits and we all seek to celebrate the work of video game performers, it's imperative the industry remembers to protect the creative work of actors. Otherwise, it's a slippery slope towards a huge drop in quality.</p><p>"Even if human performers provide the base voices, and even if the makers have the best of intentions, without an actor bringing a character to life, you simply have a creepy cheap human imitation performing at you," says Wilton Regan. "Not <em>for </em>you, but <em>at </em>you. For anything generated, there is no true emotion, no chance for repeat takes, no nuance that a talented actor can bring to the role. You need a human for that."</p>

<p>"When a young Lara Croft is shipwrecked on a forgotten island during her first archaeological expedition, her intense fight for survival soon becomes a perilous journey to unravel the island's mysteries," reads the official blurb. "Initially armed with nothing but her instincts, Lara must quickly learn how to overcome Yamatai's devious traps and murderous inhabitants to escape its relentless hold."</p><p>Tomb Raider has been "expertly optimised" for mobile devices, and also features a "fully customisable touchscreen interface", which developer Feral Interactive said will allow players to "mix puzzle-solving and intense combat with ease". The release will also include gamepad and mouse and keyboard support.</p>
<p>If this all sounds up your street, iOS players can <a href="https://feralinteractive.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=27ffb222c33986fdd91dd51b2&amp;id=ee63611621&amp;e=a916cecc0c">preorder now via the App Store</a>, while Android players can <a href="https://feralinteractive.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=27ffb222c33986fdd91dd51b2&amp;id=11ab396b23&amp;e=a916cecc0c">pre-register on the Google Play Store</a>.

            <p>Key members of The Elder Scrolls 6 team have shared an update on the highly-anticipated game's status, and the good news is development is "progressing really well".</p>
<p>According to Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, the "majority" of the studio is now working on The Elder Scrolls 6, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">first announced all the way back in 2018</a>, though he noted the team "always overlap" when it comes to game development (as well as Elder Scrolls 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">the studio is also working on its Fallout series</a>).</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"We're very used to overlapping development," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">Game Informer</a>, saying the studio has "long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them". Howard added "it's a process", and one that everyone involved wishes went faster than it does. "But it's a process that we want to get right," the Bethesda exec said.</p>
<p>Bethesda's studio director Angela Browder added thanks to the "leaps and bounds" made in the industry and hardware since Skyrim, the "possibilities" for The Elder Scrolls 6 "are crazy".</p>
<p>"I will be honest, for me, sometimes I see things that are happening, and I go, 'Angela from Skyrim days could never have envisioned seeing this like this now', and that is a cool thing to be a part of," Browder said. "And it's a thing that I hope that when the day comes that our fans play it, that they - especially those of them who've been lifers with our brands - can really see how far it's all come."</p><p>Browder noted if you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">compare the original Oblivion with this year's remaster</a>, "you can see how far" technology has really come. "So, to me, The Elder Scrolls 6 is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry," the studio director said, before adding:</p>
<p>"It's gonna be dope. It's dope!"</p>
<p>During the same interview, design director Emil Pagliarulo said the "pressure" that the Elder Scrolls players put on Bethesda "we don't put on ourselves", though the developer understands why some get frustrated waiting for a game to come out.</p>
<p>"Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games, they take not just a long time to make, but a long time to spit and polish and iron out the bugs," Pagliarulo said. "And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?"</p><p>So, to make sure The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out of the oven as a delicious turkey, Bethesda is going to take its time. How much time? Well, "as long as it needs to be to be great," Pagliarulo closed.</p>

<p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>More recently, though, many Elder Scrolls 6 fans thought they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">found a clue pointing to a 2027 release date in a recent trailer for the Switch 2 edition of Skyrim</a>.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has described generative AI as "a snake eating its own tail", discussing how easily use of the tech can be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Straley left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> back in 2017 and has now formed his own independent studio, Wildflower Interactive. In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-generative-ai-interview/">Polygon</a> about the studio's debut, Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley revealed his staunch dislike of generative AI.</p>
<p>"It's a snake eating its own tail," he said. "It can't grow and think for itself, it just consumes, and it tries to mimic what it's consumed. That's the best it can do right now."</p>

<p>Generative AI has not been used in development of Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley confirmed. However, he noted how the term AI has been used in gaming for decades, but has since become confused and conflated with the current use of generative AI.</p><p>"It's difficult to even pitch the concept of this creature, because in my world, NPCs are AI," Straley said. "AI programmers are a type of personnel you have on staff in the programming department. Now you can't say that because if somebody does have an opinion about AI, I can't now call this creature the most advanced AI companion. People are going to think we did machine learning, and LLMs, and all that. No, we did none of that. This is hard work, and a lot of problem solving, and a lot of creative thinking. Which I think makes it more charming.</p>
<p>"I like art that has chips and flaws. It's like pottery. It has imperfections because it didn't come out of the kiln right. That's the cool stuff about art."</p>
<p>Straley did admit generative AI could potentially be useful in certain instances, but he's not interested in using it.</p>
<p>"I feel like without a human being the creation, I personally have zero investment in wanting to watch a TV show made by a robot," he said. "I have zero interest in looking at art that is generated by a computer. I don't think prompting is art."</p><p>Straley's comments are timely, following those of Larian CEO Swen Vincke. In an interview with Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Vincke admitted to Larian using generative AI</a> as part of development. When this received backlash online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Vincke clarified that concept artists would not be replaced by AI</a>. Instead the studio uses "AI tools to explore references" and developers can "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier" if they wish to.</p>
<p>The backlash Larian received to Vincke's initial comment is testament to the strong immediate opinions the use of AI can generate.</p>
<p>Coven of the Chicken Foot was revealed at this year's The Game Awards showcase - we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">rundown of everything announced</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p><em>Note that there are some small spoilers for the Dispatch game in this article. Not many - a couple of small ones - but consider this a heads-up.</em></p>
<p>It seems absurd now to think Dispatch would be anything but a success. It might have fallen awkwardly with regards to The Game Awards, with half of the series qualifying for it and half not, meaning it didn't feature as strongly as it could have, but I've no doubt it'll finish high on game of the year lists. There's so much confidence in this superhero workplace comedy, so much charm and so much swagger, it seems as though it was always destined for big things. Except, it very nearly wasn't. There was a time, a very real and painful time, when Dispatch nearly didn't make it - when Dispatch nearly died.</p>
<p>As game director and AdHoc studio co-founder Nick Herman tells me, speaking in a video call:  "We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of... financial things."</p>
<p>Dispatch writer and fellow co-founder Pierre Shorette continues: "The industry was collapsing, if you recall, two years ago. We were right there. Without really getting into the details, we were at the tip of the spear of it all popping. The publisher we were at was connected with Embracer, and I feel like Embracer was one of the first dominoes to really set the industry shaking, so we were right there at the edge of it. It was a weird place to be.</p><p>"We were doing contract work at the time," he adds. (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-the-studio-that-wrote-the-wolf-among-us-2-doesnt-know-whats-going-on-with-it">One game AdHoc was working on was Telltale's The Wolf Among Us 2</a> - a project that has since disappeared into development limbo.) "We'd been pretty good about staying busy. And had we not had that contract work basically paying the bills for us to continue development, we would have died three years ago."</p>
<p>But finding another publisher wasn't easy - in fact, Dispatch never really found one. The game lists Critical Role as publisher - the role-play mega-group that's become an entertainment brand and a publisher of board games and tabletop RPGs - but it's a nominal title, there to add exposure and clout, and to formalise the relationship for the other game AdHoc is making: a Critical Role game set in the group's campaign world of Exandria.</p>
<p>Mostly, rejection was what Dispatch faced, which is why it's so strange for Herman and Shorette to see people mystified when they say they didn't know the game would be a success. "People are mad at us because 'how could they not know this was going to be a huge success?'" Herman says.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you how," Shorette adds: "you have basically everyone tell you it's a bad idea for seven fucking years!"</p>
<p>"Telling us 'this is dumb, don't do it,'" Herman says.</p>
<p>"'You're making a game in a dead genre,'" Shorette says.</p>
<p>"And god I'm glad it shook out the way it did and people rejected us," Herman continues, "and we pachinkoed all the way down to our last resort and found someone, because now we are in the most control. We don't have a publisher: we're our own publisher. We weren't forced to do anything we didn't want to do. And now we have full ownership, whereas that wouldn't have been the case if people really believed in us."</p>

</figure>
<p>Dispatch started life as an interactive live-action television series, which sounds to me similar in concept to Netflix's Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch, where you're invited to choose the direction the story takes at prescribed moments throughout. Laura Bailey, the Critical Role member and an award-winning video game actor, was attached to the project back then (Herman and Shorette knew her from their Telltale days), but she was the only person we'd recognise from the current Dispatch cast.</p><p>Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul wasn't yet on board to play main character Robert. Apparently, the studio was thinking about going for someone else, Rahul Kohli, the British actor we saw on The Game Awards stage the other night promoting Housemarque's game Saros, in which he stars. Kohli also happens to be the partner of Alannah Pearce, who we know better now as the muscled Dispatch hero Malevola, or "muscle mommy" or "demon Cindy Crawford", as Shorette refers to her. "We talked about Rahul, yeah," Herman says.</p>
<p>This live-action incarnation of Dispatch was being made for a company related to Walmart, the American supermarket behemoth. I assume it was <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2018/10/11/walmart-and-eko-announce-joint-venture-to-create-interactive-storytelling-for-entertainment-and-retail">Eko</a>, an interactive storytelling company Walmart announced in 2018, although this isn't confirmed. And the project went a long way through development, it had shoot dates, but Covid struck and closed the world down and took the project with it. Maybe it was for the best. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-episodic-gaming-former-telltale-devs-are-bringing-it-back-for-the-release-of-dispatch-and-theres-a-chance-it-might-work-this-time">As Herman told me in a pre-release Dispatch interview</a>: "You're asking a bunch of game devs to shoot a TV show. It would have been a fun failure."</p>
<p>Dispatch was forced to change. There are things we would recognise from that early idea in the game we can play today, Herman says, but the tone was noticeably different. "It was a much sadder Robert - less hopeful, less optimistic, more just destroyed, working a dead-end job," Herman says. "And you were focused on one hero. There wasn't a Z-team. It was just: you would choose one of three heroes to help." Those heroes were Water Boy, Mr Whiskey - the person in the cat costume - and Invisigal. There was no Blonde Blazer, the blonde-haired super woman, at all. Scratch that: there <em>was </em>a Blonde Blazer, but it wasn't who you think.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We haven't talked about this [but] Blonde Blazer used to be the name of Flambae"</em></blockquote>
<p>"We haven't talked about this [but] Blonde Blazer used to be the name of Flambae," Herman reveals. "He was blonde. In the original, original scripts, he was Blonde Blazer. And I can't remember what she was called; we started moving names around at some point."</p>
<p>The longer Covid lingered, the more a fundamental change began to take hold. As the real world got less hopeful, the game got more hopeful. As the real world darkened, the game lightened. Shorette and Herman refer to this as the Ted Lasso effect, referencing Apple TV's award-winning comedy that came out around the same time, centered on a relentlessly optimistic football coach called Ted Lasso. "It was definitely impactful," says Shorette. And this uptick in optimism changed how the team wanted to go about things. "We spent so much time at Telltale just figuring out how to make people like people and then figure out the worst way to murder them," Shorette says, "and it just got old."</p><p>For instance, in the first draft of Dispatch, Robert's lifelong friend Chase - who has superspeed but also ages at superspeed when he uses his powers - would die. There was one revision where the season would even end with his death. But Shorette took it out and changed his mind. "Why?" says Shorette. "I liked him. Why the fuck would we kill character we like? It was so hard to get people to like him. Why would we throw that away?"</p>
<p>Alongside Chase, the project had two other core characters in Invisigal and Blonde Blazer - the actual Blonde Blazer this time. These characters were established early on as the core of the experience and driving force of the story. Everyone else, the Malevolas, Sonars, Punch-Ups and Prisms, came quite a lot later. Indeed it wasn't until the team took a mid-development excursion to Reno, or "shit Vegas", as one of Shorette's friends calls it, that the Z-team concept whereby you look after a group of misfit superheroes was landed upon.</p>

<p>You'll recall that the live-action idea had been about coaching a hero one-on-one, so the game would focus on one hero and one mission and you'd coach them through it, watching their progress on a series of security camera feeds. Sound familiar? It is - the remnants of this approach are in the game still, in the first mission where Invisigal goes to the doughnut shop. "That was in the original script," says Herman, "except you had a bunch of cameras, you were able to hop around, and you were able to engage with the environment. It was a little bit more adventure-gamey, honestly, more puzzley." And there were bigger ideas for this approach than that.</p>
<p>"The doughnut shop was a small box," says Herman, "but we had prototypes for big versions of that where you're going through enemy bases and stuff. And it was cool but it was <em>really</em> expensive because it's all cinematic. All these angles of cameras, all these different things that can happen. So we were slowly realising we're going to do three of these in the whole game, it's so expensive, so we've got to pivot to something we can put everywhere."</p><p>Dispatching was the answer and a thematically appropriate one, dreamt up in a designer's room in a hotel in Reno. It's the system you know from the game now: you see a map of a city and events occur in it which you dispatch heroes to attend to. It's a pleasing layer of strategy. More importantly, it's gameplay that doesn't require cinematics, where characters can chat without having to be animated, and where episodes can be broken up and given gameplay substance. But a sudden need for a team meant the team also needed characters.</p>
<p>Shorette and Herman and the rest of the team began looking wherever they could for characters they could pull in. That literal bat-man in the break room who'd been put there as a gag? He'll do. "I had forgotten that Sonar was just a gag," Shorette says, laughing. Herman adds: "We had to dust that guy off and, okay, maybe he also turns into a giant bat. Maybe he's a crypto guy. But originally it was just a guy who's screaming in the break room and it was adding tension to a dialogue scene you were having."</p>
<p>Ideas for the other heroes came quick and thick, and soon there were so many, some had to be cut, such as Winter, "A K-pop star," says Shorette.</p>
<p>"Was he?" asks Herman. "I don't think he was. He was dressed like a Japanese homeless man."</p>
<p>"But the vibe was one of those homeless people where you're like, damn, you should be on a runway," Shorette says. "He had a Korean idol-y kind of face. He looked like a Saja Boy undercover."</p>
<p>And Herman groans and says "I <em>know" </em>when I mention the obvious: that cutting a Saja Boy-like character in the year of KPop Demon Hunters is a massive missed opportunity.</p>
<p>"We actually had a love triangle with him," Shorette adds. "He was the one everyone was after. Yeah that would have been great. We should do that for Season 2. <em>If </em>there is a Season 2!"</p>

<p>Let's leap forwards again in time to people playing the final game, and if the success of the game was unexpected, the ways in which people played the game were unexpected too. One decision that people made in particular surprised the team: more people sided with Invisigal than Blonde Blazer. Internal tests signalled the split would be roughly down the middle, but when the game came out, it was anything but. Statistics showed three quarters of the playerbase choosing Invisigal, and Herman thinks that's his fault.</p><p>"There are things I would do if I was going back to that to balance the choice a little bit better," he says, "because weirdly, it's like we have responsibility here. It's not just pure player emotion or the words on a page or the actors: it's also about how the choice is presented. That's my episode and I could have done a better job to push things a little bit towards Blazer. Like, she could have been on screen - we could have split-screen seen her in the back of the limo texting Robert. And just seeing her would make people more choose her. They were staring at Invisigal and getting a text from Blazer, so it's not really balanced, you know?"</p>

<p>They also didn't expect people to attach themselves as emotionally as they did to the characters of the game. In their development bubble, they often saw the game as a collection of goofs and gags and literal dick jokes. (They're big fans of streams where people enable nudity only to hurriedly try and turn it off when they realise what the on/off switch is there for, by the way. "It's very funny," Shorette says, laughing. "People are uncomfortable about dicks.") But the fans' seriousness about the characters, their artwork, their fiction, their love for them, has shown them a side to Dispatch they didn't necessarily realise was there.</p>
<p>"To see some people take it <em>so</em> seriously, it almost feels like, oh, we've got to take this more seriously now that everyone else is taking it more seriously," Herman says. "Because for a long time it was just goofs and gags and this is kind of cool - what do you think? And now it's locked in that people care about these people, they care about these details.</p>
<p>"For it to be called a comedy is underselling how it's affecting people," Shorette adds. "I've always just called it comedy but I think we've always had that dismissive, like, ahh that's just a bunch of fart jokes. But then people are into Robert's positivity. They feel like that's a fucking good man, and we need good male role models, people who are not corny about being positive or believing in people. That's cool - it's a good time."</p><p>Which brings back around to where we began, sort of, with fans being somewhat mad at AdHoc for not predicting Dispatch would be a success. Because it turns out fans are also mad that AdHoc hasn't told them what it's doing next, as far as Dispatch and a second season or sequel are concerned. "It's the new problem, right?" says Herman. "It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it?" So how seriously are they talking about it?</p>
<p>"As seriously as anything," answers Shorette. "But the thing is, the tough thing is, it's like in music: you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling. We had <em>so</em> long with this - seven years is a lot of time. If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand."</p>
<p>"There were <em>zero </em>expectations for Season 1 - external expectations," Herman adds. "People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head. Season 2, if we do it, we know that's going to be an extra challenge."</p>
<p>"A lot of pressure," adds Shorette. "It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>
<p>The team is "days away" from sitting down and figuring out what comes next, Herman tells me, which considering I spoke to them a couple of weeks ago might already have come to pass. "We're entering the time where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out," he says. And I would be amazed - flabbergasted, even - if these plans don't include a Dispatch Season 2.</p><p>But the studio also has that Critical Role game to make, don't forget, though it doesn't sound as far along as I had hoped it would be. "It's been bubbling, simmering I would call it," Shorette says. "It's not full boil or anything. It probably has had pushes over the last year or so, at different points, but as Dispatch needed to get released, that took up a lot of our resources."</p>
<p>Whatever the future holds for AdHoc, though, it is certainly bright. Blazingly bright, even. From a studio struggling for survival, nervous about whether the world would want a Telltale-style episodic game, AdHoc and Dispatch have become one of 2025's most notable successes. The pressure of survival is off; the pressure of success is on. The world cannot get enough of Dispatch.</p>

            <p>A second season of Dispatch is being discussed "as seriously as anything" at AdHoc Studio, and the team will sit down any day now and make a decision about it.</p>
<p>"People are mad that we haven't told them what we're doing," studio co-founder and Dispatch game director Nick Herman told me in an interview. "It's the new problem, right? It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it? We're days away from really sitting down and having the time - because we've had to support the game - where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out."</p>
<p>I spoke to Herman and Pierre Shorette, the lead writer and another studio co-founder, as part of a longer interview live on Eurogamer now. But though Herman said the studio is yet to make a decision on Season 2, the ways they referenced a follow-up made it sound like a much surer thing.</p>
<p>When they talked about a cut Kpop idol-inspired character called Winter, for instance, and a love triangle he was involved in, Shorette joked that he could reinstate this for Season 2. "We should do that for Season 2," he said, before quickly adding: "<em>If </em>there is a Season 2!"</p><p>It was when I questioned them directly about a second series and how seriously the studio is talking about it, that Shorette said, "As seriously as anything." But though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone#:~:text=The%20episodic%20superhero%20workplace%20comedy,number%20also%20equates%20to%20sales.">Dispatch has been an obvious success, racing to 2m sales</a> and capturing a large and passionate fanbase, there are concerns internally about following it up.</p>
<blockquote><em>"You have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second"</em></blockquote>
<p>As Shorette explained: "The thing is, the tough thing is, it's like in music: you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling. We had <em>so</em> long with this - seven years is a lot of time. If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand."</p>
<p>Then Herman added: "There were <em>zero </em>expectations for Season 1 - external expectations. People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head. Season 2, if we do it, we know that's going to be an extra challenge."</p>
<p>"A lot of pressure," Shorette said. "It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>
<p>It might be a surprise to hear Dispatch was in development for several years but its journey was a twisting, turning one. From being a live-action television series to being dropped by a publisher half-way through, the game has had to survive some bumps. You can read all about it - and about that cut Kpop character and more - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a> live on Eurogamer now.</p>

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has announced Fallout Season 3 is currently being written, just a day after season two premiered. What's more, collaborations between Fallout video games and this next entry in the popular TV show are being planned.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-season-3-scripts-fallout-76-game-tie-in-1236610167/">In an interview with Variety</a>, Howard revealed the current status of Fallout's next season, as well as how it will cross over with the games.</p>
<p>Howard explained: "For us on the game and TV show side, we're writing Season 3 now [...] We're having those conversations now of, what are we doing in Season 3 for the TV show and what elements can we bring into our games at that time when it comes out that don't feel forced or fake."</p>

<p>The Fallout series and games have already explored this sort of multi-media promotion, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout 76's recent Burning Springs update</a>. Released earlier this month, Burning Springs starred Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, and featured several new bounty hunter missions for players to complete. It's free too, a nice touch to be sure.</p><p>The Fallout show has also acted as an opportunity to shoehorn Game Pass into the situation, as Amazon, Bethesda, and Samsung have partnered up to offer both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and season one to Samsung TV owners for free via Game Pass. Head of Samsung Gaming Kevin Beatty told Variety he thought they were "extremely fortunate" to offer season one, and that he hopes they'll be able to stream season 2 in the future.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Todd Howard confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-todd-howard-has-no-interest-in-becoming-bethesdas-version-of-marvel-cameo-king-stan-lee">he had no interest in taking up a Stan Lee style cameo in the Fallout show</a>, and didn't rule out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">possibility of an Elder Scrolls TV show in the future</a>. He was, however, tight-lipped about a Wolfenstein show.</p>

            <p>Swen Vincke, the CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Divinity developer Larain, has responded to the intense backlash the studio has received since its use of generative AI was confirmed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated"> the Larian CEO stated the studio is using generative AI to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text</a>, with Vinke saying "everyone at the company is more or less OK" with the way the technology is being implemented. He added the studio's upcoming and newly-announced release Divinity won't contain anything which has been AI-generated.</p>
<p>Soon after Vincke's statements went live, however, he was met with backlash from fans <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">as well as former Larian developers</a>, which prompted the studio head to respond with his <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833"> own post</a>, stating: "Holy fuck guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI."  </p>

<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 head added Larian has "a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more", with the artwork they create being original and something Vincke is "very proud" of.</p>
<p>Continuing further, Vincke said he was "asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI" during the interview with Bloomberg. "I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn't say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists," he said.</p><p>Vincke stated the studio uses "AI tools to explore references", in the same way it uses the likes of Google and art books. "At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art," he said. "There is no comparison."</p>
<p>Larian hires its team of creatives for "their talent", Vincke closed, and "not for their ability to do what a machine suggests". He again reiterated the team can still "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier".</p>

<p>In a further statement shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">IGN</a>, Vincke again clarified that Larian is not looking to replace any of its developers with generative AI. It will also not be releasing a game which includes content made by the technology.</p>
<p>You can read Vincke's statement in full below:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We've been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p>
<p>"Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p>
<p>"Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating. Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual's workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p>
<p>"We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games. We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p>
<p>"While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse."</p></blockquote>

<p>While <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/braak.bsky.social/post/3ma53v5blo222">many remain unconvinced of Vincke's response</a>, others have pointed out Larian is far from the only beloved studio to admit to using AI. The "Expedition 33 team freely admitted using AI and just won the most awards ever in The Game Awards history," <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/2001061930547503396">Washington Post reporter Gene Park noted on social media</a>.</p><p>AI, of course, remains a key area of discussion across the industry, and reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines. Earlier this month, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>. More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games">Bethesda's Todd Howard shared his own thoughts on the use of AI in video games</a>, calling it a "tool" but one that can't replace human intention.</p>
<p>As for Larian, it is working on Divinity, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announced at The Game Awards with a rather gruesome and unsettling trailer</a>. Vinke has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">since said Larian's upcoming game is the studio "unleashed"</a>, while confirming it will be a turn-based RPG.</p>

            <p>Larian is using generative AI as part of its game development process, but CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed the studio's new Divinity game won't include anything AI-generated.</p>
<p>Vincke discussed the topic of AI with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announcement last week at The Game Awards of its new Divinity game</a>. It's the studio's next project following the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was a particularly expansive game.</p>
<p>As such, the studio is looking to AI with its follow-up, but Vincke confirmed it hasn't massively improved efficiency. Larian uses AI tools to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text, Bloomberg reported.</p>

<p>In Divinity, then, "everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," said Vincke.</p>
<p>And while the use of AI has led to some pushback internally, Vincke believes "at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it."</p>
<p>Larian is aiming to cut down on development time for Divinity, to complete production in less time than Baldur's Gate 3. AI is one potential tool, while another is developing Divinity's quest and storylines in parallel rather than linearly. The studio is also growing in size.</p><p>"I think a lot of founders have the same problem," said Vincke. "I have to be large, otherwise I can't make my video game. With growth suddenly comes a whole bunch of responsibilities that you didn't necessarily think you were ever gonna have, but you have them and then you make the best of them. Size exposes you to new problems that you couldn't imagine existed."</p>
<p>Back at GDC last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-larian-interview-swen-vincke-on-industry-woes-optimism-and-life-after-baldurs-gate-3">Vincke discussed the topic of AI with Eurogamer</a>. "So, we certainly don't see it as a replacement for developers," he said. "But we do see it as something that allows us to do more stuff."</p>
<p>He continued: "I do see it as an additional tool that you can put on top of the things that are in the game. And we're certainly doing experiments with that. But as I said, it's still far from being usable in that sense."</p>
<p>In the same Bloomberg interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">Vincke declared Larian's forthcoming Divinity game as "us unleashed"</a>, confirming it will be a turn-based RPG.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">current gen upgrade was released for Larian's previous game Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, available now on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <p>Larian CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed the studio's next game, Divinity, will be a turn-based RPG, describing the game as "us unleashed".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">Divinity was revealed at last week's The Game Awards</a>, following an elaborate stunt with a demonic statue in the desert.

<p>"This is going to be us unleashed, I think," Vincke told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "It's a turn-based RPG featuring everything you've seen from us in the past, but it's brought to the next level."</p>

<p>Divinity will also be an early-access release, Vincke confirmed, just like Baldur's Gate 3, though it's unknown when this could start.</p>
<p>Vincke explained the studio had originally planned to work with Wizards of the Coast once again on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, but the developers weren't excited about it.</p>
<p>"Conceptually, all of the ingredients for a really cool game were there except the hearts of the developers," he said.</p>
<p>That's why the studio is now returning to Divinity, the franchise on which the studio is built. Previous games in the series had real-time combat, though the two Original Sin games were turn-based, leading to speculation among fans as to what this new Divinity game will feature.</p><p>"Baldur's Gate 3 was a good game and I'm proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better," said Vincke. He noted the tabletop systems of Dungeons &amp; Dragons were difficult to translate into a video game. "Here, we're making a system that's made for a video game. It's much easier to understand."</p>
<p>What's more, the studio will be using a new game engine and is doubling down on cinematic storytelling. The developers also want to expand on the breadth of storytelling, too.</p>
<p>"The idea is that when you talk to fellow journalists about the game, you'll have completely different stories," Vincke said. "We're doing a couple of things that you haven't seen in RPGs before, I think."</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Divinity at The Game Awards, Larian has released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">current gen upgrade of Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <p>Financial documents have revealed that not only is Dead Island 3 in development at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a>, but it's aiming for a 2028 release.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">This was spotted by user bogorad222 on X</a>, who posted the Dambuster Studios annual financial report online including a brief overview of the company and what it's currently working on. The overview reveals the primary focus of the studio is now Dead Island 3.</p>
<p>"After [the] release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a> Ultimate Edition in October 2024, the primary focus for Dambuster Studio is now Dead Island 3," the report states. "All developers are assigned to the project and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete all of Dambuster's QA team will also be assigned to Dead Island 3."</p>

<p>The report continues: "Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world and story design moving at pace. The current predicted release window for the project is Q 1/2 2028."</p>
<p>As for Dambuster's main risks, the report states these stem from "having the right vision and mission to know which games are trending in 3-5 years, staying on top of engineering standards of AAA games as well as having the right talented team available for working on the projects."</p><p>Dead Island 3 had been teased back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-3-teased-with-returning-character-as-dambuster-studios-celebrates-20-million-dead-island-2-players">as Dambuster celebrated 20 million Dead Island 2 players</a>. In a celebratory post, Dambuster stated the outbreak was "far from over", leaving many curious as to where the series would head next. The game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2s-canned-original-version-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insists-exec">which struggled during development</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">did eventually launch to plentiful sales.</a></p>
<p>If you've not played Dead Island 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-review-its-still-2011-in-los-angeles">Eurogamer's review</a> described it as: "A straightforwardly accomplished zombie action-RPG that doesn't quite make the most of its Californian setting."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been going from strength to strength this year. Following its release back in April, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">game was met with widespread acclaim</a> and sales to match. In May, the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>. In October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">that figure was updated to over 5m copies worldwide across all formats</a>.</p>
<p>But, that number has since increased further, and according to <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics">Alinea Analytics, </a>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold "almost" 400k copies since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">its record-breaking Game Awards nominations</a> on 17th November. Meanwhile, the company's <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2000615104090341472/photo/1">head of market analysis Rhys Elliott</a> estimates Clair Obscur has "sold an extra 200k+ copies since" The Game Awards last week, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">scooped up the coveted Game of the Year accolade among others</a>.</p>

<p>To break that down further, Elliott said 76 percent of those sales were on Steam, with 21 percent on PS5 and three percent on Xbox. "Around 52 thousand Xbox players" have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-xbox-game-passs-biggest-third-party-success-2025">since played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 via Game Pass</a> "for the first time" as well, Elliott added.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#1m">SteamDB</a>, meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has received a notable uptake in player numbers since last week's award show, as you can see in the graph below.</p>
<p>The Sunday before this year's The Game Awards welcomed 22,759 Clair Obscur players on Steam, while the Sunday after saw 56,993 players. That's an increase of 34,234 players between those two specific days.</p>

<p>The success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p>
<p>During the awards show last week, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> fans have discovered a load of unused conversations between the game's controversial NPCs.</p>
<p>Unlike previous games where Samus is mostly isolated and alone, the latest in the series sees Samus rescuing and interacting with an ensemble of Federation soldiers. This has proven unpopular with many players, who feel it undermines its otherwise mysterious tone.</p>
<p>Now, YouTuber Bearborg has uploaded a video of all base camp interactions in the game, including unused dialogue, which were taken from the game's files (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">VGC</a>). The video includes over 41 minutes of dialogue, of which around 34 minutes is unused.</p>

<p>As this extra dialogue was all recorded, it suggests the game originally had far more incidental conversations between its characters, which were (perhaps rightfully) pared back.</p>
<p>Cut conversations include discussions on how much robot VUE-995 can bench press, MacKenzie's lack of field experience, and Armstrong finding out about roast beasts, among many others. It's mostly more humorous dialogue that adds little to the story, which is likely why it was cut.</p>

<p>In the final version of the game, these characters are little more than broad, stereotypical sketches. Yet as Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson explained, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-chatty-companions-silent-samus-the-problem">Metroid Prime 4 suffers more from Samus's own lack of dialogue by comparison</a>.</p>
<p>"It's presentationally clear here that Samus just isn't talking," he wrote. "The feeling of awkward weirdness only grows as the game winds on. These guys begin throwing their lives on the line for this woman who offers nothing back in return. This might even work if they acknowledged their leader's silence - but they don't. Everyone just acts like this is all normal. Maybe it is, with this being Samus' in-universe reputation. Either way, it sucks."</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 was eagerly awaited for 18 years until its release earlier this month. Unfortunately, for many it has not lived up to expectations.</p>
<p>"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>.</p>

            <p>Two more actors have been cast in Netflix's upcoming Assassin's Creed adaptation, which is based on Ubisoft's games of the same name.</p>
<p>Lola Petticrew (pictured below), who is known for Bloodlands and Trespasses, and Zachary Hart (pictured above) have both joined the show, though their characters at this time are being kept under wraps. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/assassins-creed-zachary-hart-netflix-live-action-series-1236647717/">Deadline</a>, Hart - whose previous credits include Slow Horses - will be a series regular.</p>

<p>The duo will be joining previously announced cast member Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor set to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>
<p>While characters in the upcoming series are still unknown, it was previously said they will be different from the games. A report last month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-show-will-be-set-in-ancient-rome">claimed the TV show will explore a time period hitherto untouched by Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series</a>, and include figures from Ancient Rome such as Emperor Nero and Seneca the Younger.</p><p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation has been a long time coming, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">was first announced in 2020</a>. The series is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show. Filming is expected to take place in Italy next year.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, it really is just a case of when and not if Ubisoft will announce a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry Black Flag. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">a myriad of leaks and rumours</a>, earlier this month a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">listing for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted on the PEGI ratings board website</a>, further confirming its existence.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> art director Robert Sammelin has shone some light on the inner workings of the extraction shooter's matchmaking system, confirming that player behaviour is indeed a factor in the "complex" process of assigning players to online matches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/">Speaking to PC Gamer at The Game Awards</a>, Sammelin stated: "Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We analyse behaviour and match accordingly." When asked if he was able to elaborate on the matter, Sammelin said "no" and laughed.</p>
<p>Instead, the interview shifts to the topic of player passivity in general, and how the team at Embark has been able to see it in data gathered from Arc Raiders matches. Sammelin explained: "We got some figures on how many people have even downed another player, and they were surprisingly low at a large scale. There's also quite a difference in playing with a squad or solo with this, [which] opens up a very different experience depending on how you choose to engage with the game from the get-go.</p>

<p>"Of course data is great, the amount of data we get from telemetry is really helpful in finding out what we should be addressing, tweaking, or tuning. Pairing it up with internal assumptions is invaluable in terms of tuning and balance. That's something we'll keep doing continuously."</p><p>Arc Raiders has garnered somewhat of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">a reputation for player pacifism since its launch earlier this year</a>. Some players have even argued that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-are-waging-war-over-a-controversial-topic-are-pvpers-ruining-the-experience">PvPers were ruining the experience, in what is clearly a high-stakes PvPvE genre</a>. Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">even quizzed a sociologist on the matter</a>, given the interesting dynamic between those friendly players and others engaging with the extraction shooter as intended.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand, there's plenty to do right now in Arc Raiders. In fact, today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-snow-map-condition-flickering-flames">the game's frosty map condition has been added to the game</a>, with a Christmas-themed community event pushing raiders to head out and collect berries for the festive season.</p>

            <p>There's now a free demo available for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Xbox Series X/S, ahead of the full release in January.</p>
<p>The demo includes the iconic first chapter of the game, and progress will carry over to the main game. Note that on Switch 2, you'll need at least 8GB of space to download the demo, but this is a great opportunity to see how the game runs on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>What's more, you can grab a free copy of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> game if you pre-order Remake digitally on either platform. That's only available until 31st January 2026, but that's enough time to experience the 1996 original before diving into Remake.</p>

<p>Those who pre-order the physical version of Remake will receive a Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Play Booster back, containing 15 random cards (while stocks last, at least).</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake will release on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S on 22nd January 2026. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">full Remake trilogy will eventually be available across both platforms</a>, in addition to PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, though, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">physical version of the game will be a Game Key Card</a>, meaning it's just a physical key for a download - you'll still need over 90GB of space for the game, making it one of the largest on the system.</p>
<p>Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi has also confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory">development of the third part won't be impacted by the multiplatform approach</a>. It remains unknown if its eventual release will be simultaneous, or a PlayStation exclusive for a limited time.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry's oh-so-challenging platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has sold over 7m copies since its release in September.</p>
<p>Silksong is the follow up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, and ever since it was announced back in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-just-made-my-day-live-reactions-to-the-silksong-release-date">many were left desperate to get their hands on it</a>. It finally materialised three months ago across multiple platforms, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-causes-server-chaos-on-xbox-steam-and-nintendo-as-platforms-grind-to-a-halt">crashing many digital store fronts in the process thanks to the sudden influx of eager players</a>. How many eager players? Well, quite a lot!</p>

<p>Team Cherry has today announced it has sold over 7m copies of Silksong in the last few months. That number is full fat sales, and does not include the "millions more" who have played via Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p><p>"It's a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected," <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">Team Cherry said</a>. "Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game's challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home.</p>
<p>"Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further."</p>
<p>Speaking of expanding the game even further, the developer went on to detail Silksong's first expansion known as Sea of Sorrow, which is coming out next year. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-unveils-first-big-silksong-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-and-its-completely-free">nautically themed expansion will include new areas, bosses, tools and more when it arrives as a free update for all players</a>.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Silksong five stars. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Eurogamer's Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/any-future-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-would-exist-alongside-the-others-as-standalone-entry-says-team-cherry">Team Cherry recently flirted with the idea of more entries in its Hollow Knight series</a>, which (if they ever do materialise) would sit alongside the studio's previous games, rather than act as any kind of continuation that would require an understanding of earlier lore to appreciate.</p>

            <p>
Well if you thought we were done with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> excitement for 2025, think again. Team Cherry is wrapping up its year with a few last bits of business, including news of an enhanced version of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and, most excitingly, a first look at Silksong's first big - and completely free - expansion Sea of Sorrow, coming next year.
</p>
<p>
We already knew some sort of Silksong DLC was on the way, of course; Team Cherry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-supported-with-extra-content-for-years-to-come">confirmed plans</a> for post-launch "stuff" shortly after the game's release, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-in-development">reiterated its intentions</a> back in November. Now, though, we've got a much clearer idea of what the studio's been working on. It's first big expansion is called Sea of Sorrow, and it's coming to Silksong in 2026.

<p>
"Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion", Team Cherry teases, before <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">elaborating further elsewhere</a>. Sea of Sorrow is, as you've no doubt guessed, "nautically themed", and will include new areas, bosses, tools, and more when it arrives as a free update for all players. Expect more details "shortly before" the expansion's release.
</p><p>
Additionally, Team Cherry has announced a Hollow Knight Switch 2 Edition, which will feature similar enhancements to those already enjoyed by Silksong on the platform, including "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects". It'll be free for owners of the existing Switch version, and there's a free update coming to other platforms too.
</p>
<p>
PC players can check out many of the update's features right now in a public-beta branch available for Steam and GOG. A full list of current additions can be <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">found in Team Cherry's patch notes</a>, but expect to see the likes of expanded controller support, the inclusion of 21:9 and 16:10 resolutions, smoother map panning, and the ability to pause in inventory menus. More improvements will be added before the update's full release next year.

Six month after announcing an indefinite delay for Marathon in response to "passionate" community feedback, Bungie has slapped its live-service extraction shooter with a release window and price, confirming it'll launch for PlayStation 5 and PC in March next year for £35.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">formally unveiled its Marathon reboot</a> in May 2023, but it wasn't until April this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">legal challenges</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">more</a> - that the troubled project finally got its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">big reveal</a>. Unfortunately, the response was less-than-positive, and a subsequent alpha playtest proved equally divisive. As a result, Bungie revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Marathon would no longer launch on 23rd September as originally announced</a>, and would instead be indefinitely delayed to make improvements.

<p>
There's been little concrete news on Marathon's progress since then, although Sony chief financial officer Lin Tao did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">reference the title last month</a>, revealing it was still set to release within the company's current financial year. And Bungie has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/marathon-vidoc-highlights-the-extraction-shooters-dark-world-and-survival-challenge/">narrowed that down further</a>, confirming the extraction shooter will launch in March 2026. Additionally, it'll cost £34.99/$39.99/€39.99 - the same price as Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">ill-fated shooter Concord</a>.
</p><p>
Confirmation of Marathon's release window was accompanied by a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J91kh56jiA">20-minute gameplay breakdown</a>, with Bungie outlining a number of enhancements made since April's divisive play test. These include improvements to visual fidelity, proximity chat, a Solo Runner queue, and a "solo scavenger experience" titled Rook. 
</p>
<p>
"Whether you were with us back in April for our first Alpha or you're just joining us now," Bungie wrote on the PlayStation Blog, "there's a rich world full of lore and loot for you to discover when your cybernetic biosynthetic shell takes its first steps into our new world."

            <p>
Following Amazon's decision to 'gut' its video game division in October as part of 14,000 job cuts across the company, Ubisoft has announced the acquisition of one of its studios - Amazon Games Montreal - which is currently working on MOBA March of Giants.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/15/3205660/0/en/Ubisoft-accelerates-in-fast-growing-MOBA-market-by-acquiring-March-of-Giants-game-from-Amazon.html">Ubisoft's announcement</a>, the acquisition includes the rights to March of Giants, and will see the Amazon Games Montreal team join the company. That includes former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a> creative director Xavier Marquis, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-recruits-former-rainbow-six-siege-devs-for-new-studio">joined Amazon in 2021</a> after leaving Ubisoft two years prior.
</p>
<p>
As to why Ubisoft wants March of Giants and its team, the company says the global MOBA games market is expected to "continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030" - and it believes its newly acquired title is "an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game."
</p>
<p>
"March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added in a statement. "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre [Parizeau], Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft notes the terms of its acquisition deal "are not being disclosed", but it does reveal the agreement includes Amazon's commitment to providing marketing support for March of Giants on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Amazon Games Montreal's sale follows radical changes to Amazon's video game strategy in October, when - according to Bloomberg - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">company 'gutted' its games division as part of sweeping layoffs</a>. At the time, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) reportedly told employees the company had "made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs", resulting in "significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team."
</p>
<p>
In the aftermath of Amazon's announcement, it was confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026">ongoing work on its New World MMO would cease</a>, and word emerged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-amazon-dev-suggests-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-following-recent-studio-gutting">suggesting its Lord of the Rings MMO had also been canned</a>.

            <p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation is due to air in just a couple of days time, but don't expect to see Bethesda studio head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> popping up as a cameo.</p>
<p>Many creators and execs have enjoyed appearing in adaptations of their work, with the likes of Stan Lee often cameoing in Marvel films and shows during his time. Fans would look out for Lee cropping up, with his cameos becoming a rather charming addition to the Marvel cinematic universe and beyond.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But Howard isn't interested in doing something similar for Bethesda in Fallout, though he's been asked several times. "They've offered me a whole bunch, even in season one," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-he-has-turned-down-all-the-offers-to-cameo-in-the-fallout-tv-show-so-far">IGN</a>, explaining he was "going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things."</p>
<p>However, the studio head thinks he is best placed "behind the camera" rather than in front of it. "I said no to all of them so far," Howard furthered, when asked if would perhaps consider being a victim of The Ghoul's. "I don't want to distract," he said. "Everyone goes, 'Oh, there's Todd!'"</p>
<p>But, can he ever see himself being the Stan Lee of Bethesda, even one day? "Not at this time," Howard replied.</p>

<p>The second season of Fallout is heading to Amazon Prime this week, on 16th December (that's a day earlier than first announced). Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>As for other Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>

'Tis the season to be jolly, even if you happen to be ankle-deep in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Yup, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> 2 is getting into the seasonal spirit of giving with a completely free update promising "hours" of new quests and more - all arriving on Tuesday, 16th December.
</p>
<p>
It's been a busy 2025 for Stalker 2, with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> having released numerous significant updates for the well-received open-world shooter - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-roadmap-for-2025-includes-a-life-updates-and-an-upgrade-to-a-new-version-of-unreal-engine-5">major fixes for its troublesome A-Life system</a> - alongside a version for PlayStation 5. And it's now wrapping up the year, with a massive new storyline featuring "hours" of gameplay.

<figcaption>Here's a look at Stalker 2's Stories Untold update.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KCLiw3e-b8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map," GSC explains <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations... You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is."
</p><p>
And so begins a fresh mystery within the Zone spanning eight new quests and seven locations, including the Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot, and Volkhov SAM. It also promises six new characters, each with their own backgrounds and stories, a unique weapon - specifically the GP37V2, a modified version of the GP37 rifle that only support single and burst fire modes - plus a new hub to create. The latter, assuming you make the right choices on your adventure, will appear in the Burnt Forest, giving you access to a technician, trader, medic, guide, and more.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's big free Stories Untold update arrives for all platforms on Tuesday, 16th December. And if you'd like to know more about its recent leap to PlayStation 5, GSC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-something-that-should-be-happening-in-any-version-of-the-civilised-world-the-struggles-of-gsc-game-world-bringing-stalker-2-to-the-ps5">spoke to Eurogamer back in November</a>, discussing, among other things, the difficulties of continuing development amid the ongoing Russian invasion of the Ukraine.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' Flickering Flames event kicks off tomorrow, and with it a blanket of snow will land softly over a variety of outdoor maps. While exciting, it'll make these dangerous maps even more perilous thanks to new environmental effects and frostbite.</p>
<p>This map condition is called Cold Snap, and will be rolled into live servers alongside the regular rotation of Night Raids and Electromagnetic Storms. During the Cold Snap map condition, waters freeze and turn into unsteady ground, vision is limited, and staying outside for too long will damage your raider. You'll have to rush inside to stave off the frostbite.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Flickering Flames event will push the Arc Raiders community to keep things festive. It's all about gathering Candleberries from out in the world, as well as sources of light and heat to keep things cozy down below ground. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-finish-community-event-and-unlock-a-new-map-in-just-one-day#:~:text=Arc%20Raiders%20players%20have%20come,to%20unblock%20the%20North%20Line.">This appears to work like the Stella Montis map unlock </a>did, with raiders having to deposit certain resources back at the hub.</p>

<p>Those who go out and gather Candleberries will earn cosmetics, weapons, raider tokens, new items, and more for handing them in. As such, it's worth booting the game up and getting your foraging gloves on. You'll have until the 13th January to earn everything you want.</p><p>There's also a new Raider Deck coming to the game, starting the 26th December. The Goalie Raider Deck will be totally free and permanent, and will work much like the launch Raider Deck did. It'll come packing lots of rewards as you'd expect, but most importantly a new hockey stick raider tool will be included.</p>
<p>Finally, this December is when the first departure window opens for Arc Raiders, meaning you'll be able to send your levelled up character off to explore the world permanently in exchange for an XP boost and some unique rewards.</p>
<p>With the conclusion of this Flickering Flames event, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-an-impressive-2025-roadmap-and-its-bringing-a-new-map-new-events-and-other-game-changers">we'll have reached the end of that initial roadmap release by Embark Studios</a>. That means what 2026 will hold for Arc Raiders players remains largely a mystery. I, for one, am excited to jump back in, earn some exclusive rewards over the xmas period, and start fresh next year with a new character.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> now has current gen versions available for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Larian's previous RPG, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, was already available on Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. But now it's available on newer platforms with higher resolution and increased framerate. There's also a free upgrade available if you already own the game.</p>
<p>The shadow drop follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-divinity-original-sin-trademark-the-game-awards-statue-larian">leak last week of a PS5 version of the Definitive Edition of the game</a>, so this isn't totally out of the blue.</p>

<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 was first released in 2017 for PC, with PS4, Xbox One, Switch and iPad versions following. While already available to play on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, it's been via backwards compatibility only.</p>
<p>"Hey we weren't meant to announce that yet," wrote Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse on the leak last week.</p>
<p>That leak arrived alongside new trademarks for the Divinity franchise, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">pre-empted Larian's announcement at The Game Awards that the studio is developing a new Divinity game</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement finally solved the mystery of the strange statue in the Mojave Desert. Revealed with a gruesome trailer, Divinity is going to be even larger than Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>Until then, it seems Larian is keen for players to revisit a refreshed Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <p>Exodus looks a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> - let's get that out of the way. Not only does Archetype's space-faring RPG have the same look and the same sensibilities, right down to getting a spaceship and gathering a crew in order to save the day, but it's made by some of same the people who dreamt Mass Effect up, including, notably, lead Mass Effect 1 &amp; 2 writer Drew Karpyshyn.</p>

<p>But what sets Exodus apart is time dilation. If you've seen the film Interstellar, or if you're familiar with actual space-travelling science, you'll know broadly what this means. It's to do with relativity. Time passes slower for objects moving very quickly or in strong gravity compared to stationary observers. The faster you go, broadly speaking, the slower you age. Exodus has this concept at the heart of its design.</p>
<p>"The IP I feel is unique enough - people, once they get into it, will see it," Drew Karpyshyn, narrative director of Exodus, tells me in an interview. "The impact of time dilation is something very unique and fresh, I feel, and we really leverage that. We really lean into it. It's an important part of our IP and a very important part of our story.</p>
<p>"I don't know too many other science fiction properties, especially games... Most of them have instant travel or fast travel between planets. We are staying more hard sci-fi and saying it does take literally years to go [there], so that makes a huge impact in how your choices play out. That, to me, is one of our really defining features."</p>

<p>Information of how time dilation will work in Exodus has been kept intentionally vague. We know chunks of time will pass and that we'll be able to see the longer-term consequences of our role-playing decisions in the game, but we don't know more than that, such as how much time will pass and what kind of consequences we'll face. Are we talking months, years, decades, centuries, or even millennia?</p><p>There are, however, significant clues available in <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/expanded-universe?book-uid=01JTH3Z5HCE277YZKRA13WBXN9#trpg-books">an Exodus companion tabletop role-playing book</a> published earlier this year, which I have to hand. But before I dive into the clues within it, here's more scene-setting explanation from the people making the game.</p>
<p>"Time dilation really only impacts as you start to approach the speed of light," Karpyshyn explains. "When you are travelling within your system, if you're going from Earth to Mars for example, you wouldn't really see the effects of time dilation. Technically it would happen but it'd be hundreds of a second, so it wouldn't be anything anyone would notice. It's more once you get into distances of light years, that's more how it impacts. And that's, again, based on real-world science, so we're trying to follow the rules of actual physics as far as space travel [is concerned]."</p>
<p>As to the question of how much time will pass, the assembled interviewees - which include Archetype studio co-founder Chad Robertson and game director Chris King - are cagey about answering. "It's a dangerous one," says Robertson. "We teased generations," adds King. "We said generations." But how long is a generation? A quick internet search tells me somewhere between 20-30 years.</p>



<p>This tallies with the Exodus TTRPG book. Somewhere near the back, there are tables for a Game Master to use when implementing time dilation-related consequences of their own. These consequences can relate to characters close to the player or they can relate to the world and technological advancements.</p><p>Should you return from an 'exodus' - the game's name for a mission away - with a valuable piece of civilisation-altering technology, for example, you may see it begin to change the world you live in, first hand. You might also see major world events occur which change the shape of the world or societies living in it. World peace could come about, according to another table in the book, or ecological collapse or asteroid strikes or the rise of totalitarian rule.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Here's the Exodus book on my lovely carpet.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a guideline for how much time we're talking about, there are tables related to "anchors" in the game, which are characters the player has a meaningful relation with, which list events in the brackets 0-9 years, 10-30 years, and 31+ years. Events that can occur include people dying or being murdered; people falling in love and marrying and having children; and things like deaths in a family or changing career or self destruction.</p>
<p>There's even a table listing events that can occur long after an "anchor" passes away. Here, consequences are listed in brackets of 0-30 years, 31-100 years, and 101+ years, suggesting much more time can potentially pass. Events in these brackets include biographies being written about that person, or that person becoming a pop culture icon, or even the subject of a film. So when Chris King says "generations" of time can pass, it seems he does mean generations, plural.</p><p>More interestingly, these "anchors" are people you'll consider your best friends, parents, mentors, siblings, partners, and even children, which begs the question of whether the video game will go as far as you having children, too. The passing of time will also probably have an effect on your adventuring companions, too.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Time dilation really only impacts as you start to approach the speed of light"</em></blockquote>
<p>You will gather companions as in a game like Mass Effect, but unlike Mass Effect, your spaceship won't be your travelling hub. Instead, your hub will be on your home planet, meaning that if and when you need to fly away, you'll choose the people you want to travel with - the people who'll experience time as you will. Everyone else will experience time relative to the planet they stayed on, meaning, of course, that you might return to find decades have passed.</p>
<p>"A big difference in, say, Mass Effect, where you hang out on the Normandy quite a bit, [is] we don't really have the same hub structure," King tells me. "You'll go travel in the ship but primarily our hub is back on the home world, so the structure is a little bit different there. But yeah, there's some similarities in terms of getting a ship and going into space and traveling to different places and whatnot.</p><p>"You do bring your companions on the ship with you," he adds. "There are times where you may not bring everyone on a quest. It sort of depends on what's going on. And then when you actually land on a planet, you'll pick two companions that will come join you, but then you can call the other ones if you'd like to swap out or bring someone else in."</p>

<p>Time dilation will be a major part of the Exodus experience, then, and form many of the role-playing conundrums within it - a way of showing you short and longer-term consequences I've been fascinated by in games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>, for example. Time dilation will be a fact of life - and a widely understood risk - for people living in the world.</p>
<p>"They understand it as a phenomenon of their existence," Chad Robertson says, "because it's a real, physical element. And so when Jun [the protagonist] goes on his journeys, much like in Interstellar, they understand that there's going to be some ramification that could happen if things don't go as planned, depending on where the journey goes and how long it lasts. It doesn't make it less shocking; we want it to be shocking to players when there's changes that occur at a big scale, both with the world or with companions and other things.</p>
<p>"We hope the players will accept it once they immerse themselves, that this is just a natural reality of this universe that you have to deal with, and then, my gosh, this decision is something that does matter to me more because I can't control the amount of time passing that may occur based on this journey that I'm about to undertake."</p><p>Exodus is due out in 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X. Notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him">Exodus stars decorated Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey</a> in his first video game role, and it will also, according to Drew Karpyshyn, feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exodus-release-date-moved-thirsty-compaions-mass-effect-comparisons">a roster of "pretty thirsty" game companions</a>.</p>

            <p>The Tomb Raider: Catalyst team has confirmed where the upcoming game sits in the series timeline.</p>
<p>According to game director Will Kerslake, Catalyst - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">which will see the globe trotting Lara Croft heading to Northern India</a> - takes place after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-underworld">Tomb Raider: Underworld</a>. That's the game where Lara pops along to Helheim whilst wielding Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.</p>

<p>"From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld," <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-catalyst-picks-up-years-after-2008s-underworld-finally-continuing-lara-crofts-story-from-the-legend-trilogy-after-almost-two-decades/">Kerslake told GamesRadar+</a>. He added the more recently concluded Survivor reboot trilogy, which saw Lara taking on Trinity in the likes of Siberia and South America, will still serve as Lara's origin story.</p>
<p>"So we're seeing a more experienced Lara Croft," the Catalyst developer said, before adding you won't need to have played or hold a deep knowledge of the other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> to be able to follow along.</p>
<p>"What's important to know is that this is a new chapter in Tomb Raider," he stated. "So whether you followed Lara from the start, or this is your first Tomb Raider game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is designed to stand on its own as an adventure that can be enjoyed by everyone."</p>
<p>If you want a visual representation of how Catalyst and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">newly-announced Legacy of Atlantis remake</a> fit into the unified Tomb Raider timeline, you can check out the infographic by <a href="https://x.com/FeoUltima">@FeoUltima</a> below.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is due to release next year, while Tomb Raider: Catalyst will be arriving on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam in 2027.  </p>
<p>Over the weekend, Lara Croft actress Camilla Luddington passed her bow and arrows over to Alix Wilton Regan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">sharing a farewell post to the character she had embodied for 10 years</a>. "The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget," Luddington wrote. "I could not be prouder of what we created."</p>

            <p>Nothing spreads the festive cheer quite like spooky things, right? Well, ok, I can think of a few other things that are probably higher up the festive list, but for Megabonk fans, spooky is what's on the cards.</p>
<p>Megabonk's "Spooky Update" was initially meant to arrive on a smaller scale around Hallowe'en, but solo developer Vedinad decided they wanted "to make it bigger", and as things grew, naturally so did the work involved. Anyway, while later than first intended, the spooky update for Megabonk is now here.</p>
<p>As for what it includes, along with some general bug fixes such as the Giant Fork's Megacrit not working as intended, this update also adds new items, a new character and a new map.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Megabonk's Spooky Update, as shared by Vedinad, below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>New Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Map</li>
<li>New Character</li>
<li>New Weapon</li>
<li>New Items</li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses</li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork's Megacrit didn't work</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity</li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)</li>
<li>Fixed a "bug" where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings - Will enable certain settings that most players don't need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.</li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won't be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balancing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the "caveman" bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn't be able to spawn close to you or reach you</li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won't be OP</li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile</li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1 percent Poison Damage per level.</li>
<li>Calcium's passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now loses about 25 percent, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6 percent</li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It's to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you're veeeryy late game.</li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16</li>
<li>Dragon's Breath now has 200 percent faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1 percent -&gt; 0.75 percent, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2 percent -&gt; 1.5 percent</li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn't make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet</li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Console</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can press f10 to open the console</li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something</li>

            <p>Total War Attila has seen a surge in players recently, thanks to the 1.0 release of an ambitious mod that totally overhauls the game into a Lord of the Rings grand strategy experience. Titled The Dawnless Days, the mod has led to the largest peak in concurrent players for Attila in almost a decade.</p>
<p>The Dawnless Days, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/totalwarattila/mods/1">which you can download on Nexus Mods now</a>, adds a full War of the Ring campaign to play through on a custom map on Middle Earth. It also adds a variety of playable factions that fit with the setting, as well as points of interest from throughout Tolkien's works. As of writing, Eriador is currently barren and unplayable, though the mod team are working on it!</p>
<p>Looking at SteamDB, you can see that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/325610/charts/#9y">Total War Attila has seen a 24-hour concurrent player peak of 11,248</a>. This is the largest number of concurrent players that game has seen since 2016 during a Sega strategy bundle. If the mod were to beat the all-time peak, it would need to surpass 26,346 concurrent players from back during the game's initial release.</p>

<p>The Dawnless Days mod was originally uploaded to Nexus Mods back in June 2020, and has been receiving consistent updates since then. The Dawnless Days team is looking for 2D artists, 3D artists, and animators <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/totalwarattila/mods/1?tab=posts">according to a recent post</a> on the modding platform, though it's emphasised that they cannot and will not accept donations for the project. This is likely due to copyright concerns - no one wants to see a project like this get DMCA struck, after all.</p><p>Atilla might be getting a lease of life - in a very Gandalf the White sort of way - but elsewhere Creative Assembly is pushing ahead with new Total War projects. The company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPIpN9OKKR4">only recently announced Nagash as the latest lord coming to Total War: Warhammer 3</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-medieval-3-announced-bringing-series-back-to-its-historical-roots-for-25th-anniversary">Total War: Medieval 3 during its 25th anniversary stream</a>. Then of course, who could forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-warhammer-40000-is-finally-actually-real-coming-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc-but-has-no-release-date">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 was announced at The Game Awards last week</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi has stated his latest game, To a T, "didn't sell well" and "wasn't a good fit", expressing the difficulties of releasing more experimental games.</p>
<p>Takahashi is best known for the surreal Katamari Damacy series, which sees players rolling a ball around environments collecting increasingly bigger objects. Takahashi left publisher Namco in 2010 and has since lived in Vancouver and San Francisco while working on other projects.</p>
<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/i-wish-i-had-the-katamari-damacy-ip-to-a-t-was-meant-to-counter-the-downer-vibes-of-2019-america-but-keita-takahashi-says-it-didnt-sell-well-and-fears-it-just-wasnt-a-good-fit/">Games Radar</a>, Takahashi revealed he doesn't own the Katamari Damacy IP (with Namco continuing the series itself). What's more, he's now had to move back to Japan due to To a T's lack of success.</p>

<p>"I don't think anyone tries to make a niche game," said Takahashi of his output. "The title 'niche game' is just a result. I know my games are far from mainstream.</p>
<p>"I recently returned to Japan, and one of the reasons I had to do was because To a T didn't sell well. This is a risk of being independent, and I'm willing to take it, but I don't think it's a question of niche or traditional, it's a question of whether people like it or not."</p>
<p>Takahashi believes there's "still room for new ideas", but "unfortunately To a T just wasn't a good fit".</p>
<p>Published by Annapurna and developed by his own studio Uvula, To a T follows a young child who's stuck in a T pose. It's full of joy and humour, but it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability">also a game about living with a disability</a>.</p>
<p>Takahashi told Games Radar he was inspired by the "downer mood/vibes/atmosphere of the place where we live" and so wanted to "make something very positive and silly".</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, but it's definitely getting harder for me," he said, when asked about the difficulties of releasing experimental games. "If anyone wants to invest in a Uvula, let me know. Let's make more fun and weird games!"</p>
<p>"What ultimately worked for me about To a T, about this frustrating, bewildering, clumsy and ingenious game - and I see this in glimpses, and in little starbursts of my own triggered memories - is its abiding sense of just how luridly weird life is when you're young, how boundless and loosely-ruled it seems," wrote Christian Donlan for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is">Eurogamer about understanding the core of To a T</a>.</p>
