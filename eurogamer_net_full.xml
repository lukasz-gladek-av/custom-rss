            <p>Just weeks after release, an unspecified number of Wildlight's Highguard development team has been laid off.</p>
<p>The studio's live-service hero shooter will not be shut down, Wildlight has confirmed to Eurogamer, but instead be given to a "core group of developers" to keep the game going.</p>

<p>In the statement shared with Eurogamer this morning, Wildlight wrote: "Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game."</p>
<p>The Highguard studio added it is "proud of the team, talent, and the product" it had created. "We're also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community," Wildlight concluded.</p><p>While Wildlight did not say how many members were affected by today's layoffs, posts on the likes of LinkedIn suggest it was the majority of the team. "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">level designer Alex Graner wrote</a>. "This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard."</p>
<p>Tech artist Josh Sobel was also impacted by the Wildlight layoffs. "It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before," <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097">Sobel wrote</a>. "I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ yrs for anything."</p>
<p>In a follow up post, Sobel said they had "LOVED working at Wildlight", and it is now "hard to envision going up from here", likening today's news to the end of a romantic relationship. "You can't think about dating right after a breakup. It wasn't just a gig to me. 2.5yrs of working towards a promising, rose-tinted future, with the most passionate and efficient devs on the planet. We fucking MADE THAT SHIT! Fast."</p>

<p>"I don't think gamers really understand just how special this group of talented devs was. There were stumbles, as any new team would face, but our ability to execute on goals and pivot at a moment's notice was unmatched. I am devastated that this team as a complete unit can no longer be," Sobel continued.</p><p>"We accomplished a lot, and I couldn't be more proud. But it's hard to believe it's over. Hard to believe that this was the result of all our efforts. I wish the best of luck to everyone who remains at Wildlight.</p>
<p>"If the numbers climb, I'll be the first in line to apply again."</p>
<p>"I join my incredible Wildlight teammates in having been laid off," Highguard's social and community lead <a href="https://x.com/alex_frostwolf/status/2021745874435813748">Alex Frostwolf also shared</a>. "Highguard is the story of us: a group of talented, like-minded folks on an adventure into the unknown. Much like our Wardens who get back up after losing a fight, we too will rise again for our next adventures."</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Since its slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>The dataminers were right, there is a warlock class coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, as part of the The Lord of Hatred expansion that arrives in April. I played it at Blizzard a couple of weeks ago, and although I can't tell you in detail about it yet, I can say it's the dark complement to the light-bringing paladin class that's also in Lord of Hatred - the yin to its yang, if you like.</p>
<p>But there are more reasons to be excited about the warlock. One, it's a brand new class for the Diablo series, meaning the warlock has never appeared in any previous games. But two, and this is the show-stopping bit, it's coming to two other Diablo games as well: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a> Resurrected. To emphasise the show-stopping bit there: this is the first new character class Diablo 2 has had in 25 years, and it's being released today in a paid Reign of the Warlock expansion for the game. It costs $25.</p>
<p>The warlock's arrival in Diablo 2: Resurrected begins a new era for the game whereby it will progress beyond its classic state with additional ongoing development. There will effectively be two instances of the game, one known as Diablo 2: Resurrected, the time-locked classical version of the game, and a second modern version called Reign of the Warlock, which will push the game on. Is that a dangerous road to walk? Yes, but as Blizzard told a group of press I was in, "We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa." I will write more about this in a subsequent article. </p>

<p>Blizzard announced the warlock triple-drop in a Diablo Spotlight video today. The other notable major Diablo 4 announcements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fishing mechanic,</li>
<li>A skill-tree overhaul, which significantly expands what's there by adding new skills and potential for customisation</li>
<li>A new endgame pursuit called War Plans, whereby you can make bespoke lists of activities you want to do, modify them, and earn rewards for carrying them out. To me it seems like an evolution of Adventure Mode - a new pursuit to keep you busy once the game's campaigns are done</li>
<li>A "hyper-rare" event called Echoing Hatred, which throws infinite waves of enemies at you and gives you loot depending on how long you survived</li>
<li>The Horadric Cube, which lets you combine materials and items</li>
<li>Loot filters</li>
<li>And the return of Charms and Sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred launches 28th April on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The other notable Diablo 2 announcements are: Enhanced Terror Zones for the game, and new quality of life features including much-desired loot filters, advanced stash tabs, and a loot-tracking database called the Chronicle, which notes everything you've found and where you found it, thank god.

</p><p>Each of the three games' warlock interpretations are different, by the way, tailored to their various gameplay styles. Diablo 2's is perhaps the most fiddly - I have played it too - particularly in the demon taming skill tree, which lets you dominate demons you face and either use them like pets or consume them for power. It's another layer of micro-management.</p>

Meanwhile, Krafton is planning to keep veterans and newcomers alike busy with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> ports of the two previous games.</p>
<p>The surprise news dropped today, 11th February, with the press release announcing we won't even have to wait a full week for the free upgrades to both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Below Zero</a>; they're coming on 17th February. As an extra, a new Subnautica 2 developer vlog, which you can watch below, has been released.</p> <figure>

<p>On Switch 2, Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero are getting "visual and performance upgrades" in the form of 1440p resolution for docked play and 1080p while going handheld; across both modes, the games will run at 60 frames per second. Hopefully, the performance will be consistent and not variable. While generally slow-paced, the Subnautica games are first-person, and their underwater environments can be confusing to fully navigate at times. Under those circumstances, having 60 FPS is a godsend.</p>
<p>There's also talk of "optimized controls" for the Joy-Con 2 controllers that enable "more precise movement, smoother exploration, and refined interaction" with the game worlds, though specifics haven't been shared. We also have to assume the price tags for fresh purchases won't be altered since the updates are completely free.</p><p>Past drama with publisher Krafton aside, developer Unknown Worlds remains at the helm of the Subnautica IP and buzz surrounding the full-blown sequel is still loud, so if you need new oceanic sci-fi adventures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">make sure to keep tabs on it</a>.</p>

            <p>Joy Toy, a popular figurine production company, has announced a line of small-scale Starcraft models as part of a collaboration with Activision Blizzard.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joytoy.com/blog/detail/we-officially-launch-the-starcraft%E2%80%94small-scale-action-figure-collaboration">In a blog post to the official Joy Toy website</a>, the company announced it'll be making models for the Zerg, Protos, and Terran. Exactly what those models are remains a mystery for now, as they're silhouetted in the announcement post. Details on product information and pre-order schedules are set to come in the future via Joy Toy channels.</p>
<p>These figurines will be a compact size of roughly 10cm, with seemingly five available split across the three playable <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> factions.</p>
<p>While it is worth noting that this post explicitly states these models are "based on the characters from the classic game, StarCraft," the announcement does come at an interesting time for Blizzard and the StarCraft IP.</p>
<p>Not only is 2026 a milestone year for Blizzard, with multiple big announcements teased for Blizzcon later this year, but rumours are circulating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-reportedly-partnering-with-nexon-to-revive-starcraft">around a new StarCraft game in-development at Arc Raiders publisher Nexon</a>. If these reports are accurate, this game's development would coincide with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-squashes-hearthstone-2-supicions">big shifts at Hearthstone (though not Hearthstone 2)</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-expansion-brings-players-surging-back">a massive Overwatch resurgence</a>.</p><p>It is, of course, also possible that these figurines are just a nice nostalgic way to show your love for the original StarCraft, and that nothing is going on with StarCraft as the IP remains dormant. It's totally possible. Place your bets, folks!</p>

            <section><p>Tarsier returns to horror with a rich, meaningful evolution of its familiar Little Nightmares formula. And while it could benefit from being a little more radical, it remains utterly compelling; bleak, nasty, and full of menace.</p></section>
<p>It's impossible to talk about Reanimal without talking about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a>. Developer Tarsier's first game since departing the series that put it on the map (part three was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-review">handled elsewhere with middling results</a>) is so Little Nightmares coded it's difficult to ignore. This is a game of two spindly limbed moppets, Boy and Girl, lost in a hellish, hostile world. Play is structured around recurring boss characters and inevitable crescendo pursuits. And Reanimal even shares many of its predecessor's affectations, from the enigmatic opening tease - here the mouldering mouth of a well opening onto a threatening sky - to the way our precocious protagonists return from death huddled together, as if woken from a premonitory dream.</p>

<p>But for all its inarguable similarities, Reanimal also feels like a very different mood. For one, the horrors our burgeoning band of children face are no longer filtered through the softening lens of Burton-esque whimsy. This is a bleak, vicious, violent world, and often genuinely disturbing. And beyond its grimier, nastier tone, it's wildly more ambitious, more experimental too. The first big surprise is the voices - an addition that could have easily undermined its sense of haunted isolation. But from the very first line of dialogue - a meek, accusatory, "I thought you were dead", Tarsier nails the delivery. There are maybe a dozen more lines to come, each more chilling in its strange ambiguity, especially when delivered by - I think? - real children. And then there's the camera; a restless, shifting thing that sees Tarsier breaking away from the constraints of its beloved side-on perspective to frame its cinematic third-person action - its fog-smothered oceans, its flooded streets, its burnt out forests, and forgotten industry - for maximum impact.</p>

<p>We begin, though, on eerie-calm waters, Boy and Girl's early rowboat journey guided through the black of night by screaming gulls and the faint red lights of distant buoys. For a while, it seems Tarsier might have completely broken free of structural tradition, as we drift freely into the unknown; through crumbling abyssal caverns and along winding, mine-littered inlets. But soon enough, as the boat runs aground in the shadow of something like a vast concrete fortress, Reanimal falls into a more familiar rhythm.</p><p>Just like Little Nightmares, Reanimal builds its progress around a series of essentially episodic creature encounters, following a predictable formula of introduction, escalation, and then final confrontation before moving onto the next. And Tarsier has imagined genuinely unsettling horrors here - wretched, tortured creatures warped into ungodly fusions of other more terrible things - that further accentuates its bleaker, meaner, more hopeless tone.</p>
<p>Reanimal's world, too, is a fascinating one. This shattered island, ripped asunder by the ocean, is an unexpectedly contemporary dystopia. Early on, our young siblings find themselves lost amid abandoned industry; desolate rail yards making way for crumbling urban squalor, then forgotten farmland, weather-battered coastlines, and so on. It's a world of carparks and supermarkets, of taxi cabs and school buses, that's at once immediately familiar and entirely alien. And while there's the faintest wisp of a narrative - of humanity and nature locked in a doomed cycle of corruption, perhaps - it's more of a mood piece told through the subtle suggestion of its environmental design than a coherent story.</p>



<p>As to how Reanimal plays, Tarsier largely prioritises forward momentum here, introducing only the gentlest friction. There are simple puzzles - most often wanting you to find this thing, use it here - as well as basic one-button combat, used sparingly to inject a sudden shock of tension. There's a bit of light platforming, even a bit of driving, but the focus is very much on maintaining pace rather than mechanical escalation. Notably, though, progress isn't entirely linear, and the world provides some space to breathe. Occasionally you'll reach an impasse and must explore further afield to find a solution. And each new area is filled with little secrets - half-hidden passageways, mysterious alcoves - for those eager to collect masks, concept art, and other more esoteric things. But Tarsier keeps the reins tight enough that its claustrophobic mood is never allowed to dissipate - even during the handful of more open-ended sailing segments, which mostly serve as a palette cleanser between major areas.</p><p>All in all, it makes for a perfectly solid, if perhaps unremarkable mechanical foundation. Which might be more concerning if it wasn't for Reanimal's relentless pacing. Tarsier's set-piece work, its meticulous choreography, is often properly astonishing - the studio knowing exactly when to switch from foreboding silence to all-out action. I really don't want to spoil too much, but there are some stellar moments here - from a collapsing train-top chase to a precarious cliffside escape blighted by amassing birds. And notably, the combination of tighter controls, sensible checkpointing, and more forgiving failstates means it neatly sidesteps the frequent trial-and-error frustrations of Little Nightmares. And the spectacle of it all, the pure cinema of that shifting camera, ensures it retains a convincing sense of peril even without more frequent game overs.</p>




<p>In fact, given how much it contributes to the experience, Tarsier's camera is worth dwelling on for a little longer. There are moments when you're lost at sea, only for it to pull back for a spectacular reveal as vast shapes emerge through the fog. There's a dizzyingly vertiginous staircase pursuit that, viewed from above, is pure panic as grasping limbs burst up from rising shadows. Sometimes too, Tarsier deploys subtle transitional tricks to throw doubt on Reanimal's spatial cohesion, further unmooring its sense of reality - there's a neat bit involving a bus stop where, simply by tightening the frame, Tarsier shifts the mood entirely. Admittedly, form occasionally exceeds function, leading to moments of frustration - a few times I felt completely lost amid a sweeping vista - but it feels like a small price to pay given how integral Reanimal's roving eye is in building its atmosphere and tension. And if atmosphere is what makes good horror, then Reanimal - with its grim world built from stark shadowplay and searing stabs of red, its grotesque animation work, and its relentlessly oppressive sound design - is killer. This might not be a scary game, but it's full of genuine menace.</p>
<p>All of which has left me wondering why I'm not <em>quite</em> so enamoured with Reanimal as I feel I should be, why by the time it reached its conclusion eight-or-so-hours later, I was left feeling just a little bit unfulfilled. Partly, I think it's down to its wilfully elusive story, whose enigmatic, intentionally anticlimactic ending feels like it's been designed as much for Reddit theorycrafting as it does to provide satisfying narrative resolution (and who knows where the upcoming story DLC will take things). Partly too, I think it's down to Reanimal's episodic framework; the predictable ebb and flow of events it's borrowed straight from Little Nightmares. Familiarity is, perhaps, the enemy of horror, and - for all Tarsier's elaborate choreography - Reanimal's inarguable thrills feel a little undermined by its adherence to routine.</p>

<p>But those are minor concerns in the greater scheme, and there's so much here I adore. Reanimal is a game of phenomenal mood and artistry, and it builds on a familiar foundation in a way that feels like genuinely meaningful evolution, even if it might ultimately have benefitted from being more radical. And while I won't pretend to fully understand the depth of its enigma, Tarsier's latest is a dark, violent, and grimly compelling journey through a remarkable vision of something like hell.</p>

            <p>Last summer, we were promised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead">the first-ever Hellraiser video game</a> somehow wasn't an asymmetrical online multiplayer one. Instead, publisher and developer Saber Interactive confirmed it was a story-driven, first-person horror adventure.</p>
<p>Since that first reveal, we've seen the game a few times, but a meatier trailer hadn't arrived... until now. Ahead of Valentine's Day, of all things, the Cenobites are back, and the game's new trailer is all about the love story at the centre of the whole mess.</p> <figure>

<p>Needless to say, the protagonist, Aidan, isn't having a great time after falling in love with the wrong girl, someone who's grown obsessed with the Genesis Configuration, one of the "fun" little puzzle boxes that can summon Pinhead and their demonic peers. Of course, longtime fans of the wildly uneven movie series know the Cenobites aren't the worst which can come from the Labyrinth and other hellscapes... unless you strike a deal with them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like Aidan <em>will have to strike a deal with them</em> in hopes of saving his partner, who may or may not be doomed already. The trailer doesn't fully explain why he's doing everything he's doing, but, uh, he's hurting some people (and other monstrosities) pretty bad after meeting with Pinhead. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551980/Clive_Barkers_Hellraiser_Revival/">The game's official description</a> mentioned battling cultists "devoted to the Cenobites," so that explains things <em>at least</em> a bit.</p><p>Perhaps the most fun part of the gameplay shown so far is that Aidan can use the Genesis Configuration to get otherworldly help and inflict extreme pain on his enemies... while trying to dodge horrifying deaths himself. Fun for the whole family ahead!</p>
<p>Hellraiser: Revival is currently targeting a release on PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. No launch window beyond 2026 has been set at the time of writing though.</p>

            <p>Riot Games is "downsizing" a substantial number of developers from the team that has been working on 2XKO, the fighting game that only launched less than a month ago. Roughly 80 staff will be either transferred to other teams at Riot, or laid off with six months' severance pay.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">In a statement posted on the Riot Games website</a>, 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon broke the news to the public. Cannon wrote that following the console release "overall momentum hasn't reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term," despite enticing a core audience of dedicated players.</p>
<p>This "smaller, focused" team will be focusing on key improvements to the game, according to Cannon. Additional plans will seemingly be shared soon, though it's worth noting this statement comes shortly after a <a href="https://x.com/Play2XKO/status/2016949629376712831">post by game director Shaun Rivera </a>stated the game's systems were: "unfortunately making the game feel way too sharp and overwhelming for some players", indicating significant gameplay changes in the near future.</p>

</figure>
<p>Cannon's post continues, reassuring fans 2XKO's competitive circuit would continue as planned, thanking those on the team impacted by this decision, and pledging to continue communicating about "how things are progressing".</p>
<p>On social media, 2XKO developers hit by these cuts shared the news and expressed their disappointment. Patrick Miller, who spent a decade working on 2XKO, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pattheflip.bsky.social/post/3meh7ko2g2k2g">revealed he was laid off with 30-minutes' notice yesterday</a>. As was <a href="https://x.com/Blinkity">lead champion designer Alex Jaffe</a>, who spent eight years working on the title, <a href="https://x.com/davidboltonart/status/2021053759179325909">senior character artist David Bolton</a>, and many others.</p><p>Riot, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/riot-lays-off-2xko-developers-less-than-three-weeks-after-release-overall-momentum-hasnt-reached-the-level-needed-to-support-a-team-of-this-size/">speaking to PC Gamer</a>, said that the 80 staff impacted is not an exact nor final figure, as some laid off staff will be able to find other positions at Riot Games following these cuts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42pmgfmr340">Content Creator Rooflemonger also claims</a> to have been told that a follow-up statement by Riot will go into the specifics of the "focuses of 2XKO moving forward", and "nothing they have committed to is going away".</p>
<p>How exactly 2XKO will continue to, let's say, release five champions in 2026 as previously established (more than competitors like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>) with its team cut in half remains unclear. How Riot expects to retain the same scope of development is puzzling. Eurogamer contacted Riot Games for clarification on how exactly this would pan out, and was referred to the aforementioned statement and its mention that additional communication is coming.</p>
<p>These layoffs raise questions about the confidence of Riot Games when it comes to newer projects. The decisions cannot be discussed without considering the past few years of releases - and cancellations - at the company.</p>

</figure>
<p>These cuts to the 2XKO team echo <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/riot-lays-off-530-staff-riot-forge-shutting-down">Riot's 2024 decision to layoff vast swathes of the Legends of Runeterra team</a>, sunsetting the game's development and pivoting it towards a PvE model. According to CEO Dylan Dajeda, the game hadn't: "performed as well as we [needed] it to, despite our best efforts". That same year, Riot Games shuttered its Riot Forge publishing arm, with Dajeda writing that the company didn't "view this as core to our strategy moving forward."</p><p>Let's not forget Hytale, a game Riot Games <a href="https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/hypixel-studios-reveals-hytale-1203089201/">had invested millions of dollars</a> into, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">before cancelling the project and winding down Hypixel Studios in June of last year</a>. Hytale would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">acquired by Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme in November</a>, and not even three months later release into Early Access to reach <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HytaleInfo/comments/1qc1ogo/simon_confirms_that_28_million_people_are/">a concurrent player count at launch of around 2.8 million players</a>.</p>
<p>For the sake of fairness, Riot Games is certainly capable of great decisions, and employs many talented developers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> remains a juggernaut in its genre, Valorant both on PC and consoles remains a smash hit for the company, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teamfight-tactics">Teamfight Tactics</a> doesn't receive the praise it deserves despite being a major, persistent cash cow for the publisher. That severance package is also very generous, so I don't want to paint Riot unfairly here. It's a business, after all.</p>
<p>It's also worth applauding the fact 2XKO was in development for almost a <em>decade</em>. While the team size has shifted over the years from its R&amp;D period to the game we have today, funding a fighting game and paying for American salaries for such a vast amount of time would have been a substantial investment. Having the faith in your team, so much faith to support a total top-to-bottom redesign from a 1v1 fighter to a 2v2 tag fighter a few years ago, does take guts. Let it not be said that Riot isn't willing to make big bets on underdogs - 2XKO is anything but an industry-trend led product.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Even with some of Riot's most popular characters, the game itself is niche. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Riot Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But in terms of what sort of audience its games will attract, and the company's ability to stick with them, there's an obvious disconnect with reality. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">2XKO is a great game</a>, made by people clearly knowledgeable about what fighting game fans want. Ask any of those fans how vast the audience appeal of a 2v2 tag fighter is, though, and the answer will be unanimous: it's a niche market.</p><p>What's especially painful is, there's probably not a worse time to make such cuts. Riot Games has, through funding such a lengthy development process, done the hard part. It has paid for a bold new video game. But pulling such a substantial amount of staff from the game just weeks after release is essentially an ambulance siren to all casual players - the crowd seemingly missing from the picture here. I appreciate we're talking about spending millions more on a non-certain bet, and I imagine there could be a big red number on some balance sheet in Los Angeles somewhere. But hell, you built this thing and invested millions already - why take the bat to it now?</p>
<p>Taking a glass-half-full perspective, keeping 80 staff on 2XKO does imply there's still hope from upper management the team can turn things around. But anyone with any familiarity with the live service market knows that casual, fair-weather players can smell bad news a mile away. It does not instil confidence. Live service is a battle for people's time, not just their money, and seeing such cuts when a game comes out may prove repellent.</p>
<p>What needs to happen in my view is clear. We know there'll be future communications about the future of 2XKO soon. This needs to happen <em>very</em> soon. There must be a pledge that 2XKO will still have support beyond 2026. Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, Warframe, and Rainbow Six Siege prove that a rough start is not necessarily fatal. Some longevity and stability can attract interest.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Fallout 76 was an undeniable disaster at launch, but with time and hard work, that ship was steered in a good direction. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Bethesda Softworks</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Fighting game fans are already pretty sad about these cuts, largely because many of the impacted developers were pulled from fighting game communities in the US. It's like trying to support a local pub after your best mate was fired, it leaves a sour taste for the most entrenched. For casuals, for whom this news could be the first major thing they hear about the game, it's an appetite killer. For League of Legends fans, they've gone through similar events before. The discussion must - must - be refocused on how the game is absolutely not dead ASAP.</p><p>Ultimately, I'm worried on two fronts. I'm primarily concerned for the developers, who made an excellent fighting game and were laid off because growth projections from corporate <em>didn't match reality,</em> or something equally video games in 2026, but I'm also concerned that this pattern of missteps will result in long-lasting consequences for future Riot projects. And affect more developers, in turn.</p>
<p>What is a potential player who is excited for, let's say, the upcoming Riot Games MMO meant to think when they see that the company is so eager to pull the plug on live service games if they don't <em>immediately </em>shake the genre to its core? What is someone who spent £100 on 2XKO Arcane cosmetics meant to feel when prompted to spend money on future Riot ventures?</p>
<p>If Riot Games wants to reignite community confidence in its games, it needs to actually hunker down and release a new one without throwing it down the drain so soon. Creating a live service game is already a nightmare, but this approach threatens to sour the well for not only 2XKO, but future projects in the works there.</p>

            <p>Supermassive Games' Lashana Lynch-starring survival horror Directive 8020 has landed itself a new release date.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassive-games-delays-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020-following-layoffs">After an earlier delay</a>, it is now due to arrive across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC (via Steam) on 12th May, the team has announced.</p>
<p>To accompany this news, Supermassive has also released a new trailer, which gives us all a look at Directive 8020's choice-based narrative, such as should you as the ship's medic Cooper save fellow crew member Engineer Cernan who is in peril, or abandon them to a grizzly end. "Every choice has a consequence," the developer warns, so choose wisely.</p>
<p>You see, previous decisions can reshape situations in Directive 8020. So, in the case of Cooper, they could now have a gun, and when they potentially come face to face with two identical versions of Engineer Cernan, the player has to decide which one is real. "One choice will prove fatal," Supermassive states.</p>
<p>As well as all this, the latest Directive 8020 trailer also gives us a look at on-planet gameplay. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>In a first for Supermassive's Dark Pictures Anthology, Directive 8020 will also include a new feature known Turning Points, which allows you to more easily rewind and revisit key moments in the story. This will be handy for those completionists among us. There will also be a Survivor Mode, which means "no safety nets" and every death is permanent.</p>
<p>Those interested can pre-order Directive 8020 via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10008357">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/directive-8020/9pf9qdh98k8l">Xbox Series X/S</a> now. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2255370/Directive_8020/">Steam</a> pre-orders will be coming "soon", Supermassive has said. Pre-orders include access to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Dark Pictures Outfit Pack</li>
<li>The Dark Pictures Collectables</li>
<li>Cinematic Filter Pack</li>
<li>Digital Soundtrack</li>
<li>Digital Artbook</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassives-dark-pictures-series-returns-in-2025-with-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020">Directive 8020 will be a continuation of the studio's Dark Pictures series</a>, which started with Man of Medan, followed by Little Hope, House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me. Lynch has taken the lead role of "ground-breaking astronaut" Young.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula">saw the game in action at Gamescom 2024</a>, calling it a "notable upgrade to the Dark Pictures Anthology's formula".</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has been around long enough now to have a "subculture" of its own. For the most part, millions of players have swarmed into Embark Studios' hit extraction shooter because most raiders found topside are... surprisingly nice. So far, the developers have been fostering a welcoming community even if PvP is an option, and the new event is all about experimenting with PvE further.</p>
<p>On 9th February, Embark announced the 'Shared Watch' event with <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2020905547927552273?s=20">a cute little trailer</a>, and the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0">patch notes</a> released the following day confirmed a substantial update before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shares-early-2026-roadmap-escalation-content-updates">February's 'Shrouded Sky' content update</a> continues to escalate the Arc threat. Saint Valentine's nears, so let's be good to each other.</p>
<p>What is it exactly about, you might ask? "Players will earn merits from destroying, assisting and damaging ARC and earn rewards. No merits will be earned from PvP encounters." You know what to do if you want to maximize your grind and meta progression!</p>
<p>The official post describes the Shared Watch as "an annual holiday that reminds us of the true enemy," so expect it to be a yearly tradition. For the most part, the solo queues have been quite peaceful since launch, with most raiders choosing to help fellow scavengers. Uncommon evildoers aside, that's been a fantastic way to enjoy Arc Raiders in a more relaxed, less sweaty manner. It's good to see Embark play around with the game's core premise in conversation with the community though.</p><p>Before those who favour PvP encounters start whining about the studio paying a bit too much attention to the calmer side of Speranza recently, let's remember late January gave high-level players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you">the opportunity to join even tougher versus-centric lobbies</a>, so this feels natural if you ask me. In spite of all its success, Arc Raiders is still in its infant months, and with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-marathon-cosmetics-and-content-details-chinese-event">Bungie's Marathon soon coming in hot with a stronger focus on PvP</a>, it'll be interesting to see how Embark reacts to the community's movements.</p>
<p>As surprise extras, the 1.15.0 update also adds two new cosmetic sets and brings back the Cold Snap map condition, as we're still technically in wintertime. Of course, more tweaks and bug fixes are part of the package, and we'd be surprised if there are no more minor patches before this month's major Escalation update.</p>

            <p>When Pokopia was announced, most people drew a couple of quick comparative conclusions from its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_bYri9p1Uk">first cutesy trailer</a>. There was much to be said in reaction, but the broad deduction can be efficiently summarised as this: Pokopia is Pokémon's take on Animal Crossing. It quickly transpired, also, that the game shares development staff with Dragon Quest Builders, a Minecraft-inspired spin-off of another major turn-based Japanese role-playing franchise.</p>
<p>Simple enough, then. Pokopia is Pokémon, plus Minecraft, plus Animal Crossing. Except it isn't. Except <em>it is</em>. Except it isn't. After a hands-on, I suppose I can happily conclude that it is indeed those things - <em>and</em> more. And that more? Oh, it's only one of the best, most criminally underrated games about raising critters ever made. Step forward, Xbox 360 gem <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viva-piata">Viva Pinata</a>.</p>
<p>As someone who absolutely adores Viva Pinata, I actually feel like a bit of an idiot for not clocking the similarity sooner. In hindsight, the extended trailer for Pokopia makes it more obvious - but it was only sitting down and playing around an hour of the game that it <em>really</em> clicked.</p>

<p>It's in game flow that the two are most similar. In Pokopia, Pokémon aren't caught in Poke Balls and carried around with you - and nor should they be, given you play a Ditto that has haphazardly attempted to transform into its former owner. Instead, it's all about the habitat of the area around you. Each Pokémon in the Pokopia Pokédex will be attracted to appear if certain conditions are met.</p><p>You'll start off slow, simply creating patches of long grass. Any Pokémon head of any age knows that Pokémon love a bit of long grass. That'll attract your most basic critters - but then as you want to attract more, the requirements will gradually increase. Some Pokémon might want to be near bodies of water, or in long grass that is shaded at the base of a tree. Others aren't even after the natural world - fighting-type Hitmonchan needs a would-be Gym, meaning a punching bag or similar plus a bench to sit at and rest,no grass required.</p>
<p>When Pokémon join the island, a handful of them will also provide you new abilities. Initially Bulbasaur will teach you Leafage, a move that Ditto can then use to create long grass. Squirtle will teach you Water Gun, which can then be used to revive dried-out areas. You can imagine how these abilities will grow - and these are your Minecraft-esque abilities for shaping the world, be that adding, removing, or shaping terrain. There are a handful of these in the early stages I played, though it's clear the game will feature many more - though not as many as there are Pokémon; only some have a new move to bequeath.</p>
<p>As well as building up habitats that Pokémon will want to come and live in, the secondary thread is the ruined areas in which you're operating. While the demo gave away no actual detailed answer as to their nature, to my eye these areas are clearly locations from across the Kanto map of the first generation of Pokémon RPGs - but they're in a ruined, almost post-apocalyptic state. How that happened isn't clear, but all the humans are gone and the Pokémon are clearly in hiding - so it's up to you to rebuild.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Splashing some water around to turn dead grass into verdant green and to revive ruined trees is one thing, but beyond that there are also the buildings. In the demo, I have the opportunity to collect the resources to rebuild a Pokémon Center.  Rather than directly 'rebuilding' it out of blocks in a Minecraft way, I have to deposit the resources into a chest in front of the ruined building and then assign Pokémon from the friends I have attracted to the nearby area to assist in building. Because all Pokémon are different, some Pokémon are going to be more suited for building certain structures than others. On top of this you can place individual blocks - but it seems the buildings will be a more prefab affair.</p><p>With this, the delightful and instantly sticky loop of Pokopia is revealed. You'll need to recruit more Pokémon in order to help you to restore more of the areas, which in turn is required to progress to unlock the skills or items you'll need in order to attract even more types of Pokémon. Round and round it goes.</p>
<p>It's delightfully simple, and it is also immediately satisfying and addictive. Although the core story looks as though it'll hand-hold you through objectives with helpful chatty Pokémon advising you on what to do next - kid friendly, in other words - going beyond that feels quite intuitive. You can find little hints in the environment that add Pokédex entries that give you clues as to what environmental cues are going to be required to get somebody new to spawn, and you can then figure out how to achieve that. You'll also want to work at keeping the friends who've already arrived happy - so one Pokémon might want a toy or some other sort of environmental upgrade near their habitat, which in turn improves their happiness, a measured stat that details just how nice of a home you're maintaining.</p>
<p>These things crop up and so off I go, trotting about this limited starting area - finding resources to use the rudimentary crafting table mechanic, completing challenges listed in the Pokedéx to get currency to buy useful items for improving happiness or creating new habitats. Attracting new Pokémon, discovering a new habitat hint and getting excited about it… the time then just disappears. The conditions of my hands-on stipulates some things I can't talk about, as is normal - but the funny thing is I didn't see a lot of those things anyway, because my own curiosity dragged me off the main path and away from any of the revelations - the sign, I think, of a winner.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are those more contemporary Minecraft-esque elements too, of course, clearly using technology and skills honed when much of this team worked on Dragon Quest Builders. In a multiplayer session, we needed to get one particular Pokémon from one landmass to another, over water. This is not a Pokémon that can safely swim, nor can it fly. In the end, our team of four players worked together to smash a bunch of blocks out of the side of a mountain, using it to create a bridge the creature could gingerly cross.</p><p>My point being that building block stuff is absolutely there, and perhaps as the game progresses such strategy and building will become a more core part of the flow. There's also the Animal Crossing esque stuff, which I didn't reach in this build - having a house, decorating the interior, etcetera. There is clearly more than the loop I describe - but my hands-on gave me the impression that of all the games this shares a similarity to, it's that Viva Pinata loop which is at Pokopia's heart - and goodness, it really rather works.</p>
<p>I've been doing this job for a long time, and I've done a lot of pre-launch hands-ons. I also think my radar is pretty good; I don't have to play a game for too long, most of the time, to get a broad idea of what it is about. But in this hands-on I wasn't checking how much time I had left, or looking over my shoulder to see what PR was up to. I just slipped <em>into the zone</em>. In my experience this is almost always a hallmark of a properly brilliant game.</p>
<p>Mechanics I love mashed up with characters and a world I also have a great affinity for. I haven't felt this way about a Pokémon game since Conquest, the 2012 strategy crossover with Nobunaga's Ambition. That was a serviceable tactical RPG that I loved a little extra because of the way it used Pokémon's world, characters, and mechanics. My hope now is that Pokopia isn't like that - I suspect it might be more. An <em>excellent</em> spin-off… that also has that Pokémon secret sauce. Next month, we'll know if my suspicions are correct.</p>

            <p>
And here we go again! Barely a month into 2026, developer Hello Games is back with another major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, kicking off its tenth anniversary year in style. Assuming your idea of style is trucking, hauling, and tossing stuff around with gravity guns. that is (it's certainly mine).
</p>
<p>
All the above arrives today, 11th February, as part of No Man's Sky new Remnant update - which, by my reckoning and terrible maths, is the exploratory space sim's 39th major update. Following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-space-wreck-salvaging-and-expanded-ship-building-as-its-busy-year-continues">December's Breach release</a>, Remnant is all about hauling; or more specifically, it's about industrial enterprise - processing scrap into "rare and highly prized resources".

<p>
That might not sounds as immediately enticing as, say, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-adds-fully-customisable-multi-crew-spaceships-you-can-build-and-fly-with-your-friends">fully customisable multi-crew space ships</a>, but read the fine print and it starts to get a lot more exciting. For one, Remnant introduces trucks, tipping flatbeds, and haulers players can construct and customise, cramming them full of salvage and debris to cart back to new Waste Processing Plants for reclamation. As Hello Games explains, "Build your own brightly coloured incinerators, spider legged sci-fi explorer, or heavily armed military vehicles with tank tracks."
</p><p>
Key to all this hauling is the new Gravitino Coil, a powerful anti-gravity module for the good ol' multi-tool that, says Hello Games, turns No Man’s Sky "into a physics playground". With the Gravitino Coil equipped, players can hoist, fling, and carry large objects - which, continues the studio, creates a "fun and tactile new loop of searching for wrecks, loading trucks full of cargo and hauling across the alien landscape to industrial yards to gain new loot and rewards." Just watch out for the highly volatile scrap during transportation. Oh, and if you were wondering, yes, it IS possible to use the Gravitino Gun as a weapon - just pluck up something heavy (Sentinels included) and throw.

Last but not least, Remnant brings a new limited-time Expedition. This community focused event tasks travellers with tidying up and reclaiming a planet covered in wrecks and salvage. Rewards for completion include "dozens" of vehicle parts, plus a new armour set incorporating padded fabrics and ornate steam punk detailing. Full <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/remnant-update">update patch notes can be found here</a>.
</p>
<p>

As for what else Hello Games has in store for No Man's Sky's tenth anniversary celebrations, that remains a mystery for now. All it's saying currently is its customary closing teaser, "More will follow... Our journey continues." And might 2026 also be the year we finally learn more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">the studio's intriguing procedural planet sim Light No Fire</a>? We shall see!

            <p>Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is almost here, and that means we'll be hearing more and more about it in the coming weeks as the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">breaks into Steam's top sellers</a> and gets more folks talking. Regardless of what ends up happening after launch, it seems the relaunched marketing campaign is working wonders in the post-<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> era.</p>
<p>Now, via <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ">Marathon HQ</a>, we've learned new details on the game's customisation and weapon options. Moreover, it appears that Chinese influencers, streamers, and games media <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ/status/2021252272982753431">were mostly blown away</a> by what they saw during a recent event.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>When it comes to launch-day skins, it seems the game will feature <em>at least</em> six skins for each Runner, one based on each faction. The X/Twitter post above shows screens from the event and some of those early cosmetics. Considering how paper-thin other multiplayer games are on that front at launch, Bungie might be off to a great start when it comes to unlockables.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ/status/2021252272982753431">full rundown of information</a> extracted from the event is even juicier, as it reveals 28 guns with "two or more skins" will be available at launch; some cosmetics even alter the model, so you won't have to wait very long to get substantial visual redesigns. On that front, there was praise for the "massive upgrade" the game's overall look has received since last year, with many voices saying the environments are "giving off a much darker and mysterious tone."</p><p>When it comes to systems and mechanics, it looks like the skills and perks are fairly flexible when it comes to builds, something worth taking into account when you team up with a group of Runners. Another highlight was how expensive meds and shields were, at least during this preview session, with early-game PvP also being described as a "guaranteed loss" even if it's tempting to take on human enemies that are described as "loot pinatas."</p>

<p>The PvE crowd might also be in for a surprise, as it appears the NPC enemies are ruthless and "constantly calling in reinforcements" instead of going offline once a hot area is cleared. On top of that, watch your surroundings, since "environmental hazards like poison gas vents, perimeter turrets, and landmines are everywhere as well."</p>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-new-footage-impressions-chinese-event-seasons-roguelike/">Wccftech</a> also shared some extra tidbits from the event, with a special focus on the game's ongoing narrative, which will be told through "roguelike adventure" seasons during which players have to get stronger to tackle increasingly difficult runs as mysteries unfold. As a reminder, if you're killed in action, you'll lose your valuable loot and equipment.</p><p>At this point, it's safe to say Marathon's take on the extraction shooter subgenre will be completely different from Arc Raiders, so it'll be interesting to see how these two heavy hitters coexist together if Bungie's latest doesn't land with a thud.</p>

            <p>Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Ellie in Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and its sequel The Last of Us Part 2, has shared her thoughts on the divisive second season of HBO's TV adaptation.</p>
<p>While the first season of The Last of Us was met with praise, the show seemed to falter a bit with season two. There were a few quibbles, with many debating whether or not the TV team was right to reveal Abby's motivations so early in the season, among other issues with pacing, character development and so on. </p>
<p>But, season two was always going to be a tricky board to tread. Even the award-winning The Last of Us Part 2 received some very vocal pushback on its release in 2020. So, what does Johnson make of the renewed discussions around The Last of Us following season two's release last year?</p>
<p>"I feel like with The Last of Us, people really love that story, including me, and it's very, very passionate fans. And sometimes that passion feels really great, and sometimes it feels not great," Johnson told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-ashley-johnson-backlash">The Direct</a>. "But you know, I understand it. I understand loving something so much, and wanting it to be what you want it to be."</p><p>Johnson added it "can be hard sometimes", because "when you are making these things, and on your side of things, you're passionate about it, and excited about it, and hopefully those two things can meet". However, the actor noted that sometimes "they do not", and this can be difficult.</p>
<p>"I mean, anytime you're working on anything, you want people to like it, and you want people to love it as much as you," Johnson explained. "But I love The Last of Us in every form, and I am so happy that I get to be a part of [telling] that story."</p>
<p>As well as her part in bringing the games to life, Johnson also had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-the-last-of-us-episode-nine">cameo in the first season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, as Ellie's mother.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer. While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p><p>As for the future of the series, it is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">suspected the upcoming third season will be its last</a>. Since then, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-third-and-perhaps-final-season-adds-two-new-cast-members">Clea DuVall and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. will both join The Last of Us for the show's upcoming season</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2's biggest shockers</a> was having Wasteland veteran <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-veteran-ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-dollars-and-a-sandwich-for-his-voiceover-work-in-the-original-game">Ron Perlman</a> (who's done voice acting for the entire game series) show up in a quick cameo role as a mysterious CGI'd super mutant.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers for Fallout's Season 2 finale ahead.</strong></p>
<p>After the last episode, which dropped last week, we didn't get any answers regarding this new player or where the teased "war" might be going. We know the Fallout universe has a lot going on beyond the current scope of the show, and while it seems we'll eventually get to see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-ending-explained-your-biggest-burning-questions-answered">even the giant mech Liberty Prime</a> one way or another, we'd be surprised if the creatives manage to cram every iconic bit of the games into the live-action adaptation.</p>
<p>That said, co-showrunner and writer Geneva Robertson-Dworet revealed during <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">an interview for The Direct</a> the plan is to have more of Ron Perlman's super mutant helper in the show: "I hope people know that he is a larger character in this world, in our minds." She also went on to underline she's always seen him "as a big role" that's part of their tendency to hint at wars happening elsewhere in the Wasteland.</p><p>It might be a while before he shows up again though, as those conflicts "maybe aren't in the region of the Wasteland where our characters currently are." Perlman's green-skinned guy has been seen helping The Ghoul near New Vegas, however, so we'd be shocked if he is nowhere to be seen in Season 3 even if the larger war the showrunners are hinting at isn't on the immediate horizon.</p>
<p>First up, Lucy and Maximus will have to deal with the Legion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-funko-pop-might-have-just-spoiled-a-fallout-season-2-plot-point">after its change in leadership</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://collider.com/fallout-season-2-finale-explained-colorado-location-geneva-robertson-dworet-frances-turner/">The Ghoul is heading to Colorado</a>... but that may also take a while to pan out.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">full chat with The Direct</a> is an interesting read that goes into more of the world-building ambitions of the team behind the show. For example, the powers that be aren't shying away from stating the Brotherhood of Steel might have a larger role moving forward and as we get to see other chapters.</p>
<p>It's a world of possibility out there, and as long as the show's ratings <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">remain healthy</a>, I'm sure both Bethesda and Amazon MGM Studios are happy to keep it going.</p>

            <p>SFB Games, the creator of acclaimed PS1-style retro-horror <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crow-country">Crow Country</a>, has a new game coming this year: The Mermaid Mask. It's a follow-up to the equally acclaimed detective game Tangle Tower and, according to SFB, will arrive on PC and consoles this summer. Better yet, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1696770/The_Mermaid_Mask/">a demo available for The Mermaid Mask on Steam</a> now.</p>
<p>Tangle Tower, a vibrant, illustrative-style point-and-click murder mystery, came out in late 2019 and has had <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/359510/Tangle_Tower/">an Overwhelmingly Positive reception on Steam</a>; we didn't review it, sadly. The Mermaid Mask is very much the same thing, billed as the next instalment in this Detective Grimoire series. It tells the tale of a legendary submarine captain who has been suddenly killed - a mystery you must get to the bottom of.</p>

<p>Voice actors Edwyn Tiong (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/loco-motive-review">Loco Motive</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/harold-halibut-review">Harold Halibut</a>) and Amber Lee Connors (Demon Slayer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>) feature, with more cast to be revealed soon.</p>
<p>"We've been working on The Mermaid Mask for a long time - never before have we poured so much love and care into a single project, and it's become something quite remarkable," commented creative director Adam Vian in a press release.</p>
<p>"In 2024, our survival-horror game Crow Country became a surprise hit, which diverted our attention a little longer than we'd initially intended (a good problem to have, as Crow Country was wonderfully well received)."</p>
<p>Vian added that this is a "self-contained" entry in the series so no prior knowledge of Tangle Tower is necessary.</p>
<p>Crow Country came out in 2024 and turned heads with its PS1-style visuals. But as we discovered in our review, nostalgia wasn't the only thing the game had going for it. "More than just its nostalgic visuals, Crow Country is funny, self-aware, and extremely hard to put down," we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crow-country-review">our four-star Crow Country review</a>.</p>

            <p>Mewgenics, the latest release by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, launched yesterday. Within six hours the game sold over 150k copies, made back its development costs, and leaped to the top of Steam's Top Sellers list.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot">Speaking to IGN</a>, Glaiel revealed that the game has already a bigger release than any of the expansions for The Binding of Issac, the prior game released by the duo and itself an indie darling.</p>
<p>Mcmillen revealed that prior to Mewgenics, The Binding of Issac: Rebirth sold 40k copies on its release date, while Mewgenics sold 152k in its first five hours. He added: "Isn't that kind of insane?" The original Binding of Isaac <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-sold-700-000-copies">managed to sell over 700k copies in less than a year</a> after launch, an impressive figure that's on track to be beaten in short order.</p>

<p>Since its release yesterday, the game<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/"> leaped to a peak concurrent player count of 65,962 on Steam</a>. In addition, it has beaten out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s big relaunch on Steam's Top Selling page. That game is no slouch by the way, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-expansion-brings-players-surging-back">itself seeing new peaks not seen in years</a>.</p><p>Mewgenics, for those unaware, is a cat-focused tactical Rogue-like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">which Eurogamer previewed recently</a> with much acclaim and praise. In it, Christian Donland wrote: "If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in."</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch, both Mcmillen and Glaiel celebrated with a custom Mewgenics cake, which you can see below. Eurogamer enquired into what sort of cake this was, and has been told via a PR spokesperson it was a vanilla cake with chocolate bits. Lovely.</p> <div>

            <p>The poorly-received Dino Crisis-like Code Violet has a sequel in the pipeline.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Code Violet, it's a third-person action horror game from TeamKill Media, which places you in the shoes of Violet Sinclair as she faces down "ferocious prehistoric dinosaurs and hostile forces". And, well, it hardly set the world alight on its debut earlier this year.</p>
<p>But, despite this less than enthusiastic response, TeamKill Media has revealed it's already started work on "the next chapter of Violet's story", citing the, erm, "overwhelming success" of Code Violet.</p>
<p>"We're actively progressing on several exciting projects, with more announcements and reveals coming your way very soon," the Code Violet team wrote, before stating it was now developing a sequel known as Code UltraViolet.</p>
<p>"We're incredibly excited about what's ahead and can't wait to bring you along for the journey," <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/2021293486377431222">the studio closed</a>. "Stay tuned!"</p>
<p>This is somewhat surprising to hear, given that Code Violet hardly won scores of praise from critics and players on its debut earlier this year. As noted by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/awful-ps5-dino-shooter-code-violet-will-get-a-sequel-for-some-reason">PushSquare</a>, TeamKill's latest release has an overall critic score of 29 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/code-violet/">Metacritic</a>, and a 2.6 user score. Meanwhile, over on the PS Store, it's got <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP5503-PPSA26528_00-0656994000407395">a 2.88 player rating</a> from confirmed buyers. Of those reviews, 36 percent only gave Code Violet one star (though, 31 percent awarded it the full five stars).</p><p>"Game is utter garbage. Needs to be removed from this planet, so no one else falls for this scam in purchasing it. PlayStation store should definitely refund everyone that has purchased it," reads a one star Code Violet user review on the PS Store.</p>
<p>Have you played Code Violet? And, if you have, are you keen to see a sequel?</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A revitalised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>) is bringing players back, propelling the game to most-watched status on streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and to being one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most played games on Steam</a> - comfortably above copycat hero-shooter Marvel Rivals. There was even a queue to log in to Overwatch when I played yesterday evening, which is something I've never seen before.</p>
<p>Currently there are <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/overwatch-2">nearly 100,000 people watching Overwatch streams on Twitch</a>, making it the most viewed game by some way, with nearly 30,000 more viewers than second-place game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>. Meanwhile on Steam, Overwatch peaked at 165,000 players, putting it briefly in the top 10. It's currently 13th, nearly 10 places ahead of genre rival Marvel Rivals, which has trumped Overwatch on Steam for a long time.</p>
<p>Note, however, that Overwatch is not only available on Steam. The predominant platform for play is Battle.net, which is presumably where the bulk of the audience lies. Should the jump in activity on Steam reflect the jump in activity on Battle.net, then, the actual number of Overwatch players is presumably much higher.</p>
<p>The renewed Overwatch activity is due to an expansion-like release, The Reign of Talon, which arrived yesterday. It's the game's first expansion and heralds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">the beginning of a new yearly expansion-era for Overwatch</a>, which Blizzard will release in addition to more regular Season updates.</p><p>Season 1 - the kick-off season for Reign of Talon - brings five new heroes to the game at once, which is an unprecedented amount for Overwatch, and Blizzard plans to add five more new heroes over the course of the year. These aren't the only changes to the game, though, with major user interface reworks and story-related changes present as well.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1segu/so_death_chandelier/">So… Death Chandelier???</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Synodii/">u/Synodii</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/">Overwatch</a> </blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>But it's the new heroes that everyone is talking about - notably the new flying hero Jetpack Cat, who has the meta-shaking new ability to tow other characters through the air. All of the combo possibilities of this are currently being felt out. Among them, lifting a spinning, Ultimate-ing Reaper above a team to prevent them hiding behind cover; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1omoi/behold_the_jetpack_cat_reinhardt_duel/">airlifting the hammer-swinging Reinhardt through the air to duel other airlifted Reinhardts</a>; and discovering bizarre quirks such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rsht/eliminated_someone_before_the_match_even_started/">being able to kill people before a match has officially begun</a>. People are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rog9/first_game_with_emre_first_potg/">getting to grips with the other new heroes, such as Emre</a>, and discovering how potent they can be. The question is how long Overwatch can keep this renewed momentum up for.</p>
<p>Not all of the new heroes have gone down well, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-responds-to-overwatch-anran-design-controversy">Controversy arose over the weekend around the visual appearance of new fire-wielding hero Anran</a>, whose final, cute in-game look seemed to contradict a more ferocious design used in previously-released animated shorts and comics for the game. Anran's face also appears very similar to a lot of other female characters in the game - an issue the community refers to as "same-face syndrome". Blizzard has said it's discussing her design with the intention of making changes to it.</p>

<p>Silent Hill: Townfall (my computer keeps trying to autocorrect that to Downfall, which is very annoying) is coming from Screen Burn (née No Code), the Glasgow-based developer of Stories Untold and Observation. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">first announced back in 2022</a>, though at this time not too much was revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie.</p><p>Soon after this reveal, some started to decode the trailer, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">discovered an SOS signal was tucked between the 'THY FLESH IS WEAK' images</a>. There was also mention of Alessa, who is the little girl seen throughout Silent Hill during the first game and the name should be pretty familiar to anyone who's played the first or third installments, or watched the original Silent Hill movie.</p>
<p>So, will you be watching?</p> <div>

<p>Last year saw the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, which plopped players into the shoes of teenager Hinako. We awarded Silent Hill f four stars on its debut. "Silent Hill f's frustrating first-half is outweighed by a brilliant, delirious second that's well worth the initial slog," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/">Eidos-Montréal</a> is one of those veteran game studios that constantly appear in the news cycle, but always seem to be tied to some form of drama despite their pedigree. Luckily, Embracer Group has kept it running and working away on a handful of mystery projects, most of which have been scrapped.</p>
<p>Though the current buzz points to the developer now working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumour-has-it-a-new-alien-game-is-on-the-way-and-its-being-described-as-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-with-xenomorphs">an ambitious Alien video game</a> with heavy action-adventure elements, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-cancelled-lotr-game-by-eidos-montreal-with-a-telltale-like-story-first-look">this report from MP1st</a> deals with a cancelled Lord of the Rings project which never got too far. Late last year, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8?t=2132s">Insider Gaming talked about this</a> already, so it's not the first time we'd heard about it, but that noise didn't take off.</p>
<p>MP1st now claims to have gotten their hands on concept art and early tests done for the game, which apparently didn't advance much before being binned. The project joins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/">the reported Legacy of Kain reboot</a> as games that haven't moved forward at Eidos-Montréal recently.</p>
<p>The images show painterly and colourful art depicting what's believed to be the Umbar region of Middle-earth, as pointed by recurring file names and some of the 3D screens introducing a better sense of how the game would've been structured, at least in that region. Apparently, the iconic Prancing Pony inn from the books and movies was part of the game as well, as it wouldn't have been restricted to the area south of Gondor and known for its pirates.</p><p>But perhaps the most interesting part of the report is the game would've featured card-based mechanics on top of an isometric view similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest for the Wicked</a>'s and a Telltale-like narrative approach. We lack more details, but I think it's safe to say Eidos-Montréal aimed to make a LOTR game that would've felt quite different from what we've gotten before.</p>
<p>The end of the report underlines the studio is now "deep in development" of a major project nicknamed "P11" that's third-person and open-world. Could that be the rumoured Alien title? Place your bets now.</p>

            <p>Sorry Marvel fans, you may need to retract those claws, as it seems that Insomniac's Wolverine won't be appearing during this week's PlayStation State of Play.</p>
<p>When Sony first announced a State of Play for tomorrow, 12th February, it said the show would last for over 60 minutes, and include "news, gameplay updates, and announcements". Many soon assumed (and hoped) this lengthy broadcast would include a look at Insomniac's Wolverine, which was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game"> first teased back in 2021</a> during a PlayStation Showcase.</p>

<p>However, it now appears that this won't be the case after all. Replying to one fan on social media, who asked when we would all hear and see more from Logan and co, <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?s=20">Insomniac replied</a> with a very to the point:</p>
<p>"Spring 2026."</p>
<p>Now, alas, February doesn't exactly fall under the 'spring' window (she writes while looking out at the sunless, grey sky, wondering when the ground will ever be dry again). Spring starts towards the end of March, so unless Insomniac is pulling the wool over our eyes it seems doubtful Wolverine will show up tomorrow night.</p><p>Something that may (<em>may</em>) show up though could be the next game from Sony Santa Monica. When asked about a possible appearance from the team during tomorrow's State of Play, industry insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot48-has-ot48-been-hijacked-by-ot47-ot46-and-ot45-to-the-detriment-of-48-ots-of-history.1329010/page-378#post-151107211">Shinobi602 responded</a>: "Wouldn't be super surprising given the target release window." They did stress, though, "this isn't a confirmation it'll be there lol".</p>
<p>Thankfully, we don't have too much longer to find out what Sony has up its sleeve, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">tomorrow's State of Play kicking off at 10pm UK time</a>. What do you hope to see there?</p>

<p>In the meantime, while we may not be getting Wolverine news this month, we do have another Marvel-flavoured leak for February. Recent rumours suggest that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-extra-february-games-leak-ahead-of-tomorrows-state-of-play">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be headlining PlayStation's PS Plus Extra games for February</a>.</p>

            <p>It seems that PlayStation's upcoming PS Plus Extra games for February have leaked.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029">dealabs</a>, PS Plus members can expect to get their hands on the following three titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown (PS5)</li>
<li>Neva (PS5/PS4)</li>
</ul>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The big headliner here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which reunites players with Spider-Man (of course) as well as Miles Morales and MJ. "At once a little simple and a little over-stuffed, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is still above all a game of immense charm and fluid, free-form style," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">four star review from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>I would also fully recommend Neva, which is the most recent game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gris">Gris</a> developer Nomada Studio. It follows the story of a young woman named Alba and a magnificent wolf, with whom she forms a lifelong bond.</p>
<p>We also awarded Neva four stars on its release. "Nomada Studio follows up on the striking Gris with an effort that's poignant and precise, if maybe just a tad melodramatic," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neva-review">Eurogamer's Neva review from 2024</a>.</p>
<figure>

<p>It is expected that Sony will officially announce February's PS Plus Extra games in the very near future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">perhaps during this week's State of Play</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><strong>Update:</strong>It looks like the ESRB page we referenced in this story - which points to an age rating for an Xbox Series X and Series S version of the game - has actually been live for over year, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250210164852/https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40376/resident-evil-5/">according to Internet Archive's functionality</a>. Elsewhere on the site, there are listings for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>, Resident Evil  Revelations 2, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a>. Just because these games have been rated on ERSB, it doesn't necessarily mean we're going to see any updates on them any time soon.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oringal story follows:</p>
<p>More Resident Evil remakes are happening. That's an inevitability after all the modern REmakes crossed the <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/game/226039/resident-evil/">10m copies sold mark</a>. We're now getting close to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">RE4</a>'s third anniversary, and news on the next comeback could drop any moment now. If we pay attention to the ESRB website, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> could be next in line.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-5-re5-remake-capcom-xbox-series-2000667258">Kotaku</a>, we've been alerted of a new listing for an Xbox Series X/S version of the game originally released in March 2009. The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40376/resident-evil-5/">page</a> is barebones and provides a short description that could perfectly apply to yet another remaster or re-release of the fifth mainline entry, but as pointed out by Kotaku, there's mention of in-game purchases. Capcom has been throwing those into every game in recent years, even single-player ones, so whatever this iteration of RE5 is, some form of new content is coming <em>at the very least</em>.</p><p>Personally, I'm mostly convinced by the theory it's a full-blown remake. It's been almost three years since RE4's release, and while leakers <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2012597154825515449?s=20">have been denying</a> rumblings of RE5 being up next in favour of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-code-veronica">Code Veronica</a>, the Africa-set game's return is looking a lot more likely right now. Again, it could just be a new remaster with a few extra bits of content while other game gets the remake treatment, but looking at Capcom's trajectory so far, we'd put our money on the next mainline instalment.</p>
<p>The timing is also funny, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">PlayStation's next State of Play stream is happening later this week</a> and will have more than enough space for all sorts of game reveals. Kotaku is also smartly pointing out the RE4 remake was revealed during a State of Play stream in 2022. Adding fuel to the fire, Eva La Dare, who voiced and mocapped Sheva Alomar, <a href="https://x.com/KarenShevaEva/status/2011868483194392926?s=20">has also been teasing something</a> for March.</p>
<p>Regardless, Resident Evil fanatics have lots to look forward to later this month, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is arriving and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-switch-2-ports">biting into Nintendo Switch 2</a> with RE7 and Village by its side.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Blizzard has said it's discussing a visual redesign for new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> hero Anran following controversy about her look, which arose after she was revealed last week.</p>
<p>Anran is one of the five new heroes arriving in Overwatch today (formerly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>) as part of an expansion-like release called The Reign of Talon. Early access to Anran was available at the weekend.</p>
<p>The controversy is twofold, and intertwined. One: people somewhat rightly accuse Overwatch of having a same-face problem - "same face syndrome", it's colloquially called - whereby the female character models in particular in the game tend to have the same or similar face. Two: and this seems to be the main source of aggravation here, we've seen a depiction of Anran before looking notably different.</p>
<p>Anran is the sister of existing Overwatch hero Wuyang, and when Wuyang was introduced to the game, Anran co-starred in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytZnOGwEq9s">Wuyang's animated short cinematic, Elemental Kin</a>, and <a href="https://blz-contentstack-assets.akamaized.net/v3/assets/blt2477dcaf4ebd440c/bltda027517bc96a819/6892813ccec4566b0c2fe2bc/OW_Aqua_EN.pdf">in Wuyang's adjoining comic, Against the Tide.</a> There, Anran cut a different image, one with a more believable face and a stronger sense of ferocity. It's a presentation even Blizzard has agreed is at odds with the young, cutesy looking presentation of Anran that's in the game now.</p>

We're so proud of the work that our team has put into Anran and the rest of the five heroes launching in Season 1, and we agree that she can be even better if we get this aspect of her right in-game.</p>
<figure>

<p>"We discussed sharing this with all of you last week but wanted to wait until we had confirmation of exactly what we can do. We're hoping to make this update in Season 1 but I don't have specifics to share just yet. Our hero models are incredibly complicated and we really need to test out what we can do."</p><p>Keller's comments follow unrest in the Overwatch community but also criticism from the voice actor who portrays Anran in the game, Fareeha Andersen (who didn't say anything about this at Blizzard HQ when we met two weeks ago, perhaps understandably). Andersen's comments cut a little deeper, calling out a wider problem with female representation and beauty standards in general.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/AskFareeha/status/2020291256279089431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2020291256279089431%7Ctwgr%5E2e86c06a906d90bb07e764c795a439a71e01f7e2%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-is-a-hill-worth-dying-on-overwatch-actor-supports-potential-redesign-of-criticized-character">Andersen said in a videoed message on social media</a> that, "There was an unspoken promise [made in the animated short and comic] that said, 'We're going to challenge the beauty standards ransacking media these days - the Ozempic chic, the contour your nose / you have no nose / the tiniest nose. And because of that precedent, I think people feel let down.</p>



<p>"Overwatch is a trailblazer at challenging that, at trying to break those moulds, at trying to explore the bounds of what it means to be good, what it looks like to be heroic. And I think the result we got says something else - it says something that leaves a bad taste in our mouths. It's not the bold, optimistic swing that we know Overwatch to make. And it's a look that isn't congruent with her personality; she looks like the younger sibling, she looks more docile somehow, as the fire hero. She looks more docile than the most peacekeeping support in the game.</p>
<blockquote><em>"She looks more docile than the most peacekeeping support in the game."</em></blockquote>
<p>"I've been seeing everyone's redesigns - and quietly bookmarking them - but I wanted you to hear that this concern is important. This is a hill worth dying on, it's worth speaking on, because I believe that the more we speak up about the things that truly matter to us, the more we'll see ourselves reflected in the world around us."</p>
<p>Overwatch has been commended in the past for its representations of characters from around the world. Early on, it introduced the older Egyptian lady Ana to the game, which was a type of character we had very rarely seen before. Blizzard also goes to lengths to ensure it matches actors with similar backgrounds to the characters they're portraying, such as it did with Fareeha Andersen and Anran, and Kerem Erdinc and Emre, one of the other new characters coming to the game. Erdinc actually helped spot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-nearly-had-an-f-bomb-problem">a Turkish Emre f-bomb problem Overwatch nearly had</a>.</p><p>That is to say that I believe this matters to Blizzard, and the quick response from Aaron Keller here is to be commended, although it remains to be seen what Blizzard will actually do about Anran's design. And if it alters Anran, will it also consider tweaking the faces of other heroes as well?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">This week is a big week for Overwatch</a>, which is undergoing something of a relaunch. Blizzard is moving to a kind of annual expansion release model for the game, under the guise of year-long collected storylines of content. The first is The Reign of Talon that begins/launches today, 10th February, and adds five new heroes to the game, with a further five planned over the course of the year. There are also many other changes besides - not least the dropping of the "2" from the game's title. Overwatch, in a sense, is back.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There's no denying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> was the big mainstream moment of the series after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">3</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> successfully turned the post-apocalyptic RPG series into something more in line with The Elder Scrolls. More than a decade later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">its player numbers are skyrocketing again</a> after each season of the TV show and we're waiting for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">Switch 2 port</a> coming later this month.</p>
<p>Even if a fifth mainline Fallout is nowhere to be seen, the franchise is enjoying its moment in the spotlight, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/FalloutOralHistory-PartII">Game Informer's excellent multi-part Oral History</a> has been exploring the past, present, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">future of the game series</a>. When talking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> big honcho <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> and other key creatives like lead designer Emil Pagliarulo, more on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>'s genesis and success was uncovered, and it appears everyone at the studio is agreeing on that entry being the franchise's most important one.</p>
<p>"In 4, we swung the other way, really making the world as dense as possible, because we came up with the whole crafting system where every piece of junk you can find, you could use to build and craft things," lead artist Istvan Pely said of the studio's approach to Fallout 4's overarching world design when compared to 3. Most players would tell you what defines the fourth game is the bigger focus on sandbox elements and "endless" content generation through the settlement system and building/crafting mechanics. At the same time, longtime Fallout fans maintain the series lost its way a bit when all that surpassed its RPG core.</p>
<p>Regardless, Fallout 4 remains <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6rjeDJD4sMW6KGgcyqgQ2Y/fallout-4-sets-record-sales">the series' biggest success</a> to this day, with <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/fallout-4-has-shipped-25-million-units-as-of-2020-as-per-leaked-microsoft-documents">over 25m copies sold by 2020</a> (who knows what the official number is nowadays) and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/377160/charts/#max">Steam data</a> showing it's got the biggest concurrent players, 24-hour peak, and all-time peak numbers versus the rest of the series. Even the online-only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/charts/#max">which is doing mighty fine nowadays</a>, doesn't compare.</p><p>Pagliarulo pointed to the gap between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and Fallout 4 being a turning point for the studio, as casual "game jams" started to push the developers to try new things that often were fun enough to be kept around as part of the next game. After The Elder Scrolls V's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elder-scrolls-5-skyrim-hearthfire">Hearthfire</a> DLC, additional experimentation led to the now-iconic settlement system that allowed players to put all the once useless loot to good use. "It was a long road to get it functional, to figure out how the U.I. is going to work. We had a sort of team dedicated to that," Pely explained.</p>

<p>In the age of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> becoming a sensation and player expression-oriented games taking off, that entire layer of Fallout 4 added tons of replay value to an already massive RPG. "It was our first go at [player-generated content], but it was worth it, because I think we realized, like, if we can figure this out, that can become sort of a Bethesda staple," Pely added. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starfield">Starfield</a>'s focus on player creations of various sorts, including spaceships, it's easy to see how important the 2015 game's reception was for the studio, no matter what you think of it.</p>
<p>More than 10 years after it launched, Todd Howard also seems impressed by how well Fallout 4 has endured: "You feel incredibly fortunate. Like, we’re talking about it 10 years later. I think it’s still probably the most played Fallout game right now, and you just feel really blessed that the fans have taken to it and stuck with it." When you combine everything these Bethesda veterans have to say with the game's astounding financial performance over time, it's easy to see why Fallout 4 on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> has become a priority.</p>

            <p>Here's how the first few minutes of Romeo is a Dead Man go down: first, the entire cosmos floating in a fish tank to the ethereal strains of what eventually turns out to be Japanese rap (this is just the title screen). Next, a stop-motion animated intro over a glorious town of miniatures. Then! Cut to the interior of a police car; a zombie attack; our hero's gruesome death; a portal opening onto the space-time continuum and a granddad on a motorbike. Romeo Stargazer's resuscitation via the medium of eyeball syringe and big spacehat. More zombies! A love story told in flashback, relayed by an energetic camera gliding across a beautifully illustrated comic book. Romeo's dimension-hopping evil girlfriend Juliet, and his Doc Brown-like granddad inexplicably reborn as a sentient jacket patch. Honestly, if I hadn't just spent the last six hours playing it, I'd call Romeo is a Dead Man exactly the kind of game they don't make anymore.</p>

<p>This latest oddity from idiosyncratic studio Grasshopper Manufacture feels like it's been catapulted from the past, from a long-gone, distantly remembered era when video games were wild; unbound by rules. I realise this is selective memory filtered through nostalgia talking, but even so - it's had me reminiscing about the El Shaddais, the Asura's Wraths, the Seamans of this world. And, of course, pretty much anything Grasshopper boss Goichi Suda (better known as Suda51) has had a hand in before. Suda has previously called his design philosophy "punk", but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-melting-faces-generative-ai-jazz-band">for Romeo is a Dead Man it's jazz</a> - and if that shift in outlook has resulted in anything tangible, it's perhaps a game with less edge and more soul, but one that's no less creatively untamed.</p>

<p>For all its wild, peripheral abandon, though, Romeo is a Dead Man has an instantly recognisable core. Here, Grasshopper serves up another hyper-kinetic third-person hack-and-slasher - essentially the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a> by way of 2014's Killer is Dead with perhaps a nod or two to Suda and Shinji Makami's 2005 Capcom cult classic Killer7. Which is to say it's Suda doing what Suda does best, and if you've struggled to connect with his work in the past, Romeo's batshit continuation probably won't change that. Me though, I'm mostly in the "love" camp, and from that perspective, Romeo is a relentlessly joyous return.</p><p>Given how many times Grasshopper has done this particular violent dance already, of course, it shouldn't be much of a surprise to hear Romeo is a Dead Man's foundational combat is where its most immediate pleasures lie. Just like No More Heroes, just like Killer is Dead, its furious hack-and-slash sword action is so viscerally intense, so visually excessive, it's a miracle you can see anything at all. But there's more to celebrate than just the ceaselessly hypnotic arterial sprays of lurid neon. Romeo's combo-based combat (built from light attacks, heavy attacks, and special attacks with show-stoppingly outlandish psychedelic lead-ins) is wonderfully honed - fluid and rhythmic in a way that's enormously, consistently satisfying.</p>



<p>It's not especially deep so far, true, but Grasshopper adds enough wrinkles to keep things interesting. For starters, melee is complemented by a snappy gun blast available at any time, used to target opponents' flower-like weak spots for Massive Damage - a little rhythmic flourish that feels faintly reminiscent of Killer7. And Romeo's daft roster of undead Rotters is diverse enough to prevent the hack-and-slashing from devolving into mindlessness. You've got sniper-armed grunts; charging mutants with bulbous tomato heads; huge muscular things with devastating clap-back attacks; even scampering little buggers that squeeze out streams of explosive poop. And that's before you get to Romeo's elaborate showpiece boss battles - hundred-foot tall mutants with pendulous arms, giant dismembered heads with electrical attacks - that add an almost puzzle-like dimension to combat, shaking things up even further.</p><p>Combat, then, is a strong anchor for the mayhem around it, and while there's definitely the familiar sense that Grasshopper's ambitions may have once again exceeded its time and budget, what I've played so far also suggests Romeo might be one of the studio's most refined games to date. As you catapult through time (did I mention you're a new recruit for the FBI's space-time division?), you'll visit everything from a lovingly rendered 80s shopping mall in search of a confederate soldier-turned-mobster to a 1960s government building. They're decently expansive areas, encouraging a kind of fleet-footed exploration as you mow through enemies in your path. And specific objectives - tracking down generators, say - help further concentrate your focus. There's nothing too elaborate here, but there's a paciness, a breezines, to the action that stops things from getting dull. And it all feeds into Romeo's loosely Soulslike rhythm; its fast-travel save points functioning something like bonfires, resetting enemies each time to keep the farmable levelling currency flowing - further incentivising combat.</p>



<p>Amid all this, Grasshopper adds a bit of spice by giving levels a sort of trans-dimensional overlay. Interact with the retro, jazz-spewing TVs floating around the place and a headless gentleman will whisk you away to a weird polygonal otherworld, giving things a bit of a platform-y, puzzle-y twist as you portal back and forth between dimensions trying to reach otherwise inaccessible areas of the main world. As with most peripheral elements in Romeo is a Dead Man, it's not exactly what you might call fully realised, but it's just enough to change things up whenever the thrill of combat might threaten to flounder.</p><p>Romeo is a Dead Man is <em>full</em> of this stuff, and it's hard not to fall for its relentlessly enthusiastic sense of invention. There's a farming component back on your spaceship (yes, you have a spaceship and, yes, it's presented like a top-down pixel-art RPG) where you can grow seeds into Rotters who'll help out in combat. There's a katsu curry mini-game, styled like a prestige anime show, where you fry up your collectible ingredients to create elaborate meals with powerful effects. There's a scanning game that's basically quadruple-paddle Pong; a weird first-person space-flight thing where you'll navigate space-time and collect boons tucked away in procedurally generated dungeons. Elsewhere, levelling plays out like a Pac-Man maze game; you'll acquire ability granting badges, and buy new weapons - power shotguns, big feck-off hammers - then level those up too. I could go on.</p>

<p>It's a wild, wonderfully compelling mess of interlocking oddball systems. And while much of this stuff probably wouldn't stand up to scrutiny in isolation, slammed together into this ludicrous, inexplicable whole - this world of science cats and extra-dimensional dojos; this weirdly sweet love story spilled across all of space and time - it's just delightful. And it helps that Romeo's cast, working to a buoyant script packed with joyfully stupid gags, and even some surprisingly affecting moments, is just relentlessly endearing.</p>
<p>Six or so hours in, I can tell you Romeo is a Dead Man isn't perfect. And I can also tell you it's been a good long while since a game has kept me this delightedly enthralled. It's brilliant, stupid, spectacular, imaginative, and clear-eyed in a way that prevents it from feeling like a creative crapshoot and more like a coherent, consistent whole. They really don't make this kind of game anymore - if they ever did at all - but they have and it's brilliant and I love it so far.</p>

            <p>Josef Fares, founder of Hazelight Studios, has revealed that he and his team are at work at yet another video game. This should come as little surprise, given the success of Hazelight's last game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p>
<p>The reveal, which comes from Fares himself, comes in the form of a photo posted on his personal Twitter account. This photo shows Fares in a mocap studio, his arm blocking three actors in ball-covered mocap suits to keep their identities mysterious… This image comes with a sentence from Fares: "Next game in the making".</p>
<p>So what do we know about this next game? Well, precious little. We know Hazelight <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-and-it-takes-two-director-is-already-fully-focused-on-hazelights-next-game-which-the-studio-started-work-on-around-a-month-ago-its-quite-early/">started working on it in early 2025</a>, and that Fares was "super, super excited" about it. The only people who do know more about it, aside from Hazelight developers themselves, are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-players-invited-to-see-studios-next-game-after-beating-rock-hard-secret-level">those who first completed Split Fiction's incredibly hard secret level</a>.</p>

<p>Hazelight's last game Split Fiction proved exceptionally successful. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">The game sold 2m copies in just a week after its launch</a>, the first million of which being sold in the first 48 hours. Not too shabby. This proved so good a launch that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-praises-split-fiction-hugely-successful-launch-as-game-passes-another-sales-milestone">EA gave the game its flowers during a quarterly financial report</a>, stating the game was a key part of a strong Q4 in 2025 alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p><p>If you've not played Split Fiction yourself, maybe<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review"> Eurogamer's Split Fiction review is worth a read</a>! In it, Katherine Castle summarised the game as: "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>, the "cozy life sim" spinoff releasing on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 5th March, has quickly become one of the most anticipated launches of early 2026. Marketing on it has been <em>a bit </em>timid considering the huge IP it's riding though, so there are still some doubts less than a month before launch. However, if you're in London, you might be able to get a proper taste of what it offers as soon as this weekend.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-pokemon-pokopia-demo-will-be-available-to-play-at-the-pokemon-european-championships-this-weekend/">VGC</a>, we've learned a Pokémon Pokopia demo will be available to play at this weekend's Pokémon European International Championships, which are taking place in <a href="https://www.excel.london/">London's Excel exhibition centre</a>. While the event's focus will be on its high-stakes Pokémon tournament, it will also house a number of more casual activities for all sorts of Pokémon fans. From TCG activities to panels and meet-and-greets, it's a great place to hang around if you're a huge Pokémon fan.</p>
<p>Nintendo has seen the timing of this year's EUIC (13th February to 15th February) as the perfect opportunity to show off Pokopia and allow people to go hands-on with it, and it's hard to argue against the decision. If they want to get people (hopefully) buzzing online about the fantastic pitch that is a Pokémon game heavily influenced by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, that's a golden opportunity.</p>
<p>If you haven't been keeping track of what's up with Omega Force's (in collaboration with Game Freak) Pokémon Pokopia, let's just say it stars a Ditto who mimics a human as they collaborate with all sorts of Pokémon to rebuild a ruined village that was left behind by the actual humans. Player creativity and flexible build options appear to be especially important on top of the usual farming mechanics, and with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-upcoming-pokemon-pokopia-may-have-a-deeper-link-to-classic-games-fans-believe-heres-what-we-know">the twist the property should provide</a>, we're quite curious about this one.</p>

            <p>Hyper-realistic food was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a>'s strengths, and many RPGs since then have really committed to perfecting the art of beautifully rendered cooking and dishes. Up next, it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> studio Game Science is upping its food tech for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">Zhong Kui</a>, the sequel of sorts that was revealed last year.</p>
<p>Today, 10th February, the developer surprise-dropped a "Chinese New Year Special" video that contains over six minutes of in-game footage from Black Myth: Zhong Kui... unless it's not really about the game we'll get at some point in the future. Watch it here:</p> <figure>

<p>Yes, that seems like an odd way to market a heavily hyped game, but since the action-RPG is still years away, there's no proper vertical slice ready to be shown. I guess it's neat to have a major studio putting something together for the fans, even if it's just a fancy tech showcase of food and demons casually hanging with chill humans... and sharing body parts with them to make the dishes special. I'll admit the blend of cozy and unsettling vibes works.</p>
<p>The very last scene teases someone who's about to be fed by their captors, but how are we supposed to be excited or theorize? We know nothing about the actual game yet. Even the final message underlines the video is a "Year of the Horse Special" that's unrelated to the main storyline and non-canon, so what do those seconds even mean?</p><p>In any case, there's plenty of symbolism and tradition to chew on here, especially if you're familiar with Chinese culture. Those in love with cutting-edge graphics will have plenty to admire too, and I personally always enjoy when developers go extra hard on food and assets most people don't pay much attention to.</p>

            <p>Remedy Entertainment, best known for narrative-rich single player games like Control and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, has got itself a new CEO. His name is Jean-Charles Gaudechon, a former EA executive and senior vice president of fantasy sports betting platform Sleeper.</p>
<p>While at EA, Gaudechon spent 2012-2013 as studio head and executive producer at EA's free-to-play studio, helping to direct live service development at the industry giant. He'd later return to the company after a stint away, concluding his EA career as vice president and group GM of EA Asia Studios.</p>
<p>Fast forward to March 2024, and he'd help found the "sports super app" Sleeper, on which users can draft fantasy sports teams and make "sleeper picks" (bets) on athletes performances, team performances, etc. He is now the CEO of Remedy, quite the stark shift indeed.</p>

<p>This news, <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/?publicationId=c86bbf74-7d56-4b1e-bc4d-56f406fc8258">announced on the Remedy investors website</a>, came alongside a statement by Remedy Chairman of the Board of Directors Henri Österlund. He wrote: "I am delighted to announce the appointment of Jean-Charles (JC) Gaudechon to lead Remedy into a phase of profitable growth. His proven history in growing gaming franchises and successfully leading international studios is an excellent fit to the current stage of Remedy's business. Under JC's leadership, we are well-positioned to significantly accelerate growth, guide Remedy towards greater independence through self-publishing, and deliver sustained value to our players, partners, and shareholders"</p><p>Gaudechon also added his own statement to investors, the wider company, and world as the new CEO: "I'm excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time," Gaudechon wrote. "The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value. Remedy has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry's future. We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way. I will be moving to Finland with my family and I'm incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio."</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps Gaudechon will be some sort of fiscal Ted Lasso, coming in and keeping what's beloved about Remedy intact while bringing in that ever-elusive growth. It is no secret that Remedy Entertainment is indeed in need of more money. Alan Wake 2, while adored and critically acclaimed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">didn't make a profit until well after its release</a>. Recently, its cooperative shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">FBC Firebreak missed the mark to such a degree</a> that Remedy had to issue a profit warning to investors. It is perhaps little mystery that investors would welcome a growth-focused CEO into their arms.</p>

            <p>The next 2D fighter from Arc System Works is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. Published by Sony, it's also set to launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3787240/MARVEL_Tkon_Fighting_Souls/">Steam</a>, so we're not counting it as a true PS5 exclusive. That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-preview">it no doubt could become one of PlayStation's surprise hits</a> when it finally drops, and the final details are promising an adequate offering of modes and characters.</p>
<p>Though Steam has since scrubbed the description which likely went up early, social media accounts like <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a> screen-capped it all when someone, somewhere, hit the button early:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The 4v4 tag team fighter will seemingly have 20 characters at launch, which is below what many hoped for, but well above <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">2XKO</a>'s disappointing initial roster, for example. For a more traditional fighter, I'd say 20 heroes and villains are more than fine - but since Marvel Tokon's whole thing is its 4v4 battles, team builds might get repetitive soon (at least until more Marvel icons start arriving).</p>
<p>On a more positive note, 64-player lobbies sound great and follow the recent trend of amping up the social element of these games outside of old-school matchmaking. Ask around and it's evident this is the type of feature which can elevate a fighter from niche to enduring mainstream heavyweight. It remains to be seen how many player-versus-players will be there at launch, but we might be off to a great start there.</p><p>As for the single-player portion, an Episode Mode will elaborate on the game's "lore" and team dynamics so it's not just a meet-up of Marvel characters duking it out. Personally, I'm not expecting a meaty story mode from it, but if it can rise above the utterly forgettable solo modes found in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-king-of-fighters-xv-review">The King of Fighters XV</a>, that will be more than enough. In any case, let's hope the offline options go beyond a thin campaign and local versus. Not every fighter can be as offline-friendly as the Mortal Kombat series, but it'd be nice if developers pushed harder on that front.</p>
<p>These leaked details on Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls' launch offerings arrives right after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">PlayStation setting a 12th February State of Play stream</a>, so there's almost no doubt the game will have a slot there, probably locking a release date, too. We'll find out on Thursday.</p>

            <p>Despite some missteps along the way and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-plummeted-lagging-behind-even-the-last-games-dlc-and-a-two-year-old-street-fighter-game">performance woes</a>, we maintain <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is a pretty good game. Complaints about difficulty and end-game content were addressed by Capcom in due course, but for anyone still a bit underwhelmed by the final offering, you only need to wait until the summer to see what's next.</p>
<p>Now, as we near the game's first anniversary, we've finally learned when we should expect to hear the first details about the traditional jumbo-sized expansion. Via an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526493182068786774">official blog post</a> (plus a video you can watch below), producer Ryozo Tsujimoto unveiled what's coming next to the game in time for the birthday celebrations plus the expected announcement window for the "large-scale expansion" that should shake things up:</p> <figure>

<p>As teased before the end of 2025, free content updates are ending (for now). Though we believed the December update would mark the end of pre-expansion support for Wilds beyond the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-january-2026-performance-update-released">promised performance improvements</a>, a new major patch coming on 18th February is adding a bunch of 10-star Arch-tempered monsters to slay in permanent event quests, new weapon and pendant designs from a design contest held a while back, and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>Starting 18th February, a month-long anniversary event celebration of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will bring seasonal festivities, a "special item pack", new event quests, and of course, all-new armour sets and cosmetics. That should be the end of new free content (though rotations of past events could happen) until the expansion is ready. Will it be as substantial as Iceborne or Sunbreak? We sure hope so.</p><p>"We look forward to sharing the first reveal of the expansion this summer," the shared video message promises, potentially pointing at one of the big summer showcases we tune into every year. Will that reveal come alongside an official announcement of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">rumoured port for Switch 2</a>? That seems like a solid bet, but it's also the kind of thing that could happen in any Nintendo Direct stream, so anything's possible.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has explained why Warcraft-based collectible card game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, still isn't available on console, 12 years after release. The game is available on handheld devices like tablets and mobile, but has never made the jump to the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> or Steam Deck. In explaining its thinking, the developer suggested that belonging to Microsoft and Xbox means these console conversions are now more of a priority than ever.</p>
<p>"There's a level of investment that we need to make to make that happen," explained Hearthstone executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith during a group interview I was a part of at Blizzard recently, "primarily in terms of UI and UX and making sure that it's very natural to go and play a card game on those platforms. I know it's possible - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gathering-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013-review">Duels of the Planeswalkers for Magic [The Gathering], many years ago now, was absolutely delightful</a> with the controller - so I know we can do it.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of are there enough players there wanting that beyond who's going to pull out their phone or their tablet to play? It's been so exciting seeing that segment of the market grow such that we can then say, yeah, actually, let's go and do this."</p>
<p>Hearthstone was quickly ported to mobile in 2015, a year after a release, mostly because Blizzard recognised an opportunity there and rushed to fill it, Lyons-Smith said. "We ported that thing to get fast to market and <em>a whole lot</em> more players showed and so it was the right strategic choice at that time," he said. But the Hearthstone codebase is old now, and the quality bar is high on consoles and handheld console machines.</p><p>"I asked an engineer who'd been on the project a long time and he estimates the code is 16 years old," Lyons-Smith said, "and the team was 15 people 16 years ago. And so there's more of an effort to go: 'I want to make sure when we go that it's awesome.' That it doesn't just feel like, yeah, they ported it here and you <em>can</em> play... I want to make sure that when we go, we're going to go and it's going to feel awesome for players that love that form factor, whether they're leaning back on the couch or sitting on the couch with their handheld."</p>
<p>Game director Tyler Bielman echoed that sentiment by saying, "If we're going to bring it specifically to that living room big screen platform, we would want to make sure that the full experience is optimised for that mode that you're in."</p>
<p>Lyons-Smith added: "So let's get there and let's do it right and we'll find the right time to do it."</p>

<p>It was to a follow-up question asked after this that Lyons-Smith made the remark about owner Microsoft being keen to get games on as many platforms as possible. "In the future as we explore console and handheld, we'd probably go as wide as we could," he said. "Certainly we have a different owner now than we did three years ago and they're more invested in Xbox and 'anything's an Xbox'. Their high-level goal [being] games playable anywhere."</p><p>Play Anywhere is one of Microsoft's key ideas as it transitions Xbox away from hardware and more towards being a platform-agnostic gaming brand. The idea is that you buy a game once to play on multiple platforms - wherever houses an Xbox ecosystem or app. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Last year's expensive Asus Rog Ally X</a> handheld device was and is a key proponent of this.</p>
<p>Blizzard has just announced a Cataclysm themed expansion for Hearthstone that will launch on 17th March. It'll bring a whole new story to the game as well as reintroduce Colossal cards, which are play-space-filling brutes, and new keywords, funky mechanics, and more. Blizzard is also teasing a major Hearthstone announcement for BlizzCon 2026, though as I discovered, this will not be Hearthstone 2.</p>

            <p>No, Blizzard is not preparing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> 2 announcement for BlizzCon 2026, I've been told, but there is something significant being announced later this year.</p>
<p>The company aroused suspicion for a sequel during a Hearthstone broadcast this afternoon, while announcing a Cataclysm-themed expansion for the World of Warcraft card game. The company teased that a major announcement was coming at BlizzCon 2026 in September, and for something bigger than usual.</p>
<p>I watched this 'spotlight' broadcast at Blizzard headquarters, just over a week ago, so I was able to quiz the team afterwards about it. I asked executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith whether we were talking about something as significant as a sequel, and he put me straight.</p>
<p>"No, this is not a Hearthstone 2," Lyons-Smith told me. "There's no whole new game that is launching as part of that. Over the years we've done mixes, new types of content, new modes and such in the game, and it will be of that familiar ilk."</p>

<p>However, the BlizzCon 2026 announcement will still be especially notable. Familiar, yes, but "in a bigger way than we would normally do"," Lyons-Smith said. "Bigger than what's happening with Cataclysm."</p>
<p>Cataclysm arrives for Hearthstone on 17th March and reimagines the World of Warcraft expansion of the same name. That means world-breaking dragon Deathwing is back, and he's bringing some colossal pals with him. Literally colossal: Colossals are returning to the game.</p><p>These are mega-minions who, in the case of Magmaw, for instance, a giant lava worm, fills all available minion spaces with their wormy body, and keeps refilling them whenever any segments are killed. Magmaw has 99 minion recharges, so you can begin to see what kind of a problem that card represents. The other Colossals are similarly chonky.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Cataclysm also brings new keywords, a new story, and powerful new abilities like Rewind that allow you to redo some plays. Also, on 10th March, one week before the expansion arrives, Blizzard will make every card from the recent Un'Goro and Emerald Dream expansions available to everyone for the duration of the Cataclysm expansion cycle, which is nice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hearthstone-isnt-on-console-switch-or-steam-deck-but-increasingly-likely-to-happen">But Blizzard isn't yet ready to bring Hearthstone to consoles or handheld devices like Switch or Steam Deck</a> - not officially, anyway. Nevertheless, there's a suggestion this is now more of a priority under Microsoft than it was under Activision before. Could we perhaps be in for a new platform announcement at BlizzCon?</p>

            <p>The upcoming God of War series has finally got its Atreus, as Callum Vinson has been cast as none other than the son of Kratos.</p>
<p>He comes from prior work as a young Jason Voorhees in Crystal Lake, as well as Piglet in Me &amp; Winnie the Pooh. He also has a history of voice over work, having played Lope in Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island. It makes sense, after all, that an archer would have range. I'll be here all night, folks.</p>
<p>As well as the God of War series, Vinson is set to play a role in both season three of The Night Agent, a popular Netflix drama.</p>

<p>Vinson comes in the wake of some other impressive casting calls, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-has-a-head-for-casting-with-the-return-of-mimir-actor-alastair-duncan-confirmed">including Alastair Duncan returning to the role of Mimir from the games</a>.  Odin and Thor also have assigned actors, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-keeps-casting-characters-from-ragnarok-adds-severance-and-homeland-stars-as-odin-and-thor">Mandy Patinkin and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson taking these antagonistic roles respectively</a>. Kratos too has been chosen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">with Ryan Hurst taking the lead role</a>.</p><p>This God of War adaption, being produced by Amazon, has still yet to have a release date as of writing. Nor does it have a proper trailer announcing it to those not paying attention to early casting decisions. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">it is already approved for a second season</a>. The show also has some stellar talent directing it, including Frederick E.O. Toye <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">who'll be taking the lead over the first two episodes</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think of this casting decision? Is Vinson the right actor for the role? Let us know!</p>

            <p>
Discord has announced a new "teen-by-default" approach to its platform, meaning age-verification will be a mandatory requirement for all users around the globe in order to access certain settings, channels, and "sensitive content."
</p>
<p>
Beginning in early March, Discord will implement a "phased global rollout" of a new update designed to give all new and existing users worldwide a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Once live, users will be required to undergo age verification - either via facial age estimation or by submitting a form of identification - in order to access certain features. This builds on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">changes previously rolled out</a> to users in Australia and the UK.
</p>
<p>
Without age verification, users will be unable to bypass sensitive content filters, and will not be able to access age-gated channels, servers, or app commands. Nor can they speak on Discord server stages or access messages sent to their inbox from people they do not know. Additionally, all users will see warning prompts when receiving friend requests from users they may not know.
</p>
<p>
As for the age verification process, Discord is adopting what it calls "privacy-forward age assurance". It says video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device, and insists all identification documents submitted to its vendor partners for processing will be "deleted quickly" — "in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." It does note, however, that while only one verification method will be required for most users, it may sometimes request multiple methods when "more information is needed to assign an age group." Once age verification is complete, user will be alerted via a direct message from Discord's official account.
</p><p>
"Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility," the company wrote in a statement accompanying the news. "We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform."

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is off to a tremendous start this year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-update-adds-bastion-tank-siege-breakers-warbond">new batch of heavy weaponry</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-armours-up-for-its-very-own-star-war-as-automatons-have-stolen-plans-for-a-planet-killing-space-station">Automatons stealing a not-Death-Star</a> setting the stage for Super Earth's attack on the Cyborgs of Cyberstan. What can players expect from this next major step in the Galactic War and the game's future?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-helldivers-2-launches-the-battle-for-cyberstan-arrowhead-says-its-already-plotting-to-expand-the-scope-of-the-game">IGN</a> sat down with Arrowhead's Mikael Eriksson, game director on Helldivers 2, to discuss the team's ambitions for these live events and how they're reshaping a previously planned narrative based on the community's performance.</p>
<p>On 10th February (that's tomorrow), the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrfT-ox5lIk">battle for Cyberstan</a> begins, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> will be tasked with taking over the hostile <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leM2NjGmCbY">Cyborg-controlled</a> planet. "Players can win and players can lose, and it's going to be super fun to see that play out," Eriksson said, pointing out past events like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">Super Earth's defence</a> could've gone the wrong way. "Following that was pure fun for everyone at the office except for maybe the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-a-dungeons-and-dragons-style-gm-behind-the-scenes">Game Master</a>, who was sweating a little bit."</p>
<p>How much can the players' performance really affect the admittedly complex plans for the live online game's content and narrative? Eriksson used tabletop role-playing games as a clear example of what Arrowhead is going for, in that there's an overarching story that has been set, but players can choose how they interact with it, leading to smaller changes and deviations. Still, catastrophic failures can lead to, well, catastrophic results: "We know that players will now go to Cyberstan, but we don't know how it will play out. We don't know if they will win. We don't know if they will lose. And there will be impacts on the Galactic War level. So the story that is being written in the Galactic War will change depending on what they do. And it can be quite consequential. Planets can get destroyed to never be able to be played on again. That sort of thing can happen."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In a way, Helldivers 2 is a "forever game" despite it not having an overabundance of FOMO elements. This inevitably leads to more casual players being confused in regards to the state of the in-game narrative and the galaxy. "We are actively working on getting to a point where regardless of if you're new or if you're experienced, you should just be able to get into the game and understand very easily exactly what's happening and why we're fighting the fight that we're doing right now," Eriksson explained. It's hard not to think of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s struggles when it comes to onboarding new players, with the main difference being Destiny 2's stories and universe are far denser.</p><p>Eriksson acknowledged the strength of having a simple fantasy that players can "get into" quickly. That's allowed development on new content and narrative arcs to stay agile, and Arrowhead doesn't "want to stray away from that." The game will evolve and grow, but it appears the team is well aware of the dangers of making the game too big or dense for players looking at it like an uncomplicated form of escapism.</p>
<p>"Working on Helldivers as a live-service game is just bliss, because it’s such an interesting universe, endless possibilities, and we have many, many ideas that have yet to come to fruition," the game director added, promising there's much more to come... as long as the players stick around. So far, I'd say this is one of the few live-service success stories that studios and publishers could learn from.</p>

            <p>A new report suggests Blizzard has partnered with Korean gaming giant Nexon - owner of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and The Finals studio Embark - to create a shooter of some kind based on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> brand.</p>
<p>The report, published on <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994">Korean site dnews</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-to-reimagine-starcraft-as-a-shooter-secret-project-underway.1429834/">picked up by Resetera</a>, heard from "industry sources" that Nexon signed a "cooperation contact" last year with Blizzard "for content development related to the StarCraft IP". Nexon has reportedly set up a dedicated team for the project and is housing it in its shooting division, suggesting the game is a shooter. Not much is known beyond that, apart from famed StarCraft modder Choi Jun-ho has apparently been hired to guide the team.</p>
<p>This news follows suspicions from earlier this year that Blizzard is preparing a StarCraft-related announcement for BlizzCon this year, in September. Those reports in turn follow talk from last year that Blizzard is working on a StarCraft shooter. Respected reporter Jason Schreier, who'd written an insider-based book about Blizzard's history, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">told IGN</a> that, "They are working on a StarCraft shooter. StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard." Former Far Cry man Dan Hay is apparently in charge.</p>

<p>If this is true, it will be Blizzard's third known attempt to make a StarCraft shooter. The first attempt, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news270306ghost">StarCraft Ghost, was public and was cancelled almost exactly 20 years ago</a>. The second attempt was never announced but was said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-reportedly-cancels-first-person-starcraft-shooter">codenamed Ares and cancelled in 2019</a>.</p><p>This wouldn't be the first time Blizzard has partnered with another company to adapt one of its major gaming brands. Relatively recently, Blizzard partnered with Chinese gaming giant NetEase to produce mobile game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>, which - even after a falling out between the two companies - remains a key part of the company's Diablo vision. Could Blizzard be doing something similar with Nexon?</p>
<p>Perhaps a more pertinent question is: if this is true, what kind of game will this be? Blizzard games are fundamentally about people playing together - it's one of the company's core tenets - so multiplayer will almost certainly feature in some way. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> is a futuristic multiplayer shooter too, so if this is true, how do you make a StarCraft shooter different enough to live alongside it?</p>
<p>Nexon is the Korean company that famously owns Arc Raiders studio Embark, but which also produced The First Berserker: Khazan last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> in 2023. It also runs a number of online games including Sudden Attack and MapleStory.</p>

            <p>Hey, remember Netflix's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> movie that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">is going nowhere</a> for the time being? Funnily enough, we continue to get more updates on Gore Verbinski's take on the material, which has been dead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why">for nearly 13 years now</a>.</p>
<p>While promoting his latest movie (Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qwyvlg/hi_rmovies_im_gore_verbinski_director_of_good/">on Reddit</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gore-verbinskis-bioshock-movie-would-have-somehow-included-both-of-the-games-endings">IGN</a>), the original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy director once again commented on that ambitious big-screen adaptation at Universal that was ultimately binned.</p>
<p>"I loved this project when we were getting close to making it at Universal... I was going to dive deeply into the Oedipal aspect and definitely keep it hard R with the Little Sisters, and the 'choices' the protagonist makes... and the consequences," he said at first. As a healthy reminder, this was a $200m R-rated movie that was unsurprisingly deemed too risky. But considering Verbinski's knack for both epic and creepy visuals, it probably would've been visually stunning at the very least.</p>
<p>We'd already heard how the project came undone and was shelved, but most of the creative deets had been locked away in a vault. This time around, Verbinski was chattier than usual, so he revealed a shocking approach to the game's conclusion: "I had worked out a way with writer John Logan to have both endings and I was looking forward to bringing that to the big screen and really f***ing with people's heads." The first game's two endings were all about showing the Little Sisters the best side of humanity and rescuing them... or harvesting their power to become more powerful yourself. A single murder ruined your chances of getting the good ending, essentially penalising players for chasing easier and faster upgrades.</p><p>Verbinski has shown in the past he's also quite good when it comes to loopy narratives (and A Cure for Wellness might be the best example in his career), so I'm also choosing to think he could've totally pulled off a dual ending which offers no definitive answer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, he admits he's still hearing about the current iteration of the project from time to time, but he's not sure "any studio is quite willing to go where I was headed." With Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games series, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-long-walk-review">The Long Walk</a>) now at the helm and Netflix footing the bill if the project moves forward, there's a good chance the movie could retain some of the needed edge, but we're not expecting a $200m R-rated epic at this point.</p>

            <p>A demo of Sad Cat Studios' cyberpunk platformer Replaced has been announced.</p>
<p>Replaced is the rather wonderful looking 2.5D "retro-futuristic" sci-fi platformer, which is set in an alternate 1980s America that has been scarred by a nuclear catastrophe. It plops players into the shoes of Reach, an AI who becomes unexpectedly trapped inside a human's body.</p>
<p>Replaced's is set to release next month, but ahead of that, developer Sad Cat Studios' has revealed a demo, which will be available on PC (Steam and Windows store) from 11th February, 2pm UK time.</p>

<p>"Expose the sinister secrets of Phoenix Corporation as Reach, an AI trapped in a human body," reads Replaced's official blurb.  "Navigate a dark cyberpunk thriller in this narrative-driven 2.5D platformer blending cinematic exploration with fluid, free-flow action."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">After a few delays</a>, Replaced is set to release on 12th March, across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/">PC Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/replaced/9mz1c8d26b7h">Xbox Series X/S</a>, Xbox Game Pass, PC Epic, and PC GOG.</p>
<p>I recently got to go hands-on with Replaced. "I really think Replaced has the potential to be something special. I fully expect I will need tissues by the end of it, though, because I have theory about where things are going and well, yeah, emotions. And while emotions alone don't count for much, it's the brutality and relevance of its dystopian setting that makes such a human heart matter," I wrote in Eurogamer's Replaced preview.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">studio was forced to delay the game due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/replaced-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>Oh my goodness, there are so many things I want to tell you about Replaced. I want to tell you about its side-scrolling action, I want to tell you about its cyberpunk landscapes, I want to tell you about its flying cars and the corrupt corporation leading this dystopian world. But, you all know - at least on a surface level - about that already. It's in the trailers, and I can say from playing the first few hours, it's all in the game as well. And, it's great, as I have hoped it would be ever since Replaced was first announced all those years ago.</p>

<p>So, while I will get into more detail about all of that in a moment, if you will humour me for now, I want to talk about something which took me by surprise when I got to go hands-on with Replaced during a visit to publisher Thunderfall last month - the sheer amount of heart there is to be found in this dystopian and cruel world.</p>
<p>Allow me to very quickly set the scene. Replaced is a 2.5D "retro-futuristic" sci-fi platformer, set in an alternate 1980s America. This America has been scarred by a nuclear catastrophe, and now humanity is split. On one side, there is the corrupt Phoenix Corporation, which is holed up behind the walls of Phoenix-City. On the other side, there are those considered disposable, who live in shanty-like towns beyond the walls of Phoenix-City. Mixed into this is a gang known as the Termites, a nasty underground-dwelling bunch who hunt other humans for sport. And when an artificial intelligence known as Reach gets trapped inside his human operator's body at the Transplantology Department, he soon discovers the harsh world that lies beyond the walls of Phoenix-City.</p>

<figcaption>Here's our video-fied version of this preview, to see Replaced in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_E6ODBEMwM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As soon as I took control of Reach, now in this foreign human body, I felt protective of him. Reach only knows what has been taught to him by his operator, and at the beginning of the game there is an almost childish naivety to him. He just wants to protect his operator's body, and doesn't fully understand why the PCPD are hostile towards him. So, he runs for his life into a world that he does not know. At one point, Reach comments that he thought those on the other side of the wall would be provided with necessities to survive. "But this place is… ruined," Reach says. "The level of human aggression does not correlate with the data I have," he adds later.</p><p>Thankfully, Reach is soon saved from aggressive Termites and derelict ruins by Tempest, a rockstar of a soul who takes him back to the relative safeness of Prospero (the Shakespearian-ness of these names is not lost on me). Prospero is, despite its very humble offerings, full of life, and while there is a deep sadness here, there is also hope. There are those who genuinely want to help others, and do good. </p>
<p>While much of these interactions <em>could </em>be missed, Replaced - from what I have played so far - actually has a healthy dose of side quests that build up this world if you chat with those around and about. And, I really suggest you do. Among other things, this saw me helping a young girl restore an arcade machine. I then spent around 20 minutes enjoying a minigame within Replaced, which added a new layer of depth to a game I thought was going to be a fairly straightforward action-based side-scroller.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sad Cat</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then there were those in Prospero who had been dealt a very rough hand in life. <em>Very </em>rough. And yet, they weren't sitting and feeling sorry for themselves. They were out there serving others in a way they knew how. At another point one story, which I will not spoil here, left me with a lump in my throat. Sad Cat has, from my short time with it, completely surpassed my expectations with the way it marries dystopia with heartfelt characterisation in Replaced (and there are some standout characters, from the no-nonsense matriarch of Prospero known as, well Matriarch, to the rather eclectic "bonafide tech-wizard" Yo-Yo and the stern but kind-hearted Ironwood).</p><p>Meanwhile, there are numerous collectable documents and the like you can find littered throughout Replaced. Some of these are more playful, like a board game box, while others will genuinely tug at your heart strings, like an eviction notice or diary entry. Sad Cat has crammed this world with an incredible amount of detail.</p>
<p>Speaking of, oh my word those set pieces. I found myself on several occasions just stopping to look around. The environments, rendered in glorious pixel art, are so dynamic, with trees blowing in the breeze, birds chirping while soaring overhead, sun dappling across the leaf-coloured ground, dilapidated billboards hinting at a once prosperous past, graffiti covered walls and so much more. It is quite something to behold.</p>

</figure><figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sad Cat</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I've touched on, when I wasn't making friends in Prospero I spent my preview facing off against the corrupt Phoenix-City police department as well as various members of the Termite gang by using speed, force and stealth to make my way forward. When things first started going sideways for poor ol' Reach, I did the only thing I knew how - I ran. I fled from the raining gunfire being sent in my direction, jumping over fences and logs as I made my way from the city itself and into the surrounding woodlands. The jumps between runs were fluid and slick, and while this section may have gone on a <em>little </em>long, ah, it was exhilarating.</p><p>However I was soon face to face with a rather burly cop who wanted my guts for garters, and here Reach and I learned to counterattack and dodge with some classic indicators: counter when little yellow 'lightening bolts' appear above an enemies head, dodge when it's a red one. A little later I found myself a gun, and while Reach could not fire it yet due to the built-in biolock, he could use it like a baton, which was rather handy against those Termite fools. Then it was a case of punch and repeat.</p>
<p>At one point, I was worried this style of combat may get a tad samey, but thankfully a little later into the preview, I was at last able to fire my gun thanks to Yo-Yo. I couldn't go totally bananas with it though - this wasn't a John McClane "Ho, ho, ho, now I have a machine gun" moment. Rather, I had to charge up the gun with energy before I was able to take a shot. This was done by hitting and countering enemy attacks. Only then could I release a very satisfying, and somewhat juicy, blow to an oncoming foe.</p>

</figure><figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sad Cat</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for those foes, they ranged from some fairly basic Termite goons to the much sturdier Tank Termites. Some enemies had their own guns, meanwhile, so it was important to keep an eye on what everyone was doing when a brawl happened, because I got shot a fair few times when my focus was one Termite, not realising another one was about to pop me off from behind (huzzah for those medical stims I picked up earlier!).</p><p>Then, there was the leader of the Termites, a futuristic chunk of man known as Uncle Ben, who looks like a mash up between LeChuck from the Monkey Island series and - once another journalist pointed it out to me, meaning I could no longer unsee it - the villain from Disney's Mulan. Before I could get to him, though, I had to sneak past the rest of his Termite crew, using - aha, the third tool in my arsenal - stealth!</p>
<p>Avoiding the spotlight of a patrolling Termite car, which housed a very accurate Termite Sniper, I used a newly acquired pickaxe to swing behind pillars and walls in order to stay hidden. I ducked behind crates, I scrabbled up walls, and I poured myself through windows, all the while avoiding the beam of light that would immediately bring about my death should it land on me. To be clear, I did not manage this the first time. Or the second for that matter. In fact, it took me several attempts to finally make it past the searching cars, and for quite some time I was launching poor Reach into an abyss because I kept failing to deploy my pickaxe at the right time. I am pretty sure he forgave me, though…</p>

<p>I honestly loved my time with Replaced. I always thought I would enjoy it, but my expectations have far and away been surpassed. There are still a few things that are not perfect, of course. The 'yellow paint' markers guiding you by the hand can be a little distracting, and there could have been more enemy variety.</p><p>But, overall, I really think Replaced has the potential to be something special. I fully expect I will need tissues by the end of it, though, because I have theory about where things are going and well, yeah, emotions. And while emotions alone don't count for much, it's the brutality and relevance of its dystopian setting that makes such a human heart matter.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">the last State of Play</a>, which gave us our first proper look at Insomniac's brutal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> game and started to nail down the final details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/saros">Saros</a>, the new sci-fi roguelite from Housemarque. Now, we finally know when the next big stream from Sony is happening.</p>
<p>On 9th February, and following a bunch of rumours, 2026's first State of Play was locked for <strong>12th February, Thursday, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm GMT / 11pm CEST</strong>. As always, you can watch via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PlayStation">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>, so set your alarms and start working on big theories and wishlists!</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/09/state-of-play-returns-this-thursday-february-12/">official PlayStation Blog post</a> doesn't tease any of the titles we'll be seeing, but it makes it very clear it's a full-blown showcase featuring third-party and indie games as well as large projects from PlayStation Studios. It'll be over 60 minutes long and include "news, gameplay updates, and announcements."</p>
<p>Last week, Guerrilla Games surprised-dropped a reveal of the second long-rumoured online Horizon game: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-hunters-gathering-is-a-three-player-tactical-co-op-game-that-looks-a-bit-like-dauntless-with-a-closed-playtest-coming-soon">Hunters Gathering</a>. We might get an extra update on the upcoming playtests there, but otherwise, it's strange Sony got it out of the way so close to a big State of Play.</p><p>As we march into a year that should be mainly defined on the first-party front by Saros and Wolverine, many are wondering whether PlayStation Studios has more aces up its sleeve beyond the admittedly strong third-party support and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> (coming March), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">which has been doing actually okay</a> following its rebooted marketing campaign.</p>
<p>In any case, it's exciting to be looking forward to another one of these streams again, and with no limits to what can be shown, anything is possible. What are you hoping for?</p>

            <p>Today, in news no one could've predicted: Toyota has been quietly working on a game engine of its own, but the end goal isn't what you'd expect.</p>
<p>The shocker comes from <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/toyota-announces-open-source-console-grade-proprietary-game-engine/">Automaton</a> (with Japanese site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2026/02/09/162541.html">Game*Spark</a> as the original source), who explains Toyota Connected North America, a subsidiary of the company known for its cars, recently revealed the <a href="https://fluorite.game/">Fluorite</a> engine. It "works closely with Flutter," which is the UI framework used by Google, and uses the Dart language to handle game logic as well as interface. "Its purpose is to yield high performance even on lower-end or embedded hardware, like running 3D graphics and interactive UI via in-vehicle systems."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the official Fluorite site shared above is highlighting features like its high-performance Entity Component System (ECS) core, which is written in C++ and goes for "optimization for weaker hardware." Secondly, there are "model-defined trigger touch zones" that should allow artists to more easily set clickable areas inside Blender, making "building 3D interfaces a lot simpler."</p>
<p>The third highlight is "console-grade 3D rendering" powered by Google's Filament, which definitely ups its potential for game development even if Toyota's ambitions are limited to displays for its cars. Last but not least, Fluorite is also leaning on Flutter's 'Hot Reload' to allow quick updating of scenes.</p><p>So, why did Toyota work on this in the first place? Well, the original Game*Spark piece, translated by Automaton, explains Toyota Connected North America originally wanted to work with established game engines, but all of them were tied to high licensing fees or a resource-intensive nature. Thus, Fluorite was born.</p>
<p>The best part is that Fluorite is being marketed as a fully featured open-source engine, so even if Toyota won't be working on games, there might be potential there for independent developers.</p>

            <p>Tundra Interactive, the indie developer behind the indie strategy RPG Void War, has at last spoken out about why the game was temporarily removed from Steam earlier this year. The reason? Well, according to Tundra , it all has to do with a particular set of bulky, familiar-looking shoulder pads.</p>
<p>The original DMCA take down was issued by one Mal Reynolds on behalf of Games Workshop. Tundra initially believed this to be a troll takedown, given Mal Reynolds is the protagonist's name in Firefly, but it turns out this was a legitimate DMCA by the UK tabletop juggernaut.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-issued-ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-steam-game-with-a-dmca-takedown-because-of-oversized-convex-shoulder-pads-with-a-metallic-rim-dev-says">Speaking to IGN</a>, Tundra Interactive confirmed the DMCA's legitimacy, and claimed the given reason for the takedown notice was a pair of shoulder-pads shown off in its original featured trailer, described by Games Workshop as: "oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim".</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Here's that bloke and his shoulders, for reference. Does this look like a space marine to you? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Tundra Interactive.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Looking at this character, and his shoulder pads, there is a clear resemblance between the bloke and a Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine. With the big spike attached, one could likely be mistaken for thinking it were a Chaos Astartes. Tundra told IGN it disagreed with this opinion from Games Workshop, but took the trailer off the Steam store page nonetheless .</p>
<p>In a statement issued to IGN, Tundra stated: "All of the artwork in the trailer is original work created by our artists. While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on. We may re-upload an updated version later after we find time to adjust that shot, but for now our priority is shipping content and finishing multi-language font support so we can finally deliver proper translations."</p><p>Regardless of this minor hurdle for Tundra and Void War, the game is back up on Steam seemingly unhampered by the DMCA notice, with a new trailer present to be safe. A word of warning perhaps, Games Workshop is keeping an eye out for potential copyright infringement! Be careful when designing grimdark sci-fi accessories for your bulky soldiers, folks.</p>

            <p>Pokémon has never <em>not</em> been trendy, but we're expecting even more from the massive IP this year, as the "pocket monsters" are turning 30 later this month. That means there are game announcements on the horizon, celebrations happening all over, and even a huge Super Bowl spot starring Lady Gaga and other celebrities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-special-video-set-for-super-bowl-2026">First teased last week</a>, the 'What's Your Favorite?' ad played during last night's Super Bowl match and was also released online by The Pokémon Company, who enlisted a number of world-renowned individuals to essentially yap about their favourite Pokémon. The highlight here is Lady Gaga performing Jigglypuff's iconic song from the anime, but the whole thing feels adequately cute:</p> <figure>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3O4ymaZ41Q" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The list of celebrities in the spot includes comedian Trevor Noah, Blackpink's Jisoo, F1 driver Charles Leclerc, football player Lamine Yamal, actress Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and singer Young Miko as they reveal their favourite Pokémon. You have safe picks like Arcanine and Jigglypuff, whereas others go for Zygarde or Luxray. No Pikachu here, which makes these clips feel somewhat genuine.</p>
<p>The end of the video also encourages Pokémon fans to create Pokémon 30 snapshots with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon GO</a> app with a "What's Your Favorite" filter. Though this promo, which has cost The Pokémon Company millions of dollars just for the Super Bowl slot alone, focuses on the mobile sensation and people's connection with the largely adorable creatures, it's a fun way to kick off a "year of Pokémon" that probably has many surprises in store for us.</p><p>We're not expecting much talk of new games until after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> comes out early next month, but perhaps the 27th February (the day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-original-pokemon-games-took-lots-of-trial-and-error-to-develop">Pokémon Green &amp; Red</a> were originally released) will arrive with a stream that outlines the immediate future of Pokémon video games. That's just wishful thinking, but it would make sense, wouldn't it?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> player-numbers are currently the strongest they've been on Steam since the game arrived there, spiking ahead of the game's first expansion-like release, The Reign of Talon, which arrives tomorrow, 10th February.</p>
<p>Sunday, 8th February saw approximately 70,000 people playing Overwatch 2 together on Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a> - which is only 5000 fewer than when Overwatch 2 launched there in August 2023. The game has struggled to break 60,000 concurrent players since then.</p>
<p>The numbers aren't gigantic - they put Overwatch 2 39th in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">Steam's Most Played list</a>, which is notably lower than competing hero shooter Marvel Rivals, in 21st - but Steam isn't the only platform Overwatch 2 is played on. The primary home of Overwatch 2 is Battle.net, so the true number of people playing Overwatch 2 is likely to be markedly higher.</p>

<p>It bodes well for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Overwatch 2, which undergoes a bit of a relaunch this week</a>, dropping the "2" from its name and welcoming five new heroes at once - and further five throughout the year - in a huge, unprecedented-for-the-game, expansion-like release. And the plan is to do these expansion-like releases every year. There's a lot to unpack, as I found out when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">I travelled to Blizzard recently to learn about Overwatch's bold new plan</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-review-a-brilliant-teamplay-experience-in-the-grip-of-an-existential-crisis">Overwatch 2 launched in 2023, after a year in early access</a>, controversially overriding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> 1, a game that no longer exists. Overwatch 2 moved the series to being fully free-to-play, supported by a Battle Pass, and changed group sizes to five from six. It was a rough transition, but lots of good work has been done on the game in the years since, reintroducing 6v6 battles and ironing out a lot of Battle Pass kinks, and adding significant new game modes like Stadium, in which you can mechanically customise a hero similar to how you would in a MOBA - earning new abilities as you play.</p>

            <p>As that cartoon lion once famously sang before killing his uncle and shagging his cousin, I just can't wait to be king! It's not a sentiment I was expecting to be writing when I first fired up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s latest major expansion, Royalty &amp; Legacy - I'm hardly what you'd call an enthusiastic monarchist - but here I now am, several hours in; scheming and extorting my way to the top, drunk on unearned power.</p>

<p>In Royalty &amp; Legacy, a Sims' regal ascent is tied to the concept of Nobility. Any Sim can be a Noble, and all that's required to get started is a throne, a knighthood, or - the cheaper, more straightforward option - a book purchase and a bit of research into their ancestry. But first, I turned to the forgotten depths of my harddrive, plucking out Daxton Flood - a young adult Sim of limited fortune and humble living - for what I'd vaguely envisaged to be a sort of rags-to-riches story.</p>
<p>As exotic as the Noble life might seem in reality, Royalty &amp; Legacy simplifies it down to a fairly standard Sims 4 career. By completing various tasks, a Sim can slowly rise through the ranks of Nobility, earning money, power, and opportunity as they go. Which brings us back to Daxton Flood - now wrenched away from his happy, familiar life in Ravenwood and relocated to a drab fishing shack in the new world of Ondarion. And credit to Maxis, Ondarion is beautiful; a gorgeously detailed coastal region split into three distinct neighbourhoods: the art-loving Dambele, the opulent Bellacorde, and Verdemar, a quiet coastal corner that once served as home to nobles and pirates alike. And, really, who could resist that kind of storytelling prompt: son of a legendary pirate resurfaces and becomes unruly pirate king? Of course I was in.</p>

<p>Or at least that was the plan. But it didn't take long to veer off course once the power started trickling in. As a Noble, each promotion - from humble knight through the likes of viscount and duke on the way toward king - requires a Sim to complete a checklist of vaguely thematic tasks. And so Daxton's earliest days were spent polishing his Charisma in front of the mirror, nipping off to practice waltzing and swordsmanship, or vanishing on rabbit-hole-style Noble Ventures. And while the benefits of promotion start off fairly small - a couple of Noble-skewed social interactions - things steadily grow more interesting. It wasn't long before Daxton was holding court, giving speeches, and making life-changing decisions for his subjects after listening to their woes. And eventually it's possible to enact powerful decrees in your kingdom - boosting the likelihood of pregnancies resulting in twins or triplets, perhaps, or increasing the payout of creative pursuits if you enact the Artisan's Proclamation.</p><p>And while all this is going on, Royalty &amp; Legacy keeps track of your Noble Alignment, responding accordingly depending on whether your actions most frequently favour the proletariat or the nobility (did you spend your afternoon helping out at the local school or mocking the poor?). Imagine my surprise when a well-dressed stranger showed up with a nicely wrapped gift - containing, it turned out, a pile of trash, making his feelings on my reign entirely clear. Sometimes too, you'll receive missives in your letter box, praising your grand beneficence, or slapping you down with thinly veiled threats. You can, if you wish, fire a few responses back from atop your throne. Which really did set the tone for everything to come when I discovered the only place big enough to put one was in the yard next to Daxton's bins.</p>



<p>Daxton's grasp for kinghood didn't exactly start swimmingly, but soon enough we were getting the hang of this whole Nobility thing. We set up a family dynasty for future heirs and began working toward unlocking some powerful boons; we enacted a couple of entirely self-serving decrees, put the gladrags on for a nobles-only ballroom whirl, kissed a couple of frogs (no handsome princes this time, just slimy lips), failed at extracting the mythical sword in the stone, won a quick swordfighting tournament in the afternoon, and slipped away for an illicit tryst with a gentleman from an opposing house at sundown. Scandalous!</p><p>And secrets are their own currency in Royalty &amp; Legacy. After finagling a friendship with a fellow noble so they'd dish the dirt on some of Daxton's less malleable acquaintances, we learned some <em>very</em> interesting things. One of Daxton's love rivals, for instance, had taken to the dark arts in order to manipulate her extended social circle. And armed with this shocking knowledge, he could happily orchestrate her downfall. Extortion is one option if you're looking for a specific outcome, but exposure also brings its own machiavellian sense of reward. And having exposed her secret on social media, I was delighted to see she'd been blighted by a random assortment of debuffs - mockery in the streets, a frequent need to pee - for the next few days.</p>



<p>But what goes around and all that. After a pretty good streak as supreme ruler of my glorious trash yard - peasants delighted by Daxton's beneficent rule, poshos slightly more irked - it all went a bit wrong. Royalty &amp; Legacy introduces Backrooms, a lot-type that serves as one thing by day and another by night. And having heard rumours of a bookshop-turned-red hot night spot over in Dambele, it seemed like the perfect place to continue Daxton's steamy affair away from prying eyes. Which turned out to be true - but then disaster struck when a drunken swordfight resulted in a spectacular loss on the way home, Daxton becoming embroiled in his own scandal of shame. Nobody likes a loser. And guess who found out, sweeping in for her revenge?</p><p>You can, of course, ride out a scandal - secreting your Sim away until the hungry mob finds a new target and the debuffs have gone. But that kind of skulking didn't seem in character for Daxton and his ordinarily proactive approach to bin-adjacent rule. So I purchased a podium and used his Noble powers to call a press conference in front of his humble abode - it's all about the optics! - after which news-hungry journos and curious onlookers began amassing in their droves. And the full-throated apology Daxton so convincingly delivered would probably have done the trick if I hadn't suddenly discovered the option to make him instantly nude.</p>

<p>Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from Royalty &amp; Legacy, assuming it'd be a little too far removed from my usual, more grounded Sims 4 playstyle. And while it definitely feels like an expansion primarily designed to fill a very specific role-playing niche, its systems - even if they <em>are</em> built on familiar foundations - coalesce in a way that really sells the illusion. And even though it's hard to feel comfortably all-in on anything The Sims right now, given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA's controversial new ownership</a>, I can't pretend I didn't get swept up in the adoration, manipulation, and corrupting influence of power. Will Royalty &amp; Legacy stay in my DLC rotation for the long term? The jury's still out - but maybe Simba had the right idea all along.</p>

            <p>Initial player data indicates that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> is performing well following its release last Friday, hitting nearly 90,000 concurrent players on Steam over the weekend. It is currently at the top of Steam's Trending Games list.</p>
<p>Nioh 3, the latest triple-A release from Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, hit an all-time peak of 88,045 concurrent PC players on Sunday <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681010/charts/">according to SteamDB</a>. This is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1325200/charts/">over double what Nioh 2 achieved on the same platform</a>, and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/485510/charts/">eight times what the original Nioh managed</a>. The big difference, aside from a potential increase in popularity? Nioh 3 is the first game in the series to launch simultaneously on PC and console.</p>
<p>With that, it's worth considering Nioh 3 is also available on the PlayStation 5, so these figures are only one half of the whole picture. While player data isn't as readily available on console platforms, the game does currently have a 4.48 star rating on the PlayStation store.

<p>It's not just a case of good-looking numbers, either. Nioh 3 is currently sitting on a very positive rating on Steam, with games critic reviews praising the game in droves. The game is currently sitting at 86 on Metacritic.</p>
<p>As for Eurogamer,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review"> it was described as "a historical high for Team Ninja" in our review</a>. Dom Peppiat summarises the game's merits with the following: "Innovation is the ki to success for Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo, as Nioh 3 iterates on the formula once more to take an already great 'masocore' series to new heights."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> has been in a pretty good place since 2020's Wastelanders update, which added NPCs and entirely new questlines to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-review-a-bizarre-boring-and-broken-mess">the once-barren online survival game</a>. Since then, it's become more of a full-blown multiplayer RPG with a strong diehard community even if not every Fallout fan vibes with the basic pitch. Why don't we have crossplay though?</p>
<p>This question has been repeatedly raised by the players over the years, and you'd think the development team is tired of giving negative answers by now, but something could change at some point in the future. Just don't expect an update to happen soon.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-no-crossplay-cross-progression-feature/">a roundtable interview</a> in late 2025 where the idea of having crossplay was shot down due to the "huge technical hurdle" it'd be to figure out almost eight years after launch, there's a new hope to latch on to. During an interview with creative director Jon Rush and production director Bill LaCoste (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout-76-crossplay-bethesda/">Polygon</a>), a more positive update on the matter was given.</p>
<p>"We are looking into it, and we have plans to try to scope out what that work is going to entail for us... It's just not in the immediate plans for us. We know players want it," Rush said. Don't expect proper commitment to the idea, as it sounds like Bethesda is just exploring options as the community doesn't let go of the idea, but the door hasn't been fully shut yet.</p><p>LaCoste once again brought up the "technical hurdles" of going back to the game's roots after years of iteration and trying to rework its innards into something that supports shared online play across all platforms without breaking anything in the process: "So going back and retrofitting it to do that, when you have different places that players are pointing into, and now you're having to worry about entitlements and account purchases and currency." If you've been around long enough, you know we also have to add to the pile of potential issues Creation Engine's infamous creakiness and tendency to crashing.</p>
<p>While it seems crossplay remains a distant dream, this is yet another example of organized movement from the most dedicated portion of a game's community making a difference. A few years ago, we'd lost all hope of Fallout 76 ever getting a current-gen upgrade, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-native-versions-for-xbox-series-x-and-s-and-ps5-early-2026">that will be happening later this year</a>, so it's never too late to turn things around if the interest is there and the financials make sense.</p>
<p>In any case, the numbers should be good enough, as Fallout Season 2 has made us (and seemingly many people) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">excited for Fallout's overall future</a> and Bethesda is happily adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-goes-free-to-celebrate-tv-shows-season-2-conclusion-adds-a-30-cosmetic-cameo">$30 power armour cosmetics</a> to a game that many were burying ages ago.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 6.46pm</strong>: In a statement to Eurogamer, Epic Games' senior communications manager, Brian Sharon, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place."</blockquote>
<p>Original story follows.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Horses developer Santa Ragione has responded to comments from an Epic Games Store executive claiming he "made provably incorrect statements about the game's content".</p>
<p>Posting the statement online over the weekend, Santa Ragione refuted claims that Epic Games Store "love" the studio, alleging the storefront had "ghosted" it when it withdrew support for its controversial horror game at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Santa Ragione's Horses was, of course, the subject of multiple headlines ahead of its release as Steam <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">refused to distribute the game</a>. Then, just before its release, it was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">banned from the Epic storefront</a>. This all put the studio into jeopardy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">with founder Pietro Righi Riva telling Eurogamer it could face closure if Horses didn't sell well</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">Santa Ragione claimed that it had received notification from Epic 24 hours before Horses' release</a>, explaining it would no longer distribute the game after its "review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines". Epic's email specifically referenced its policies around "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content", saying Horses contravenes guidelines prohibiting content that "promotes abuse and animal abuse", and "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour or [that is] not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated".</p>
<p>On this latter point, Epic said it had filled out an IARC Questionnaire based on the content it reviewed, receiving an Adult Only (AO) rating - a rating category it does not distribute on its storefront.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, however, Epic VP Steve Allison told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game">Game File</a> in an interview, "We love [Santa Ragione] [... but the studio's] answers were just different than... some of the moderators' were after they played through the game".</p>
<p>"Our time on this topic was limited, but it seems news of the Steam ban triggered an Epic review of the rating, which is usually produced via a self-reported submission to a ratings coalition," Game File's Stephen Totilo later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me7ljfxjes2i">clarified</a> on social media.</p>

<p>"The fact that the game does not deserve an AO rating is apparent from the widely available full walkthroughs on YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, as well as from its distribution on the Humble Store," the studio added.</p>

<p>"I think Rayman is still a fun game, and there's a lot of content," Michel told <a href="https://retrogamesofficial.com/">RetroGamer</a>. "The pacing is a bit slow because you have a big character on the screen. It also has pixel-precise gameplay, so it's not always easy, but it's interesting that the constraints of yesterday make it still feel original today.</p><p>"Even though it's complex, I think there's a kind of remake planned," he added. "I think it's a nice move, because [the lack of savepoints is] the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps now one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">second only to the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>, the unannounced Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-unannounced-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-popped-up-on-the-australian-ratings-board">even popped up on the Australian Classification Board</a>. The Australian government has rated it a 'G' - the equivalent to the UK's 'U' - for its "very mild impact" violence. It's reportedly coming to both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch, with Atari listed as both the developer and publisher.</p>
<p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, towards the end of last year, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-series-returns-to-life-on-its-30th-anniversary-but-dont-expect-a-new-game-soon">and provided a little teaser of what's to come</a>. In a video posted on the official Rayman X account, which had been dormant for years prior to the announcement, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>It's now unclear, however, if those plans have been scuppered by Ubisoft's "reset" in which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a>, including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. The news wiped<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years"> over a third off its share price</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has "aggressively" been cracking down on cheaters and already banned "tens of thousands of players so far".</p>
<p>That's according to Embark Studios' CEO Patrick Söderlund, who told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">IGN</a> in a new interview that while he wasn't "going to give a specific number" on how many players have been caught cheating, with "anywhere between 0.1 percent to one percent of any multiplayer crowd in a large-scale multiplayer game is cheating", the team had to work hard to "be a step ahead".</p>

</div><figcaption>Is Arc Raiders any good?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziFMFFkMJ2Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"We have been pretty aggressive on this," Söderlund said. "The game wasn't prone to so many cheaters in the beginning, but as with all multiplayer games that get successful, this becomes a component, unfortunately. For us as developers, just like a [Distributed Denial-of-Service] attack, it's one of these things that you just have to try and be a step ahead. To be very honest with you, it's not always easy because the minute you do something, the minute you come up with something, they've come up with something else to do."</p>
<p>That's not the only difficulty, either. Söderlund said that the banning process alone is "delicate" because "we need to make sure that we ban people that deserve to be banned".</p>
<p>"If you take general figures, anywhere between 0.1% to 1% of any multiplayer crowd in a large-scale multiplayer game is cheating, and therefore, to some extent, should get a temporary or a longer, or permanent ban," Söderlund explained.</p>
<p>"It could be a minor thing that you're trying. An aim bot that may get you a 24-hour suspension, to doing something that, frankly, means you shouldn't be playing the game anymore. So, we've put together a system. We've started banning players, and why do I know that? Because I see an influx of people trying to get to the studio, and to me. 'Oh, I didn't do anything'.</p><p>"We're seeing a pretty substantial change in that, but I know that we have banned probably tens of thousands of players so far, that I know. Again, we need to make sure that we get it right. That we are fair, and that, in the case where it's clear that we didn't get it right, that we can quickly remedy the situation so that player isn't affected in an unfair fashion or way."</p>
<p>It's this need to be fair that does, Söderlund admits, result in "a little bit more cautio[n] than what I think some people want for that specific reason".</p>
<p>"Regardless of how cautious you are and what systems are in place, there are always people that are going to feel like they're treated unfairly that, 'I didn't do anything,' and then there are absolutely people that will get caught or that are unfairly banned that we need to deal with. We try and look at it from that perspective, but we will continue to go after people that are doing things in the game that they shouldn't do."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raider-is-committed-to-skill-and-fun-not-unfair-advantages-and-is-refunding-gear-lost-to-cheaters-even-if-you-didnt-report-them">Arc Raiders committed to returning items to your inventory if you lose them to cheaters</a> shortly after launch, saying it was "committed to skill and fun, not unfair advantages". And you don't even have to be the person to have reported them, either.</p><p>While finding and losing gear in extraction shooters is a key part of the experience, developer Embark Studios said it was working to ensure that players who lose out due to "unfair play" are compensated, regardless of whether or not they're the one who reported the cheaters in the first place.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview</a>, we wrote: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p>Epic Games Store plans to be available on the next Xbox console at launch.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game">Game File</a>, Epic Games' Steve Allison said Xbox had "welcome[d]" the idea of including Epic's storefront on its hardware, adding "we're going to be there, like, on day one".</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Love &amp; Legends in Fortnite.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV4XiVb4aJQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"We definitely plan to be on the new hardware for Xbox, because, unless their policy or stance on it changes, [Microsoft] are telling us they’re going to welcome that," Allison said. "And we're going be there, like, on day one. That will probably require us to build in whatever their requirements are, some sort of software to support that."</p>
<p>To do this, however, Epic needs to design a dedicated app for the next Xbox console, and Allison admitted, "we haven't built the apps for those that we need to build".</p>
<p>If this comes to pass, it'll herald a significant change in the console ecosystem, which, up until now, has been extraordinarily closed to third-party sellers.</p>
<p>Allison went further, confirming Epic Games Store now averaged around 67 million monthly users last year – around half of Steam's, Allison thinks – and generating a record $400 million (£294m) in revenue from the sale of third-party games.</p>
<p>Consequently, Epic now intends to expand into other markets, including on iOS in Japan, mobile in Brazil, add more social features (forums(!), specifically), and make it easier to switch between EGS' PC offerings and EGS on mobile. We should also expect an update to the store's game launcher later this year, too.</p>
<p>"We're ripping out the guts. We're replacing the guts with modern guts. That are faster, it won't have, like, a two-second lag on your refresh, it won't take as much system resources in your tray, all that stuff's underway."</p>
<p>In a different interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/epic-wants-to-bring-its-store-to-the-next-gen-xbox-as-it-begins-to-show-serious-growth-weve-been-talking-to-the-folks-at-microsoft">WindowsCentral</a>, confirming Epic Games had "been talking to the folks at Microsoft" and expected "serious growth" as it continues to build its sales business, Allison hinted that its free games program can have a significant impact on the sale of <em>its</em> free games on <em>other</em> platforms, like Steam and consoles.</p>
<p>"We take it very seriously," Allison said about its free games program. "The team loves to highlight games that they think are awesome, that may have been underserved or missed by players.</p>
<p>"We bring in 10 million new players a year through the program. It's very consistent. It's the best customer acquisition spend you can ever make, from a dollars-per-new-user standpoint," Allison added. "It's really important for our players. I would never want to see us rug pull it away from people, it's kind of part of our identity."</p>

            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron insists we are "misunderstanding" his recent comments about video games.</p>
<p>Macron felt compelled to jump onto X/Twitter over the weekend after he "once again made gamers lose it" following an <a href="https://chb44.com/2026/02/france-ai-video-games-children-safety/">address to the nation earlier this month</a>, wherein he confirmed plans to study how children are affected by AI and gaming.</p>

<p>"I've seen a lot of misunderstandings. So let me be clear," he <a href="https://x.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2020059471209283956">wrote</a> (as translated by machine and what I remember from GCSE French). "The facts: I have always supported video games, pop culture – the industry, creation, culture, jobs. I have put French esports in the spotlight at the Élysée and made commitments to structure the sector and attract major events to France, which we have done.</p><p>"We have honoured the Sandfall teams and, even better, I support the participation of our teams (Karmine, Vitality, Gentle Mates, etc.) in the creation of a French national team around video games for a world competition. There are so many French gems that have global influence! We can be extremely proud of that."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>J’ai (encore) fait bondir les gamers…</p><p> J’ai vu beaucoup d’incompréhensions.<br>Alors je vais être clair.</p><p> Les faits : j’ai toujours soutenu le jeu vidéo, la popculture - industrie, création, culture, emplois.… <a href="https://t.co/Wl7P3REHxH">pic.twitter.com/Wl7P3REHxH</a></p></div>— Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/2020059471209283956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>However, Macron added that supporting the games industry and its culture does not mean he cannot "ask a simple question" about the impact of gaming on young people.</p>
<p>"Parents' observation is that some young people spend their days and sometimes their nights playing. It has also often been pointed out that games rated PEGI 18 are played by children," he added. "This is a major issue of public health, education, and responsibility. For physical health, especially the eyes, and mental health, when a young person no longer goes out at all because they play excessively, of course, it is worrying, and we must take it seriously.</p>
<p>"What I announced on Brut, in response to this teacher who was shouting her anger, is not a ban on video games: it is the launch of a scientific, collective work to look reality in the face. Calmly, lucidly, and with all stakeholders involved. It is our responsibility to ask researchers, scientists, and clinicians to assess the impacts, to untangle received ideas and to shed light on the public debate."</p><p>Macron added: "That is exactly what I am doing: I am opening a serious, informed and calm debate, which I want to keep far away from shortcuts. One can love video games, be proud of them, and at the same time look without taboo at certain practices and their effects."</p>
<p>If you're wondering what he means by honouring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, developer members of Sandfall Interactive were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7425479716297539584/">knighted last week</a> in recognition of their significant contributions to the French arts. The Ordre des Arts et des Lettres – the Order of Arts and Letters – was given to Sandfall developers to mark a "major moment in the history of French video games".</p>
<p>Macron also congratulated Sandfall Interactive when Clair Obscur: Expediyion 33 released last year, calling its RPG a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">"shining example of French audacity and creativity"</a>, and just last month, Macron once again publicly congratulated Sandfall Interactive for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, this time for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">securing a record-breaking nine wins at The Game Awards </a>in December.</p>

            <p>Another day, another game getting the TV treatment, but this one's a biggie: Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast this week revealed Craig Mazin, showrunner on HBO's divisive The Last of Us television adaptation, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-tv-treatment-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-showrunner">turning his hand to Baldur's Gate</a>, and specifically continuing the story of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on TV. Developer Larian's fantasy RPG is, of course, a <em>hugely</em> beloved game, and responses to the news have been swift, strong, and not entirely positive. Feelings have also been floating around the Eurogamer office (well, it's more of a chat room, but you get the point), and, thus, the embers of this week's The Big Question were inflamed. This, for those of you new to these parts, is where we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/the-big-question">tackle a topical talking point</a> from the week's video gaming news before flinging it over to you. Let's go!</p>
<p>Mazin hit the headlines back in 2019 for his award-winning work on HBO miniseries Chernobyl - a link that offered some assurance to The Last of Us fans when it was announced Mazin would be adapting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s video game for TV. And that faith appeared to have been rewarded when HBO's show landed to huge critical acclaim and commercial success in 2023. The response to Season 2, however, has been rather more mixed, and - related or not - what was initially planned as a four-season story arc now seems to have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">truncated to three</a>. Which is to say that Mazin's attachment to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> TV series comes with some baggage, deserved or otherwise. Nor does it help that Larian won't be involved in the show beyond a planned "chat" with Mazin. Feelings on this week's announcement are divided to say the least.</p>

<p>For Eurogamer's Connor Makar, though, it's all a bad idea. "The problem with the HBO show," he opines, "is that (as it appears to based quite closely on the 'canon' ending of Baldur's Gate 3, focusing on the companions' future etc.) it can't help but annoy huge swathes of fans who envisioned the future differently - the fans who made other choices, and won't recognize HBO's Baldur's Gate as their own." And, yes, Connor counts himself in that number.</p><p>"For me," he continues by way of example, "Karlach's a squid now. She just is. There was a romantic thing going on, but in the epilogue when I saw the squid head I was like, sorry love, this won't work out. So, as far as I'm concerned, she should be floating around all sad and inked up. I would bet hard cash that's not how Karlach will appear in the show, though. She'll be her red and popular self, immediately making my Baldur's Gate false. They'll make yours false too! I don't know about you, but to me, that sucks."</p>
<p>As for our Bertie - someone else who's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/lets-get-evil">spent a lot of time making Baldur's Gate 3 his own</a> - the immediate response to HBO's announcement was equally negative, but he's slightly coming around. "I woke up hating the idea," he says, "but I've softened a bit since. Look, Wizards of the Coast can presumably do what it likes with Baldur's Gate now. Larian's done its thing and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">off making Divinity</a>. The two have gone their separate ways. And as much as I love Baldur's Gate 3 and feel protective over it, I can't expect capitalism to keel over because I don't want my experience tarnished by whatever comes next. Wizards could have asked Jerry Bruckheimer to adapt this but they haven't. In the scheme of things, Mazin is a much better shout."</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"I'm reassured by how much of a nerd he seems to be," Bertie continues. "He's apparently got 1000 hours in Baldur's Gate 3, which is a lot more than me, and I'm an actual self-identifying nerd. Where he finds the time, I don't know - shouldn't he have been improving the second season of The Last of Us or something? Don't, Bertie, don't. To me, it suggests he's passionate about the game and that he cares, as does the fact he's going to chat with Larian, to presumably show he's not taking Baldur's Gate in an atrocious direction."</p>
<p>The choice to go with Mazin specifically is, of course, another sticking point for some, so I asked Eurogamer's Victoria Phillips Kennedy - a self-confessed mega-fan of Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-wraps-with-episode-seven-but-was-it-a-satisfying-finale">frequent watcher of the television show</a> - how she felt about the Baldur's Gate 3 news in the context of Mazin's hiring. "I'll admit I was a tad surprised," she says. "Mazin's Chernobyl and his The Last of Us adaptation - the work I have most knowledge of - are both largely grounded in a very gritty, realistic world, while Baldur's Gate 3 is a fantastical cocktail of chaos, with dragons, spells, mindflayers and more."</p><p>"Even so," she continues, "I don't think you can deny Mazin's talent. And as someone who - for the first season at least - thought his work adapting The Last of Us was exemplary (season two isn't <em>bad</em>, I just don't think it's up to quality of the first), I guess I'm hopeful he'll do the same for Baldur's Gate 3, and treat the game fans love with respect and authenticity. And yes, I know Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann was heavily involved with The Last of Us, and not having Larian joining in with Baldur's Gate 3 is undoubtedly a shame. But, Druckmann wasn't part of Chernobyl, and I think that's one of the greatest TV shows this side of the millennium."</p>
<p>But for all the skepticism surrounding the Baldur's Gate 3 TV show at this early juncture, Bertie reckons there's potentially reason to be excited too. "Secretly, I'm quite jazzed - do people say jazzed? - at the prospect of seeing the Baldur's Gate setting in glossy cinematic detail on our TV screens," he says. "This isn't an exclusive-to-BG3 setting after all, but a Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting detailed and expanded over decades of collaborative development. The creative opportunities here are huge - it's an enormous and very detailed playground."</p>

</figure>
<p>And while I'm undoubtedly absolutely the worse person to be sticking my opinion into this discussion given I've only had chance to play a couple of hours of Baldur's Gate 3 and am very much of the opinion Naughty Dog's The Last of Us isn't All That, I kind of think Bertie's onto something here. I always thought the first season of Mazin's The Last of Us adaptation was at its best when it didn't feel completely beholden to its source material; when it felt freer to scribble outside of Naughty Dog's previously defined lines. So I'm kind of curious to see what Mazin - as a clearly skilled writer and fan of Baldur's Gate - can do in a bigger sandbox, when he's not so tightly constrained. As Bertie puts it, "Where Mazin will decide to go with the series, I don't know, but as the 2023 Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honour Among Thieves film showed, there is, potentially, great entertainment to be found."</p><p>So with us lot out the way, it's your go. Do you think continuing the story of Baldur's Gate 3 is a futile - and misguided - pursuit, given the show can't possibly satisfy a loyal fanbase who all have very different, very personal memories of the game? Is Larian's absence from the project also a concern? Or perhaps Mazin has earned your trust, and maybe you're just excited to see him play around in a sandbox with so much potential, where a whole new bunch of stories are waiting to be told? Will you be tuning in? That's The Big Question, and now over to you!</p>

            <p>Who do you have this Sunday? Do you even care? Maybe not - this is <em>Euro</em>gamer after all, and one could not be blamed for not taking an interest in an American sport right now. But there's nevertheless definitely more fandom for hand-egg in Europe than ever before - and so here I am, thinking about Superbowl Sunday because even here, in Britain, it's all over the telly and the like.</p>
<p>Yes, today is the Superbowl, or 'the big game' as brands call it when they want to do tie-ins without paying or infringing on a weirdly grimy corporate trademark. For me, as a Brit who sort of accidentally tripped into being 'into' this particular sport 15-some years ago, this weekend means staying up until something like four in the morning, praying for a game good enough to justify the late night, junk food, booze, and a very bleary-eyed Monday.</p>
<p>I mercifully don't have a dog in the fight for this specific game, given my Rams valiantly fell at the final hurdle - I just hope the Patriots/Seahawks showdown isn't a blow-out. But that also leaves my mind free to wander and think about the sport as it takes over just about everything in the states and certainly my weekend here. And if I'm thinking about American Football and video games, I'm only thinking about one thing: Blitz.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nfl-blitz">NFL Blitz</a> is, without a doubt, one of if not the greatest sports game ever made. That team at Midway is what in sporting terms we'd call a 'dynasty', in fact - because the only thing that can stand up to Blitz is NBA Jam - which was made by pretty much the same creative group.</p><p>The thing that makes Blitz stand-out special is its attitude towards American Football. It's the idea that it's a representation of the sport that is in the <em>spirit</em> of its traditions and laws, even while absolutely being about a million miles removed from the <em>letter</em> of the law.</p>
<p>Or to put it another way, it's like how you have a lot of racing games out there, but OutRun is a <em>driving</em> game, and that's different. IYKYK.</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

<figure>
 


</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Essentially, Blitz understands that it is a videogame - and so the rules of the game are tweaked or even tossed out entirely to give you something that represents the only most exciting plays of any given NFL season - over and over again, designed to sap quarters from your pocket. In arcades, landromats, bowling alleys and bars it did just that - but that beautiful arcade stickiness remained just as potent in home ports for consoles like the Dreamcast and N64.</p><p>It's a thrillingly addictive, wildly competitive, simply <em>wonderful</em> game. At the risk of sounding like an old man, it's the sort of sports game they just generally don't make any more; joyous in its silliness, steadfast in its refusal to waste even a second of a player's time.</p>
<p>This has also made a Blitz revival difficult. Some would tell you that the braying masses out there really want simulation titles like EA's Madden, and that's why those get made. True enough. A great deal of the barrier is the league itself, however.</p>

<p>What is acceptable within the sport proper has shifted massively. There's a meme about how if you watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ozCFxk1AHF8">the highlight reel</a> that used to open NFL games broadcast on CBS in the late seventies, <em>every play</em> highlighted would be a foul today. Some of them would even result in player suspensions! The league has tightened up the rules and rightly made the game a lot safer for those who put their bodies on the line every week - as it should. But rocked by scandals over harrowing injuries, concussions, and terrible repercussions into retirement, the NFL <em>really</em> doesn't want to talk about or acknowledge the old ways.</p><p>That extends to video games, even when the players are digital avatars with over-the-top superhero-like builds who spontaneously burst into flames when they're on a hot streak. The in-your-face hits and tackles of Blitz, designed to be eye-poppingly ‘big' on screen, are no longer acceptable. They look too much like the sort of banned moves that, in real life, might leave someone paralyzed. Blitz never cared; it's a video game. But after a deluge of proof that the sport left many players with irreversibly-changed lives, the NFL of 2026 cares.</p>
<p>When the classic Blitz games were reissued in a home arcade cabinet, the skittish NFL <a href="https://www.vg247.com/nfl-blitz-arcade1up-league">made the new publisher strip out certain content</a>, marking an otherwise pretty serviceable re-release of the original as inferior unless you hack it (I have one of these in my house, and reader, I hacked it). When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nfl-blitz-announced-for-psn-xbla">EA attempted a Blitz reboot</a> as a downloadable it had no teeth at all, and also just wasn't very good. The modern NFL, terrified of reputational damage, would never allow any modern release to be <em>exactly</em> as the originals were. That's something we have to accept.</p>
<p>So the late hits might not actually be possible in a modern licensed game. But, honestly, I think Blitz is about a lot more than that. It's totally possible to make a game that is a little more respectful about the bodies of the digital representations of the NFL's athletes while maintaining a snappy, arcade-like feel in-game.</p>



<p>The feeling this style of game design evokes is, for my money, truly unbeatable. There's an immediacy to the action, a breadth to the wild swings in momentum matches take, and just an overall vibe that is impeccable arcade perfection that's effortlessly compelling. It is totally possible that a game could get out of the humdrum of simulation, plus ultimate team and all that nonsense - and deliver something magical.</p><p>So, today, that's my Superbowl Sunday prayer. That and every year until we get a true successor. We've had a few near-misses of a sort, including the excellent 2D pixel-based titles <a href="https://www.vg247.com/retro-bowl-superbowl-sunday-american-football-switch">Retro Bowl</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1106340/Legend_Bowl/">Legend Bowl</a> - but those are closer to the NES era titles like the <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/tecmo-bowl-movie-tongal-football-video-game-1236650837/">soon-to-be a movie Tecmo Bowl</a> than Blitz. But y'know... there now at least appears to be a path to a Blitz descendant.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, it was announced that 2K Sports had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-to-make-nfl-games-for-the-first-time-since-nfl-2k5">reached a licensing agreement with the NFL</a> to make their own American Football game. 2K used to make a Madden rival, but <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-moment-madden-nfl-killed-nfl-2k-forever">backed out in the early 2000s</a>. But now, after decades, there should eventually be another big-name rival to Madden. 2K's deal secured them the teams, the stadiums, uniforms, players - everything needed to be authentic.</p>
<p>But here's the exciting rub: the 2020 deal stipulated that 2K's game has to be "non-simulation", per the terms of the deal - because EA's Madden series retains the exclusive rights to make simulation football titles. What's the most successful non-sim American Football game? Blitz, of course. Even with the excessive violence stripped out, it remains the template to follow. Approaching six years on from that announcement, I wait with bated breath - is it even still in production? And if it is, can 2K finally give us what I've been craving since 2001? I want that almost as much as I want my team to make the Superbowl next year. Almost.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>Perhaps you recently glanced at the internet and saw the fuss about Iron Lung. The indie horror movie <a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/box-office/markiplier-cries-iron-lung-indie-film-global-box-office-debut-1236649636/">got off to a rip-roaring start last week</a>, elbowing Melania aside to take the number two spot in the US box office charts, thwarted only by Send Help, the latest from horror movie king Sam Raimi. Iron Lung's success can almost certainly be attributed to its links with mega-popular YouTuber Mark Edward Fischbach - better known as Markiplier - for whom the project's clearly been a labour of love, given he not only self-funded it, but wrote it, directed it, and starred in it too. But whatever there is to be said about the movie (critical opinion is <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/iron_lung">mixed</a>), its headline-making turn has finally given me the nudge to check out the game it's based on, having languished on my Steam wishlist for so long. And, yup, it's a good 'un.</p>

<p>Iron Lung, if you're as late to the party as I am, is the work of developer David Szymanski, perhaps best known for the acclaimed retro horror shooter Dusk. But Szymanski's body of work also includes a load of grimy, experimental lo-fi micro-horrors - a category Iron Lung comfortably fits within. It's a cosmic scream of tale, set in a distant future where every habitable planet and star has vanished from existence in an event known as The Quiet Rapture. Those few humans left alive on artificial outposts in space face a desperate fight for survival as the universe's remaining natural resources continue to dwindle - and so begins an expedition to AT-5, a distant moon where an anomalous ocean of blood has been found.</p>
<p>Iron Lung is an unassuming thing. It's unashamedly retro, for starters, built from minimalist textures and PS1-era low-poly models. It features a single, squalid location, barely an arm-span wide; it lasts a brisk 45 minutes or so, and takes up a paltry 150mb of your hard drive. But don't let that fool you; this is the kind of thick, suffocating horror that starts badly and only gets worse from there. You - an unnamed convict who's signed up to this grim expedition in the hope of securing your freedom - begin your journey sealed into the titular Iron Lung; a dank, claustrophobic rust-bucket of a submarine, so unfit for purpose it's been welded shut in the less-than-reassuring hope it'll withstand the pressure of the blood ocean's ominous depths.</p>

<p>At first, as you make your slow descent, your progress is accompanied by the chatter of an unseen operator, but soon the words are lost in static as you reach your cruising depth and the fore-window is closed. And as the silence sets in, the already foreboding atmosphere only grows more discomforting. It doesn't help that your goal - and the means of achieving it - isn't immediately clear, but after poking around the submarine's squalid interior, and investigating the limited tools at your disposal, you'll start to make sense of things. To the front lies a control panel, used to move your sub back and forth, and to adjust its rotation. To the rear lies an enigmatic computer terminal, a blank screen, and a glowing camera button. Your task, you'll soon learn, is to navigate the winding trench beneath the blood ocean's surface and photograph points of interest marked on your map - being careful to avoid slamming your fragile vehicle into the treacherous rock walls, bringing your trip to a premature end.</p><p>There's an immediate problem though: your sub has no windows, no easy way to observe the world outside, and you've no navigation aids beyond a grubby paper map of the trench to refer to. That essentially means you're piloting the sub entirely blind - intuiting your progress and approximating your position, creating a mental spatial picture, by cross-referencing the barely legible grid markings on your map with those on your ship's display. You're not completely cut off from the world beyond, mind. At any time you can smack the sub's camera button to display an image of your immediate surroundings on the nearby screen - but these grungy, static-filled black and white stills are mere fragments of a vast, unknowable whole, and hint at a haunted world of darkness so oppressive it often feels better not to look at all.</p>



<p>And that's pretty much Iron Lung. You examine your map and plot a mental course from one location to the next. You hit a button to adjust your sub's angle, hit another to move forward or back (as much as the concept of movement means anything in a world you can't see), inching through the mere suggestion of surroundings until you're finally where you need to be. Then you do it again. And again. And again. It shouldn't work - it <em>should</em> feel repetitive to the point of tedium - but in Szymanski's skilled hands, a gloomy low-poly box and a couple of buttons become the instruments of remarkable anxiety and increasingly unbearable tension.</p><p>Much of that's down to its sound design, of course. Early on, the interior of your sub is defined by the quiet mechanical groan of ageing machinery and the drip, drip, drip of leaking water, while the ocean outside oozes and bubbles - white noise occasionally broken by the haunting howl of something, perhaps, like whalesong. And with the whir of every rotation, the hum of the engine in motion, the urgent screech of the radar's proximity sensors, I found myself steadily sinking deeper and deeper into Szymanski's nightmarish illusion, never once doubting the existence of the unseen world beyond. I could picture the abyss, the treacherous rock walls closing in as unfathomably vast spaces snapped tighter - all made vividly real through the interplay of a crudely drawn map, some stellar sound design, and my frantic imagination.</p>
<p>Szymanski builds the tension slowly, insidiously, establishing a rhythm and routine that demands concentration - a tunnel vision focus that, at precisely judged moments, is inevitably, harshly broken. To say much more would be to spoil the experience, of course, and this is a journey that feels worth taking. Part of me is curious to see how Szymanski's perfectly honed 45-minute slice of intensely claustrophobic horror - a masterclass in the power of suggestion - adapts to a baggier two-hour movie where the game's brilliant economy and unwavering focus will inevitably need to be broken. But while I doubt I'll be rushing out to see Iron Lung at the cinema, I'm at least grateful it got Szymanski's work back on my radar. Even if that radar, its incessant, angry beep, is almost certainly the sound of something unspeakably awful, drifting out there in the bloody depths of a forgotten moon.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/xcom-2-10th-anniversary</link>

            <p>There's this magical moment that all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xcom-2">XCOM 2</a> players experience. A member of your elite squad of sci-fi planetary defenders holds their machine gun right up at the face of some alien foe, probably a Muton, and somehow has only a 90 percent chance to hit it. Still, aim perfect, hands steady, they can't possibly miss, you think. Then they do, they always do. 100 percent guaranteed. F**k you, XCOM! I love you.</p>
<p>It's one small component of the wider rollercoaster that is XCOM 2, a brilliant turn-based tactics game from Firaxis released 10 years ago. How time flies, I guess. Looking back, while the game does have a solid narrative and top-to-bottom great design, it's those hair-pulling events that remain firmly in my mind. Proper XCOM moments that define a playthrough.</p>
<p>If you've not played it, the game champions a linear but meaningful approach to class-based tactical gameplay, allowing you to train your gaggle of end-of-world wastrels across distinct styles of combat. All useful, all strong in their own way. The Sharpshooter, your go-to sniper class, can also be flipped on its head as a pistol-wielding quickdraw fiend in close-quarters fights. You can slap on some custom colours and outfits too, making these units your own cast in a man-vs-alien thriller you control - sort of. It doesn't sound like much, but goddam do you get invested in your crew.</p>

<p>You spend dozens of hours with, let's say, Paul the Grenadier. He's leveled up to the max and packs the best weapons and equipment at your disposal, but more importantly he's from Sweden and has the beard to match. He's a character, not a faceless gun, and that's key. He's got one shot to take down a Sectoid currently mind-controlling one of your units, but he's <em>just</em> out of range to clip them with his grenade launcher. This, obviously, is your fault. You didn't position him right. But, sitting alone at your desk at 2am, it's another twist in Paul's own story arc. The time he let the team down… again. Well done Paul, good job mate.</p><p>I'm an especially big fan of XCOM 2's boss-style encounters, walking struggle factories that can mass produce frustrating moments you have to claw and chew your way out of. Following certain missions in the story, these daunting foes will just show up unexpectedly during regular missions, and they have a habit of doing so at the worst times possible. You'll be taking down some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-sector">Dark Sector</a> human goo dispensaries when, wham, big frost snake. You can take it down but, maybe someone gets hurt? Maybe someone dies? Maybe an ankle is sprained and your best sniper needs 25 days off while North Africa is on fire. This is XCOM at its best, and to me is what the series is all about. I don't believe someone who save-scums, who gets their star soldier caught out without cover or singed in a burning building and turns back the clock, is getting the rich sauce on offer here. Being forced to adapt to rough-and-tumble situations <em>is </em>XCOM 2.</p>
<p>To be frank, you don't even need a boss to make things exciting. There's nothing like having things in order just to see a Sectopod stroll in from the fog of war. Total nightmare, and another ordeal to overcome. You need a certain resource to unlock the next tier of weapon upgrade but, yikes, don't have enough. That's okay, there's this resource drop in Brazil you can spend 10 days grabbing, while the council of four-armed aliens discover bold new ways to turn children into Monster Energy: Lando Norris Zero Sugar. What these hurdles add is texture, something you can really grip onto day after day.</p>
<p>10 years later, is it still worth trying out XCOM 2? Absolutely, it may actually be the best time to do so. Not only due to sharp discounts on the game, which occur seemingly at all times, but because you've got 10-whole-years of community content. New Armours, new maps to fight over… <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3658527190">you can turn your brave soldiers of humanity into green and spiky cacti</a>. You can load on heaping portions of quality of life changes, courtesy of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620600092&amp;searchtext=">Stop Wasting My Time</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1126395106&amp;searchtext=">Evac All</a> mods. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3496713479&amp;searchtext=">There's even a romance mod</a>, allowing you to court your soldiers between missions. An HR nightmare to be sure, but as one of the most popular XCOM 2 mods of all time, clearly not a concern for most.</p>
<p>XCOM 2 is an all-timer, one that still has a home in my installed Steam library a decade later. If you're looking back for older classics, I can promise you'll hate it. You'll love it, too, of course, which is why it makes such lasting memories.</p>

            <p>For the past week, instead of actually relaxing in the evenings, I have been ascending the gnarled brute of a mountain in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cairn-is-a-welcome-reminder-of-the-power-of-the-pause">Cairn</a>. The onerous journey has left the toes of its alpinist star Aava bloodied; I've pushed the tendons of her rangy fingers to snapping point. With more frequency than I care to admit, I've caused this hell-bent climber to tumble down the same part of rock face over and over again, saved only by a piton. At other times, lacking such safety measures, she has bounced all the way down to Kami's base off jagged, life-ending shards of rock. I curse the game, mountain, and myself with each major and minor tumble, every lost metre and handful of minutes.</p>
<p>But after much suffering, I made it. All in, my ascent of Kami took some 11 hours. That's a little less than what it took me to reach the top of the misty mountain in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>. Despite their tonal differences (Cairn is solemnly earnest; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baby-steps-review">Baby Steps is gonzo absurd</a>), these games are cut from similar cloth. Both complicate locomotive mechanics (climbing and walking, respectively) that have been streamlined to a frictionless mush by triple-A blockbusters over the past 20 years. Both give you a straightforward goal that would make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> smile: see that mountain, climb it! Each of these games is, I think, a bold and brilliant addition to a cohort of titles we might collect under the "masocore" banner. But Cairn and Baby Steps go a little easier on the player than the likes of<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-meat-boy-review"> Super Meat Boy</a>. That's one of their quietly revelatory qualities: how they broaden video game difficulty.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a Cairn trailer to show it in motion.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgsQ-y2DL_g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>If you'll permit me a brief history of "masocore", the term was popularised in the late 2000s by game designer, academic, and writer Anna Anthropy who herself attributed the word to a SelectButton.com forum member. The descriptor grew in popularity throughout the 2010s, enjoying an early<a href="https://trends.google.com/explore?geo=Worldwide&amp;q=masocore&amp;date=all"> spike in use</a> around 2011, the year of - oh yes, that's right -<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tough-love-on-dark-souls-difficulty"> Dark Souls</a>. Masocore isn't quite a major part of player or critical parlance these days - though notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">Nioh 3, just released</a>, is one of a rare series to explicity describe itself as such - yet the ideas summoned by the TikTok-primed portmanteau (of "masochism" and "hardcore") have<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-video-game-difficulty-became-a-cultural-battleground"> defined</a> 15 years of video games. Ego-skewering difficulty is venerated; players need to cultivate saintly patience if they wish to see the sights these uniformly challenging games offer; naturally, one must "git gud."</p><p>But in Cairn and Baby Steps, you need not memorise the five attack patterns of a fiendish boss to move forwards; there are fewer demands that your thumb and fingers flutter dexterously across the controller or keyboard like a ballerina's feet across the theatre stage. Indeed, Cairn's control scheme is gloriously simple: the left analogue controls whatever limb the game deems suitable to move next; a single button locks that limb into place on the rock. The challenges these games offer - which are certainly not trivial - are thus approached in a more cerebral manner. You assess a stretch of turf or rock - its various, complicated gradients and changes in material composition (mud, rock, ice, etc) - and mentally plot the best route up to it.</p>



<p>What a thrill (and reprieve), it is to play genuinely difficult games where there are no arbitrary gates to progress. That's part of the elegance of Cairn and Baby Steps; you are locked into battle, though it is with terrafirma rather than a rogues' gallery of ultra-hard enemies. As such, the challenging encounters in these climbing games have a more naturalistic ebb and flow; if you struggle with one route, simply try another. These worlds are designed in such a way that if you fall - say, sliding down a 50-metre mud slide in Baby Steps - your character will land in a spot that causes you to see the terrain anew (and, likely, askew). Failure in combat-oriented games is not often accompanied with such literal, perspective-shifting revelations.</p><p>The vertiginous trials of Cairn - every fissure, crag, tor, escarpment, and ridge - have been meticulously designed and laid out by a talented team of level designers and artists. When I<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/19/cairn-mountaineering-summer-games-preview"> spoke</a> to creative director Emeric Thoa, he was evidently proud of that fact. "I know we are in the year 2024, and there are words such as 'procedural' and 'AI', but we are designing and making this mountain entirely by hand, placing every single rock, crack and handhold," he said. "It's really a lot of work - very repetitive - and I'm so grateful to our level design team."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / The Game Bakers</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Cairn was in development for six years. One imagines the production must have felt intensely durational for Thoa and his colleagues. There is perhaps also a mirroring in the game's making with that of its playing: Cairn only lasts 11 or so hours (particularly if you make a beeline for Kami's summit), yet the experience is one of arduous, incremental progress; you are locked into the single, monotonous task of ascending Kami for almost the entirety of this time, breaking only for cutscenes and when you cosy up in Aava's bivouac to make food and rest.</p>
<p>Cairn's embrace of slowness is at odds with the lightspeed rhythms of other video games, many movies, practically all of social media, and even much of offline life itself. Actually acclimating to Cairn's slowness is part of the challenge: it demands sustained concentration in an era when attention spans are<a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/attention-spans"> allegedly</a> diminishing. Certainly, its idiosyncratic approach to pacing makes any lost progress all the more frustrating because of the time needed to reclaim it. The focus Cairn and Baby Steps both require makes me think of "slow cinema" movies like Apichatpong Weerasethakul's meditative mystery<a href="https://youtu.be/PDU6B93ltds"> Memoria</a> and Ryusuke Hamaguchi's aching drama<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BPKPb_RTwI&amp;pp=ygUUZHJpdmUgbXkgY2FyIHRyYWlsZXI%3D"> Drive My Car</a>. Like those directors, who each deliver magical payoffs which only work because of their films' uncompromisingly unhurried tempos, the makers of Cairn and Baby Steps wield anticipation with similar skill. They make you put in the work, huffing and puffing up every vertical impediment, before delivering a full-body flood of emotion: pure, euphoric joy.</p>

<p>But hardship is the more common condition in these games, just as it is in Dark Souls, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, and even Death Stranding. Often, this suffering feels distinctly Catholic in nature. Nate walks because he feels shame for his whole miserable being. In<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review"> Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, Sam Porter Bridges walks the length and breadth of Australia, in part, as repentance for the responsibility he feels for the disappearance of his adopted daughter. The punishing difficulty of Pharloom in Silksong, whose currency is rosary beads, reflects an entire realm in penance.</p><p>If the motives behind these characters' masochism is often clear, that of players is naturally more subjective. Why submit yourself to frustration, anguish, and perhaps even pain (in your mind and thumbs, if not your whole body) of a task which you are doomed to repeat ad nauseam? Cairn refracts this question through Aava. But one of the game's smartest decisions is in refraining from showing her articulate exactly why she climbs so obsessively. In one tragic scene towards the game's end, we see her try and fail to explain this compulsion to her partner over a radio device. But she is unable to verbalise these feelings. Frustrated at her own lack of words, Aava instead unleashes a single, guttural "fuck."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The idea of obsession sits at the rugged core of Cairn. You puzzle over the supersized Kami as you might a Rubik's Cube, examining it from different angles and experimenting until a route finally clicks into place. But all you need do is carefully move the left analogue stick and press one button. Here, then, is a more streamlined game of obsession, a more minimalist take on masochism, yet one which goes big where it matters. Its generous design should mean more people enjoy the rarefied sights Kami offers, and the rarefied emotions it inspires, too.</p>

            <h2>7th February</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little about the games we've been playing. This week, Bertie discovers handheld gaming and gets all excited; Marie struggles to impress Mama; Kelsey experiences Nioh for the first time, and loves it; Will plays another mech game and also, somewhat predictably, loves it; and Victoria reveals a passion for skateboarding that I never knew she had. What have you been playing?</p>
<p>If you're looking for something else to read, or a reminder of what you once wrote, there's a whole <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/what-weve-been-playing">What We've Been Playing archive</a> to delve into.</p>
<h2>Hades 2, Switch 2</h2>

But last week, when I jetted off to Blizzard, which was exciting, I took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. <em>My</em> Switch 2, by the way - I didn't pinch it off someone. And it was a revelation! Who knew that you could burn so much time by playing games? Don't answer that.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> was my poison of choice, with a sprinkling of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/songs-of-conquest">Songs of Conquest</a>, which didn't work brilliantly on the small-screen though it's still a good game. Even Hades 2 felt a bit cramped after playing it on my TV for so long. But overall it was perfect for the occasion in hand.</p>
<p>There was a wonderful moment on the return flight when I was sitting next to a German <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>-streamer and they pulled out their Switch 2 to play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> (great choice). There we were, two Switch 2-ers, merrily tapping away. How plane journeys have changed.</p>

<p>My battle with Cooking Mama continues. I experienced a short-lived wave of confidence after my pizza got a perfect score, but it didn't take long for Mama to crush that, with flames in her eyes, over my poorly de-boned fish.</p><p>At this point I have no logical reason why I keep dragging myself back to that kitchen. I know the standards are higher than my stylus skills can keep up with. So I inexplicably chose to raise the stakes by cooking steak and paid the price; Mama demands perfection, not whatever it was I ended up serving. Every time I enter the kitchen I know her eyes are boring into my soul, waiting for me to make a mistake that she can 'fix'.</p>
<p>Why do I keep coming back for more? Is it the shiny gifts I open when I get enough stars? I don't think so. I think it's because I achieved perfection once and now I feel as though I can do it again...</p>

<p>I've never played a Nioh game before despite knowing the series was likely to be right up my alley, and covering Nioh 3 for guides has seen me finally give the series the time that it deserves.</p>
<p>And what a time it's been so far! You can read all about just how great the game is in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">Dom's review</a>, but let's just say that Nioh 3 is, without a doubt, home to some of the most satisfying and fruitful combat I've ever engaged with. I've been having a real blast, and I no doubt have another 20+ hours to go so that's my life for the foreseeable. Wahey!</p>

<p>Me, writing about playing a game where giant pilotable humanoid war machines fight each other again? How dare you. Anyway, Battletech is the turn-based strategy complement to the real-time, FPS-like MechWarrior games, and I thought it would be a perfect way to enjoy some mech-fighting action on a work trip this week.</p><p>Playing the stock 2018 game works surprisingly well on the Xbox Ally X Windows handheld that I took with me, thanks to Steam's library of community control schemes, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that even the heavy BattleTech Extended mod, which bundles together an incredible amount of extra content, runs okay. I think 40-60fps is more than playable territory for this sort of game, and some lengthy load times couldn't dampen my enthusiasm for guiding my fledgling mercenary company across deserted city streets or foggy mountaintops in search of sneaky enemy squads (which I'd then salvage to build my forces further).</p>
<p>Still, there's nothing <em>quite</em> like a mouse and keyboard, and I'm not ashamed to admit that one of the most exciting parts about being home - beyond the thrill of sleeping in my own bed - is being able to transfer my save games across to the big PC to play there. Sourdough's Irregulars will become the foremost mercenaries in the Inner Sphere!</p>

<p>Not many people know this - probably because I live in an area where we mostly have snow/ice/rain for a large chunk of the year, so I don't get out as often as I would like - but I really enjoy skateboarding. My board is called Aeryn Sun-set, after Aeryn Sun from Farscape (my board has a sunset scene on its deck).</p><p>Anyway, to cut to the chase, I haven't been able to get on my board all year, because of that aforementioned snow and rain. We had nearly 2ft of snow last month - it went over my boots! So, the other night when I was looking wistfully at the world outside, which seemed so close and yet so far, I decided to boot up Skate Story and have a meander around its demonic world.</p>
<p>I didn't play for long, maybe 40 minutes or so, but ah, the vibes of this game are <em>chef's kiss</em>. I love the music, I love the crystalised visuals, I love the wacky philosopher heads. I don't know if I'm totally sold on the overall mechanics - there was one time I was trying to perform a trick combo under a tightish time limit and accidentally quit the game due to my frantic button mashing - but damn, Skate Story nails the atmosphere. So for now, as I write watching more snow fall outside, this will be how I get my skateboarding fix until the sun decides to show its face again. Only - <em>checks calendar</em> - three more months to go!</p>

            <p>Nioh's weird multiplayer has always been one of the most unique quirks of the Soulslike-cum-masocore series. I'm not talking about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-co-op">the needlessly complicated suite of co-op options</a> that pals can use to run through the game together, I'm talking more about the asynchronous multiplayer that's woven into the DNA of the series itself. If you wander out into the 'open field' of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, for example, you will find red graves littered around the area. Each of these marks a place where a fellow player has died - and inspecting it will tell you the bloody fate they suffered.</p>
<p>Similarly to the Souls games, these markers are like phantom hands from waylaid travellers on the same path as you, reaching out across time and space to say 'watch out, friend, dangerous road ahead'. The difference in Nioh, thanks to the sadistic machinations over at Team Ninja, is that these hands aren't just designed to inform, but also <em>inflict. </em>Summoning a spirit (or a revenant, to give it its proper in-game name) from one of these 'bloody graves' lets you fight another human player, exactly as they were when they died.</p>
<p>Over my time in Nioh 3 (when I was playing pre-launch, with a more barren server), I came to form relationships with some of these doomed spectres: the same names would crop up again and again, and I'd soon learn that one person had trouble with the hulking oni tucked away behind walls, whilst another was often victim to high edges and watery precipices. It's a small thing, but it adds an element of player-directed storytelling to the game, a very human touch to the demon-filled wastelands that make up historical Japan.</p>

Early in the game, I earned three pieces of rare 'Crimson General' gear from a decent boss drop. In the next area, I sniffed out as many 'bloody graves' as I could, and managed to complete the full 'Pride of the Crimson Army' set - complete with high-powered odachi, my Samurai weapon of choice - that carried me through easily until the mid-game.</p><p>Later, fancying my luck at 'bloody grave' loot again, I topped up my collection of Ninja gear in the game's final area. Given that I ended up using the Ninja in 80 percent of my encounters (yes, really, I think its back attack damage scaling and utility when it comes to ki depletion is out of this world!), having a set as good as 'Devious Loyalty' and its Skill-based attack scaling for the final run of battles was a life-saver.</p>
<p>That Team Ninja gives you the option to tackle 'bloody graves' and their restless revenants instead of grinding against the same bosses or 'battle scrolls' (level select, in common parlance) has always been a fun quirk of the series. But thanks to the open-ended nature of Nioh 3, I found myself even more compelled to summon from 'bloody graves' whenever I could: some people might be outfitted with items more commonly dropped across the map, for instance, and you can easily put together high-powered sets from pilfered loot after just a few minutes of experimentation.</p>
<p>But the usefulness of Nioh's peculiar asynchronous multiplayer goes beyond build-crafting. If you deviate slightly off the beaten path (or engage in a little bit of back-tracking), you'll find a blue grave near most major bosses. This is known as a 'benevolent grave', and interacting with it will summon a friendly NPC to help you out until either its health runs out, or a generous timer ticks down. Now, engaging multiple enemies at once in Nioh is a death sentence, usually, so having some NPC fodder to attract enemy attention or help you thin out the herd can trivialise even some of the more demanding bosses (here's looking at you, Takeda Shingen).</p>

<p>Team Ninja has placed a decent number of its own revenants and benevolents around the game, but now <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3681010/charts/">over 70,000 people are playing Nioh 3 on Steam alone</a>, you're all going to get to experience the game at peak power: absolutely brimming with fool-hardy deaths, generous player-placed ghosts to help with touch mini-bosses or big bosses, and an absolute bonanza of character builds to help see you through the game's myriad historical eras.</p><p>Just be careful. I, so often, got cocky. I'd face down an unexpected ambush from a one-eyed oni, or an enki, or a horde of skeleton soldiers, and see a red grave. "Stomped to death by Gaki Chief", it'd say. "You fool, you idiot!" I'd cry to myself, and summon them, thinking to nick all this clown's items before riding off into the sunset, plunder in-hand. On more occasions than I'd care to count, I would over-exert myself against a well-levelled human foe, find myself exhausted, and summarily get cut down by a grapple move that would kill me in one blow. Oh, the humility. Fittingly for a game like Nioh, I would continue this spiral of death - assumedly - as someone would find my grave on the floor, and summon me hoping for my loot. I just hope my unsent, vengeful spirit had enough nous to execute that unsuspecting player, in turn.</p>
<p>You can complete Nioh 3, of course, without engaging with this mechanic at all. But it very much feels like its part of the game, a nice way to show you how failure is baked into the whole experience of Nioh: you die so that you may live again, you are cut down by more powerful samurai so that you may learn to deflect, to dodge, to overpower and overcome. Seeing failure naturalised so readily - and so prolifically - across the map emboldens you, encourages you. "I won't be just another red grave for my enemies to rob," you tell yourself, as you grit your teeth and go up against your rival brother for the fifteenth time that evening. "I will come out on top this time, I'll show them. I'll show them all."</p>
<p>And then one day, you do. And you lay a blue grave in front of the boss to tell those that come after that there is hope, after all. They've just got to trust in you.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note from the author</strong>: Please always summon the character 'Guilthound' if you see their benevolent grave. Thank you.</em></p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A Q&amp;A between shareholders and Nintendo's president Shuntaro Furukawa has been released alongside February's quarterly financial report, in which the topic of rising memory costs was discussed. While the price hikes haven't impacted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> yet, Furukawa states that might change if the trend continues into the next fiscal year.
</p>
<p>When asked if the rising price of memory has impacted the Switch 2's profitability, and whether this could lead to a price revision for the console, Furukawa responded with the following:</p>
<p>"We do not disclose details regarding individual components, but we can say that we are working to secure stable supplies of memory components by holding discussions from a long term perspective with our business partners. As a result, the recent rise in memory prices did not have a significant impact on hardware profitability in the third quarter. In addition, we do not expect any significant impact in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>"However, if this rise in component prices lasts longer than expected and runs through the next fiscal year and beyond, it may put pressure on profitability. If the situation deteriorates significantly, we will carefully assess market trends and respond. As for any future change in the price of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, no decision has been made at this time. Any decision to change the price will be determined comprehensively, taking into consideration not only profitability, but also other factors like the platform's installed base, sales trends, and the market environment."</p>

</figure>
<p>Furukawa was also asked if Nintendo will focus on expanding the install-base of the Switch 2 or the console's profitability in the future, given the context of these rising component prices. To this, he responded: "The current rise in memory prices is happening at a pace that exceeds our expectations. In general, the profitability of hardware tends to improve with economies of scale, and we want to continue to reduce costs as much as possible through mass production of Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. With regard to not selling hardware at a loss, what we are focusing on is profitability on a global basis.</p><p>"There are various external factors, such as fluctuations in exchange rates, but looking at the global picture, we have traditionally tried to avoid situations where individual units are sold at a loss as much as possible. It is difficult to predict the changes in the external environment that are currently taking place, but I think it is not an appropriate approach to be excessively influenced by short-term trends. The second and third years for Nintendo Switch 2 are very important, and if we can expand the hardware installed base, we can use that as a basis to greatly expand software sales. We will take this into account when making business decisions and flexibly consider various options."</p>
<p>One shareholder, noticing that inventory of the Switch 2 was higher than usual, asked whether this stocking up on the console was an intentional decision made with the rising cost of memory in-mind. This, it turns out, wasn't the case. Instead, the higher than usual inventory was to get ahead of potential supply issues leading into last year's holiday season.</p>
<p>"Our aim was to begin production as early as possible so that we could secure sufficient inventory at launch," states Furukawa. "Even after the release of Nintendo Switch 2, we worked to expand production capacity to establish a position where we can respond appropriately if demand during the holiday season exceeded projections. As a result of these initiatives, we hold a certain amount of components and products, and these are recorded as inventory. While we currently expect some sort of impact on profitability if the increase in memory prices continues over the long term, we do not anticipate constraints in our production plans due to insufficient supply in the next fiscal year and beyond."</p>
<p>These rising memory prices, caused by the ongoing production strain of AI datacenters and the wider generative AI boom, has resulted in widespread industry shifts as certain components skyrocket in demand.<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/nvidia-is-reportedly-looking-to-cut-gaming-gpu-production-by-up-to-40-percent-in-2026-due-to-vram-supply-issues-but-its-not-as-bad-news-as-you-might-think-not-yet-at-least/"> It was only earlier this year that reports indicated that Nvidia would cut gaming GPU production due to VRAM shortages</a>. Here's hoping things settle down before consoles - the Nintendo Switch 2 included - are seriously impacted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-7-reimagined-vs-original-remake<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>To remake anything beloved is to walk a tightrope. There is always a delicate balance to be struck between keeping what made the original great intact and delivering on the remake's promise to modernise, improve and strengthen. It's such a hard task that one can be forgiven for being reluctant to undertake it even once, but in the case of Dragon Quest 7 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> now faces down this conundrum a second time.  Are they gluttons for punishment?</p>

<p>Dragon Quest 7 was first released for PlayStation way back in the year 2000. The game became known as a solid cult classic, and in particular garnered praise for its unique structure, with the narrative taking place across a series of islands each with its own largely self-enclosed narrative. Instead of one huge over-arching story, DQ7 is essentially a series of lovely vignettes that eventually broadly tie together. This structure also helped to lend this game the other thing it became famous for: its size. It is absolutely enormous, a proper poster child for the Japanese RPG stuffed-to-bursting.</p>
<p>Fast forward thirteen years, and Square Enix had a second crack of the whip with a remake for the Nintendo 3DS. This version, the first to be officially released in Europe, made a number of changes to streamline the game to the point where Square Enix referred to it as an 'abridged' version of the original. Tack on another thirteen years and somebody at Square Enix had clearly concluded that the 3DS version wasn't abridged enough - as here we now are in 2026 with Dragon Quest 7: Reimagined.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, this is not an abridged version of that sprawling original. It is a reimagined version instead - reconsidered, with the cuts and design changes deeper and more wide-ranging than had been attempted on the 3DS. Remakes of games that are loved can be a scary business, but nobody could say here that Reimagined's developers have been timid: they have gone for it, and been unafraid to wield the axe. The result is the most welcoming version of DQ7 yet - though that in turn comes at a cost.</p><p>Reimagined does not hold back. Because of the siloed nature of its narrative, it is easy enough to drop entire islands or plot lines, for instance, without damaging the overarching story. This game does that. Other places have been pruned back so significantly they are tough to recognise. Dragon Quest 7 was a truly non-handholdy RPG, which led to scenarios where players could be confused about where to go or what to do next, especially after some time away from the game. Reimagined aggressively curtails this - objectives are now clearly marked at all times. Key item nearby? It'll be boldly highlighted on your map. Conversations between your allies often serve double duty as character building and ensuring you absolutely do not forget where to go next.</p>
<p>Battles are closer to the 3DS than the original, triggered by encountering visible enemies on the overworld rather than through pure random encounters. DQ7's turn-based combat is still classic fare for this series and totally satisfying, though it has been gently softened in myriad ways. Enemy weaknesses are instantly highlighted from the very moment you first meet them. It's much easier to heal fully and much harder for your party to wipe now - and even if that happens the punishment for doing so is breezy. The increased frequency of full, free heals at the Sacred Statues means Dragon Quest's familiar careful resource management is a lot less important.</p>

</figure>
<p>You can even cut down weaker enemies on the field, without entering combat at all, if you're powerful enough. If you know your way around a turn-based RPG, you will inherently know in your very soul how much time that will inevitably save. In the end, failure has been made almost impossible and busywork has been all but eliminated. You likely won't need to fret about the game's admittedly generous difficulty options, for the default is already easy enough.</p><p>All of this is of the like that it will certainly provoke a range of responses, especially given the reputation of the original as an unwieldy beast. Undeniably brilliant without debate is Reimagined's gorgeous new doll-like art style, though. For my money this is one of the most pleasing and lovely ways I've yet seen to bring sprite-based pixel art and the poppy colorful designs of Akira Toriyama into 3D.</p>
<p>These character models have a fascinating story, for Square Enix actually built scale dolls of each of Dragon Quest 7's characters and then scanned and captured them in order to understand things like materials, lighting conditions, and articulation. I think you can really tell - they're slightly uncanny, but they're also absolutely brilliant. They're expressive and detailed in all the right ways while retaining a playful vigor that is at the heart of Dragon Quest.</p>
<p>When you take it all in - the approachable art, the gameplay lubricated to the point where any attempt to grapple with its systems too thoroughly will have it slip through your fingers - one gets the sense that this is actually Square Enix taking what it knows is one of its most beloved entries in the Dragon Quest series with the hardcore and making a bold attempt to reorient that experience as the sort of game that could be somebody's very first Dragon Quest. It makes for a curious comparison and companion piece to the recent remakes of the first three titles in the series. Those are more faithful to the originals. This is something else.</p>



<p>That something isn't bad, either. In fact, I think it's rather good. But it is a different kind of good to the original versions of Dragon Quest 7. What was once a game filled with friction, difficulty, challenge, scale - yes, arguably too much scale - has now sanded down every rough edge in sight. It is the Japanese RPG equivalent of when you buy those rubber things to pad the edges of your coffee table so your toddler doesn't fall over and take their eye out.</p><p>I'm sort of alright with that. The brisk and cheerful journey that has been presented here does play to DQ7's strengths, allowing even the most casual and vaguely curious player to meander from one island to the next experiencing the various storylines and vignettes on offer. With how deep these cuts and changes go there was a danger of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, as the saying goes, but I do think that fate has been largely avoided. There's some regrettable cuts, yes. More experienced fans like myself may very well bemoan the handholding or the lack of difficulty - but I also expect this game isn't really made for me. I had the constitution, after all, to get through the previous two versions even when they were at their most sluggish and grindy.</p>
<p>In short, this is a fascinating new way to experience a classic, and while plainly not as definingly brilliant as the original, it is certainly a more approachable and modern way to understand why it was so. I just wish, as with some of the Final Fantasy titles, this version existed alongside a reliable way to play one of the other versions on existing systems. Both side-by-side, with players offered a choice between the two, would be perfect. But this reimagining on its own isn't bad, either.</p>

            <p>One of the greatest things on earth is when you're talking to someone you sort of know and they quietly switch from talking about human friends or family members to talking about their cats. It's great because there's often no meaningful alteration in tone to tell you something has changed. Cats are frequently introduced into conversation the same way a person might start talking about an intermittently beloved uncle who's just out of prison. Cats are often delightful reprobates and oddballs. They're needlessly, inventively cruel, or inhumanly calm and forbearing, or they're ostentatiously silly. One will sit on the landing and swipe at everyone. Another will hide under a bath mat, certain that they have attained complete invisibility. They are known by their names but also by their behaviours.</p>

<p>The cats in Mewgenics are known by their behaviours.</p>
<p>Mewgenics - strange harmony here: Francis Galton, cousin of Darwin and originator of the racist pseudoscience of eugenics, also published a paper called Three Generations of Lunatic Cats - is all about cats and what they get up to. An easy way in might be to see it as a kind of XCOM for cats. You gather a gang of four cats and then take them out on a violent adventure, moving through different cat-adjacent spaces - caves, sewers - and engaging in turn-based battles with the various creeping horrors you find there.</p>
<p>In battles, the cats rove about a grid and use a variety of attacks or passive abilities to defeat everyone they're up against before moving on. Each adventure is a kind of roguelite run, so alongside battles and bosses you'll encounter little vignettes that could turn out to be good or bad - eat the mystery meat? - or treasure chests, or branching paths that allow you to take a different route depending on how good you're feeling about your chances.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a Mewgenics trailer to show it in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH9xJU44Ffg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>So why is it called Mewgenics and not, say, XCOM: Enemy's Gone and Dumped on the Carpet? This is because after a run, you retire your cats and they go and live in a house together. Well, sometimes they do. Because where XCOM had a bit of base-building, Mewgenics has a whole machine that runs on cats. Strays come by and can be dropped into the house to then take out on new adventures. Retired cats can mate and create kittens that can grow up and - you're with me - be taken out on new adventures with the former strays. Fine.</p><p>But then it gets weird. Because around your house is a whole town of people who will give you things <em>in return for cats</em>. This upgrade system is decidedly non-fun, and all the more brilliantly squeamish for it. Someone in town wants retired cats in return for adding a new room to your house. Someone wants kittens to teach you about cat ancestry. Someone wants dead cats. Of course they do. The machine that runs on cats chugs along and you exchange your cats judiciously to expand your house, to get a bigger stash, to learn more about the world of Mewgenics and cat breeding all that jazz.</p>



<p>Oh yes, cat breeding. I'm still early on in this dazzlingly rich and complex game but I'm already understanding that success in the long term revolves around breeding cats and making sure you like the outcomes. Cats have traits and abilities that are useful in battle, but because you can only take a cat out for one roguelite run before it's retired, you need to be careful about then breeding your retired cats to keep the traits and abilities you like in play. The right environment helps: certain rooms boost your chances of interesting mutations or of healing damage or of passing on better abilities. Further on in the breeding distance - this is a thing? - lies new class abilities, which opens the door to multiclassing. Hold me.</p><p>This is important, I can tell even now, because the turn-based stuff really isn't screwing around. XCOM may be the closest touchstone but it isn't a perfect match. Rather than Firaxis' ingenious and much copied two-actions-per-turn design, Mewgenics opens things out a bit. You can move and you can attack each turn, but each cat also has a pool of mana that allows them to use various powers and abilities that they have been bequeathed, either by the random number game of birth genetics, or clever breeding, or the collar they're given that denotes their class - healer, archer etc. etc. - or by levelling up and unlocking stuff on their run.</p>
<p>There are dozens and dozens of these abilities and they're frequently brilliant. At the simple end you have something like a straightforward melee attack or a fur-ball ranged move, say, but very quickly you get interesting variants. One cat might have an attack that can also heal friendly units. Another might have a move that puts them in a certain position behind enemies: crucial for a game in which attacking from a certain angle gives you better results. Another might send a fly zipping across the screen or perform a dash attack. My favourite so far is a move that punches an enemy INTO SPACE for the rest of the turn before they land and do massive damage. (To themselves, happily.)</p>



<p>Add on passives and you get really game-changing builds. On one run, for example, I was completely pummeled by an enemy that lobbed mines around the screen, mines that would slowly tick down and then explode inflicting harsh pain along rows and columns. Next time around I was dreading this guy, but I found out two of my cats on this run had passives that meant they did automatic spit attacks whenever anything moved within range, and so all this guy's mines were automatically rendered useless. This is just one example. The passives in this game kind of rule.</p><p>Then there are things like the vermin and goop-heavy enemies - often disgusting, but always creatively designed and game-altering - and the environments you move through. Some will be littered with chunks of masonry you can use as cover. Others will have grass or patches of broken glass that alter your movement options. A lot of the attacks you're given are elemental, so electrical attacks to an enemy standing in a pool of water will radiate outwards. Then you hit the sewer levels where pools of water shift around, moving units with them. Fire attacks are great until all that grass gamely catches light.</p>



<p>Onwards the game unspools with new ideas, but the reason it remains rich rather than bewildering is that the ideas all make sense. You innately know what thorns are going to do to a unit. You know that taking your cat wearing paper armour into a lake is not going to be good for the paper armour. (Oh yes, there's a rich item game in play, too. The things you can deck these cats out with.)</p>

<p>Mewgenics is the work of Edmund McMillen, as well as Tyler Glaiel, and there's a lot of McMillen's previous work in particular at play here. Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> are a fascinating and distinctive blend of grot and high-powered thought, so it's not rare to fight a bunch of feces monsters in the sewers in Mewgenics and then be frozen in place for a few seconds by the brilliant wording of a tooltip. The art is thick felt pen lines on the greys and blacks of wet newsprint. It's instantly obvious who made this stuff.</p>

</figure>
<p>If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in. New classes, new abilities, new items, new environments, new ramifications to the cat breeding - not a sentence I type every day - make it clear even to a dimwit like me that twelve hours from now this is going to be a very different game to the one I think I'm playing at the moment. It's cats, then, and they're definitely all lunatics. But expect far more than three generations of them this time out.</p>

            <p>
Bandai Namco has pledged a range of fixes for its Soulslike sequel Code Vein 2, including frame rate and performance improvements, following "feedback".
</p>
<p>
Code Vein 2 launched for PlayStation 5, Xbox series X/S, and PC late last month, sending players on a post-apocalyptic adventure through time in a bid to thwart an impending disaster. Its reception was mixed, but one consistent criticism focused its wonky performance.

<p>
And now Bandai Namco has acknowledged these complaints in a message <a href="https://x.com/CodeVeinGame/status/2019724775665340440">on social media</a>, saying the Code Vein 2 team is "committed to improving the game for a better experience" and will be making a number of "major adjustments" in response to player feedback.
</p><p>
Top of the list is stability, with Bandai Namco promising improved frame rates during combat (with boss battles said to be a priority), a reduction in stuttering and lag during field exploration, and more general adjustments to reduce temporary frame rate drops during play. It's also looking to improve frame rates when using "Prioritise Action" mode on consoles.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, players can expect a range of "action balance" adjustments intended to, among other things, enhance the responsiveness of Evasion and Guarding, and to improve "game feel" relating to controls and feedback for certain player attacks. That's alongside changes to enemy behaviour, plus broader adjustments and bug fixes. Oh, and customisation fans are getting bangs as a new 'front hair' accessory too.
</p>
<p>
There's no news on when these updates will arrive, but Bandai Namco says it plans to release them over the course of "multiple patches".
</p>
<p>
For what it's worth, as a series newcomer and Soulslike fan, I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-wasnt-expecting-much-from-code-vein-2-but-its-a-very-pleasant-surprise">quite enjoyed my time with Code Vein 2</a> when I took it for a whirl last month, even if that erratic performance wasn't exactly easy on the eyes.

            <p>Sophie Turner has started filming for Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider adaptation, and we now have our first look at her Lara Croft making her way through a soggy woodland.</p>
<p>The brief footage, which you can see below, shows Turner's Lara with holsters-a-plenty, because yes, those are her dual pistols you can see strapped to her thighs. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turner's hair has been styled in a long braid for the scene, which according to the YouTube description accompanying this footage, was shot in Surrey (that explains the weather).</p>

<p>Additional set photos show Turner doing her own stunts, and parachuting in to the scene (via <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html">Daily Mail</a>).</p>
<p>You can see some images of this below.</p>

<p>We've recently had a flurry of cast announcements for Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>. Along with Turner's Lara Croft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs has been cast as Lara's Uncle Atlas</a>, while Martin Bobb-Semple will play Zip, Bill Paterson will play Winston and Celia Imrie will play Francine (that is to say, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, who is "focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne").</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a>, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner.</p>
<p>"It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Waller-Bridge has said of Tomb Raider</a>. "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is. Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p>

            <p>The Highguard team has released another patch for its live-service hero shooter.</p>
<p>This update includes a new Warden, known as Ekon. Ekon is described as a "legendary Wildwalker" who is able to shapeshift into a direwolf. This means he doesn't need a mount, as he is the mount.</p>
<p>"When his mentor, and closest thing to family, goes missing in the lost land of Highguard, there is no monster or Warden this great predator will allow to stand in his way," developer Wildlight teases.</p>

<p>As well as this new Warden, the update - which welcomes in Highguard episode two - also adds a new map known as Skydrift which, as the name suggests, takes place above the clouds. From a quick glance at the artwork for this map (see further below), I get flashbacks to the sky islands in Legend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but with more structures dotted about.</p>
<p>Other quality of life improvements include the likes of being able to leave the party by clicking on party member's social card, Dead players no longer show up on the minimap and more.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>PC game-download store GOG has come under scrutiny for using generative-AI in marketing artwork, then for seeming to sit on the fence in an answer about whether it will keep using the tech in the future.</p>
<p>The piece of artwork was a banner advertising a 2026 sale, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/post69?cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj">which a GOG forum user, presumed to be a GOG artist, spoke out about</a> and confirmed was created with AI. This caused a stink and so gen-AI use was one of the topics GOG was immediately questioned about during <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qu09vg/ask_the_gog_team_and_micha%C5%82_kici%C5%84ski_anything/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">an Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Managing director Maciej Gołębiewski - when asked about the negative reaction and whether GOG would move away from gen-AI use in the future - replied: "We're not planning on making absolute statements in either direction. AI tools are one of many technologies we test and try out, and in some contexts it genuinely helps us push the company (and the mission) forward.</p>
<p>"What we will change, though, is how and where those tools are used; we understand that using new technology doesn't mean skipping human judgment." His answer did nothing to cool or calm the crowd.</p>

<p>I followed this response up with GOG and Gołębiewski this morning but was told GOG wouldn't elaborate on what had been said. However, I did speak to Gołębiewski at length in January, in an interview about GOG's private acquisition, and gen-AI was one of the topics we broached.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use"</em></blockquote>
<p>Gołębiewski told me at the time: "We are not using it [gen-AI] as of right now, but we've seen instances where communities have used the AI or neural network to analyse all of the code that is available for a game - all of the repositories or the documentation that's available for a game - with an aim of making it run better or maybe making it run on a different operating system or different hardware. AI is pretty good at absorbing the context and then guessing some action points based on that context.</p>
<p>"We haven't done this in this form," he added, "but I'm sure that at some point the application of AI - not necessarily generative AI in terms of artworks or code or whatever - will be found for how this can be used to advance game preservation. Every technology at some point finds its way to be put to good use. It's just the road to that is usually windy, shaky, however you might call it. So we haven't yet, but I'm not saying we won't do it in the future. If this can be used to advance our mission, then we will do it."</p>

<p>GOG's founding mission - and continuing mission - is restoring and preserving classic games, whether they be old classics or more modern classics, and ensuring they can be played in their best form into the future without being locked behind DRM. This often requires a lot of work on GOG's end, hence the attraction of AI in helping alleviate some of that.</p><p>But GOG is a store that also sells newer games, both indie and bigger games, and that prides itself on a selective approach, and on being close to its audience and receptive to them. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-says-selling-horses-when-steam-wouldnt-was-matter-of-freedom">GOG earned plenty of respect by stocking provocative indie horror game Horses</a> last year, when other stores, like Epic and Steam, wouldn't. "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on the right values," Maciej Gołębiewski said to me about making that decision. It's a statement that seems to grate against what it's saying now about gen-AI.</p>
<p>GOG recently became a private company after having spent its entire existence as part of CD Projekt - the house of The Witcher games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. And one of the positive potential ramifications of this is not being burdened by that huge game-making business, and therefore being more agile and able to take risks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">new owner Michał Kiciński explained to me recently</a>. I wonder if this moment will be a telling one in the company's new era.</p>

            <p>The Exit 8 is one of the many video game series currently getting a film or TV adaptation, and ahead of its international cinematic debut in April, the team has released a new trailer for the subway-bound horror flick.</p>
<p>If it wasn't already on your radar, The Exit 8 became quite a cult hit on its initial release back in 2023. It's a walking simulator inspired by Japanese underground passageways, and while I admit that doesn't sound great at first, here's the thing: you are trapped in this seemingly endless passageway, and have to pay careful attention to your surroundings in order to find your way out. And, things get weird.</p>

<p>This is the exact premise Exit 8's film adaptation will also lean on. "A man trapped in an endless sterile subway passageway sets out to find Exit 8. The rules of his quest are simple: do not overlook anything out of the ordinary. If you discover an anomaly, turn back immediately. If you don't, carry on. Then leave from Exit 8. But even a single oversight will send him back to the beginning. Will he ever reach his goal and escape this infinite corridor?" reads the film's official blurb.</p>
<p>We had a little look at what this film would be like last year, but now we have a new extended trailer, showing just how claustrophobic and nightmarish this looping plight will be for the poor chap - played by singer and actor Kazunari Ninomiya - who is doomed to wander the subway alone (well, kind of alone, if you catch my drift...).</p>
<p>You can check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>Exit 8 (the film) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cult-japanese-horror-game-the-exit-8-gets-first-film-trailer">debuted in Japan last year</a>, but is now reaching audiences further afield with its 10th April release date.</p>
<p>Genki Kawamura directed the adaptation, following his work as producer on anime film Suzume, directing and writing the 2022 film Hyakka, and even producing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-pokemon-and-ed-sheeran-collaboration-is-coming-out-next-week">Ed Sheeran's Pokémon music video for Celestial</a>.</p>

            <p>MachineGames' most recent release may be the brilliant Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but the studio is of course also known for its Wolfenstein games. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-doesnt-sound-like-weve-heard-the-last-from-machinegames-wolfenstein-series">following an earlier hint that the studio wasn't finished with its nazi-busting series</a>, we now have more concrete word on the fate of MachineGames' Wolfenstein trilogy.</p>

<p>This word comes from studio director Jerk Gustafsson, who was chatting with Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry</a> about MachineGames' 15 year legacy. During this conversation, Gustafsson admitted that because of the time it takes to make a video game in this day and age, he may only have a few more projects left in him before the end of his career.</p>
<p>"There's so many things that I would like to do, but I'm also getting a bit older, so I don't have that many games left in me," he said. "It takes a long time to make a game now, and let's say that we release one every four years, then maybe two more, maybe three if I'm lucky."</p>
<p>So, could one of these hypothetical projects be Wolfenstein 3? While Gustafsson was careful with his answer, he did say this:</p>
<p>"Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein. We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say."</p>

<p>As for the more immediate future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">MachineGames is set to release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2 later this year</a>. Like I have said, this game is brilliant, and I loved being able to whip crack my way across the globe with Indy.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv">Wolfenstein TV series in the works</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Bethesda's Todd Howard is staying tight-lipped on how things are progressing</a>.</p>

            <p>A new report has claimed that Gears of War E-Day is eyeing a release window in the second half of 2026, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> tentatively targeting a launch some time this Summer.</p>
<p>This report, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad">written by The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, claims that Microsoft wants both Gears of War E-Day and Fable to dodge the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, with Tom Warren writing: "I understand Microsoft has a good idea of when both should launch, but it's also keen to avoid being too close to Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19th date."</p>
<p>The report also touches on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> Remake, which The Verge reports is in "active development". The article also states that Bethesda wants the game to reach a similar bar of quality as the Oblivion Remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-in-the-shadow-of-skyrims-mountains-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-still-matters">which was well-received in part due to its faithfulness and level of polish</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, The Verge reports that Double Fine's The Kiln is aiming for an April release, and new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> content is due for a reveal soon. All of this comes with a caveat, with Warren sensibly writing: "Don't be surprised if any of these game dates slip or change -- such is the reality of video game development."</p><p>If these release windows are accurate, which they may very well be (The Verge has a solid track record with this stuff), then Microsoft certainly has a packed 2026. Fable, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">which we already know is due to launch some time this Autumn</a>, recently got a dedicated showcase in an Xbox Developer Direct. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, set in Japan and landing on the 19th May.</p>
<p>If these dates and release windows are accurate, what do you reckon of Xbox line-up this year? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <p>
Craig Mazin, showrunner on HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-wins-series-another-emmy">award-winning The Last of Us adaptation</a>, has confirmed he's giving <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> the TV treatment next, with the new show set to continue the story of the acclaimed fantasy RPG - although developer Larian seemingly won't be directly involved.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/baldurs-gate-hbo-craig-mazin-1236654094/">Variety</a>, HBO is developing the Baldur's Gate 3 TV adaptation, hot of the success of its live-action The Last of Us series, with Mazin serving as both as showrunner and executive producer on the new project.
</p>
<p>
In a statement accompanying the news, Mazin claimed he'd put "nearly 1000 hours" into the video game version of Baldur's Gate 3. "It is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created," he said. "I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can't wait to help bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can."
</p>
<p>
Francesca Orsi, HBO's executive vice president and head of drama, added that Mazin's "deep and long-standing passion for the source material paired with his remarkable talent for building immersive worlds filled with rich, compelling characters promises groundbreaking results."

After news of the adaptation broken, The Games Awards' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2019563522339082576?s=20">took to social media</a>, claiming Larian had told him directly the studio - which officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">wrapped up work</a> on Baldur's Gate 3 last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">moving away from D&amp;D</a> - has "no involvement in the series." Larian boss Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061?s=20">later confirmed</a> no Larian writers were consulting on the adaptation 'to his knowledge', but did note Mazin had reached out "to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope."
</p><p>
"We worked incredibly hard on making Baldur's Gate 3 worthy of its legacy," Vincke wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143?s=20">separate social media post</a>. "Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they'll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion."
</p>
<p>
"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventure," he continued. "There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts."
</p>
<p>
Larian director of publishing Michael Douse also <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680?s=20">shared his feelings</a> on the news, writing, "I've spent the last eight to 10 years of my life with the writers and creators of Baldur's Gate 3 and they're the most incredible storytellers and creators in the space. Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved and the characters are represented at the same level as the game.
</p>
<p>
"Our stories are built by fierce comeraderie and resolve," Douse added. "I have watched them write and write and write and through respect for audience and material come up with some of the finest shit I have ever played. I hope TV allows for the same thoroughness."
</p><p>
There's no word on when HBO might be looking to bring its Baldur's Gate 3 adaptation to air, but Mazin will be tied up with his The Last of Us show for a little while longer at least. While Mazin had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">previously confirmed a four-season plan</a> for his post-apocalyptic series, insisting there was "no way" its story could be wrapped up sooner, HBO boss Casey Bloys <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">recently indicated season three will be its last</a>. "It certainly seems that way," he told Deadline, "but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners."

            <p>Guerrilla and PlayStation have lifted the lid on Horizon Hunters Gathering, a new co-op game set for PC and PS5.</p>
<p>Introducing the studio's next game, Guerrilla lead Jan-Bart van Beek said while the team will still keep making single player games ("they are a huge part of who we are as a studio," van Beek said), it was time to try something new. And this is where Horizon Hunters Gathering comes in.</p>

<p>Horizon Hunters Gathering is described as a tactical co-op action game, which allows up to three players to join up as "heroic Hunters" to protect the world. But, not just any world, though. This one - as you would expect from the Horizon series - is "under threat from deadly machines".</p>
<p>Guerilla stated in a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/">PlayStation blog post</a> that the upcoming game will include combat that is "tactical, reactive and deeply skill-based" (which, to be honest, means I probably won't be very good at it, as I am more of a 'spray and pray' kinda gal). All of this will take place in replayable hunts, the developer explained, before going into more detail about two game modes.</p><p>The first of these is Machine Incursion, which is "a high-intensity mission where waves of machines pour out from underground gateways, led by a formidable boss". Then there is Cauldron Descent, which is a "longer, multi-stage trial in which ever-changing rooms push Hunters to their limits, from brutal machine encounters to hidden doors that promise power and reward for teams prepared to open them".</p>

</figure>
<p>Before setting out on these hunts, players will be able to choose from a roster of hunters with varying skills, motivations and "personal struggles". This is all part of the new stories Guerrilla wants to tell within its Horizon world.</p>
<p>"The game has a narrative campaign which will introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats, but we're keeping it under wraps for now," the developer teased. "What we can say is that Hunters Gathering is fully canon and its story doesn't stop at launch!"</p><p>If this sounds like your thing, Guerrill has announced a first, small-scale closed playtest for the end of the month; <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/?hr=true&amp;betaId=DEA61B71-0498-4EEB-9EAF-53C71761F968">you can sign up via the PlayStation Beta Program and mark your interest in any future Horizon Hunters Gathering playtest on PC or PS5</a>.</p>
<p>"This is both an exciting and daunting step for us," Horizon Hunters Gathering game director Arjan Bak said. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-horizon-series-was-always-thought-about-as-a-multiplayer-game-says-studio-head-following-mmo-announcement">Multiplayer games have always been part of our studio’s DNA</a>, and it's where I began my own career. Bringing a co-op hunting experience into the Horizon universe is something we’ve envisioned for a long time, and we’re approaching it with care, ambition, and passion.</p>
<p>"On behalf of everyone at Guerrilla, thank you to our Horizon fans and creators who support and believe in us. And welcome to all new Hunters excited to join us on this adventure. Horizon Hunters Gathering is about taking on challenges together – and we’re just getting started."</p>

<p>In addition to Horizon Hunters Gathering, there is also a Horizon MMO from NCSoft on the cards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Horizon Steel Frontiers, as it is known, is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system" on the game's eventual release.</p>

            <p>Right, any game that looks like you let the artisans from Studio Ghibli or Cowboy Bebop makers Sunrise make a Daft Punk video is immediately going to pique my curiosity. Layer on some puzzle-heavy, playful-looking co-op gameplay, and you've got my attention. Tell me I can play it with my partner, across two Switches, for the entry price of just the one game, and I'm sold. Day one with bells on.</p>
<p>I was already interested in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/orbitals">Orbitals</a> after its impressive showing at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards</a> back in December 2025. There, we get the meat of the game: it's from Kepler Interactive and Japanese indie dev Shapefarm, it's an intergalactic puzzle adventure game, and it is coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> sometime in 2026 (as of today, we know it's 'summer').</p>
<p>You play as Maki and Omura, a pair of friends that are trying to save their space station home from cosmic storms that have decimated their habitat once before. You can each use tools to affect the environment and solve puzzles, and in a pretty cool gimmick, it seems that individual players using tools alongside their co-op partner will be able to create new and unexpected effects.</p>
<p>The gameplay and art style are enough of a selling point, to be honest (it looks like something between Astro Boy and Evangelion, somehow) but then you add in the work from Studio Massket - an animation studio that's worked on bits of Edgerunners, One Piece, and more - you've got a recipe for something really special. Studio Massket has done all the anime cutscenes that serve as connective tissue for the game, rounding out the world and giving it this very analogue, very lived-in feel that so much 80s and 90s anime had (here's looking at you again, Cowboy Bebop).</p>

<p>So, the game itself looks great. Just take a look at the trailer if you need more convincing: it seems to be shooting for the same space Josef Fares and Hazelight have been playing around in over the past few generations: one where games are built explicitly "from the ground up"for co-op, telling stories that only work when multiple people are playing them together, bridging mental gaps to help players solve puzzles as one.</p><p>Fares and his team have already proved that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-players-on-switch-2-can-invite-original-switch-owners-to-join-the-fun">the 'Friend's Pass' mechanic</a> is integral to the success of this co-op new-wave. "I felt that if you are playing together on a couch, you shouldn’t pay extra if you're playing online with someone," <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would?utm_source=post-email-title">he told The Games Business earlier this year</a>. "That didn't make sense. So, we came up with the Friends Pass, and that in itself became good for business. It started from a creative decision and then became a business thing."</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction sold 2m copies in one week</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">broke three Guinness World Records within days of its launch</a>.  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> has sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marital-platformer-it-takes-two-sales-pass-20m">way over 20m copies</a>, at this point. Trusting people to play games like this with a friend (and knowing there's enough appeal for that to work) rather than forcing them to buy two copies if they want to play on two machines? It's a refreshing bit of consumer-friendly decision-making, in an industry that is otherwise feeling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">increasingly hostile</a> to the average player.</p>
<p>So, back to Orbitals. I plan to play this game with one of my partners, wedged together on the sofa, me on my Switch 2 and them on their Switch Lite. Knowing that I can simply buy the game and invite them to play with me from a few meters away endears me to this game <em>so much</em>, and it's not even out yet. Better yet, I travel with work a fair amount, and so knowing we can pick up where we left off with online play and <em>still </em>without having to shell out for a second copy is another big tick (as is the ability to just play it together on the big screen in a pinch).</p>
<p>I know GameShare is not a new feature - on the Switch 2 alone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, 51 Worldwide Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> and more make use of the gimmick - but it's a good one. One that should be shouted about more, and one that feels like it exists at the core of Nintendo's 'family friendly' focus. And good on Orbitals, for being a beacon of this sort of consumer-forward, co-op-first way of thinking - at least from how it looks here in theory. I can't wait to see how it all works in practice.</p>

            <p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase in February 2026 may not have brought insight into what first party games are arriving on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but it did give us a great look at what third party games are coming to the console in 2026. (Hopefully we'll get a look at the upcoming Nintendo titles for this year soon. The end of the tax year is approaching…)</p>
<p>Whether you missed the Nintendo Direct or simply want to revisit the announcements, you'll find all of the showcased games down below.</p>
<h3>Orbitals</h3>
<p>We started off this Nintendo Direct with... an anime? Well it's actually Orbitals - a co-op sci-fi adventure where you'll work with a friend using various tools, like the Liquid Launcher, to explore different areas. There's even cute little pets you can cuddle with during your adventures!</p>
<p>Orbitals will be released on Nintendo Switch 2 in Summer 2026.</p>

<p><strong>Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse</strong></p>
<p>Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse is the sequel to 2023's Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo. If you're a horror fan and enjoy visual novels, then I highly recommend giving the original game a try. The ability to switch between the different storylines and character perspectives gives the game a unique feel, while some of the horror scenes can hit quite hard especially when you're unprepared for them.</p><p>In this sequel, you'll be venturing to a mysterious island to investigate the mermaid's curse and strange doublegangers. It really was meant to be an normal day pearl diving... As before there's a range of characters you can play as!</p>
<p>Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse will be released on Nintendo Switch on 19th February.</p>

<h3>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h3>
<p>Indy can defeat everything but video game leaks apparently as his arrival onto the Switch 2 was leaked before the Direct started. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (I'll stand by that being a silly name for a game) was Eurogamer's Game of The Year in 2024, whipping the title away from other games despite its December release.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be released on 12th May for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>
We already knew - or at least strongly suspected, thanks to a couple of leaks - Bethesda would have a big presence during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-partner-direct-february-2026-live-report">Nintendo's latest Partner Direct showcase</a>, but it turns out the studio had a little more up its sleeve than just Fallout and Indiana Jones. It's now confirmed that last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is, of course, a spruced-up version of Bethesda's well-regarded 2006 open-world fantasy RPG - setting players loose in a much-beautified version of Cyrodiil, courtesy of Unreal Engine 5. Alongside an obvious visual upgrade - including new character models - it also features improved combat, a new levelling system, an updated UI, and more. Not that you'll likely notice any of this stuff if it's your first time with Oblivion.

<p>
"What a treat to go back to this one again," Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wrote of Oblivion Remastered when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">named it one of our top 50 game of 2025</a>. "Oblivion may have shed some of the complexity and outlandishness of Morrowind, but in doing so it also shed the intimidation factor. This is really the genesis of all modern - especially western - open world RPGs today, and frankly it's still a lesson in how that structure should be done."
</p><p>
As for the newly announced Switch 2 version, there's not a whole lot of specific information to report just yet, with Bethesda mostly whizzing through the basics during Oblivion Remastered's Nintendo Partner Direct debut. What we do know, though, is that it's heading to the platform sometime in "2026", joining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> and Indiana Jones: The Great Circle - both of which have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">also now been officially confirmed for Switch 2</a>.

            <p>Resident Evil: Requiem players on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will be able to pick up brand-new amiibos of both Grace and Leon this Summer.
</p>
<p>The Amiibos, revealed during today's Nintendo Partner Direct, will be available to purchase seperately from the game later this year. One features Grace donning a black backpack and slick brown jacket, while the other has Leon with his handy hatchet. </p>
<p>As for what they actually do, aside from sit on your desk as a cool collectable, players who place them on their Switch 2 controllers will be able to unlock special in-game weapon skins for Resident Evil: Requiem. So it you fancy getting a bit stylish in 2026's biggest horror release, that's how you go about it.

<p>Resident Evil: Requiem, set to release on the 27th February, is looking to be a nice blend of first-person and classic third-person Resident Evil. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">You can read Eurogamer's final preview on the game ahead of its release later this month for a more in-depth look at the game</a>. 
</p><p>In it, Alex Donaldson wrote: "All told, this final hands-on can consider mission accomplished: I left it far more excited for RE9 than I went in. I think that mad lot might just do it again. And certainly, with its varying modes of play and dizzying pendulum tempo, it feels like a fitting tribute to thirty years of Resident Evil's brand of survival horror. I am properly desperate to get my hands on the final thing."

            <p>
It's a good day for those those interests lie at the intersection of 'spooky' and 'deduction' - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s acclaimed visual novel Paranormasight is officially getting a sequel and it's coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> later this month, on 19th February.
</p>
<p>
The original Paranormasight, subtitled The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, launched back in 2023, offering an engaging, intriguing blend of spooks and investigatory adventure, all tied to a story of dark rituals and murder in Tokyo, Japan. "Paranormasight is a delight," reckoned Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo-review-spooky-goings-on-in-tokyo">review</a>. "A mystery, a puzzle, and a ghost story that's genuinely haunted by the player on the other side of the screen."

<p>
So news of a sequel is exciting indeed, and Square Enix has now shared early details as part of Nintendo's latest Partner Direct. Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse, as it's known, whisks players to coastal Japan, introducing them to a young pearl diver called Yuza Minakuchi who, while diving one day, encounters another version of himself at the bottom of the ocean.
</p>
<p>But soon, other mysteries begin to plague the island's inhabitants, and - as the adventure unfolds - you'll talk to them, and explore the bay's depths, to uncover the truth of the Mermaid's Curse.
</p>
<p>
So there you go. That's Paranormasight: The Mermaid's Curse, coming to Switch 2 on 19th February.

            <p>The second entry in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> remake trilogy is heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> in the coming months.</p>
<p>As announced at this afternoon's Nintendo Partner Direct, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> will make its Switch 2 debut on 3rd June.</p>

<p>We previously suspected the entire Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy would make its way onto Nintendo's console. Back in May of last year, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi discussed the Switch 2 technical specs, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">kept making references to the Final Fantasy 7 remake series</a>. That has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-za/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html">all since been confirmed</a>.</p>
<p>"After escaping the dystopian city of Midgar, join Cloud and his friends on an epic journey across the planet in pursuit of Sephiroth. Ride chocobos, sprint across sweeping plains, and explore a vibrant, expansive world," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>You can check out the Switch 2 trailer for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth below.

<p>As for how we enjoyed Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on its initial PS5 release, well here is what Ed Nightingale had to say about it all: "Rebirth is a playful take on an emo classic that's bloated but full of character in a bid to justify its own existence."</p>
<p>Ed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">awarded Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth four out of five stars</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, I know it has a terrible name, but The Adventures of Elliot does look rather lovely. It mixes the visuals of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> with the gameplay of classic Zelda - Hey, listen, the main character even has a fairy companion (see what I did there).</p>
<p>The Adventures of Elliot will arrive on Switch 2 on 18th June. There is a demo you can try out today. </p>
<p>You can check out the release date trailer for The Adventures of Elliot below. Will you be playing?</p>

<p>I have been hands-on with Planet of Lana 2 already, and I was charmed by Wishfully's upcoming sequel. It has taken everything that I loved from the original, and levelled it up, to create a deeper narrative and more expressive world. That includes underwater sections, and a much more agile Lana.</p><p>As for the original, here is what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-of-lana-review-pace-poise-and-something-more">Christian Donlan had to say about Planet of Lana on its release in 2023</a>: "It's a game that disappears in pleasant little sips... Nothing is introduced that is not easy to understand, so that you can get to the fun of puzzling how to use it quickly. Nothing is arduous to use - your AI companion is both beautifully behaved and responds to very clear controls, as does all the machinery you get to interact with in the later acts. There are brainteasers here, but no frustrations."</p>

            <p>The original Planet of Lana is a game that has stayed with me since its release back in 2023. Its Ghibli-inspired 2D art direction, its story told in a made-up language, its swelling and emotive music - all of these areas are still, to me, some of the most beautiful in games today. However, I've always felt that developer Wishfully was just scratching the surface with Planet of Lana, and could push to do <em>more</em> with the land of Novo and its intricacies.</p>

<p>Well, a few years later, that's exactly what Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf hopes to do, with the upcoming sequel expanding not just the original's story, but its mechanics and world as well. Wishfully has today announced a release date of 5th March, with a demo also coming to Steam, Xbox and Playstation from 11th February, and to coincide with that announcement I spoke to Wishfully's creative director and co-studio head Adam Stjärnljus.</p>
<p>"During [the original] Planet of Lana, we first aimed to only create one stand-alone game," Stjärnljus tells me during a visit to the studio last month, but he says the team never really wanted to stop there. "There was just so much to tell about Lana and Mui's story, as well as the history of the people and the planet of Novo. So it became very natural as we needed to satisfy our own curiosity."</p>

<p>This curiosity soon saw the studio begin work on Children of the Leaf, which is set to release later this year. Lana is now of course older than she was in the first game, and is much more agile and quick. Meanwhile her adorable sidekick Mui - who Stjärnljus describes as a monkey/cat/dog-like companion - now has some upgraded powers, which sees him able to override machines, as well as hypnotise and control certain creatures throughout the world.</p><p>"We've focused on improving all different parts of the game; Lana has a more fluid and responsive movement. The collaboration between Lana and Mui is much more expanded, enabling more intense stealth scenes and bigger puzzles," Stjärnljus elaborates. "We've also focused on adding more weird creatures that you now have full control over," the goal again being to expand the ways in which you can explore. Stjärnljus adds it "both made sense for Mui to have upgraded powers and it filled a need to improve the collaboration with Lana".</p>
<p>Indeed, Mui's powers combined with Lana's improved athletic prowess are key for Planet of Lana 2's considerably more complex puzzles and stealth sections, as I discovered during a hands-on preview where I was able to play the first four hours. There was more than one occasion where I was left scratching my head as I pondered how to bypass a robotic sentry at the top of a frigid mountain fortress, or navigate an underwater labyrinth.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wishfully</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Let's start with those underwater sections, an all-new depth (sorry) for Planet of Lana 2. Early on, I needed to find healing seaweed to make some medicine for a sick girl. However, this seaweed was not only submerged in the waters surrounding Lana's village of Tailo, but also guarded by a hostile, inky-black sea beast, crackling with electricity (isn't that always the way). Thankfully, I could use Mui's powers to take control of and pilot some small fish through various underwater passages, and - once Lana had cleared the rocks blocking the way - lure this larger aquatic predator away from the plant.</p><p>Then, controlling Lana once again, I was able to trap the beast by closing an underwater gate which was activated from above. This took a decent amount of timing and skill to get just right, because the sea beast would soon return to its original place guarding the seaweed if I didn't act quickly enough, and was a good example of that expanded collaboration Stjärnljus was talking about earlier.</p>
<p>"A platformer is limited in exploration by definition," he says. "You can go left, right, up or down. That’s it. So, it felt like a very natural step to go down, and for the down to be filled with water that we could populate with a bunch of new creatures, mechanics and secrets.</p>
<p>"Also," he adds, "because Mui is famously incompatible with water, we got really excited about working with that restriction both through gameplay mechanics and narrative."</p>
<p>Ah yes, Mui not liking water! I had forgotten about that, but was soon reminded when I had to get Lana's companion from one end of a watery expanse to another. At first I tried Lana's whistle to call him over, but he did not come. I then tried to direct Mui (just like in the original game, you can instruct Mui to stay put, scout on ahead or interact with items like switches in the sequel), but again he did not comply.</p><p>Then I remembered Mui's aversion to water, so I turned my attention back to Lana and dived under to find something I could use to transport my sidekick across to the other side. It was here I discovered Lana could run out of breath and drown - sorry about that, Lana. On the plus side, for larger areas of underwater exploration there will be pockets of air for Lana (and me) to catch a breath.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wishfully</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Soon after these azure waters, Lana and Mui found themselves in another new environment, this time up against the harsh winds and bitter cold of a snowy mountainside. Platforming came into play much more during this section, as Lana and Mui made their way up rocky ledges, occasionally ensuring they were both ducked behind boulders and such to protect themselves from sporadic bursts of wind that could blow them off the edge.</p>
<p>Once safe from the storm and tucked inside a cavern, I then discovered another new creature Mui could pilot: a white pom-pom of a being, which could stick to surfaces and leave a trail of flammable ash (at least, that is what I am going to assume it is) behind it. This creature could then roll into a flame to ignite the ash left in its wake, and burn through large webs blocking Lana and Mui's path, or cause pillars to retract into the wall to clear a safe passage.</p><p>Again though, timing was key, because these pillars would soon reemerge from the walls. Sometimes there was more than one pillar to circumnavigate, which meant being canny with how I laid the ash trail. Ignite one too soon or too late, and I wouldn't have time to reach the upper ledge before another pillar blocked Lana and Mui's path ahead.</p>
<p>It may sound simple enough reading about it all here, but in practice, it was decidedly tricksy to coordinate… and I relished that challenge. When I ultimately puzzled my way out of the cavernous area, I was left with a sense of accomplishment I do not remember feeling in the original. Like I said, I did enjoy the first Planet of Lana, but I never really felt like my little grey cells (to borrow from Poirot) were getting enough exercise. Here, though, I felt like they had stretched, gone for a little jog, and then come home for a reviving yoga session.</p>

</figure>
<p>Another area I explored during the preview was around a large, mechanically-themed facility and down into a mine. To add an extra layer of tension, this area also included patrolling machines, guards and security cameras. Again, Mui was an essential sidekick, and was able to temporarily disrupt cameras to allow Lana to pass safely. Sometimes there was more than one camera, and Lana would need to crouch inside drifts of snow to avoid detection, timing her runs between defensive sweeps of the vicinity.</p><p>Then we had those patrolling machines I mentioned. There were times when Lana and Mui had to work together to manipulate and position beams of light, which these machines had an aversion to. This essentially trapped the machines in a corner, allowing Lana and Mui to clear a safe passage forward. Other times it would again be a case of timing, so getting ready to sprint away from a scout machine and then sliding out of reach before getting struck. Again, this sounds deceptively simple, but my heart still raced each time Lana narrowly missed being caught.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wishfully</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I came away from my time with Planet of Lana 2 impressed. It is the kind of game I can imagine curling up with at the end of a busy day, and sinking an hour or so into each evening to unwind. The world of Novo remains as beautiful as ever with Lana's bucolic fishing community a bright contrast to the cold and harsh industrial areas' black and grey. Meanwhile, the music is as evocative as you would expect from composer Takeshi Furukawa. When the orchestra picks up during a mountainside climb, you can't help but feel your soul swell, and the score feels as much a character in Planet of Lana 2 as Novo does.</p>
<p>Essentially, everything in Planet of Lana 2 has improved. And yes, it could be challenging, but it is also full of heart and emotion, with family, friendship and that sense of connection to others a key part of the experience. An achievement, given Planet of Lana 2's scant dialogue and made-up language.</p><p>"We just love working with limitations! It really forces us to boil everything down to the essentials," Stjärnljus says when I ask about players still feeling a connection to Lana and Mui, despite not actually being able to understand them. "In both Planet of Lana 1 and 2 we use every tool at our disposal to convey emotion as simply as possible to ensure nothing is lost in translation."</p>
<p>Stjärnljus describes "Music, animation, voice acting and body language" as tools used by the studio to "fill the gaps" left by ostensibly simple character models with unintelligible language. You could argue that applies to most games, but there are good examples of it here, even right at the very start of Planet of Lana 2, when Lana and her niece meet and playfully roll down on the grass, the little girl clapping her hands together in delight. It's the kind of warmth you feel throughout, from silly games in an old shipwreck, to the ache Lana feels when her young niece becomes ill. Oh, and before I forget, of course Lana can pet Mui.</p>
<p>"One of our favourite things to observe is when new players get past the point of just focusing on getting Lana where she needs to go, and start worrying if Mui is following along. Before long, most of them even start to feel guilty if they forget about her," Stjärnljus says.</p>
<p>I can confirm that, yes, I did feel guilty on the odd occasion I forgot about Mui. One time he got struck by a machine after I (as Lana) had managed to evade it, and therefore assumed we were all in the clear. Well, it turned out we were not, and the game let me know by taking me back to my last checkpoint to try again, this time with Mui in tow. I also accidentally electrocuted Mui once, but the less said about that the better…</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wishfully</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Planet of Lana 2 is obviously a more ambitious and far chunkier game than its rather snappy five-hour-long predecessor, thanks to all of its new puzzle mechanics and controllable creatures. In fact according to Stjärnljus, Planet of Lana 2 will be roughly double the length of the first game, so we are looking at around 8-10 hours overall. He assures me though that even though the two games are linked, you won't need to have played Planet of Lana to still appreciate the upcoming sequel. But, if you did enjoy the first Planet of Lana, then I have no doubt that its sequel will be right up your alley.</p><p>Wishfully set out to improve and build on its original ideas from Planet of Lana, and from what I have seen so far, it is fair to say the studio has done just that. The world is bigger, the enemies are smarter and the puzzles are harder. As I had hoped it would, the developer has scratched further down beyond Planet of Lana's surface, and unearthed something potentially deeper and richer.</p>

<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 1.43pm:</strong> The Switch 2 release dates for both Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Fallout 4 have leaked.</p>
<p>We are less than an hour away from Nintendo's upcoming Partner Direct, and it seems two of the planned announcements have broken free ahead of schedule. As shared by the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/nintendo-direct-on-vous-devoile-les-dates-de-sortie-des-titres-xbox-a-paraitre-sur-switch-2-61002">billbil-kun</a> of Dealabs, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition will launch its physical edition with a digital download code on 28th April. This chap will retail for $59.99/€59.99, billbil-kun said, though they did not offer UK pricing.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Meanwhile, the insider added Fallout 4 could arrive digitally via the Nintendo eShop, before then, with billbil-kun suggesting later today isn't out of the question. If this does prove accurate, it wouldn't be too surprising - after all, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">acclaimed Fallout adaptation on Amazon has just wrapped its second season</a>, so Bethesda and co would likely want to capitalise on the interest around the franchise as a whole.</p>
<p>As for Indy, well apparently The Great Circle will arrive on Switch 2 on 12th May, retailing for €69.99 / $69.99. I would absolutely recommend giving this game a shot, if you haven't already done so.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>To top it all off, a physical Switch 2 version of Skyrim Anniversary Edition is also said to be coming. According to billbil-kun, this will be released on 28th April. I will update this story once the Direct is live, and we get confirmation.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-switch-2-ports</link>

            <p>For decades now, the adage has been to add a little damning-with-faint-praise caveat to a complement about good-looking games, especially third party ones, on Nintendo platforms. It looks great, we might muse… '<em>for a Nintendo platform'</em>.</p>
<p>In this context, one can see why Nintendo would want to make Capcom's upcoming releases of Resident Evil 9 and Pragmata such tentpoles. That backhanded complement still lingers, but when you look at and play these games on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, they no longer feel like heavily compromised versions. Compromises <em>are</em> present, naturally, but in this presentation they feel more reasonable, and ultimately these games feel right at home on Nintendo's newest platform. I look back to the days of properly hobbled, materially different versions of multiplatform games on Nintendo platforms and think: Those days may finally be over.</p>
<p>I've played a fair amount of Resident Evil: Requiem pre-release demos, and so I sit in a pretty good position to compare and contrast. I was one of the first people to play it in June (PS5), and then did so again in August (PS again) and September (Switch 2, handheld), and then last month I played three hours of a near-final version (PS5 again). A little over a week ago, I finally got to play the missing piece - not Xbox Series X, which will surely profile close enough to PS5, but the Switch 2 version docked, on a TV.</p>

<p>This is a crucial step - handheld, many Switch 2 games present better thanks to the relatively modest screen size going a long way to hide away some technical shortcomings. Case in point: I heartily recommend Switch 2's version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but only really if you plan to primarily play handheld. Docked, on a TV, there's really nowhere to hide.</p><p>This is a challenge for a game like Resident Evil in particular. I reckon horror is absolutely best experienced in a darkened room on a decently large display, ideally with a surround sound system so the gleefully cruel sound design can properly turn your stomach. Horror games can work on handheld - RE had a great turn on 3DS, for instance - but I do think it's an experience most at home in a more cinematic setting.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the upcoming Resident Evil 9 on Switch 2. Point is, I've run the gamut. The best thing I can tell you is this: I'd happily play this game entirely on Switch 2, if the circumstances suited. Docked <em>or</em> handheld.</p>
<p>This is a shift for me. I'm a bit of a snob; I've got a ludicrously powerful PC, so that's my primary port of call. A Switch version of any high-fidelity game was always either a novelty or an 'if I have to' thing. But as I sat there experiencing a solid-looking version of RE9 at a frame rate that is comfortably shooting for 60, I simply thought: I'd happily play this as my main version of the game.</p>

<div>



<p>Crucially, Resident Evil 9 on Switch 2 looks good on the handheld and on a TV (docked mode).</p>

</div>

<p>It has of course been nipped and tucked and graphically tweaked to make everything work on this platform. So this doesn't look as good as the PS5 version that I played by quite some way. But it also speaks to the overall trend of diminishing returns on ever bigger and better game graphics that the difference is now no longer fundamental. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say that the Switch 2 version of Resident Evil 9 is probably a little stronger than what a PS4 version of the game would look like - and I don't actually think this franchise (or gaming in general) has visually moved on that far from how the PS4-era Resi games looked. Things look better, but each graphical upgrade is more granular than the last - and it's clear here that the Switch 2 has more than enough oomph for these new RE Engine games to get by. At a time when huge budgets dictate games can reach the biggest audiences possible, these versions don't just feel appropriate - they feel a must.</p><p>In practice the slight cosmetic pull-backs means that a jump scare from a big nasty monster is perhaps slightly less visceral because the mix of blood and saliva that glistens on its teeth when the game pushes into an extreme close-up after the jump scare isn't quite so realistic - but the moment still works. Protagonist Grace's lavishly rendered hair looks a generation older here than it does on PlayStation - but that isn't really fundamental to the experience. Meanwhile, some new-gen features make it over - so ray tracing is in, even if it perhaps isn't in its full-blown form on Nintendo's platform.</p>
<p>Pragmata felt a touch less stable than Resident Evil, but that perhaps makes sense with it having action that can get more frantic with sci-fi particle effects firing off as you battle robots. It still felt fine, though - it felt at home on Switch 2, which just wasn't the case for older entries in franchises like this.</p>

<div>



<p>Pragmata has more effects going off during combat, which can hurt performance, but overall it still looks great on Switch 2.</p>

</div>

<p>There's a lot of work being done here by DLSS, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amidst-a-sea-of-genai-nvidias-dlss-45-update-means-gamers-are-at-least-getting-something-out-of-ces">aka Deep Learning Super Sampling</a> - an AI-powered technology that essentially renders games at a lower resolution initially to increase performance and allow for advanced features like ray tracing, but then upscales that initial image to the desired output resolution. There's trade-offs to this around input lag and visual artifacting, but I think the majority of users will struggle to see the difference.</p><p>DLSS is a cheat, but it's a cheat inherent to all gaming, pretty much. Everybody is at it; PlayStation's biggest exclusives are now often deploying their equivalent, PSSR, and even my PC's RTX 5090 is putting in DLSS duty. On the Switch 2 it's a vital tool to get games like RE9 and Pragmata over the line - but honestly, I'm not all that interested in debates about fake resolution or fake frames or whatever else. I'm interested in the result, not the journey. This result is pretty fantastic, all things considered.</p>
<p>As they have in many matters third party, Capcom does rather appear to be paving the way. Its in-house RE Engine is ready for the Switch 2 big-time. This isn't Diet RE9 or Pragmata Zero; it's the full-fat thing. It's a way of playing these games that I can recommend to anyone; it's no longer strictly circumstantial. And those trade-offs are now beginning to feel more like footnotes than glaring caveats marked with the boldest asterisks. If other third parties follow suit as strongly as Capcom, the Switch 2 is even more irresistible than I first thought.</p>

            <p>There's a Nintendo Direct broadcast happening today, focusing on non-Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> games, and we'll be covering everything divulged right here. You know the drill: watch along, chat along, possibly make a pithy remark. Or be refreshingly positive - it's up to you!</p>
<p>What we know: the Nintendo Partner Direct will begin at 2pm UK time and will be short and sweet with a running-time of 30 minutes. No need to stay up half the night for this one - mentioning no names, ahem, Sony.</p>
<p>What we don't know: what will be in the broadcast. There aren't any official sighters to go by, which means we have plenty to speculate about. Are we about to get a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring on Switch 2</a>, for example? And speaking of FromSoftware: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">what's going on with Switch 2-exclusive The Duskbloods</a>? You can't just dangle that in front of us one year and then not say anything about it, can you?</p>
<p>Beyond that, maybe we'll get a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-coming-to-switch-2-next-year">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2</a>, and potentially something about the second <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> game Rebirth coming to Switch 2 - there are rumours.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's theoretically a good moment for third-party games on Switch 2, while Nintendo's new console has comparable power, so let's see how the Switch 2 capitalises on it.</p>

Hello everybody! I do like these chattery moments. So, what are you hoping to see? Frankly, I'll take almost anything on Switch 2. I wonder if it's a pyschological thing most of the time but the concept of being able to take a game around with me, that was previously stuck in my TV, never gets old to me. Welcome to 10 years ago, Bertie.

      <p>Switch 2 co-op exclusive Orbitals launches this summer</p>
    <p>
Here we go.
</p>
<p>
What is Direct opener I wonder? 
</p>
<p>
We're straight into a game. An anime-looking game. "Deep in space a research station was suddenly struck by a cosmic storm..." This looks like a Japanese cartoon. Orbitals, it's called. I can't see any semblance of gameplay yet.
</p>
<p>
Now I can! It's the two-player co-op adventure we've heard about before, a bit like Hazelight's games - It Takes Two, Split Fiction. In other words, you need to work together. You have different guns to do different things. It looks very Hazelight, with a different visual finish.
</p>
<p>
Gameshare is supported so you only need one copy of the game. Good. 
</p>
<p>
Orbitals is a Switch 2-exclusive and launches this summer.

      <p>Paranormasight tells a mermaid mystery on 19th February</p>
    <p>
Paranormasight now. A mystery adventure. This one's about mermaids and pearl divers - a classic combination if ever I've seen one. A pearl diver finds a copy of himself under the water. Looks a bit dark.
</p>
<p>
You need to investigate by talking to people, and by taking a dip in the water. There seems to be a nice variation of gameplay types here.
</p>
<p>
Paranormasight The Mermaid's Curse launches 19th February.

Glossed over an anime football game there, apologies.

<p>
A dinosaur-related, subterranean Tokyo third-person stealth game now. Well, they're not just dinosaurs but strange underground creatures. If you're found in this game, you're dead. 
</p>
<p>
It's got Gameshare so you and your friends can share controls, which sounds strange.

Capcom's Pragmata now, which is about a man and his android-girl-partner's journey. A company sends bots against them and Dianna, the android, needs to hack the enemies to soften them up for you to shoot.
</p>
<p>
Looks like a twiddly thing to control, hacking and shooting at once. Interesting idea though.

            <p><strong>Update</strong> (2:10PM): An upgraded port of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> has been revealed at the Nintendo Partner Direct. It's coming out later today, and owners of the original Nintendo Switch version of the game can get a free upgrade on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Original article (11:40AM)</strong>: Hollow Knight has received a PEGI rating for the Switch 2, hinting towards a port to the latest Nintendo console.</p>
<p>As can be seen<a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Hollow+Knight"> on the PEGI website</a>, the beloved metroidvania can be seen rated across all its console versions. However, if you peer down at the base version of Hollow Knight (not the Voidheart Edition) you can see a Switch 2 version rated today, the 5th February 2026.</p>
<p>This comes at a peculiar time, as we have a Nintendo Partner Direct to look forward to later today at 2PM GMT / 3PM CEST / 6AM PST / 9AM EST. Perhaps this is a early indicator of a reveal to come.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight hasn't become a household name without cause. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-so-special-about-the-original-hollow-knight-the-intoxicating-power-of-team-cherrys-invisible-insistent-guiding-hand">has an extremely compelling guiding hand</a> that urges players to explore a collection of endearing, often gorgeous, sometimes horrifying, locations that are both lovingly-crafted and packed with weaving narratives.</p><p>If you've not actually played the original Hollow Knight yet, perhaps you jumped first into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> or just haven't found the time, it's an absolute must-play. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-a-slick-stylish-and-super-tough-metroidvania">You can read Eurogamer's review of Hollow Knight here</a>, in which Vikki Blake describes the game as: "A stern yet scintillating 2D adventure that makes a point of not holding your hand."</p>

            <p>Original Mario voice actor Charles Martinet has shared more on how he came up with the voice for Nintendo's moustachioed plumber.</p>
<p>Back in 2023, Nintendo announced that Martinet, the exuberant voice of Mario, would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-charles-martinet-no-longer-video-game-voice-of-mario">no longer be the English voice actor behind Nintendo's most recognisable mascot</a>, after almost 30 years in the job. Starting with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/internet-briefly-thinks-its-identified-marios-new-voice-actor-until-he-says-no">the role was instead taken on by Kevin Afghani</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-explains-what-charles-martinets-mario-ambassador-job-actually-entails">Martinet became a Mario Ambassador</a>.</p>

<p>But, how did Martinet actually come up with the 'whoops' and 'wahoooooos' of Mario? Well, first off, it turns out that Martinet actually crashed Nintendo's audition for Mario without knowing anything about the character. In fact, he didn't even know anything about Nintendo. But even so, he had "so much fun at the audition" many decades ago, and soon his iconic legacy began.</p>
<p>"I was simply told to start talking, and when you run out of things to say, that's your audition," Martinet told <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/features/mario-actor-interview-never-heard-nintendo-203132-20260203">GamingBible</a>. "I didn't want to do an Italian plumber sounding gruff, mean and nasty or scary to children, like a Mafia member. I didn't know whether the audience would have children in it, but I have a principle of comedy of always being kind. I thought to myself that I'll do something much more silly and fun. I didn't know anything about video games, so I just made things up about food and started talking."</p>
<p>Martinet added that "being able to bring that joy into children's and adults' lives" has been a "tremendous honour" for him.</p>
<p>"When they tell me stories of growing up with Mario, and playing the games with their parents, grandparents, and now their children, it gives me such a feeling of joy that cannot be described. I'm just grateful for those moments every day."</p>

<p>Since his turn as the voice of Mario in the games, Martinet did have a rather charming cameo in the Super Mario Bros. Movie. Here, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-charles-martinet-voices-in-the-super-mario-bros-movie">he voiced Mario and Luigi's father</a>. Mario and Luigi's father appears in multiple scenes during the film's opening section in Brooklyn, and again at the end, when Bowser's castle comes crashing back through to the "human" world.</p>
<p>At one point, we hear Mario and Luigi's father congratulating his sons by saying: "That's my boys!" Awww! I wonder if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-unveils-new-characters-that-do-not-disappoint">he will return for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, as well…?</p>

            <p>Have you heard the word '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-masocore-action-with-an-approachable-twist">masocore</a>' before? It's a portmanteau of 'masochist' and 'hardcore', and it's what Team Ninja used to describe the first few games in the Nioh franchise. In an interview <a href="https://www.fandom.com/articles/nioh-2">a long time ago</a>, Yosuke Hayashi (general producer at Team Ninja) told me that the team working on the Nioh games never really wanted to make them 'Soulslikes', and thought that 'masocore' suited the developer's vision slightly better.</p>
<p>"We weren't trying to make a game in this genre to begin with, but when we played the original Dark Souls, we were really inspired," Hayashi told me back in 2020. "Team Ninja is famous for difficult action games, but it wasn’t our primary intention to make a difficult game. It was more about detecting the tension of samurai games - and the genre that worked for that, for us, happened to be 'masocore'."</p>
<p>Now, on the eve of the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, I had the chance to chat to Masaki Fujita, game director of the third game in the hardcore action-RPG series. I was curious about the evolution of Team Ninja's experience in the genre, and if its approach to difficulty had changed at all when it came to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-review-4">Nioh</a>, especially after working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-4">a new Ninja Gaiden</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin-review-a-trashy-soulslike-that-packs-surprising-depth">Final Fantasy: Stranger of Paradise</a> in the interim.</p>

<p>For context, there is a long-running - and often quite exhausting - discourse around difficulty in action-RPGs. Should games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dark-souls-review">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> have difficulty options? Would it make the titles more accessible for players? Would it compromise the feeling of achievement that even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> believes lies at the core of the experience? Would the entire genre be as beloved, as infamous, as popular, if it wasn't for its relationship with brutal difficulty?</p><p>"We've never considered adding difficulty settings to the Nioh series," Fujita tells me when I askew whether the challenge level in these games is non-negotiable for Team Ninja. "The value of clearing the game is something that is unifying, and since Nioh 3 has even more variations on strategies to clear the game compared to previous games in the series, our approach is not to change the difficulty setting when you can't clear it."</p>
<p>This is actually a sentiment echoed by 'father of the genre', Miyazaki. The Dark Souls boss is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tough-love-on-dark-souls-difficulty">on the record</a> as saying you don't need to be 'particularly skilled' to play Sark Souls games: you just need to know how to adapt, how to pick up a new spell, a different weapon, a new way of thinking, if bashing your Moonlight Greatsword against a boss over and over again isn't yielding any success for you.</p>



<p>The same is true in Nioh - and (after pumping 80 hours into it) especially Nioh 3: there are so many tools at your disposal now, with magic, ninjutsu, summons, Guardian Spirit skills and more being made more available and easier to use, that any roadblock you come up against can be chipped away at… if you know how to re-spec and re-evaluate. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nioh-3-review">In my review</a>, I mentioned it's the easiest title in the series so far, and that's partly because of the '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> effect'; if something is proving too tough, you can simply wander out into the open field, check off more side missions, and come back later. The level scaling is pretty intense in Nioh 3, and you'll soon find even five or so levels can make an eye-watering difference.</p><p>"The enjoyment and sense of accomplishment of being able to figure out on your own how to overcome a situation is what we see as one of the best parts of this series," concludes Fujita. Personally, I think that feels more apparent in Nioh 3 than in any other game in the series, precisely because Team Ninja gives you so much freedom in choosing how to tackle the various gatekeepers and difficulty spikes. I think the formula is more potent here than in any other Team Ninja game, period. Nioh or not.</p>

            <p>Valve time strikes again. Three months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-valve-announces-standalone-steam-frame-vr-headset-plus-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-revival">announcing a trio of new hardware products</a>, including the Steam Machine, Steam Frame and Steam Controller, Valve has published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">blog post detailing their delay</a>. The new hardware was meant to arrive in the first quarter of this year, but this has now been "revisited" to the first half of the year due to the "memory and storage shortages you've likely heard about". </p>
<p>The Steam Machine is likely the major catalyst behind the decision, as the sharp rise in RAM and storage prices could force a rethink for a living room box that was intended to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">bridge the gap between consoles and entry-level PCs</a>. With RAM and storage prices doubling, tripling or even quadrupling over the past three months, even the relatively modest base model with 16GB of DDR5 RAM and 512GB will now cost significantly more to produce. </p>
<p>For context, the cheapest 16GB DDR5 SODIMM kit has <a href="https://zdcs.link/98AyY1">more than doubled in price on Amazon UK</a>, from £67 on Valve's November announcement date to £148 today. A 512GB 2230 NVMe SSD of the type used by Valve in the Steam Machine has <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8YMG">also rocketed up in price</a>, from £54 to £88 in the same time period. If we look at 2TB drives, it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxg3D">a steeper climb</a>, from £129 to £244. </p>
<p>Valve isn't paying consumer prices from Amazon, of course, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">these price surges are a worldwide affair</a> that have affected nearly every part of the PC industry. The situation could even postpone the release of the next generation of games consoles. </p><p>While the Steam Machine is the most obviously affected, the Steam Frame VR headset is also a miniature Snapdragon-powered gaming PC, with its own 16GB of LPDDR5X memory and 256GB or 1TB of storage, and its pricing will therefore need to be reconsidered. Previously, Valve had indicated that it expected the Frame to undercut the Valve Index in price, which retails for £919. The Steam Controller is the only member of the trio relatively immune to the current climate, though its launch is necessarily tied to the other two products. </p>
<p>Valve's post states that it expected to be able to share pricing and availability data by now, so it will be interesting to see how long it will take the Washingtonian firm to release revised information. In the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english">the recent blog</a> to see a few more frequently-asked questions answered, on topics including RAM/storage upgradability, ongoing support for the Valve Index and expected Steam Machine performance figures, with more blogs to come over the coming weeks. </p>

            <p>It sounds as though Blizzard is open to exploring generative AI during the development of its games.</p>
<p>Answering a question I asked during an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> press conference at Blizzard campus last week, Blizzard president Johanna Faries said: "I like when we are dev-led in our approach. We want our dev teams to be able to utilise or explore whatever new technology is out there, to the extent that they're comfortable doing with it what we believe is responsible, and a lot of those principles that are communicated are really around rooting in responsible choices."</p>
<p>The principles she's referring to were outlined internally to staff at Blizzard, I was later told. I wasn't told what they were.</p>
<p>Faries went on to say: "We do actually, at Blizzard, have a centralised governance team specifically focused on AI and the role it can or should play in our development cycles.</p>
<p>"What's great about that is it's very cross functional, so you're going to have voices from around the horn thinking about not just what's hot-topic now, but where do we want to be five, 10 years from now? What's the implication on our teams? What's the implication on our values? How do we make sure that we don't stymie the opportunity for devs, artists, whomever, to want to play with new tools and play in the sandbox, if it unlocks creativity or gets rid of drudgery or what have you? We want happy devs, right?</p><p>"But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it's a responsible tool and aligned with how we want to show up as a company," she said. "So I feel very good in terms of the process we have in terms of vetting: is it secure, is it safe, is it values led? But I keep coming back to: I want the teams to feel safe, to explore to the extent that it drives joy in the work. And I think we have a good process, all up, in terms of making sure we're doing it in a responsible manner."</p>
<blockquote><em>"But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it's a responsible tool" -Johanna Faries</em></blockquote>
<p>Faries' remarks come a few months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-about-incredibly-talented-people-not-doing-incredibly-boring-stuff-blizzard-devs-say-its-possible-to-use-ai-tools-while-still-feeling-handcrafted">a lead World of Warcraft artist talked about using AI to remove some of the "boring" tasks</a> of game development, such as tweaking helmets to fit the heads of different-sized races in the game. "Things like AI help a lot with that," Gabriel Gonzalez explained. "I would say the philosophy is always how we free up more time for our team to be creative, and take away the menial." Gonzalez balanced his comment by emphasising the strength of Blizzard's handcrafted approach to art and making games. "That is, and always will be, a big part of it," he said.</p>
<p>Overwatch director Aaron Keller echoed that sentiment in the same interview, seemingly ruling out AI-use in the development of his game. "Right now, we don't use AI to create characters or gameplay," he said. "I think Blizzard as a whole is known for handcrafted games and handcrafted worlds. So, we try to pour all of our creative energy and all of our passion into doing that.</p><p>"For us, it is more important to get the details right, and to make sure that the gameplay is as impeccable as it can be and withholds the Blizzard standard, rather than trying to make something as quick as we possibly can."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-hops-on-controversial-ai-train-with-concept-art-tool">Blizzard has been linked with generative AI-use before</a>. In 2023, Blizzard reportedly told staff about a generative-AI concept art tool it had developed, called Stable Diffusion, that had been trained on the company's artwork. "We are on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games," read an email from Allen Adham, one of the co-founders of Blizzard, who once led the company. He left and rejoined the company a couple of times since those earlier days, leaving again in 2024. The email also mentioned "voice cloning", "game coding", "anti-toxicity", and "autonomous, intelligent in-game NPCs" among other potential uses for the generative AI tool. It's not clear whether this still exists in any form.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, generative AI is, as Aaron Keller noted in the above interview, an increasingly prevalent technology, "So we are going to see more of it." Exactly how much we'll see of it in Blizzard games, however, remains the question.</p>
<p>But Blizzard isn't the only major game development studio exploring the use of generative AI. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian revealed in December that it was exploring some uses of gen-AI</a> during development - a decision it faced heated backlash for, causing it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">to walk back on some uses it had in mind</a>.</p><p>I visited Blizzard campus last week for three separate days devoted to Overwatch, Diablo and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>. The coverage embargoes for these days are staggered, but the Overwatch restriction has now lifted, hence a barrage of Overwatch news hitting the site. And there's a lot to write about. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">Overwatch is getting a big push from Blizzard</a>, as it drops a giant expansion-like release and adopts an expansion-like approach, and drops the "2" from the name to make it "Overwatch" again.</p>

            <p>You wouldn't know it to hear it, but decorated video game actor Jennifer Hale - famously the voice of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Commander Shepard - is the person providing the meows of new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> hero Jetpack Cat.</p>
<p>Blizzard confirmed this at its headquarters last week while detailing Jetpack Cat and the four other heroes coming to Overwatch (formerly known as "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>") next week. "The voice actor is Jennifer Hale," audio and technical director Scott Lawson told a group of press that I was in, "and she did an incredible job, and working with it was so much fun."</p>
<p>Note that Hale already voices another Overwatch hero, gunslinger Ashe, who was added to the game in November 2018.</p>
<p>Jetpack Cat has been a rumoured hero for Overwatch for a long time, and she finally arrives alongside four other new heroes on 10th February with the game-changing ability to tow other characters through the air. She can do this to both allies and enemies, though doing it to enemies requires using her Ultimate.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>I've played her; she's great fun. Very manoeuvrable, very fast, and with some useful healing abilities for supporting diving or flanking characters, not to mention the ability to pick up slower heroes from base or airlift Bastion in chaingunning form over groups of enemies. She also has lots of voice lines, although they're all variations of "meow", amusingly.</p><p>Jetpack Cat has been around as a concept nearly as long as Overwatch itself. "Jetpack Cat in particular, as a concept, is something the team has wanted to do since, man, we launched Overwatch 1," lead hero producer Kenny Hudson told me. "We've had early concept art for Jetpack Cat on the wall in our hallway for like eight years now." But the idea never got any further. "You'd walk by it like every day, like, 'Maybe we should...'," added associate game director Alec Dawson.</p>
<p>The reason why Blizzard can do Jetpack Cat now is because it's releasing so many new heroes at once - five on 10th February and a further five over the course of the year. "Going all out on making five Heroes at a time gave us some cover to explore new things, try new things," Hudson said. "When we said okay who are the five going to be...? It's funny because Jetpack Cat was always in the conversation from day one."</p>

</figure>
<p>"It just felt like it's time for the cat," art director Dion Rogers said in a separate interview.</p>
<p>Jetpack Cat may seem silly but she's not the first animal character in the game. Winston, a gorilla, has been at the heart of Overwatch since it launched, and a hamster was added in the shape of Wrecking Ball in 2018. And, as Rogers told me, there are ideas for more.</p><p>"We actually have a random idea we joke about," Rogers said, "this character called the Oranga-tank. It's an orangutan that's a tank and he's a villain. Because most of our animal characters are good guys, we were like how do we make villain animals? And Oranga-tank is an idea that's been floating around for a while. I don't know if he'll show up in the game. It's a funny drawing; there's a bunch of funny drawings everywhere."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">Overwatch is currently experiencing an exciting moment</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Blizzard announced an ambitious new yearly expansion plan</a> for the game and it will release the first of these, The Reign of Talon, next week. It also announced it would be removing the tainted "2" from the game's name to make it, simply, "Overwatch" again. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-nearly-had-an-f-bomb-problem<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Bright-eyed and hopeful Blizzard shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> nearly had an f-bomb problem.</p>
<p>It relates to new hero Emre, who's Turkish, and to his Ultimate ability which, for a long time, was called "Seek and Destroy". It wasn't until Turkish actor Kerem Erdinc stepped into the booth to record Emre's lines that Blizzard was alerted to the mistake it nearly made.</p>
<p>"I got a story for you," Erdinc told me during a group interview at Blizzard last week. "I got to name Emre's Ultimate line, and the reason behind it is hilarious.</p>
<p>"Originally the line for Emre's Ultimate, where he jumps up in the air and does his thing, was 'Seek and Destroy'. But the word 'seek', if you translate it into Turkish - don't look that up - it is a very bad word. It is <em>the</em> bad word. The f-word - that's what it means. So I said, 'Guys, you might want to avoid that one.'</p><p>"I said how about 'Search and Destroy'? And Miranda [Moyer, lead narrative designer] said, 'Well that's what we're calling the comics, so that works.'" Erdinc added: "It would have been the butt of every Turkish player's jokes about Emre where he's just saying eff and destroy."</p>
<p>Emre is one of five new heroes coming to Overwatch on 10th February. He's the last of the characters seen on that old Overwatch group image from years ago, and when played, he feels a lot like Soldier 76 - a kind of run-and-gun first-person shooter hero. Emre can aim down sights - a first for Overwatch - and has bouncy grenades, a semi-automatic sidearm, and various movement and health regen boosts. His Ultimate makes him hover in the air, in a Tron-like AI form, and fire charged explosive blasts that explode upon impact.</p>



<p>Kerem Erdinc shared the story of the Ultimate line tweak by way of highlighting how Blizzard allows voice actors to inform the design of the characters they're playing. This is a game that tries to create characters from every region of the world, so having a Turkish actor make a Turkish character feel authentic is important to Blizzard.</p><p>"Our philosophy is always to lead on our actors a lot because, as a diverse game, we're looking for people from all walks of life to tell stories from all walks of life," Overwatch senior lead narrative designer Joshi Zhang said in the same interview. "And what makes that come to life is by leaning on real experiences from real people.</p>
<blockquote><em>"I didn't grow up seeing Turkish characters in anything" -Kerem Erdinc</em></blockquote>
<p>"As writers, we don't know what those experiences are. We target them, and when our actors are able to lock on to that, that's amazing, that's where the magic happens. But we need the actors and their incredible thinking in order to make that happen.</p>
<p>"It's always really important for us that the actors have a say in: what does this line mean to you? Because what it means to you will probably be a lot closer to whatever it means to someone like you, and someone like you might be seeing themselves in the game for the first time."</p><p>Erdinc said he's been an Overwatch fan since the game came out, and for him, the idea of a Turkish hero being added to the game - for Emre has been long-rumoured - was mouth watering. "I was wishing for this character, just as a fan, for eight years since it was covered in Overwatch Declassified," he said - "just obsessed with like 'oh a Turkish hero!'. It would be so cool.</p>
<p>"I didn't grow up seeing Turkish characters in anything," he added. "I can count how many are in video games on one hand, and the Overwatch team putting such care into introducing him, fully authentic, as a Turkish character with Turkish lines..." He paused here to say he'd thrown various jokes into the Turkish localisation "to make Turkish players smile". "That means everything to me," he said.</p>
<p>"But it also comes with a sense of responsibility that if I goof this up, then that would be horrible. It's hallowed ground for me and I take it very seriously."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Overwatch - the "2" has been dropped from the name - will welcome its first expansion-like release on 10th February</a>, which will bring new heroes but also a UI overhaul and a serious story-delivery rework and push. It also kicks off a year of various additions grouped under The Reign of Talon banner, during which five more heroes will be added to the game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">It's a big, exciting moment for Overwatch</a>.</p>

        <p>We're getting 10 new heroes, total, in 2026.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> will henceforth be known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, Blizzard has announced, as it outlines a major new plan that will revolve around free, annual, expansion-like releases for the game. The first of these - The Reign of Talon - arrives next week, on Tuesday, 10th February.</p>
<p>The undeniable headline feature is adding <em>five</em> new heroes at once, which is the largest new-hero-drop Overwatch has ever had - two more than Overwatch 2 launched with. Then, a further five heroes will be added throughout 2026, one in each Reign of Talon season (from season 2-6), taking the total new-hero count this year to 10. For Overwatch, that release-pace is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The new five new heroes are spread across all character roles. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domina, a tank who's a little like Zarya,</li>
<li>Emre, a damage dealer who's a lot like Soldier 76,</li>
<li>Mizuki, a support who has a magical healing hat he throws,</li>
<li>Anran, a damage dealer who sets people on fire and then literally fans the flames to deal damage to them, and</li>
<li>Jetpack Cat, a long-rumoured support who permanently flies and can tow team-mates and enemies through the air.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">I have played all of these heroes and shared my thoughts on them in a longer Overwatch revamp article</a>.</p>
<p>The switch to a yearly focus has had a major knock-on effect for story, allowing Blizzard to move from a smaller piecemeal storytelling formula to one shaped over the course of a year, affording a much more ambitious and dramatic scope. Six 'season' releases are planned for Reign of Talon, and the game's season-count will be reset to one (from 20) to coincide with it.</p><p>The story will be told in familiar ways to Overwatch, through a mix of cinematic videos and animated comics, but you'll now be able to see and track this inside of the game, and to feel the effects of it as you play. Characters will refer to story events in voice lines, and some maps will be altered to reflect what's been going on. Watchpoint: Gibraltar will be the first of these, and it will change structurally following an invasion by Talon's evil forces when The Reign of Talon begins.</p>

<p>Showcasing all of this will be a five-week story event called Conquest, which will allow players to side with either Overwatch or Talon in a faction war. You pick a side and carry out objectives for them, earning points for the faction and rewards for yourself.</p>
<p>There's still more: Overwatch is getting a full-on user interface overhaul for Reign of Talon to better organise the information the game presents to you, and to enable a 3D hero lobby, which will expand to a full party lobby in Season 4.</p><p>There are sub-roles being added to the hero roster as well, which not only help break-up the rapidly expanding roster visually, but give gameplay perks depending on the sub-role you choose. A Flanker like Tracer gets more health from health packs, for example, whereas a Medic like Moira heals themselves while healing others.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Stadium - the recently added MOBA-like 'develop your character as you play' mode - is getting an icon overhaul, and a build helper for newer players.</p>
<p>Blizzard has also said we should also expect two new core maps during the Reign of Talon year, as well as the reintroduction of post-match accolades and reworks for existing heroes (Blizzard wouldn't tell me which ones). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-proper-switch-2-version-coming">There's a dedicated Switch 2 release that will launch with Season 2</a>, which hasn't been dated, but I expect will arrive sometime in April.</p>
<p>It's a bold and headline-grabbing change for Overwatch 2, which struggled to convince players a few years ago when it launched. More importantly, it makes Overwatch 2 exciting again.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has finally announced a proper <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> - the game formerly known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> - which it plans to release alongside the second season of The Reign of Talon this year. The current estimate for this is mid-April, Blizzard told me this afternoon.</p>
<p>The Reign of Talon is the year-long event that begins 10th February with an expansion-like release, which, among other things, introduces five new heroes to the game, overhauls the user interface, and brings story inside the game and makes a big fuss of it. There will also be five more heroes added over the course of 2026 - one in each of the five proceeding Reign of Talon seasons.</p>
<p>You can already play Overwatch (as in, Overwatch 2) on Switch, incidentally, but not in a way that's optimised to take advantage of Nintendo's newer and more powerful hardware. Presumably, we'll see much needed performance gains when the game <em>is </em>optimised, but could we also see support for some of the Switch 2's quirkier features like its mouse-pointer controls? We'll see.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Today is a big day for Overwatch, as Blizzard announces a bold new vision for the game</a> and - perhaps most significantly - drops the tainted "2" from the game's name. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">There is, as I explore in a separate Overwatch piece, much to be excited about</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> had a problem. It's a problem a lot of live service games have, to be fair. It wasn't particularly exciting any more. It had a chance at launch a few years ago to excite people, to create a wave of momentum to surf thereafter, but it floundered, beset as it was with identity problems and a misguided obsession with PvE, which sounded lovely on paper but never really worked in practice. Plenty of good work was done since on the game but most people outside of Overwatch 2 don't care - or don't know, because they're not looking anymore. They've moved on, they're playing other things. Incremental updates weren't enough to turn their heads. As far as many people were concerned, Overwatch 2 was yesterday's news, been and gone. How, then, does Blizzard make people care again?</p>
<p>That was the question at the forefront of my mind when I travelled to Blizzard's head offices recently. And I was delighted to discover, as a lapsed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> player, that it does have an answer - and a convincing one. Blizzard is <em>sort of</em> relaunching the game. Specifically, Overwatch 2 is getting an enormous release this month akin to an expansion, which will contain five new heroes - far more than we've ever had in an update before. Even Overwatch 2 itself, a whole new game, only launched with three new heroes. On top of that, there are plans for further five new heroes to be released over the course of the year. That's 10 new heroes in 2026, which for Overwatch is unprecedented.</p>
<p>That's not all: there's a top-to-bottom user interface overhaul and a huge story push I'd go as far as to call Story 2.0, as well as the many game alterations and new skins we'd expect from a regular seasonal release. Perhaps most significantly of all, though, Blizzard is renaming the game, erasing the "2" from the title to make it, simply, "Overwatch" again.</p>

<p>It's symbolic; there's more going on here than new heroes. This is a series that's been bruised and battered in recent years, first when the ambitious Overwatch League esports dream didn't work out, then when the sequel floundered, and then when Marvel Rivals used a barely disguised Overwatch formula to find huge success last year. Overwatch has been on the ropes. But this Overwatch rethink, and with it a pledge to do huge expansion-like releases every year, represents Blizzard fighting back.</p><p>The seriousness of the company's intentions were made clear by who attended the press conference I watched. There wasn't only the Overwatch trio of Aaron Keller, game director, Dion Rogers, art director, and new executive producer Ben Bell on the stage. There was Walter Kong, the head of live service development at Blizzard, and Blizzard's president herself, Johanna Faries. Here, in this article, I've assembled their thoughts from the press conference, as well as what I learned in a one-on-one interview with Aaron Keller and in a series of group interviews about different aspects of the game. I've also included my thoughts on the new heroes, which I had a chance to play.</p>
<p>Is this a turnaround moment for the game? Will Overwatch be a part of the conversation again? Could a comeback be on?</p>

<h2>No, Overwatch 2 being renamed is not an admission of any previous errors or guilt, Blizzard says</h2>
<p>The "2" in the name was tainted. To begin with, there was the controversy that Overwatch 2 would replace Overwatch 1 rather than live alongside it - a forced migration plenty of people didn't want. Then there were the things Overwatch 2 did that people didn't like, such as locking new heroes behind Battle Pass progression or moving to 5v5 matches from 6v6 - decisions Blizzard has since revised. The "2" represented a PvE dream which never properly materialised, too. It represented all of that; it came to symbolise Overwatch losing its way. But now the "2" is being dropped.</p><p>"What would I change if we could go back?" says Blizzard live service head Walter Kong during the press conference. "Probably not call it Overwatch 2." He smiles. "But when I look back at that period, I do think that it was a positive period for us, because we made an important transition. We made a transition to an ongoing live game, and that wasn't easy. It was really, really hard.</p>
<p>"It was a necessary period of challenge that we had to get through to get to where we are today. I don't think we could jump straight here. Just thinking back to what we experienced during those years makes me feel a bit exhausted, but it is what's allowed us to take Overwatch into the future."</p>
<blockquote><em>"It was a necessary period of challenge that we had to get through to get to where we are today" -Walter Kong</em> </blockquote>
<p>"It's a tricky question," game director Aaron Keller says when we talk one-on-one, and I ask whether dropping the "2" was an admission of error in any way. "From our player's point of view, they'll tell us, 'Hey, Overwatch is in the best state it's ever been in.' And a lot of times we even hear like, 'Overwatch has finally earned the two.' So I don't think this is us trying to admit there was a failure here, especially when we start hearing from the community that we've earned it.</p>
<p>"But for us what this is saying is that because Overwatch is this forever game, we don't want our players worrying about when it's going to get replaced by Overwatch 3."</p>
<p>There was once a broad trilogy idea for Overwatch, if you didn't know. The first game was to be quite contained and focus on competitive multiplayer, which it did. The second game would then expand to include a PvE experience, which it tried to do. Then the third game would expand again to be a full blown do-everything persistent online world - an MMO, in other words, just like the cancelled Titan MMO Overwatch was once salvaged from. This information comes from Jason Schreier's Blizzard book, Play Nice, by the way, which is well worth a read.</p><p>But as several Overwatch-related people reiterated during the course of the day, Overwatch is refocused on being entirely a competitive PvP game. Those old plans are no more, and there may well never be an Overwatch 3. "Never is a big word to say," Keller says in our interview, "but our intention is to continue supporting this game, this competitive hero-based, team-based shooter, for as far into the future as our players will continue playing."</p>
<p>Does that mean PvE is absolutely definitely out for good? "I think when you you talk about the PvE missions by themselves: as we developed them, and especially as we released a few of them, we didn't see a lot of excitement from players for those missions," Keller says, "and we realised that where we ought to be putting our resources in this game is on that core competitive PvP experience, and that is what we've been doing for the last few years. I don't think I could say that PvE is forever off the table for Overwatch, but it is definitely not something that we're focusing on right now or looking to get back to anytime soon."</p>

<h2>These five new heroes will shake things up</h2>
<p>The thinking behind introducing five new heroes at once is there will be something for everybody. The characters are spread across all roles - there's a tank, two supports, and two damage dealers. And what I find particularly impressive about them is how they bring never before seen ideas to the game.</p><p>Jetpack Cat is the most blatant of them. Superficially, she's ridiculous - a cat with a jetpack - but she plays brilliantly, being the game's only permanently flying hero, which means she has incredible manoeuvrability and impressive speed. That, plus her few healing abilities, makes her a great pairing for D.Vas or other dive/flanking characters that are usually hard to keep up with.</p>
<p>But Jetpack Cat also brings arguably the most exciting new tactical possibility to the game it's had in a long time, in the form of her tow rope - or beam - which she dangles for other heroes to use for a lift somewhere. This means you can do things like fly back to base to collect slow characters who've respawned there, or airlift characters to places they wouldn't otherwise be able to get. Or you could, say, airlift Bastion in chaingun form for a devastating aerial assault; or you could carry Junkrat around for him to drop grenades on teams from above. You can tow enemies too, although only as a consequence of using your Ultimate, which limits it. Still, it's an enormously powerful way to remove an obstinate tank from the battlefield as you dump them over a ledge somewhere.</p>
<p>My favourite hero of the day, though, was probably Anran, a damage dealer who's the older sister of support character Wuyang, if you're interested in lore. I don't normally go for damage types because I lack the precise skill to use them, but Anran is forgiving in that regard, which is what I really liked.</p>
<p>Anran's theme is setting people on fire with flaming fan strikes and abilities, and then literally fanning the flames to deal more damage to them. And because fanning the flames doesn't require great accuracy, just close proximity, it's much easier to reliably do. Couple that with her flaming dash and dash-around flame strike and she's got manoeuvrability and a bit of survivability. But Anran's most attention-grabbing ability is one of her <em>two </em>Ultimates, which brings her back from the dead when you use it, in a fiery explosion.</p><p>Mizuki, the other new support, will take a bit of getting used to, but he seems to already be the favourite of a few developers at Blizzard, which bodes well. I struggled with him. He's themed around a large circular hat he throws to heal people, a bit like Kung Lao does in Mortal Kombat, although with less slicing people apart. Throw the hat and it automatically bounces around allies in a loose line in front of you, and sometimes off of scenery, and then it returns to you, which feels cool. He also has a healing aura like Lucio, and a remember-where-you-were teleport to get out of trouble.</p>

<div>



<p>The new Overwatch heroes - Anran, Emre, Domina, Mizuki and Jetpack Cat.</p>

</div>

<p>But Mizuki's potential I think lies in his chain grapple, which he fires out at people to bind them, again like a Mortal Kombat character but this time Scorpion - although he doesn't pull enemies to him, he binds them in place. This can stop enemies in their tracks so it's super-useful for holding quick flankers, but it will also ground flying characters, so if you spot a Pharah or a Jetpack Cat hovering over a cliff-edge somewhere: Binding Chain them and they'll fall to their death. Plenty of potential if you have the accuracy to land it.</p><p>Domina, the new tank, is an imposing presence, power-dressed for corporate success with two floating robot arms to accompany her. She's all about barrier shields, but her barriers are a kind we haven't seen before. Hers are made up of hexagonal segments that can be individually blown away, so the whole thing doesn't go down at once, like Reinhardt's, for instance - only parts of it do. Her Ultimate also traps individual enemies <em>inside </em>their own personal shield, then explodes.</p>
<p>The key to getting the most out of Domina will be getting to grips with her laser rifle, which is like a delayed blast railgun. As you shoot it, it charges up to release a final, more powerful blast, meaning you have to stay on your target for a second or so. Some of my opponents during the playtest showed me how devastating this can be when handled well.</p>
<blockquote><em>"The strategy that we would like to go forward with is to find a way to start every year off for Overwatch with a really big, ambitious moment like this" -Aaron Keller</em></blockquote>
<p>The last of the heroes, Emre, doesn't seem exciting on paper. He's very similar to Soldier 76, the run-and-gun character who's a bit of a concession to first-person shooter players. Emre's the same thing - he even brings aim-down-sights to Overwatch for the first time. He has a grenade (a bouncy one) and a sidearm with life-stealing abilities, which temporarily boosts his jump distance and speed. Coupled with a passive that makes his health regen kick in quicker, it means he's a very forgiving kind of hero, a bit of an all-rounder.</p>
<p>But there's potential here. Emre's main weapon is hitscan - meaning your shots will hit a target the moment you shoot - which means he has great damage capability at distance, especially where annoying flying characters are concerned. His Ultimate is also one of the most intimidating I faced during our playtest. Emre shouts out and then turns into a Tron-like AI person, hovers in the air, and fires charged, explosive blasts that can devastate clustered groups.</p><p>There's something to like in all of the heroes, regardless of your playstyle, and the impact of them arriving together in the game will be considerable. We've rarely, if ever, had to shuffle multiple heroes into the pack at once, so there'll be a period of all-change as people think of ways to work them in. And then there will be five more. Just as we settle with these heroes, another one will arrive, and then another, and then another. This can't help but throw game balance out of whack this year, even though Blizzard assures me it has tools to better deal with this these days, but does it matter? Isn't the chaos a large part of the excitement, of the fun?</p>
<h2>Yearly expansions forever more</h2>
<p>As big as this moment is - and Aaron Keller tells me "this is our most ambitious launch that we've ever had for Overwatch", and "the largest year we've ever had" - Blizzard doesn't apparently think of it as a relaunch moment, even if I do. "We think about it more as an expansion moment for the game," Keller says when we talk. But it's not calling them expansions either, confusingly. It's more accurate to think of them as year-long things that begin with a big moment and then progress in several smaller seasons over the course of the year. This year is The Reign of Talon, for example, which will have six seasons within it (roughly one every couple of months, it seems). The important thing to take from this is that each season will be akin to the seasonal Overwatch updates of the past, so the expansion-like drops are on top of that, not in place of that. We're getting significantly more overall with this new way of doing things.</p>
<p>"If you look at the year we're just jumping into, yes, we have this massive moment at the start, and we do want to do something big next year," Keller tells me. "But at the same time, we are releasing a new hero every season this year and it's something we've never done before. So this is, in essence, us really committing to something bigger."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>There are still five more heroes to come this year, as seen here by their silhouettes. </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As suggested there, the plan is to repeat this formula each year, which I suppose brings the game much more in line with World of Warcraft and Diablo, which are also trying to stick to yearly expansion plans with several smaller updates in between. "The strategy that we would like to go forward with is to find a way to start every year off for Overwatch with a really big, ambitious moment like this," Keller says. "Okay, we don't think every one of them is going to be the same. We don't want a cookie cutter template for it, but we would like a moment where everyone can sit up and take notice and be like, 'Wow, look what Overwatch is doing.'"</p><p>But don't expect five new heroes every February. "This isn't something that we're promising to do every year and it's not even something I think that if we had the capability to do it that we would want to do every year," Keller says. So next year it might be a map and mode overhaul, potentially, or something else entirely. "We do want there to be an element of surprise and delight in the way that we put together some of these bigger releases for our players."</p>
<p>And in case you're wondering, these expansion-like releases will be free. "This is just part of the live service for Overwatch," Keller says. And in case you're also wondering, what with all the focus on <em>new</em> heroes, Blizzard isn't forgetting the existing ones. There's a plan to devote a season this year to reworking some of them. "We would love to have a season this year that would be a rework season," Keller says, "and so we're talking about maybe a midpoint to the year where we release multiple hero reworks and map reworks at the same time." As for which ones: "Oh I think we're going to keep that under wraps."</p>
<h2>Story 2.0</h2>
<p>Overwatch has always had lore. Since the beginning, there have been impressive cinematic videos showcasing heroes and their backstories, as well as comics and clue-laden voice-line interactions between characters in the game. But until now most of this has existed <em>outside</em> of the game, on the periphery, whereas in Reign of Talon it's being brought inside, into the foreground, in a narrative viewer part of the game. Stories are also changing to become year-long things with beginnings, middles and climactic ends, rather than occasional dollops that accompany new heroes a few times a year. This has made for a significant developmental change, allowing the designers to plan story arcs further out and go much bigger with them.</p>
<p>The Reign of Talon begins with recently added hero Vendetta slicing off Talon leader Doomfist's iconic cybernetic arm, to take control of the baddie group herself, then enacting, well, The Reign of Talon. This begins with an attack on Watchpoint: Gibraltar, a long-standing map in the game, and what's exciting about this moment is we'll see the in-game consequence of this attack when we play.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Vendetta takes over Talon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Watchpoint: Gibraltar is going to look very different," says Keller during the press conference, "and even play differently." Art director Dion Rogers expands on this in a group interview, saying: "This time it's not just additive where we just placed a couple props around and some fire. Bridges are destroyed, there's new pathways in the map. We've edited the level design to support what's happening in the storyline."</p><p>Rogers goes on, perhaps daydreaming a little: "I can see this happening to a character, too, based on what's going on. They may go through some sort of transformation that would affect their gameplay or maybe gain some temporary new power for a little while. Or even their artwork may change..."</p>
<p>Doomfist would be a brilliant test-case for this approach, with him losing his special arm, but Blizzard isn't ready to go there yet. "This isn't going to signal a change for Doomfist," Keller says. "We're not taking him out of the game. There's not going to be a version without the arm. But I don't think it means that we wouldn't do some of that stuff in the future... I think that when the game feels like it's more connected to the story, it is more powerful that way."</p>
<p>Season 1 of The Reign of Talon will begin the story and in Season 5, "It's all going to come to a head," Keller says. "We're going to have the big climactic finale. And then if this really resonates with players, that means Season 6 of this year is when we start setting up the next story with the newest hero that we developed."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>This is what the faction war event will look like.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But that's not all. There's going to be a five-week faction war between the forces of Overwatch and Talon to really emphasise this, and the alluring part of this is your being able to choose a faction to ally with. Pick a side and complete objective-based missions to earn points for the faction and rewards for yourself. "And at the end of the event," Keller says, "depending on which side wins, we're going to be making some changes in some of our maps in order to reflect which one of those sides won."</p><p>I think this feels like a push from Blizzard to engender a Warcraft-style Horde vs. Alliance sense of factional divide between players in the game, but when I put this to Keller, he seems genuinely surprised. "Oh," he says. "Hey I was on the World of Warcraft team. We had a lot of people on Team 4 [the Overwatch team] that were on the World of Warcraft team. So when we think of something like the Ahn'Qiraj event or something, we have fond memories of that."</p>
<h2>Overwatch as the golden goose of Blizzard going forward</h2>
<p>The clear message of the day is that Blizzard is committed to Overwatch in a big way. "We look at this business as something that will carry Overwatch to the next 10 years," says Walter Kong during the press conference - "that we don't look at it as a sprint, but a marathon." And while some of that could be put down to familiar marketing bluster, there is an underlying sense that Blizzard has dug in and turned things around here, and that, with this new strategy, it's throwing even more at the game going forward. Some of that is sheer Blizzard obstinacy and pride, I'm sure, and a desire to reassert its hero shooter as the dominant one out there. But there's something else going on between the lines here, too, I believe, and it's a sense that Overwatch is being shaped as a super-brand for Blizzard going forward.</p>
<blockquote><em>"It sets us up for a much broader conversation on where the future of this universe and these characters are going to go" -Johanna Faries</em></blockquote>
<p>Listen to Blizzard president Johanna Faries' opening remark from the press conference: "I think there's a vision that Overwatch is a pillar for Blizzard that we believe is a timeless game," she says. "It's not limited to chronology. It's certainly not limited to number structures. And as we think about putting a forever game mindset to this universe, not only for what it is today, but what it can continue to grow to become multiple experiences - this is by no means the capstone of what people should expect from the Overwatch universe in terms of how Blizzard is going to wrap our arms around it. [...] It sets us up for a much broader conversation on where the future of this universe and these characters are going to go."</p>
<p>Add to that Walter Kong's remarks: "We have this wonderful pantheon of heroes. We have the set of values that I think are fairly timeless, that fit today as well as they did 10 years ago - hope and optimism - and we want to be able to tell more stories and set up more experiences within that franchise, but it's something that we're not rushing."</p><p>"Multiple experiences", "tell more stories", "set up more experiences" - those are all indications Blizzard is exploring ways to expand Overwatch, beyond what it's doing now. Are those references to other Overwatch game experiences? Or are they allusions to feature film desires on the team? Riot Games managed to successfully turn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> into a blockbuster animated TV series in Arcane, although it did so at considerable, eye-watering cost. Exactly what Blizzard is exploring, then, I don't know, but it's clear how important Overwatch is to the company. Above all, it's an exciting time to be an Overwatch player, and oh how I've longed to say those words again.</p>
<p><em>This feature comes from a trip to Blizzard's offices in Irvine, California, which Blizzard paid flights and accomodation for.</em></p>

            <p>The <a href="https://evercade.co.uk/">Evercade</a> consoles remain one of the most fascinating pieces of modern hardware on the market. Mainly aimed at collectors, but also welcoming enough so that younger gamers become interested in retro gaming, they blur the line between modern emulation and older original consoles. Now, the king of retro shooters is coming to them: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom">Doom</a> is invading yet another platform.</p>
<p>The gory demon-slaying series somehow hadn't launched on the Evercade consoles yet, but it now seems that Blaze Entertainment has figured out a deal with Xbox-owned ZeniMax and Bethesda just in time for id Software's 35th anniversary.</p>
<p>On 4th February, a short teaser was shared on social media channels and through YouTube. There's not much to it, and it doesn't even confirm how many games will be included in the long-awaited cartridge, but it's a start:</p>

<figure>

<p>Hopefully, "coming in 2026" doesn't mean Evercade owners and Doom fans (often the same) will have to wait until the next <a href="https://quakecon.bethesda.net/">QuakeCon</a> to get a date or shadow drop. And before you ask, nope, you can't preorder this release yet.</p><p>The logical assumption here is that <em>at least</em> Doom 1 &amp; 2 will be part of the hot package, but if they really want to celebrate the series' legacy, the latter re-releases (with extra content) and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-64">Doom 64</a> should be included too. Recent jumbo-sized retro offerings like the extremely rich <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-just-leaked-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollections-release-date">Mortal Kombat Legacy Collection</a> have raised the bar for physical re-releases of olden classics, so we won't be surprised if Doom diehards set their expectations high for this one.</p>

            <p>We're sure we'll be hearing a lot <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-30th-Celebration-Teaser">from The Pokémon Company</a> this year, as the massive franchise is turning 30 this month and already announced a major spinoff in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a>. It's also reasonable to expect news on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">the next generation</a> sooner rather than later, but first, Jigglypuff might show up at this year's Super Bowl. Yes, really.</p>
<p>On 4th February, the official Pokémon social media accounts revealed a "special video" will be shown during the 8th February broadcast, and The Pokémon Company even gave fans a cheeky tease that you can watch below:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Jigglypuff appears to be set to be the star of the show, and while we're low-key hoping for a halftime musical performance of sorts that puts everyone to sleep, the most likely scenario is that we'll get a nostalgic edit that also hypes up the franchise's busy future.</p>
<p>In any case, I personally doubt Nintendo and TPC have chosen to reveal more about the next batch of Pokémon games at the Super Bowl of all places, but I wouldn't rule out a few quick teases and/or winks. That's just speculation on my part, and I invite you all to theorize as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/30th-celebration/">Pokémon Center site</a> has also kicked off a big anniversary promotion with all-new 30th anniversary items presented as the 30th Collection. Pikachu's head shape has been chosen as the main icon for the celebrations, with the number 30 replacing the species' famous red cheeks. Cute!</p>
<p>Though we're still waiting for official updates on what's next for Pokémon on the gaming front past <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive Pokopia, recent weeks have brought us fun little behind-the-scenes tidbits about the making of older Pokémon games like the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-original-pokemon-games-took-lots-of-trial-and-error-to-develop">Red &amp; Green</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-sun-and-moon-ultra-beasts-design-inspiration-confirmed">Sun &amp; Moon</a>.</p>

            <p>A Netease spokesperson has told Eurogamer that statements made by Suda 51 on its generative AI policy are not correct, and that the company continues to work with the technology.</p>
<p>The spokesperson has also pointed to an upcoming GDC talk hosted by Netease covering generative AI."The assertion that NetEase Games has closed an AI department or that we've mandated teams or studios not to use AI is not true," said a representative speaking on behalf of the publisher. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/">Elsewhere</a>, NetEase has offered a comment saying: "The situation described did not occur, and we have not published any related policies".</p>
<p>Suda 51, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-melting-faces-generative-ai-jazz-band">talking to Eurogamer as part of an interview on Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming game Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, stated the following: "They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all."</p>
<p>"I don't know, they never explained directly why," Suda continued. "If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly."</p>

<p>As for Grasshopper's own involvement with generative AI, Suda 51 also stated the company had not done any research into AI, and he believes there's something in the human brain that tells them something is off when they see it.</p><p>Suda told Eurogamer: "At some point there may be this thing I've heard be called the "New Reality", but even if it does get to that point and it's really good and realistic, I feel humans have something in their brain that tells them something is off. So while I don't have a strict opinion either way on people using it in their own games, that's not the way we do it. That's one of the things that bring people to Grasshopper games - they can feel people's efforts themselves. It's something we're proud of.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is about to turn 10 this month and I'm turning to literal dust as I type this sentence. However, that isn't stopping Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) from updating the incredibly successful life/farming sim in big ways.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">quick update</a> on the state of his new game, Haunted Chocolatier, IGN had the opportunity to sit down with Barone to discuss Stardew Valley's past, present, and future. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">full interview</a> is long and deep, a must-read for anyone interested in the hit game, but those looking for an excuse to get back into the cozy grind of this modern indie classic are waiting for news on what's coming with the 1.7 patch, and we thankfully have two biggies to share.</p>
<p>While it's going to be a while before we get a definitive release date and full patch notes, the developer was kind enough to share a couple of nuggets of information even if he wants the update to be a "surprise" for the most part. Think of it as a big 10th birthday gift.</p>
<p>First, following fan noise, he's worked on an upgrade of sorts to the children, who will be "a little more interesting" after the patch arrives. What that entails is currently unknown, but it's not unreasonable to expect a deeper family experience on that front. Players had been saying for the longest time that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/15klpr3/is_there_any_point_to_children/">there was no point to them</a> and they mostly felt like "set dressing" when compared to other social elements in the game, so that's a victory.</p><p>A second update to families will arrive in the form of "two more marriage candidates" that he wasn't ready to reveal yet. You'll have to wait until 26th February to learn about those, and you can start placing your bets now. Will they be new characters or veterans that players have been wanting to romance for ages? Everything's possible.</p>
<p>In any case, it's nice to see Stardew Valley receiving extra love after 10 years that many indie studios would kill for. At this point, it's reminding me of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>'s endless "actually, more patches are happening" state, and you won't be hearing me complain even if the massive game sits barely touched in my Steam library.</p>
