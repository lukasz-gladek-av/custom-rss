            <p>When Microsoft decided to pull the plug on its Perfect Dark reboot earlier this year, we weren't the only ones to be taken by surprise, with Joanna Dark actress Alix Wilton Regan stating she was "absolutely blindsided when the project was defunded".</p>
<p>In fact, Wilton Regan - who has just been announced as the new Lara Croft - said when she was told the project was cancelled, she was "as shocked, surprised, and devastated as everyone else", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">adding she found out at the same time as the rest of us</a>.</p>

<p>"I did not see it coming," Wilton Regan told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/joanna-dark-perfect-dark-reboot-cancellation-details/">TheGamer</a>. "We were basically recording bits and bobs throughout '23. We were also doing lots of performance capture for it in '24, and we were even recording more stuff for it in '25. To my knowledge, we were pretty far along. I'd done entire chapters of this universe."</p>
<p>According to the actress - who has also had roles in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Dragon Age and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name just three - the Perfect Dark reboot had "delivered several milestones that the client was really happy with", though she was unsure how far along The Initiative was in terms of the game's overall development.</p><p>"It was devastating. So many people lost their jobs. An entire workforce was disbanded," Wilton Regan continued. "There was an ecosystem of creativity and collaboration that was in place that we lost overnight. It was really difficult, really difficult for everybody."</p>
<p>For a little while after its cancellation, those close to the project hoped it may survive. Back in September, it was reported the reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two. Allegedly, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-almost-saved-by-rockstar-owner-take-two">plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself</a>. However, it did not.</p>
<p>"That was the day I was really sad because that was the day I lost hope," Wilton Regan said. "Initially, when it made it to the press that Perfect Dark was being defunded, a lot of people reached out for comments about it, both in the media, as well as personally, friends, and professionally, colleagues.</p>
<p>"I couldn't say too much about it because I knew The Initiative was in talks to keep Perfect Dark up and running in some shape or form. Possibly a slimmed-down version, possibly something slightly different. But certainly, everyone was working really hard behind the scenes to bring Perfect Dark back. And then one day, I heard from the creative director that the deal hadn't gone through, and that really everything had fallen apart, and production was fully stopping."</p><p>Wilton Regan said Perfect Dark's shock cancellation was like nothing she had experienced in her career to date. "And I guess now that I know that it can happen, you become really frightened that the same thing could happen again," she admitted.</p>
<p>While losing the role of Joanna Dark was understandably devastating for Wilton Regan, the actress was able to move her focus to other projects, notably as Lara Croft in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>, which she called her "saving grace". But, there are clearly still some scars leftover from Perfect Dark's cancellation, and Wilton Regan admitted she is "frightened about losing Lara" like she lost Joanna.</p>
<p>"I was playing Joanna over here, and I was playing Lara over here, which was wonderful and genuinely one of the most creatively exciting times of my life," Wilton Regan closed. "And I just felt so relieved that I still had Lara, but I also felt really frightened about losing Lara. I'm still frightened of losing Lara." Let's all hope that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>Wilton Regan is taking over the role of Lara Croft from Camilla Luddington, who played the globe-trotting Tomb Raider lead in the rebooted Survivor trilogy. Wilton Regan's first outing as Lara will arrive next year, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. She will then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">reprise the role in 2027's Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>, which will take Lara to Northern India.</p>
<p>Last weekend, Luddington <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">shared a farewell post to the character she had embodied for 10 years</a>, writing: "The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Acclaimed LGBTQ+ developer Robert Yang has released another explicit game, this time a commentary on fishing for dates.</p>
<p>Rainbows Are Carnivores is a gay fishing and "aquaculture romance" game, in which a hunky fisherman fishes for nude men in the sea. Or, as Yang puts it in the <a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2025/12/rainbows.html">game's accompanying blog</a>, it's a game about "using your pole to catch some high quality hogs". Hog, incidentally, is angler slang for a big fish.</p>
<p>Yang has released plenty of controversial games, but is perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robert-yangs-the-tearoom-appeals-to-censors-by-swapping-cocks-for-glocks">best known for The Tearoom</a>: a commentary on '60s sodomy laws and video game censorship, in which men stand at urinals with guns for penises, while avoiding undercover cops.</p>

<p>Rainbows Are Carnivores instead includes full frontal male nudity. It's a <a href="https://radiatoryang.itch.io/rainbows">free web-based game on itch.io</a>, with the "fisherman daddy" grading his catches until finding the perfect mate - though it doesn't quite work out how you might expect.</p>
<p>As well as a commentary on modern day dating, the game is a homoerotic play on male stereotypes, as well as criticism of overfishing. As Yang puts it: "There's never been fewer fish in the sea (so far)."</p>
<p>The game is also inspired by French film Stranger By The Lake (2013), which "artfully mixes sex and violence", explained Yang. Here, Yang portrays overfishing as its own type of violence.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a commentary on dating and romance in the app era," said Yang. "If we are the 'plenty of fish in the sea', we're also using technology to overfish ourselves - industrialising romance just like we've industrialised fishing, with diminishing returns. Dating pools enclosed by dating apps are like artificially abundant lakes where most relationships die off by the end of the season like farmed trout."</p>
<p>If you've ever attempted dating apps, you'll surely sympathise with that sentiment.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Yang announced his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-controversial-and-explicit-projects-robert-yangs-next-game-is-a-sportslike-rugby-turn-based-rpg">forthcoming sports RPG Tryhard</a>. Set in New Zealand, players will manage an underdog rugby club, combining management sim elements and turn-based gameplay. Presumably, there'll be some sex too owing to Yang's oeuvre, though Tryhard is looking decidedly tamer than his previous work.</p>

            <p>Falcom, creator of the Trails in the Sky and Y's series, has revealed during a recent shareholder presentation it has begun using AI during game development, stating they are proceeding "cautiously", but that it's been used in the early stages of development nonetheless.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Umisuika/status/2001526978164539420#m">As reported by Umisuika on X</a>, attending the shareholders meeting in-person, a Falcom representative stated: "We are proceeding cautiously due to legal issues. We are using AI to brainstorm scenarios and do research. What used to take 2-3 hours can now be completed in 10 minutes. AI is also used to correct typos in the scenario."</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this is a rough translation from Japanese to English using Google's in-built browser tools, and therefore the intricacies of this statement could be off. Even so, it is seemingly a confirmation that Falcom is integrating AI into its workflow.</p>

<p>It is no secret that Japanese video game companies have started embracing AI en masse. At Tokyo Game Show this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of polled developers acknowledged that AI has been used in game development</a>. Sega has stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">it'll start using AI "appropriately" in spite of pushback</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">Square Enix wants AI to do 70 percent of its QA by 2027</a>.</p><p>It is far from a topic isolated to Eastern game development though. Only this week, the CEO of Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">met firm backlash following an interview in which he revealed that AI was being used at his studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">acting unions continue to stand firm against the technology and the dangers it poses to the people they represent</a>.</p>

            <p>The first episode of Fallout's second season debuted yesterday, and within its hour or so run time solved one of the biggest cut content mysteries from New Vegas, which had been left unanswered for 15 years.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Fallout season two episode one below.</strong></p>

<p>Along with introducing some new faces, the second season of Fallout also reunites us with the likes of Lucy and The Ghoul, who left together at the end of season one on the trail of disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean. Hank, meanwhile, was last seen fleeing towards a ruined New Vegas in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour.</p>
<p>And, that brings us to the first episode of season two, with Lucy and The Ghoul following the bloody trail Hank has left in his wake. This includes a little stop off at Vault 24, a cut location from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. We only know about this place because players discovered a Vault 24 jumpsuit tucked away in New Vegas' game files, which could only be found using console commands</p><p>Now, as I am sure you are aware if you have read this far, many of the vaults in Fallout - both the show and the games - were set up to conduct experiments and such within. This has included the TV show's Vault 4, which experimented with mutants, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s Vault 63, which was set up by Vault-Tec's Hugo Stolz and his wife as a research facility for various technologies that would help with setting up post-War societies. There was also that poor chap that got put into Vault 77 totally on his own save for some puppets.</p>
<p>So, what was tucked away in Fallout: New Vegas' Vault 24? For a long time it seemed likely we would never know, but, thanks to Amazon's show, we now have an answer. And that answer is… communists! When Lucy and The Ghoul step into the vault, which is now derelict and covered in vegetation, they come across skeletons strapped down in front of a propaganda video, which when they were alive would have been brainwashing the poor chaps.</p>
<p>These aren't the only skeletons that were left to rot in the vault. Lucy and The Ghoul find many more strapped down within Vault 24, with pseudo-Soviet gear about the place. "These are Americans," Lucy realises, "and the Vault turned them into communists."</p>
<p>This seems like a pretty odd thing for the Vault-Tec heads to have done, but to be fair, when did they ever do anything that couldn't be labelled as pretty odd? (Again, that poor man with the puppets). On further exploration, Lucy and The Ghoul come across someone alive down there. A Wastelander with a chip in his head like the one House used at the start of the episode, which allowed him to control a goon's mind, is sitting strapped down and clearly not of sound mind.</p><p>This mind controlling chip is what Hank went into the vault to get a hold of, though it still needs some work to perfect, as so far the only people we have seen with the chips in their heads have not lived very long… that's probably a plot thread for another episode.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. After 15 years, we now know what's in Vault 24.</p>

<p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout is releasing on a weekly basis, with the final episode airing in February of next year.</p>
<p>The team is already hard at work on season three, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">with the next series being written as we speak</a>. Filming is then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">expected to begin in summer 2026</a>, Fallout series executive producer Jonathan Nolan said earlier this month.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was the best-selling premium game in November, beating out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, NBA 2K26, and other big hitters.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4njxoc2w">This data comes via Matt Piscatella</a>, senior director at sales data company Circana. Releasing the findings on social media, Piscatella highlighted Black Ops 7's strong performance in spite of the game's mixed reception from fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>By hitting the number one spot in November in terms of combined physical and digital sales, the series has earned the number one sales spot in its launch month for 18 years in a row. It is worth noting that the other games present in November's top five best-sellers had their own launches in prior months.</p>

<p>As for other games that launched in November, Kirby Air Riders landed at the number 10 spot, though digital sales were not factored in its placement. The same is true of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which secured a spot at number 11.  Interestingly enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> was the 18th best-selling game last month, over a decade since its initial release.</p><p>In spite of this relatively positive performance in its release month, Call of Duty as a franchise <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">will be undoing some significant changes as Black Ops 7 had "not met" expectations from fans</a>. Specifically, there will no longer be back-to-back Modern Warfare or Black Ops releases moving forward.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to try the game out yet,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review"> Eurogamer's Black Ops 7 review noted</a>: "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>

            <p>The next FIFA game will be exclusive to Netflix Games, and will arrive in time for next year's FIFA World Cup 2026. It will be the first official FIFA game in four years.</p>
<p>Netflix subscribers will be able to access the game on their TV, using a phone as a controller, and play either solo or with others online.</p>
<p>The game will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive - a studio yet to actually release a game, though its website states it's also working on 007 First Light with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>.</p>

<p>"The FIFA World Cup is going to be the cultural event of 2026, and now fans will be able to celebrate their fandom by bringing the game right into their living rooms," said Alain Tascan, president of games at Netflix. "We want to bring football back to its roots with something everyone can play with just the touch of a button."</p><p>Added FIFA president Gianni Infantino: "FIFA is very excited to team up with Netflix Games and Delphi Interactive ahead of the FIFA World Cup 2026. This major collaboration is a key milestone in FIFA's commitment to innovation in the football gaming space, which aspires to reach billions of football fans of all ages everywhere in the world and will be redefining the pure notion of simulation games. Our reimagined game truly marks the beginning of a new era of digital football. It will be available for free to Netflix members and is a great historic step for FIFA."</p>
<p>Note that this World Cup game will be available on "select TVs in certain countries" (details on the <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197">Netflix site</a>), but there are plans to roll it out further over time.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">EA ditched the FIFA brand after almost 30 years of officially licensed games</a>. Since then, it's continued with its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-really-wants-you-to-know-it-listened-to-fan-feedback-in-creating-ea-sports-fc-26-as-gameplay-reveal-addresses-critics">EA Sports FC</a> series.</p>
<p>FIFA, by contrast, has floundered in attempting to maintain its brand within the games industry, with no new  games since 2022. Back in October it announced the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fifa-lives-on-in-a-mascot-focused-five-a-side-football-game-coming-next-year">mascot-focused game FIFA Heroes</a> (see video above), and now this World Cup game with Netflix.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Santa Ragione's Horses was the subject of multiple headlines ahead of its release as Steam - one of if not the biggest digital PC storefronts - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">refused to distribute the game</a>. Then, just before its release, it was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">banned from the Epic storefront</a>. This all put the studio into jeopardy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">with founder Pietro Righi Riva telling Eurogamer it could face closure if Horses didn't sell well</a>.</p>
<p>Horses has now been out for a couple of weeks, and there is finally some good news for Santa Ragione. The studio has announced its game, in which players tend to a farm of naked humans in horse masks, has sold over 18k copies. In terms of income, that is "approximately $65,000 in net revenue", Santa Ragione said. This means the studio has generated enough to repay the loans it took out in order to finish developing the game, as well as the royalties owed to Horses creator Andrea Lucco Borlera.</p>
<p>"We are extremely grateful to players and to everyone who supported the release by sharing the game and amplifying what happened around it. Paying our debts is a success, and we are relieved," the studio said.</p>

<p>However, while of course great news for the team, this still isn't enough to secure Santa Ragione's future, and the company has not yet made enough from Horses to begin working on a new game. "If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime," the studio explained today. "Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love."</p><p>So, while the debut of Horses has "been meaningful and positive in important ways", the fragmented road to release - which along with Steam's controversial ban has also included delays, and key team members taking on additional work elsewhere - has still been damaging for the studio.</p>
<p>"While the launch of Horses compares very favourably to our most recent launches on Steam, Steam's economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles," Santa Ragione said. "These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like."</p>

<p>Santa Ragione closed today's news by taking aim at Valve, which faced 'censorship' criticisms from developers and players following its decision to not distribute Horses on Steam. Santa Ragione is still unsure of the exact specific reason that Valve decided to eschew Horses.</p>
<p>"We want to emphasise that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce," Santa Ragione said.</p>
<p>"For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly.</p>
<p>"We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases."</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-cursed-horror-game-horses-in-which-you-tend-to-a-farm-of-naked-humans-in-horse-masks-hasnt-been-cancelled">though this was delayed into 2025</a>, before it finally released in November.</p>
<p>"Santa Ragione delivers a subversive, sometimes shocking, often funny first-person narrative horror that, while perhaps a little insubstantial, remains an engagingly unconventional exploration of some timely themes," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">Eurogamer's four star Horses review</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> have ended their lawsuit over the "Horizon clone" Light of Motiram, following a confidential settlement.</p>
<p>Further, Light of Motiram has been delisted on all store pages, so is no longer available on either Steam or Epic. The amount of the settlement is unknown.</p>
<p>"All pending motions are withdrawn and this action is hereby dismissed with prejudice. All parties shall bear their own fees and costs," reads a statement from the court document (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-settlement-delisted/">The Game Post</a>).</p>

<p>With the dismissal with prejudice, the case is now closed and cannot be brought back to court.</p>
<p>While the store pages have been removed, the Light of Motriam website, Discord and social pages still exist, so it hasn't been entirely wiped from the internet. It suggests the game could still come back in some form, though presumably with major changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent first revealed Light of Motiram</a> in November last year, which immediately drew comparison to Sony's first-party Horizon franchise.</p>
<p>Then, in July this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony sued Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">Tencent retaliated by saying Sony's claims of originality were "startling"</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony shot back claiming the Chinese company's defence was "nonsense"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-alleged-horizon-rip-off-is-ironically-back-in-the-news-as-company-agrees-to-halt-promotion-amid-sony-lawsuit">Tencent agreed to halt all promotion and public testing</a> of the game as the two companies prepared for a court battle. Now that will no longer be necessary, owing to this confidential settlement.</p>

            <p>The Game Awards has broken its 2024 viewership record, bringing in roughly 171m livestream broadcasts earlier this month. This is an increase of 17m views compared to last year's show.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/game-awards-2025-viewing-record-livestreams-worldwide-1236611146/">Via a report by Variety</a>, this 11 percent rise in viewers does not take into account those checking out the show on Amazon Prime Video, which offered a platform for the awards show for the first time this year. What views can be measured stem from YouTube, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram Live, as well as regional streaming services in China and India.</p>
<p><a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/thegameawards">According to Streamcharts</a>, Western platforms saw a 9 percent increase from last year's show, to a peak concurrent figure of 4.4 million live viewers. This record breaking figure is reflected on platform-specific milestones too, with YouTube and Twitch seeing significant leaps from last year's viewership statistics.</p>

<p>Co-streaming also saw an increase on Twitch, with 16,500 streamers on the platform experiencing the show alongside their fans. This was an astounding 50 percent increase from last year's figure, further cementing the show as an annual keystone within the games industry.</p><p>To compare, The Oscars (which still remains a television broadcast due to a deal with ABC) <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/oscars-moving-to-youtube#:~:text=The%202025%20broadcast%20hit%20around,were%20before%20the%202020%20pandemic.">only had 19.7 million viewers this year</a>. With that show looking to jump to YouTube in 2029 when their current broadcasting deal expires, for now at least the event, which has clearly inspired The Game Awards to an extent, seems to have been overshadowed in terms of pure eyeballs-on-screen statistics.

<p>Why does The Game Awards see increasing views year-on-year? Well, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">all the reveal trailers announced at The Game Awards</a> which continue to draw eyes even from those generally uninterested in the awards themselves. For those more invested, talk around an Expedition 33 sweep was a real discussion-driver, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">as the French RPG took home a whopping nine awards in total from the Peacock Theatre</a>.</p>

            <p>Fallout 5 will be canon to the events that happen in Amazon's TV adaptation of Bethesda's video games.</p>
<p>That's coming from the studio's very own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, who when asked directly if the Fallout TV series - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-gets-new-release-date-and-you-can-now-watch-it-imminently">which just started its second season over on Prime</a> - would have an impact on the next mainline game entry, replied: "In short, yes."</p>

<p>"Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening," <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo">Howard told BBC Newsbeat</a> ahead of the second season's debut.</p>
<p>"We are taking that into account," the Bethesda executive affirmed.</p>
<p>We are still several years away from Fallout 5 actually materialising, though. Along with its post-apocalyptic franchise, the studio also has The Elder Scrolls series under its umbrella (Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, nearly forgot about that one!). Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">Howard confirmed that Fallout 5 would be Bethesda's next game after The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, which still lacks any solid release window, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">though some fans think it is coming in 2027</a>. Even so, that is hardly imminent, though I am still alarmed by how fast the new year is actually approaching, which makes me feel like I'm turning into my mother because that's the sort of thing she always says.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">Howard said development on Elder Scrolls 6 is "progressing really well"</a>. He also admitted he wished things were progressing a bit quicker than they are, but it is a process the team all wants to get right, so fair enough.</p>
<p>As for Amazon's Fallout series, its second season is releasing on a weekly basis, with the final episode being aired in February of next year. The team is already hard at work on season three, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">with the next series being written as we speak</a>. Filming is then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">expected to begin in summer 2026</a>, Fallout series executive producer Jonathan Nolan said earlier this month.</p>

            <p>A new 2D competitive platformer has just been announced, and it's coming from the same team behind an indie darling from back in 2016. Almost a decade later, the creators of SpeedRunners are back with another speedy release: Sprint City.</p>
<p>Instead of being split across several different levels like SpeedRunners was, Sprint City takes place in one single shared world that seamlessly connects nearby players. While in a party, you and your gaggle of friends will stay connected as you explore and track down challenges to take on.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if one of your friends owns Sprint City, you can join their game via your internet browser of choice and jump in to play for free. The game itself will be available on Steam in 2026, though no exact release date nor price has been revealed yet.</p>

<p>Game designer and co-owner at Second Stage Studio Casper van Est has stated: "With Sprint City, we wanted to focus on what we love most in games and what we're best at, which is pure movement. It's a shared world multiplayer experience built around how good it can feel just to move around, so we worked really hard on a satisfying game feel and a visual style that never gets in the way of that."</p><p>The original SpeedRunners also took a consumer-friendly approach to onboarding,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedrunners-will-be-free-upon-its-final-release"> initially offering the game for free on Steam</a> and only charging a premium price for those who wanted to play the game online. It proved exceptionally popular on Steam Early Access a decade or so ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/speedrunners-has-sold-600k-copies-on-steam-early-access">selling 600k copies in short order</a>.</p>

            <p>"I won't claim to be a gamer, but I was aware, broadly, of some of the concepts present in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>," Tom Morello - singer, songwriter and political activist, and Rage Against the Machine guitarist - tells me when I ask him if he was aware of the political themes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-preview">Final Fantasy 14</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-out-on-ps4-april-2014">Since its (re)release in 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">FF14</a> has tackled issues such as anti-colonialism, class struggle, and nationalism, extolling the virtues of active resistance, open rebellion, and pushing back against the established status quo in order to defend the rights and liberties of all people.</p>
<p>It makes sense, then, that Tom Morello is getting involved with the game. Morello has collected a lot of labels in his time - anarchist, warrior-poet, human rights activist - and to me it feels fitting he's penned a song that'll live in a world as politically dense as Final Fantasy 14. The track, with the rousing title Everything Burns, is a high-octane rock belter instantly recognisable to anyone that's even vaguely familair with Morello's music (and fitting for the increasingly rock-focused way FF14 has been moving over the past few years).</p>

<p>"I'm not trying to make songs for video games," he tells me."Like, that's not the thing that I get up in the morning and think. I want to be a part of making great songs that have meaningful content, that find their way into the world in meaningful ways. And in collaborating with Caleb and with the producer Tyler Smith, we made a song that checked all the boxes for me.</p><p>"One, it's a banger. It's got riffs like crazy. It's a compelling artistic work that we hope was going to integrate well into the compositions of Final Fantasy. But, two, to me, it has to exist outside the game, as well. It has to be a song that has sort of depth and meaning and meets the moment of 2025 at this crazy political crossroads that the world is in.</p>
<p>"For me, Everything Burns is both a reflection of the world that we're seeing and a warning, irrespective of anyone touching a controller, or a computer, or playing a game. This is a song that has a life - a very vibrant life - within the game. And my hope is that it has a very meaningful and vibrant life outside of the game as well."</p>

<figcaption>Tom Morello and Caleb Schomo. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"I could not agree more," agrees Caleb Shomo, lead vocalist and studio instrumentalist for the band Beartooth. Previously in the interview, we'd chatted about how Rage Against the Machine's music had radicalised a whole swathe of youths in the 90s (myself included), and that now, by appearing in a game built around a loyal and vocal community like FF14, Morello and his collaborators have the opportunity to do that again for a wholly different audience. "Like yourself, obviously I was incredibly influenced in my life by Tom and what happens when you get obsessed with that band and what it teaches you, and who you become and what you stand for," Shomo continues.</p>
<p>"And to be able to work on a song like this with somebody like Tom… I think the nature of the beast is there's no way I'm going to be able to do that - to have it come from my heart - and not mean <em>something</em>.</p><p>"For me, I think I've kind of had a hard time in my life standing up for myself. And that has a lot of what this song has to do at this period of time. Because I think that can be the nature of the beast when a climate gets this gnarly. And obviously it has its twists and turns, sure, but that really is what this song to me is about: the song is about empowerment.  Like, to the absolute furthest degree. And for it to have come around in the way it has, with so much horsepower, between it being with Tom Morello and in it being in Final Fantasy 14, yeah, the nature of the beast was it was just going to mean <em>something</em>. It's from deep in the heart."</p>
<p>"And that's the trick, isn't it? I mean, the vehicle is important," Morello adds, "but Rage Against the Machine isn't a great <em>political band</em>. Rage Against the Machine is a<em> great band</em> that has <em>political </em>context. And so you are engaged with the music, the powerful music and the beats and the rhythm section and the aggression, the guitar solos, etc. And then you're forced to be confronted with a set of ideas, right? I've made 22 records and that's the through line: you have songs that are compelling and then because they're about something, it matters to people here. The vehicle is this banging track that we've made. The vehicle is Caleb's compelling vocal performance and the big guitar riffs. The vehicle is Final Fantasy 14, where it's a crossover of a song that meets a particular historical moment <em>outside </em>of the game, that also meets a particular narrative moment <em>within </em>the game."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Masayoshi Soken. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The song actually came together really quickly. Morello plays tabletop role-playing games with Jason Charles Miller, who you may know as lead vocalist and guitarist of the industrial rock band Godhead and from various appearances on the FF14 Endwalker soundtrack, and he told Morello that Soken is a massive fan of Rage Against the Machine. "[Jason and I] played together, and he learned about Soken's love of my riffs and Rage Against the Machine, and it got in the ether. Then all of a sudden, I remember getting a message that there was the [FF14 team] needed a song in the next 36 hours. This is about a year ago, right? And so I was working with producer Tyler Smith - who produces a lot of great rock and metal songs these days - and I said, 'bro, like, let's go', and we turned around a musical track very fast."</p><p>Shomo was, fortunately, off that very same day. "Literally. That same day, I was off," he laughs. "And I just happened to get a phone call from Tyler Smith saying, 'hey, you want to do this song for Tom Morello?' And I was like, 'uh, yeah, I can be available' [laughter]. A few hours later, I don't know, man, I just kind of ascended to some ethereal plane, and then a few hours later, I was bouncing down tracks and sent it to Tyler. It was insane, to say the least."</p>
<p>Morello continues: "It was lightning in a bottle. Had the circumstance not arisen on that particular day, it might have gone in a very different direction."</p>
<p>For Masayoshi Soken, long-time Rage Against the Machine fan and lead composer for Final Fantasy 14, the experience has been humbling. "I'm pretty close to death right now," he laughs. "We've been doing a lot of interviews, and he has a different, cool Rage Against the Machine shirt every time we join a call," adds Morello.</p>
<p>It's clear to see, from listening to Everything Burns and talking to the collaborators for 20 minutes, this is more than just some thoughtless tie-in fired off for publicity. For everyone involved, this is a labour of love, and a collaboration that is designed to reflect both real-world and in-game sensibilities, from creators that do not compromise on their creative vision, no matter what the vehicle is for delivery. This is a crossover that makes more sense, the more I think about it, and I cannot wait to experience the full impact of the release in Final Fantasy 14's latest raid.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Arkane Studios' Harvey Smith has reflected on Microsoft's closure of the studio last year, describing it as "a shock" after its run of successes.</p>
<p>Smith was lead game designer on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> in 2000, before eventually joining Arkane in 2008. After working as co-creative director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>, he worked on its sequel, Prey, and the studio's final, ill-fated live-service game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/redfall">Redfall</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">studio was shut down by Microsoft in May last year</a>, following the poor sales of Redfall.</p>
<p>"Every company makes the decisions they make for the reason they make them," said Smith  on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/harvey-smith-game-director-deus-ex-dishonored-redfall">My Perfect Console podcast</a>. "I don't agree with them often, but the main shock there was this studio made Dishonored, along with the Lyon studio, and then they made Prey. Then we were working on Redfall for a number of years during the pandemic and everything else. The industry exploring games-as-a-service games... It is what it is. Creative efforts are unpredictable."</p>

<p>He continued: "It was a shock at first, but who I really felt for were the people who were new, this was their first project or they'd only been in the industry for a while."</p>
<p>Smith admitted his own privilege with the situation considering his years of experience and the ups and downs he's worked through, but lamented the loss of junior staff through studio closures and layoffs for whom developing the game was a "mind-blowing experience".</p>
<p>"It was a shock," he said. "It was not a decision I agreed with. I did believe very much in the future of the studio, we were working on something super cool."</p>
<p>At least, the studio was able to release its 1.4 update to Redfall after the announcement of its closure, what Smith described as a "huge upgrade to the game". "If we had launched with that and then built from there it might have been a different story," he said, adding the update allowed the team to get "as close as we could" to the vision of the game.</p>
<p>Smith also discussed the difficulties of receiving feedback from players online, which perhaps led to the downfall of Redfall and the studio - particularly the "vitriol" on social media.</p>
<p>"I feel like video game developers get it worse," he said, comparing the reaction to games to that of artists or musicians. "You release your game, it took years to get there, maybe it flops, maybe it does ok, maybe people hate it. Even if they love it, there's a social media caustic, acidic vitriol that gets thrown at you. And every time you ship a game there's always going to be that, every time there's that vitriol no matter what you do. Then you hope that the number of people who love it swamp that, overwhelm it."</p>
<p>Before Dishonored, Smith said he worked on a couple of games at Arkane that never saw the light of day. One of those was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> game, which certainly would've suited him well after Deus Ex.</p>
<p>"We were working for a while on a Blade Runner game, which was super exciting to me. What we could have done with Blade Runner…," he said, before tailing off. Alas, perhaps we'll never know.</p>
<p>After Redfall's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-apologises-for-redfalls-disastrous-launch-we-let-a-lot-of-people-down-this-week">Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer apologised for its disastrous launch</a>. "We let a lot of people down this week," he said.</p>
<p>"Arkane's vampire thriller is muddled and deeply compromised, but has moments of real charm," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-review-a-bit-of-a-mess-but-not-without-its-pleasures">Redfall review</a>.</p>

<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 17/12/25: </strong>AdHoc's superhero workplace comedy Dispatch has appeared rather unexpectedly on the Australian Nintendo eShop for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>According to the listings, Dispatch will be available on Switch consoles from 29th January, but can be pre-ordered now for $39.55 AUS.</p>

<p>I have just checked the eShop here in the UK, and at the time of writing Dispatch is not appearing in any of the search results. Rather, the main result was for SnowRunner - Season 5: Build &amp; Dispatch. The second result was for a game that places you in the role of an airport dispatcher (see image below).</p>
<p>It's a different story over on the Australian site, though, which currently states the Switch 2 edition of AdHoc's acclaimed Dispatch will include "enhanced resolution and improved frame rates" on its release.</p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie recently sat down with AdHoc studio co-founders Nick Herman and Pierre Shorette to discuss the team's episodic superhero comedy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">which includes the story of a cut Dispatch Kpop character</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



  


            <p>Can there really be an ethical use of AI when it comes to actors in video games? Developers are increasingly experimenting with the technology, but what does that mean for the profession of voice acting?</p>
<p>Lobbying against the practice was certainly a key part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-approves-2025-video-game-agreement-officially-concluding-its-strike">SAG-AFTRA strike that finally concluded in the summer</a>, with the new contract ensuring "safety guardrails" around AI technology. Yet while this agreement is meant to protect the livelihoods of actors, AI remains in use to voice some video game characters. Just earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">Let it Die: Inferno developer Supertrick Games admitted generative AI had been used</a> for two character voices as a deliberate, creative choice. It claimed these voices "are not derived from or modeled after any human performers, ensuring no copyright concerns", though presumably these voices still came from somewhere.</p>
<p>The most high profile recent example was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, criticised in Eurogamer's review for its use of AI voices. Embark Studios has been open about its use of AI in game development, and its previous game The Finals also utilised AI voices. For Arc Raiders, human actors trained an AI text-to-speech tool utilised for incidental NPC dialogue (but not key story points). Those actors reportedly gave consent and were paid accordingly. But despite its ancillary usage, does this set a worrying precedent the rest of the industry could follow?</p>

</figure>
<p>I wanted to understand the varying perspectives on this controversial practice, to understand more about the financial and ethical concerns of AI usage. As such, I've spoken to unions, studios, and - of course - actors on how AI is impacting the future of voice acting.</p><p>But first, why did Embark Studios choose to use AI in the first place? The studio did not respond to Eurogamer's request for comment, but ahead of the release of Arc Raiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-no-shortcut-to-making-great-games-embark-studios-cco-responds-to-and-defends-ai-use-in-arc-raiders">CCO Stefan Strandberg previously explained to Eurogamer</a> how the studio intends to be on the "forefront of emerging technologies".</p>
<p>On text-to-speech, Strandberg discussed the use of real actors. "There's something special and dynamic about putting two people together that to me, being a sound designer originally, there's nothing that can replace that in my opinion," he said. "TTS allows us to increase the scope of the game in some areas where we think it's needed, or where there's tedious repetition, in situations where the voice actors may not see it as valuable work. So it's a wide umbrella, but the experience of the game doesn't use any generative AI."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Embark used AI for some NPC voicelines in Arc Raiders. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Embark</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The use of such technology has helped Embark Studios remain a lean team, and allowed them to quickly add or alter voice lines without the need to re-record. But as Strandberg surmised: "There are no shortcuts to making great games. You need so many things in place: a clear vision, a great culture, clear goals. The vision will inform how you get there."</p>
<p>Still, text-to-speech is a form of AI that may be based on human voices, but the final result is, arguably, not human, devoid of the nuance a human actor can provide through proper performance.</p>
<p>One general assumption is that the use of this sort of AI technology is cheaper than hiring voice actors for full voice work, allowing studios to save money. Yet voice actors are already severely underpaid for their work, and US actors' union SAG-AFTRA is fighting not only for better contracts but to ensure actors are equally remunerated when AI is involved.</p><p>The union's current standard rates, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-2028%20Interactive%20Media%20Agreement%20Wage%20Table.pdf">published publicly</a>, are $1,135 for an off-camera day performer of up to three voices, or $567.50 for one voice. Additional fees can be applied, including if a role requires full motion capture, plus some actors can of course negotiate higher fees - this is just a union recommended minimum.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, the union's national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland confirms SAG-AFTRA's agreement requires actors be paid on an equivalent basis for digitally replicated voices. What's more, the union specifically bargained over real-time generation of voices using digital replicas, resulting in a minimum negotiable rate of 750 percent of scale (that would be $8,512.50 based on the $1,135 fee). As such, AI voices are perhaps more likely to be implemented for creative reasons, or speed of development, rather than financial concerns.</p>
<p>"None of this can or should be done without the consent of the performer, and we've established that firmly in our collective bargaining agreements, and frankly, outside of our bargaining agreements," says Crabtree-Ireland. "We've been working hard to get that principle established in the law, so that even in non-union settings, that minimum standard is present."</p>
<blockquote>"None of this can or should be done without the consent of the performer."</blockquote>
<p>He continues: "Our long term goal is to make sure that there's a clear respect for people's right to control the use of their image, likeness and voice for purposes of any kind of replication, especially AI. And I think we will ultimately achieve that, notwithstanding the AI regulation skittishness that some governments have, because we're not talking about regulating AI. What we're talking about is giving people the right to control the use of their image, likeness and voice."</p><p>Here in the UK, actors' union Equity also has <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/advice-and-support/rates-and-agreements?categoryId=2462&amp;areaOfWorkId=2466&amp;productionTypeId=40018&amp;tabId=null">recommended rates</a>, though these are published only to members. "It's usually the case that games companies don't engage performers directly, but contract studios who own recording spaces and equipment, and who in turn engage performers," Equity audio official Shannon Sailing explains to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"As there are no union agreements with games companies (via studios) in the UK to set minimum standards for performance work in games, the rates vary across the board. This is wrong. It's the workers - including performers - who are at the heart of creating a game, and they deserve proper pay, terms and conditions set by a union agreement."</p>
<p>The use of AI "leads to a subpar experience for gamers," Sailing adds. "No machine can capture the authenticity or emotion of a human voice actor." Still, the union understands the use of this technology won't disappear anytime soon. As such, it urges for consent, transparency, and proper remuneration for actors.</p>
<blockquote>"No machine can capture the authenticity or emotion of a human voice actor."</blockquote>
<p>What, then, of recording studios? Is AI impacting their work?</p>
<p>"I think it would be very naïve to say that AI voice isn't going to have an impact on the amount of work available to actors, but studios big and small are faced with the same dilemma every year: do more with less," says Chris Donnelly, director of audio and datasets at <a href="https://side.inc/projects">Side UK</a> - the studio behind the award-winning voicework in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Still Wakes The Deep, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, and many more.</p><p>"As creatives, we have to ensure that the call for ethical practices, strong guardrails and robust legislation is heard, as well as the financial arguments. That means fair remuneration for the actors and full transparency of how the model will be used, delivering clear and practical benefits for game developers that result in high-quality performances that gamers rightfully expect."</p>

</figure>
<p>Side is currently setting up a global committee to support client requests for AI content across its business, Donnelly explains, and the studio already has a "human in the loop" policy for any AI-related requests. "Our overall hope is that using these technologies in an ethical way, will mean that opportunities expand, adding additional depth and immersiveness to games on top of what might have been done historically," Donnelly says.</p>
<p>He admits the use of AI is "inevitable" to keep up with the demands of players for immersive experiences with thousands of realistic, dynamic NPCs, something that simply isn't possible to record using traditional methods. "Having said that," says Donnelly, "technological progress is complicated and for Side as an audio studio, we know that this is going to change the way we work. What I do feel absolutely certain of, is that AI voices or not, artists, actors and storytellers will all still be needed to make games happen."</p><p>While unions and studios are fighting for regulation and ethical practices, it's actors themselves who must suffer the human cost of increased AI voice usage. Ultimately, perhaps, it's down to them to choose whether or not to accept contracts with AI clauses included, though if the practice grows will they even have a choice?</p>
<p>"I see why devs and publishers are tempted by new models that let them change the scope of the narrative with a few keystrokes," says David Menkin (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>). "I also get why actors are tempted by a paycheck. But when creative labour becomes data, a performance can easily stop being something interpreted and start being automated."</p>
<p>Menkin says AI must be used ethically to support and not exploit creatives. "Contracts are rarely written in favour of those at the coalface and it won't take much for this new type of tech to be abused," he says. Regulation is needed, but despite performers pushing back via unions, "nothing will effectively change without government or at least industry involvement."</p>
<blockquote>"When creative labour becomes data, a performance can easily stop being something interpreted and start being automated."</blockquote>
<p>Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect, Metal Gear Solid) similarly calls for consent, control, and compensation, adding actors "should be compensated for what would've otherwise been paid work for them, especially when that work is used to generate profits for someone else."</p><p>Hale also highlights newer actors, without the knowledge to negotiate, will make "fear-based decisions and underprice themselves", which is why union status and open communication about fair rates is so important. "It's more imperative than ever that we have each other's backs and that we're clear about where we bring value and what we receive in exchange for that value," she says, adding: "I believe having human actors may well become an important mark of quality that elevates some games above others."</p>
<p>What's more, actors can "choose not to 'other' this technology," says Hale, but "move forward with it in a conscious, collaborative, constructive way". Alix Wilton Regan (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">Tomb Raider</a>, Cyberpunk, Dragon Age) is more staunchly against AI technology.</p>
<p>"The effect is, frankly, catastrophic," she says of AI's impact, noting "the voice acting market is drying up and wages are stagnating" as the tech can result in a reduced fee. "Already, many talented performers - of all ages - can barely pay their bills," she says. "The supply of actors is growing, but the demand for actors is shrinking, as corporations look to replace us with AI."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>For Wilton Regan, there are no benefits to the use of AI, even for more extreme voicework like incidental grunts and yells. "I love being in the studio and collaborating with different teams as we build new worlds and characters together, so, at best, AI alleviates some minor inconveniences such as the potential for vocal stress," she says. "But it's at the cost of endangering our livelihoods. That's a horrible trade-off that no one should have to make."</p><p>Colin Ryan (Final Fantasy 14, Hades 2) believes similarly, but says he would "prefer to see investment in vocal support for actors in games". Where theatre, TV and film have voice coaches to support actors with challenging moments, "that's not an option in video games."</p>
<p>"Developers using AI as a shortcut and to further bring down costs is a massive blow to actors' livelihoods and craft," Ryan continues, adding Embark Studios using AI even for incidental NPCs sets a "worrying precedent". "For many actors starting out, getting to record NPCs is a way to break into the industry, an opportunity for them to hone their craft, and form career-spanning connections, just like it was for me," he says. "To take away these jobs and use AI to generate them shows how little they value our contribution."</p>
<p>Further, Ryan believes the use of AI voices "isn't a creative decision, it's a financial one", and while he admits it often sounds hyperbolic and alarmist, "the truth is there will be less and less commercial incentive to hire humans" as the technology improves. "As an industry we need to make the case for humans and human creativity, to ensure that actors are a valued and intrinsic part of video game creation," he says.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>However, Wilton Regan is fighting back against AI "abuse". Along with author Nolan Kelly, she's launched <a href="https://tivoice.art/">TIVA</a> (True Indie Voice Art) as an audiobook project using poison-pilling technology to ensure the work of actors is unusable for AI. Its cast includes the likes of Hale, Ashly Burch (Horizon), Jane Perry (Returnal), and Devora Wilde and Jennifer English (Baldur's Gate 3), among others. "Our hope is that the quality of this work will convince people of our value as actors and the value of our profession in the voiceover space," says Wilton Regan.</p>
<p>The project is just one example of how actors are standing up for themselves against the threat of AI, but it's clear wider government regulation on AI technology is required in addition to union efforts.</p>
<blockquote>"As an industry we need to make the case for humans and human creativity, to ensure that actors are a valued and intrinsic part of video game creation."</blockquote>
<p>Whether for perceived financial reasons, development shortcuts, or as a creative decision, video game studios are increasingly looking to AI for voicework. And as awards-season hits and we all seek to celebrate the work of video game performers, it's imperative the industry remembers to protect the creative work of actors. Otherwise, it's a slippery slope towards a huge drop in quality.</p><p>"Even if human performers provide the base voices, and even if the makers have the best of intentions, without an actor bringing a character to life, you simply have a creepy cheap human imitation performing at you," says Wilton Regan. "Not <em>for </em>you, but <em>at </em>you. For anything generated, there is no true emotion, no chance for repeat takes, no nuance that a talented actor can bring to the role. You need a human for that."</p>

<p>"When a young Lara Croft is shipwrecked on a forgotten island during her first archaeological expedition, her intense fight for survival soon becomes a perilous journey to unravel the island's mysteries," reads the official blurb. "Initially armed with nothing but her instincts, Lara must quickly learn how to overcome Yamatai's devious traps and murderous inhabitants to escape its relentless hold."</p><p>Tomb Raider has been "expertly optimised" for mobile devices, and also features a "fully customisable touchscreen interface", which developer Feral Interactive said will allow players to "mix puzzle-solving and intense combat with ease". The release will also include gamepad and mouse and keyboard support.</p>

            <p>Key members of The Elder Scrolls 6 team have shared an update on the highly-anticipated game's status, and the good news is development is "progressing really well".</p>
<p>According to Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, the "majority" of the studio is now working on The Elder Scrolls 6, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">first announced all the way back in 2018</a>, though he noted the team "always overlap" when it comes to game development (as well as Elder Scrolls 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">the studio is also working on its Fallout series</a>).</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"We're very used to overlapping development," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">Game Informer</a>, saying the studio has "long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them". Howard added "it's a process", and one that everyone involved wishes went faster than it does. "But it's a process that we want to get right," the Bethesda exec said.</p>
<p>Bethesda's studio director Angela Browder added thanks to the "leaps and bounds" made in the industry and hardware since Skyrim, the "possibilities" for The Elder Scrolls 6 "are crazy".</p>
<p>"I will be honest, for me, sometimes I see things that are happening, and I go, 'Angela from Skyrim days could never have envisioned seeing this like this now', and that is a cool thing to be a part of," Browder said. "And it's a thing that I hope that when the day comes that our fans play it, that they - especially those of them who've been lifers with our brands - can really see how far it's all come."</p><p>Browder noted if you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">compare the original Oblivion with this year's remaster</a>, "you can see how far" technology has really come. "So, to me, The Elder Scrolls 6 is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry," the studio director said, before adding:</p>
<p>"It's gonna be dope. It's dope!"</p>
<p>During the same interview, design director Emil Pagliarulo said the "pressure" that the Elder Scrolls players put on Bethesda "we don't put on ourselves", though the developer understands why some get frustrated waiting for a game to come out.</p>
<p>"Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games, they take not just a long time to make, but a long time to spit and polish and iron out the bugs," Pagliarulo said. "And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?"</p><p>So, to make sure The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out of the oven as a delicious turkey, Bethesda is going to take its time. How much time? Well, "as long as it needs to be to be great," Pagliarulo closed.</p>

<p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>More recently, though, many Elder Scrolls 6 fans thought they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">found a clue pointing to a 2027 release date in a recent trailer for the Switch 2 edition of Skyrim</a>.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has described generative AI as "a snake eating its own tail", discussing how easily use of the tech can be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Straley left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> back in 2017 and has now formed his own independent studio, Wildflower Interactive. In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-generative-ai-interview/">Polygon</a> about the studio's debut, Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley revealed his staunch dislike of generative AI.</p>
<p>"It's a snake eating its own tail," he said. "It can't grow and think for itself, it just consumes, and it tries to mimic what it's consumed. That's the best it can do right now."</p>

<p>Generative AI has not been used in development of Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley confirmed. However, he noted how the term AI has been used in gaming for decades, but has since become confused and conflated with the current use of generative AI.</p><p>"It's difficult to even pitch the concept of this creature, because in my world, NPCs are AI," Straley said. "AI programmers are a type of personnel you have on staff in the programming department. Now you can't say that because if somebody does have an opinion about AI, I can't now call this creature the most advanced AI companion. People are going to think we did machine learning, and LLMs, and all that. No, we did none of that. This is hard work, and a lot of problem solving, and a lot of creative thinking. Which I think makes it more charming.</p>
<p>"I like art that has chips and flaws. It's like pottery. It has imperfections because it didn't come out of the kiln right. That's the cool stuff about art."</p>
<p>Straley did admit generative AI could potentially be useful in certain instances, but he's not interested in using it.</p>
<p>"I feel like without a human being the creation, I personally have zero investment in wanting to watch a TV show made by a robot," he said. "I have zero interest in looking at art that is generated by a computer. I don't think prompting is art."</p><p>Straley's comments are timely, following those of Larian CEO Swen Vincke. In an interview with Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Vincke admitted to Larian using generative AI</a> as part of development. When this received backlash online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Vincke clarified that concept artists would not be replaced by AI</a>. Instead the studio uses "AI tools to explore references" and developers can "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier" if they wish to.</p>
<p>The backlash Larian received to Vincke's initial comment is testament to the strong immediate opinions the use of AI can generate.</p>
<p>Coven of the Chicken Foot was revealed at this year's The Game Awards showcase - we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">rundown of everything announced</a>.</p>

            <p><em>Note that there are some small spoilers for the Dispatch game in this article. Not many - a couple of small ones - but consider this a heads-up.</em></p>
<p>It seems absurd now to think Dispatch would be anything but a success. It might have fallen awkwardly with regards to The Game Awards, with half of the series qualifying for it and half not, meaning it didn't feature as strongly as it could have, but I've no doubt it'll finish high on game of the year lists. There's so much confidence in this superhero workplace comedy, so much charm and so much swagger, it seems as though it was always destined for big things. Except, it very nearly wasn't. There was a time, a very real and painful time, when Dispatch nearly didn't make it - when Dispatch nearly died.</p>
<p>As game director and AdHoc studio co-founder Nick Herman tells me, speaking in a video call:  "We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of... financial things."</p>
<p>Dispatch writer and fellow co-founder Pierre Shorette continues: "The industry was collapsing, if you recall, two years ago. We were right there. Without really getting into the details, we were at the tip of the spear of it all popping. The publisher we were at was connected with Embracer, and I feel like Embracer was one of the first dominoes to really set the industry shaking, so we were right there at the edge of it. It was a weird place to be.</p><p>"We were doing contract work at the time," he adds. (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-the-studio-that-wrote-the-wolf-among-us-2-doesnt-know-whats-going-on-with-it">One game AdHoc was working on was Telltale's The Wolf Among Us 2</a> - a project that has since disappeared into development limbo.) "We'd been pretty good about staying busy. And had we not had that contract work basically paying the bills for us to continue development, we would have died three years ago."</p>
<p>But finding another publisher wasn't easy - in fact, Dispatch never really found one. The game lists Critical Role as publisher - the role-play mega-group that's become an entertainment brand and a publisher of board games and tabletop RPGs - but it's a nominal title, there to add exposure and clout, and to formalise the relationship for the other game AdHoc is making: a Critical Role game set in the group's campaign world of Exandria.</p>
<p>Mostly, rejection was what Dispatch faced, which is why it's so strange for Herman and Shorette to see people mystified when they say they didn't know the game would be a success. "People are mad at us because 'how could they not know this was going to be a huge success?'" Herman says.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you how," Shorette adds: "you have basically everyone tell you it's a bad idea for seven fucking years!"</p>
<p>"Telling us 'this is dumb, don't do it,'" Herman says.</p>
<p>"'You're making a game in a dead genre,'" Shorette says.</p>
<p>"And god I'm glad it shook out the way it did and people rejected us," Herman continues, "and we pachinkoed all the way down to our last resort and found someone, because now we are in the most control. We don't have a publisher: we're our own publisher. We weren't forced to do anything we didn't want to do. And now we have full ownership, whereas that wouldn't have been the case if people really believed in us."</p>

</figure>
<p>Dispatch started life as an interactive live-action television series, which sounds to me similar in concept to Netflix's Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch, where you're invited to choose the direction the story takes at prescribed moments throughout. Laura Bailey, the Critical Role member and an award-winning video game actor, was attached to the project back then (Herman and Shorette knew her from their Telltale days), but she was the only person we'd recognise from the current Dispatch cast.</p><p>Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul wasn't yet on board to play main character Robert. Apparently, the studio was thinking about going for someone else, Rahul Kohli, the British actor we saw on The Game Awards stage the other night promoting Housemarque's game Saros, in which he stars. Kohli also happens to be the partner of Alannah Pearce, who we know better now as the muscled Dispatch hero Malevola, or "muscle mommy" or "demon Cindy Crawford", as Shorette refers to her. "We talked about Rahul, yeah," Herman says.</p>
<p>This live-action incarnation of Dispatch was being made for a company related to Walmart, the American supermarket behemoth. I assume it was <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2018/10/11/walmart-and-eko-announce-joint-venture-to-create-interactive-storytelling-for-entertainment-and-retail">Eko</a>, an interactive storytelling company Walmart announced in 2018, although this isn't confirmed. And the project went a long way through development, it had shoot dates, but Covid struck and closed the world down and took the project with it. Maybe it was for the best. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-episodic-gaming-former-telltale-devs-are-bringing-it-back-for-the-release-of-dispatch-and-theres-a-chance-it-might-work-this-time">As Herman told me in a pre-release Dispatch interview</a>: "You're asking a bunch of game devs to shoot a TV show. It would have been a fun failure."</p>
<p>Dispatch was forced to change. There are things we would recognise from that early idea in the game we can play today, Herman says, but the tone was noticeably different. "It was a much sadder Robert - less hopeful, less optimistic, more just destroyed, working a dead-end job," Herman says. "And you were focused on one hero. There wasn't a Z-team. It was just: you would choose one of three heroes to help." Those heroes were Water Boy, Mr Whiskey - the person in the cat costume - and Invisigal. There was no Blonde Blazer, the blonde-haired super woman, at all. Scratch that: there <em>was </em>a Blonde Blazer, but it wasn't who you think.</p>
<blockquote><em>"We haven't talked about this [but] Blonde Blazer used to be the name of Flambae"</em></blockquote>
<p>"We haven't talked about this [but] Blonde Blazer used to be the name of Flambae," Herman reveals. "He was blonde. In the original, original scripts, he was Blonde Blazer. And I can't remember what she was called; we started moving names around at some point."</p>
<p>The longer Covid lingered, the more a fundamental change began to take hold. As the real world got less hopeful, the game got more hopeful. As the real world darkened, the game lightened. Shorette and Herman refer to this as the Ted Lasso effect, referencing Apple TV's award-winning comedy that came out around the same time, centered on a relentlessly optimistic football coach called Ted Lasso. "It was definitely impactful," says Shorette. And this uptick in optimism changed how the team wanted to go about things. "We spent so much time at Telltale just figuring out how to make people like people and then figure out the worst way to murder them," Shorette says, "and it just got old."</p><p>For instance, in the first draft of Dispatch, Robert's lifelong friend Chase - who has superspeed but also ages at superspeed when he uses his powers - would die. There was one revision where the season would even end with his death. But Shorette took it out and changed his mind. "Why?" says Shorette. "I liked him. Why the fuck would we kill character we like? It was so hard to get people to like him. Why would we throw that away?"</p>
<p>Alongside Chase, the project had two other core characters in Invisigal and Blonde Blazer - the actual Blonde Blazer this time. These characters were established early on as the core of the experience and driving force of the story. Everyone else, the Malevolas, Sonars, Punch-Ups and Prisms, came quite a lot later. Indeed it wasn't until the team took a mid-development excursion to Reno, or "shit Vegas", as one of Shorette's friends calls it, that the Z-team concept whereby you look after a group of misfit superheroes was landed upon.</p>

</figure>
<p>You'll recall that the live-action idea had been about coaching a hero one-on-one, so the game would focus on one hero and one mission and you'd coach them through it, watching their progress on a series of security camera feeds. Sound familiar? It is - the remnants of this approach are in the game still, in the first mission where Invisigal goes to the doughnut shop. "That was in the original script," says Herman, "except you had a bunch of cameras, you were able to hop around, and you were able to engage with the environment. It was a little bit more adventure-gamey, honestly, more puzzley." And there were bigger ideas for this approach than that.</p>
<p>"The doughnut shop was a small box," says Herman, "but we had prototypes for big versions of that where you're going through enemy bases and stuff. And it was cool but it was <em>really</em> expensive because it's all cinematic. All these angles of cameras, all these different things that can happen. So we were slowly realising we're going to do three of these in the whole game, it's so expensive, so we've got to pivot to something we can put everywhere."</p><p>Dispatching was the answer and a thematically appropriate one, dreamt up in a designer's room in a hotel in Reno. It's the system you know from the game now: you see a map of a city and events occur in it which you dispatch heroes to attend to. It's a pleasing layer of strategy. More importantly, it's gameplay that doesn't require cinematics, where characters can chat without having to be animated, and where episodes can be broken up and given gameplay substance. But a sudden need for a team meant the team also needed characters.</p>
<p>Shorette and Herman and the rest of the team began looking wherever they could for characters they could pull in. That literal bat-man in the break room who'd been put there as a gag? He'll do. "I had forgotten that Sonar was just a gag," Shorette says, laughing. Herman adds: "We had to dust that guy off and, okay, maybe he also turns into a giant bat. Maybe he's a crypto guy. But originally it was just a guy who's screaming in the break room and it was adding tension to a dialogue scene you were having."</p>
<p>Ideas for the other heroes came quick and thick, and soon there were so many, some had to be cut, such as Winter, "A K-pop star," says Shorette.</p>
<p>"Was he?" asks Herman. "I don't think he was. He was dressed like a Japanese homeless man."</p>
<p>"But the vibe was one of those homeless people where you're like, damn, you should be on a runway," Shorette says. "He had a Korean idol-y kind of face. He looked like a Saja Boy undercover."</p>
<p>And Herman groans and says "I <em>know" </em>when I mention the obvious: that cutting a Saja Boy-like character in the year of KPop Demon Hunters is a massive missed opportunity.</p>
<p>"We actually had a love triangle with him," Shorette adds. "He was the one everyone was after. Yeah that would have been great. We should do that for Season 2. <em>If </em>there is a Season 2!"</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Let's leap forwards again in time to people playing the final game, and if the success of the game was unexpected, the ways in which people played the game were unexpected too. One decision that people made in particular surprised the team: more people sided with Invisigal than Blonde Blazer. Internal tests signalled the split would be roughly down the middle, but when the game came out, it was anything but. Statistics showed three quarters of the playerbase choosing Invisigal, and Herman thinks that's his fault.</p><p>"There are things I would do if I was going back to that to balance the choice a little bit better," he says, "because weirdly, it's like we have responsibility here. It's not just pure player emotion or the words on a page or the actors: it's also about how the choice is presented. That's my episode and I could have done a better job to push things a little bit towards Blazer. Like, she could have been on screen - we could have split-screen seen her in the back of the limo texting Robert. And just seeing her would make people more choose her. They were staring at Invisigal and getting a text from Blazer, so it's not really balanced, you know?"</p>

<p>They also didn't expect people to attach themselves as emotionally as they did to the characters of the game. In their development bubble, they often saw the game as a collection of goofs and gags and literal dick jokes. (They're big fans of streams where people enable nudity only to hurriedly try and turn it off when they realise what the on/off switch is there for, by the way. "It's very funny," Shorette says, laughing. "People are uncomfortable about dicks.") But the fans' seriousness about the characters, their artwork, their fiction, their love for them, has shown them a side to Dispatch they didn't necessarily realise was there.</p>
<p>"To see some people take it <em>so</em> seriously, it almost feels like, oh, we've got to take this more seriously now that everyone else is taking it more seriously," Herman says. "Because for a long time it was just goofs and gags and this is kind of cool - what do you think? And now it's locked in that people care about these people, they care about these details.</p>
<p>"For it to be called a comedy is underselling how it's affecting people," Shorette adds. "I've always just called it comedy but I think we've always had that dismissive, like, ahh that's just a bunch of fart jokes. But then people are into Robert's positivity. They feel like that's a fucking good man, and we need good male role models, people who are not corny about being positive or believing in people. That's cool - it's a good time."</p><p>Which brings back around to where we began, sort of, with fans being somewhat mad at AdHoc for not predicting Dispatch would be a success. Because it turns out fans are also mad that AdHoc hasn't told them what it's doing next, as far as Dispatch and a second season or sequel are concerned. "It's the new problem, right?" says Herman. "It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it?" So how seriously are they talking about it?</p>
<p>"As seriously as anything," answers Shorette. "But the thing is, the tough thing is, it's like in music: you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling. We had <em>so</em> long with this - seven years is a lot of time. If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand."</p>
<p>"There were <em>zero </em>expectations for Season 1 - external expectations," Herman adds. "People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head. Season 2, if we do it, we know that's going to be an extra challenge."</p>
<p>"A lot of pressure," adds Shorette. "It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>
<p>The team is "days away" from sitting down and figuring out what comes next, Herman tells me, which considering I spoke to them a couple of weeks ago might already have come to pass. "We're entering the time where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out," he says. And I would be amazed - flabbergasted, even - if these plans don't include a Dispatch Season 2.</p><p>But the studio also has that Critical Role game to make, don't forget, though it doesn't sound as far along as I had hoped it would be. "It's been bubbling, simmering I would call it," Shorette says. "It's not full boil or anything. It probably has had pushes over the last year or so, at different points, but as Dispatch needed to get released, that took up a lot of our resources."</p>
<p>Whatever the future holds for AdHoc, though, it is certainly bright. Blazingly bright, even. From a studio struggling for survival, nervous about whether the world would want a Telltale-style episodic game, AdHoc and Dispatch have become one of 2025's most notable successes. The pressure of survival is off; the pressure of success is on. The world cannot get enough of Dispatch.</p>

            <p>A second season of Dispatch is being discussed "as seriously as anything" at AdHoc Studio, and the team will sit down any day now and make a decision about it.</p>
<p>"People are mad that we haven't told them what we're doing," studio co-founder and Dispatch game director Nick Herman told me in an interview. "It's the new problem, right? It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it? We're days away from really sitting down and having the time - because we've had to support the game - where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out."</p>
<p>I spoke to Herman and Pierre Shorette, the lead writer and another studio co-founder, as part of a longer interview live on Eurogamer now. But though Herman said the studio is yet to make a decision on Season 2, the ways they referenced a follow-up made it sound like a much surer thing.</p>
<p>When they talked about a cut Kpop idol-inspired character called Winter, for instance, and a love triangle he was involved in, Shorette joked that he could reinstate this for Season 2. "We should do that for Season 2," he said, before quickly adding: "<em>If </em>there is a Season 2!"</p><p>It was when I questioned them directly about a second series and how seriously the studio is talking about it, that Shorette said, "As seriously as anything." But though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone#:~:text=The%20episodic%20superhero%20workplace%20comedy,number%20also%20equates%20to%20sales.">Dispatch has been an obvious success, racing to 2m sales</a> and capturing a large and passionate fanbase, there are concerns internally about following it up.</p>
<blockquote><em>"You have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second"</em></blockquote>
<p>As Shorette explained: "The thing is, the tough thing is, it's like in music: you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling. We had <em>so</em> long with this - seven years is a lot of time. If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand."</p>
<p>Then Herman added: "There were <em>zero </em>expectations for Season 1 - external expectations. People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head. Season 2, if we do it, we know that's going to be an extra challenge."</p>
<p>"A lot of pressure," Shorette said. "It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>
<p>It might be a surprise to hear Dispatch was in development for several years but its journey was a twisting, turning one. From being a live-action television series to being dropped by a publisher half-way through, the game has had to survive some bumps. You can read all about it - and about that cut Kpop character and more - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a> live on Eurogamer now.</p>

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has announced Fallout Season 3 is currently being written, just a day after season two premiered. What's more, collaborations between Fallout video games and this next entry in the popular TV show are being planned.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-season-3-scripts-fallout-76-game-tie-in-1236610167/">In an interview with Variety</a>, Howard revealed the current status of Fallout's next season, as well as how it will cross over with the games.</p>
<p>Howard explained: "For us on the game and TV show side, we're writing Season 3 now [...] We're having those conversations now of, what are we doing in Season 3 for the TV show and what elements can we bring into our games at that time when it comes out that don't feel forced or fake."</p>

<p>The Fallout series and games have already explored this sort of multi-media promotion, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout 76's recent Burning Springs update</a>. Released earlier this month, Burning Springs starred Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, and featured several new bounty hunter missions for players to complete. It's free too, a nice touch to be sure.</p><p>The Fallout show has also acted as an opportunity to shoehorn Game Pass into the situation, as Amazon, Bethesda, and Samsung have partnered up to offer both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and season one to Samsung TV owners for free via Game Pass. Head of Samsung Gaming Kevin Beatty told Variety he thought they were "extremely fortunate" to offer season one, and that he hopes they'll be able to stream season 2 in the future.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Todd Howard confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-todd-howard-has-no-interest-in-becoming-bethesdas-version-of-marvel-cameo-king-stan-lee">he had no interest in taking up a Stan Lee style cameo in the Fallout show</a>, and didn't rule out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">possibility of an Elder Scrolls TV show in the future</a>. He was, however, tight-lipped about a Wolfenstein show.</p>

            <p>Swen Vincke, the CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Divinity developer Larain, has responded to the intense backlash the studio has received since its use of generative AI was confirmed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated"> the Larian CEO stated the studio is using generative AI to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text</a>, with Vinke saying "everyone at the company is more or less OK" with the way the technology is being implemented. He added the studio's upcoming and newly-announced release Divinity won't contain anything which has been AI-generated.</p>
<p>Soon after Vincke's statements went live, however, he was met with backlash from fans <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">as well as former Larian developers</a>, which prompted the studio head to respond with his <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833"> own post</a>, stating: "Holy fuck guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI."  </p>

<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 head added Larian has "a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more", with the artwork they create being original and something Vincke is "very proud" of.</p>
<p>Continuing further, Vincke said he was "asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI" during the interview with Bloomberg. "I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn't say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists," he said.</p><p>Vincke stated the studio uses "AI tools to explore references", in the same way it uses the likes of Google and art books. "At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art," he said. "There is no comparison."</p>
<p>Larian hires its team of creatives for "their talent", Vincke closed, and "not for their ability to do what a machine suggests". He again reiterated the team can still "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier".</p>

<p>In a further statement shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">IGN</a>, Vincke again clarified that Larian is not looking to replace any of its developers with generative AI. It will also not be releasing a game which includes content made by the technology.</p>
<p>You can read Vincke's statement in full below:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We've been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p>
<p>"Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p>
<p>"Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating. Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual's workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p>
<p>"We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games. We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p>
<p>"While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse."</p></blockquote>

<p>While <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/braak.bsky.social/post/3ma53v5blo222">many remain unconvinced of Vincke's response</a>, others have pointed out Larian is far from the only beloved studio to admit to using AI. The "Expedition 33 team freely admitted using AI and just won the most awards ever in The Game Awards history," <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/2001061930547503396">Washington Post reporter Gene Park noted on social media</a>.</p><p>AI, of course, remains a key area of discussion across the industry, and reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines. Earlier this month, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.

<p>As for Larian, it is working on Divinity, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announced at The Game Awards with a rather gruesome and unsettling trailer</a>.

            <p>Larian is using generative AI as part of its game development process, but CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed the studio's new Divinity game won't include anything AI-generated.</p>
<p>Vincke discussed the topic of AI with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announcement last week at The Game Awards of its new Divinity game</a>. It's the studio's next project following the hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was a particularly expansive game.</p>
<p>As such, the studio is looking to AI with its follow-up, but Vincke confirmed it hasn't massively improved efficiency. Larian uses AI tools to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text, Bloomberg reported.</p>

<p>In Divinity, then, "everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," said Vincke.</p>
<p>And while the use of AI has led to some pushback internally, Vincke believes "at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it."</p>
<p>Larian is aiming to cut down on development time for Divinity, to complete production in less time than Baldur's Gate 3. AI is one potential tool, while another is developing Divinity's quest and storylines in parallel rather than linearly. The studio is also growing in size.</p><p>"I think a lot of founders have the same problem," said Vincke. "I have to be large, otherwise I can't make my video game. With growth suddenly comes a whole bunch of responsibilities that you didn't necessarily think you were ever gonna have, but you have them and then you make the best of them. Size exposes you to new problems that you couldn't imagine existed."</p>
<p>Back at GDC last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-larian-interview-swen-vincke-on-industry-woes-optimism-and-life-after-baldurs-gate-3">Vincke discussed the topic of AI with Eurogamer</a>. "So, we certainly don't see it as a replacement for developers," he said. "But we do see it as something that allows us to do more stuff."</p>
<p>He continued: "I do see it as an additional tool that you can put on top of the things that are in the game. And we're certainly doing experiments with that. But as I said, it's still far from being usable in that sense."</p>
<p>In the same Bloomberg interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">Vincke declared Larian's forthcoming Divinity game as "us unleashed"</a>, confirming it will be a turn-based RPG.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">current gen upgrade was released for Larian's previous game Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, available now on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <p>Larian CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed the studio's next game, Divinity, will be a turn-based RPG, describing the game as "us unleashed".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">Divinity was revealed at last week's The Game Awards</a>, following an elaborate stunt with a demonic statue in the desert. It will be the next game from the studio after the huge success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which was similarly turn-based.</p>
<p>"This is going to be us unleashed, I think," Vincke told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "It's a turn-based RPG featuring everything you've seen from us in the past, but it's brought to the next level."</p>

<p>Divinity will also be an early-access release, Vincke confirmed, just like Baldur's Gate 3, though it's unknown when this could start.</p>
<p>Vincke explained the studio had originally planned to work with Wizards of the Coast once again on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, but the developers weren't excited about it.</p>
<p>"Conceptually, all of the ingredients for a really cool game were there except the hearts of the developers," he said.</p>
<p>That's why the studio is now returning to Divinity, the franchise on which the studio is built. Previous games in the series had real-time combat, though the two Original Sin games were turn-based, leading to speculation among fans as to what this new Divinity game will feature.</p><p>"Baldur's Gate 3 was a good game and I'm proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better," said Vincke. He noted the tabletop systems of Dungeons &amp; Dragons were difficult to translate into a video game. "Here, we're making a system that's made for a video game. It's much easier to understand."</p>
<p>What's more, the studio will be using a new game engine and is doubling down on cinematic storytelling. The developers also want to expand on the breadth of storytelling, too.</p>
<p>"The idea is that when you talk to fellow journalists about the game, you'll have completely different stories," Vincke said. "We're doing a couple of things that you haven't seen in RPGs before, I think."</p>
<p>Following the announcement of Divinity at The Game Awards, Larian has released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">current gen upgrade of Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

            <p>Financial documents have revealed that not only is Dead Island 3 in development at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a>, but it's aiming for a 2028 release.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">This was spotted by user bogorad222 on X</a>, who posted the Dambuster Studios annual financial report online including a brief overview of the company and what it's currently working on. The overview reveals the primary focus of the studio is now Dead Island 3.</p>
<p>"After [the] release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a> Ultimate Edition in October 2024, the primary focus for Dambuster Studio is now Dead Island 3," the report states. "All developers are assigned to the project and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete all of Dambuster's QA team will also be assigned to Dead Island 3."</p>

<p>The report continues: "Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world and story design moving at pace. The current predicted release window for the project is Q 1/2 2028."</p>
<p>As for Dambuster's main risks, the report states these stem from "having the right vision and mission to know which games are trending in 3-5 years, staying on top of engineering standards of AAA games as well as having the right talented team available for working on the projects."</p><p>Dead Island 3 had been teased back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-3-teased-with-returning-character-as-dambuster-studios-celebrates-20-million-dead-island-2-players">as Dambuster celebrated 20 million Dead Island 2 players</a>. In a celebratory post, Dambuster stated the outbreak was "far from over", leaving many curious as to where the series would head next. The game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2s-canned-original-version-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insists-exec">which struggled during development</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">did eventually launch to plentiful sales.</a></p>
<p>If you've not played Dead Island 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-review-its-still-2011-in-los-angeles">Eurogamer's review</a> described it as: "A straightforwardly accomplished zombie action-RPG that doesn't quite make the most of its Californian setting."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been going from strength to strength this year. Following its release back in April, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">game was met with widespread acclaim</a> and sales to match. In May, the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>. In October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">that figure was updated to over 5m copies worldwide across all formats</a>.</p>
<p>But, that number has since increased further, and according to <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics">Alinea Analytics, </a>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold "almost" 400k copies since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">its record-breaking Game Awards nominations</a> on 17th November. Meanwhile, the company's <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2000615104090341472/photo/1">head of market analysis Rhys Elliott</a> estimates Clair Obscur has "sold an extra 200k+ copies since" The Game Awards last week, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">scooped up the coveted Game of the Year accolade among others</a>.</p>

<p>To break that down further, Elliott said 76 percent of those sales were on Steam, with 21 percent on PS5 and three percent on Xbox. "Around 52 thousand Xbox players" have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-xbox-game-passs-biggest-third-party-success-2025">since played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 via Game Pass</a> "for the first time" as well, Elliott added.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#1m">SteamDB</a>, meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has received a notable uptake in player numbers since last week's award show, as you can see in the graph below.</p>
<p>The Sunday before this year's The Game Awards welcomed 22,759 Clair Obscur players on Steam, while the Sunday after saw 56,993 players. That's an increase of 34,234 players between those two specific days.</p>

<p>The success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p>
<p>During the awards show last week, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> fans have discovered a load of unused conversations between the game's controversial NPCs.</p>
<p>Unlike previous games where Samus is mostly isolated and alone, the latest in the series sees Samus rescuing and interacting with an ensemble of Federation soldiers. This has proven unpopular with many players, who feel it undermines its otherwise mysterious tone.</p>
<p>Now, YouTuber Bearborg has uploaded a video of all base camp interactions in the game, including unused dialogue, which were taken from the game's files (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">VGC</a>). The video includes over 41 minutes of dialogue, of which around 34 minutes is unused.</p>

<p>As this extra dialogue was all recorded, it suggests the game originally had far more incidental conversations between its characters, which were (perhaps rightfully) pared back.</p>
<p>Cut conversations include discussions on how much robot VUE-995 can bench press, MacKenzie's lack of field experience, and Armstrong finding out about roast beasts, among many others. It's mostly more humorous dialogue that adds little to the story, which is likely why it was cut.</p>

<p>In the final version of the game, these characters are little more than broad, stereotypical sketches. Yet as Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson explained, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-chatty-companions-silent-samus-the-problem">Metroid Prime 4 suffers more from Samus's own lack of dialogue by comparison</a>.</p>
<p>"It's presentationally clear here that Samus just isn't talking," he wrote. "The feeling of awkward weirdness only grows as the game winds on. These guys begin throwing their lives on the line for this woman who offers nothing back in return. This might even work if they acknowledged their leader's silence - but they don't. Everyone just acts like this is all normal. Maybe it is, with this being Samus' in-universe reputation. Either way, it sucks."</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 was eagerly awaited for 18 years until its release earlier this month. Unfortunately, for many it has not lived up to expectations.</p>
<p>"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>.</p>

            <p>Two more actors have been cast in Netflix's upcoming Assassin's Creed adaptation, which is based on Ubisoft's games of the same name.</p>
<p>Lola Petticrew (pictured below), who is known for Bloodlands and Trespasses, and Zachary Hart (pictured above) have both joined the show, though their characters at this time are being kept under wraps. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/assassins-creed-zachary-hart-netflix-live-action-series-1236647717/">Deadline</a>, Hart - whose previous credits include Slow Horses - will be a series regular.</p>

<p>The duo will be joining previously announced cast member Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor set to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>
<p>While characters in the upcoming series are still unknown, it was previously said they will be different from the games. A report last month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-show-will-be-set-in-ancient-rome">claimed the TV show will explore a time period hitherto untouched by Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series</a>, and include figures from Ancient Rome such as Emperor Nero and Seneca the Younger.</p><p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation has been a long time coming, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">was first announced in 2020</a>. The series is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show. Filming is expected to take place in Italy next year.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, it really is just a case of when and not if Ubisoft will announce a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry Black Flag. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">a myriad of leaks and rumours</a>, earlier this month a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">listing for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted on the PEGI ratings board website</a>, further confirming its existence.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> art director Robert Sammelin has shone some light on the inner workings of the extraction shooter's matchmaking system, confirming that player behaviour is indeed a factor in the "complex" process of assigning players to online matches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/">Speaking to PC Gamer at The Game Awards</a>, Sammelin stated: "Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We analyse behaviour and match accordingly." When asked if he was able to elaborate on the matter, Sammelin said "no" and laughed.</p>
<p>Instead, the interview shifts to the topic of player passivity in general, and how the team at Embark has been able to see it in data gathered from Arc Raiders matches. Sammelin explained: "We got some figures on how many people have even downed another player, and they were surprisingly low at a large scale. There's also quite a difference in playing with a squad or solo with this, [which] opens up a very different experience depending on how you choose to engage with the game from the get-go.</p>

<p>"Of course data is great, the amount of data we get from telemetry is really helpful in finding out what we should be addressing, tweaking, or tuning. Pairing it up with internal assumptions is invaluable in terms of tuning and balance. That's something we'll keep doing continuously."</p><p>Arc Raiders has garnered somewhat of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">a reputation for player pacifism since its launch earlier this year</a>. Some players have even argued that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-are-waging-war-over-a-controversial-topic-are-pvpers-ruining-the-experience">PvPers were ruining the experience, in what is clearly a high-stakes PvPvE genre</a>. Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">even quizzed a sociologist on the matter</a>, given the interesting dynamic between those friendly players and others engaging with the extraction shooter as intended.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand, there's plenty to do right now in Arc Raiders. In fact, today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-snow-map-condition-flickering-flames">the game's frosty map condition has been added to the game</a>, with a Christmas-themed community event pushing raiders to head out and collect berries for the festive season.</p>

            <p>There's now a free demo available for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Xbox Series X/S, ahead of the full release in January.</p>
<p>The demo includes the iconic first chapter of the game, and progress will carry over to the main game. Note that on Switch 2, you'll need at least 8GB of space to download the demo, but this is a great opportunity to see how the game runs on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>What's more, you can grab a free copy of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> game if you pre-order Remake digitally on either platform. That's only available until 31st January 2026, but that's enough time to experience the 1996 original before diving into Remake.</p>

<p>Those who pre-order the physical version of Remake will receive a Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Play Booster back, containing 15 random cards (while stocks last, at least).</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake will release on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S on 22nd January 2026. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">full Remake trilogy will eventually be available across both platforms</a>, in addition to PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, though, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">physical version of the game will be a Game Key Card</a>, meaning it's just a physical key for a download - you'll still need over 90GB of space for the game, making it one of the largest on the system.</p>
<p>Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi has also confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory">development of the third part won't be impacted by the multiplatform approach</a>. It remains unknown if its eventual release will be simultaneous, or a PlayStation exclusive for a limited time.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry's oh-so-challenging platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has sold over 7m copies since its release in September.</p>
<p>Silksong is the follow up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, and ever since it was announced back in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-just-made-my-day-live-reactions-to-the-silksong-release-date">many were left desperate to get their hands on it</a>. It finally materialised three months ago across multiple platforms, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-causes-server-chaos-on-xbox-steam-and-nintendo-as-platforms-grind-to-a-halt">crashing many digital store fronts in the process thanks to the sudden influx of eager players</a>. How many eager players? Well, quite a lot!</p>

<p>Team Cherry has today announced it has sold over 7m copies of Silksong in the last few months. That number is full fat sales, and does not include the "millions more" who have played via Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p><p>"It's a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected," <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">Team Cherry said</a>. "Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game's challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home.</p>
<p>"Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further."</p>
<p>Speaking of expanding the game even further, the developer went on to detail Silksong's first expansion known as Sea of Sorrow, which is coming out next year. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-unveils-first-big-silksong-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-and-its-completely-free">nautically themed expansion will include new areas, bosses, tools and more when it arrives as a free update for all players</a>.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Silksong five stars. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Eurogamer's Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/any-future-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-would-exist-alongside-the-others-as-standalone-entry-says-team-cherry">Team Cherry recently flirted with the idea of more entries in its Hollow Knight series</a>, which (if they ever do materialise) would sit alongside the studio's previous games, rather than act as any kind of continuation that would require an understanding of earlier lore to appreciate.</p>

            <p>
Well if you thought we were done with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> excitement for 2025, think again. Team Cherry is wrapping up its year with a few last bits of business, including news of an enhanced version of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and, most excitingly, a first look at Silksong's first big - and completely free - expansion Sea of Sorrow, coming next year.
</p>
<p>
We already knew some sort of Silksong DLC was on the way, of course; Team Cherry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-supported-with-extra-content-for-years-to-come">confirmed plans</a> for post-launch "stuff" shortly after the game's release, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-in-development">reiterated its intentions</a> back in November. Now, though, we've got a much clearer idea of what the studio's been working on. It's first big expansion is called Sea of Sorrow, and it's coming to Silksong in 2026.

<p>
"Voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas in this thrilling expansion", Team Cherry teases, before <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">elaborating further elsewhere</a>. Sea of Sorrow is, as you've no doubt guessed, "nautically themed", and will include new areas, bosses, tools, and more when it arrives as a free update for all players. Expect more details "shortly before" the expansion's release.
</p><p>
Additionally, Team Cherry has announced a Hollow Knight Switch 2 Edition, which will feature similar enhancements to those already enjoyed by Silksong on the platform, including "high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects". It'll be free for owners of the existing Switch version, and there's a free update coming to other platforms too.
</p>
<p>
PC players can check out many of the update's features right now in a public-beta branch available for Steam and GOG. A full list of current additions can be <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">found in Team Cherry's patch notes</a>, but expect to see the likes of expanded controller support, the inclusion of 21:9 and 16:10 resolutions, smoother map panning, and the ability to pause in inventory menus. More improvements will be added before the update's full release next year.

            <p>
Six month after announcing an indefinite delay for Marathon in response to "passionate" community feedback, Bungie has slapped its live-service extraction shooter with a release window and price, confirming it'll launch for PlayStation 5 and PC in March next year for £35.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">formally unveiled its Marathon reboot</a> in May 2023, but it wasn't until April this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">legal challenges</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">more</a> - that the troubled project finally got its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">big reveal</a>. Unfortunately, the response was less-than-positive, and a subsequent alpha playtest proved equally divisive. As a result, Bungie revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Marathon would no longer launch on 23rd September as originally announced</a>, and would instead be indefinitely delayed to make improvements.

<p>
There's been little concrete news on Marathon's progress since then, although Sony chief financial officer Lin Tao did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">reference the title last month</a>, revealing it was still set to release within the company's current financial year. And Bungie has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/marathon-vidoc-highlights-the-extraction-shooters-dark-world-and-survival-challenge/">narrowed that down further</a>, confirming the extraction shooter will launch in March 2026. Additionally, it'll cost £34.99/$39.99/€39.99 - the same price as Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">ill-fated shooter Concord</a>.
</p><p>
Confirmation of Marathon's release window was accompanied by a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J91kh56jiA">20-minute gameplay breakdown</a>, with Bungie outlining a number of enhancements made since April's divisive play test. These include improvements to visual fidelity, proximity chat, a Solo Runner queue, and a "solo scavenger experience" titled Rook. 
</p>
<p>
"Whether you were with us back in April for our first Alpha or you're just joining us now," Bungie wrote on the PlayStation Blog, "there's a rich world full of lore and loot for you to discover when your cybernetic biosynthetic shell takes its first steps into our new world."

            <p>
Following Amazon's decision to 'gut' its video game division in October as part of 14,000 job cuts across the company, Ubisoft has announced the acquisition of one of its studios - Amazon Games Montreal - which is currently working on MOBA March of Giants.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/15/3205660/0/en/Ubisoft-accelerates-in-fast-growing-MOBA-market-by-acquiring-March-of-Giants-game-from-Amazon.html">Ubisoft's announcement</a>, the acquisition includes the rights to March of Giants, and will see the Amazon Games Montreal team join the company. That includes former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a> creative director Xavier Marquis, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-recruits-former-rainbow-six-siege-devs-for-new-studio">joined Amazon in 2021</a> after leaving Ubisoft two years prior.
</p>
<p>
As to why Ubisoft wants March of Giants and its team, the company says the global MOBA games market is expected to "continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030" - and it believes its newly acquired title is "an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game."
</p>
<p>
"March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added in a statement. "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre [Parizeau], Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft notes the terms of its acquisition deal "are not being disclosed", but it does reveal the agreement includes Amazon's commitment to providing marketing support for March of Giants on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Amazon Games Montreal's sale follows radical changes to Amazon's video game strategy in October, when - according to Bloomberg - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">company 'gutted' its games division as part of sweeping layoffs</a>. At the time, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) reportedly told employees the company had "made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs", resulting in "significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team."
</p>
<p>
In the aftermath of Amazon's announcement, it was confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026">ongoing work on its New World MMO would cease</a>, and word emerged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-amazon-dev-suggests-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-following-recent-studio-gutting">suggesting its Lord of the Rings MMO had also been canned</a>.

            <p>The second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation is due to air in just a couple of days time, but don't expect to see Bethesda studio head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> popping up as a cameo.</p>
<p>Many creators and execs have enjoyed appearing in adaptations of their work, with the likes of Stan Lee often cameoing in Marvel films and shows during his time. Fans would look out for Lee cropping up, with his cameos becoming a rather charming addition to the Marvel cinematic universe and beyond.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But Howard isn't interested in doing something similar for Bethesda in Fallout, though he's been asked several times. "They've offered me a whole bunch, even in season one," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-explains-why-he-has-turned-down-all-the-offers-to-cameo-in-the-fallout-tv-show-so-far">IGN</a>, explaining he was "going to be in the sort of Dr. Strangelove Vault-Tec room, where they're talking [about] all the experiments, and some other things."</p>
<p>However, the studio head thinks he is best placed "behind the camera" rather than in front of it. "I said no to all of them so far," Howard furthered, when asked if would perhaps consider being a victim of The Ghoul's. "I don't want to distract," he said. "Everyone goes, 'Oh, there's Todd!'"</p>
<p>But, can he ever see himself being the Stan Lee of Bethesda, even one day? "Not at this time," Howard replied.</p>

<p>The second season of Fallout is heading to Amazon Prime this week, on 16th December (that's a day earlier than first announced). Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>As for other Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>

'Tis the season to be jolly, even if you happen to be ankle-deep in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Yup, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> 2 is getting into the seasonal spirit of giving with a completely free update promising "hours" of new quests and more - all arriving on Tuesday, 16th December.
</p>
<p>
It's been a busy 2025 for Stalker 2, with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> having released numerous significant updates for the well-received open-world shooter - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-roadmap-for-2025-includes-a-life-updates-and-an-upgrade-to-a-new-version-of-unreal-engine-5">major fixes for its troublesome A-Life system</a> - alongside a version for PlayStation 5. And it's now wrapping up the year, with a massive new storyline featuring "hours" of gameplay.

<p>
"Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map," GSC explains <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations... You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is."
</p><p>
And so begins a fresh mystery within the Zone spanning eight new quests and seven locations, including the Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot, and Volkhov SAM. It also promises six new characters, each with their own backgrounds and stories, a unique weapon - specifically the GP37V2, a modified version of the GP37 rifle that only support single and burst fire modes - plus a new hub to create. The latter, assuming you make the right choices on your adventure, will appear in the Burnt Forest, giving you access to a technician, trader, medic, guide, and more.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's big free Stories Untold update arrives for all platforms on Tuesday, 16th December. And if you'd like to know more about its recent leap to PlayStation 5, GSC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-something-that-should-be-happening-in-any-version-of-the-civilised-world-the-struggles-of-gsc-game-world-bringing-stalker-2-to-the-ps5">spoke to Eurogamer back in November</a>, discussing, among other things, the difficulties of continuing development amid the ongoing Russian invasion of the Ukraine.

During the Cold Snap map condition, waters freeze and turn into unsteady ground, vision is limited, and staying outside for too long will damage your raider. You'll have to rush inside to stave off the frostbite.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Flickering Flames event will push the Arc Raiders community to keep things festive. It's all about gathering Candleberries from out in the world, as well as sources of light and heat to keep things cozy down below ground. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-finish-community-event-and-unlock-a-new-map-in-just-one-day#:~:text=Arc%20Raiders%20players%20have%20come,to%20unblock%20the%20North%20Line.">This appears to work like the Stella Montis map unlock </a>did, with raiders having to deposit certain resources back at the hub.</p>

<p>Those who go out and gather Candleberries will earn cosmetics, weapons, raider tokens, new items, and more for handing them in. As such, it's worth booting the game up and getting your foraging gloves on. You'll have until the 13th January to earn everything you want.</p><p>There's also a new Raider Deck coming to the game, starting the 26th December. The Goalie Raider Deck will be totally free and permanent, and will work much like the launch Raider Deck did. It'll come packing lots of rewards as you'd expect, but most importantly a new hockey stick raider tool will be included.</p>
<p>Finally, this December is when the first departure window opens for Arc Raiders, meaning you'll be able to send your levelled up character off to explore the world permanently in exchange for an XP boost and some unique rewards.</p>
<p>With the conclusion of this Flickering Flames event, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-an-impressive-2025-roadmap-and-its-bringing-a-new-map-new-events-and-other-game-changers">we'll have reached the end of that initial roadmap release by Embark Studios</a>. That means what 2026 will hold for Arc Raiders players remains largely a mystery. I, for one, am excited to jump back in, earn some exclusive rewards over the xmas period, and start fresh next year with a new character.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> now has current gen versions available for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Larian's previous RPG, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, was already available on Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. But now it's available on newer platforms with higher resolution and increased framerate. There's also a free upgrade available if you already own the game.</p>
<p>The shadow drop follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-divinity-original-sin-trademark-the-game-awards-statue-larian">leak last week of a PS5 version of the Definitive Edition of the game</a>, so this isn't totally out of the blue.</p>

<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 was first released in 2017 for PC, with PS4, Xbox One, Switch and iPad versions following. While already available to play on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, it's been via backwards compatibility only.</p>
<p>"Hey we weren't meant to announce that yet," wrote Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse on the leak last week.</p>
<p>That leak arrived alongside new trademarks for the Divinity franchise, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">pre-empted Larian's announcement at The Game Awards that the studio is developing a new Divinity game</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement finally solved the mystery of the strange statue in the Mojave Desert. Revealed with a gruesome trailer, Divinity is going to be even larger than Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>Until then, it seems Larian is keen for players to revisit a refreshed Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <p>Exodus looks a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> - let's get that out of the way. Not only does Archetype's space-faring RPG have the same look and the same sensibilities, right down to getting a spaceship and gathering a crew in order to save the day, but it's made by some of same the people who dreamt Mass Effect up, including, notably, lead Mass Effect 1 &amp; 2 writer Drew Karpyshyn.</p>

<p>But what sets Exodus apart is time dilation. If you've seen the film Interstellar, or if you're familiar with actual space-travelling science, you'll know broadly what this means. It's to do with relativity. Time passes slower for objects moving very quickly or in strong gravity compared to stationary observers. The faster you go, broadly speaking, the slower you age. Exodus has this concept at the heart of its design.</p>
<p>"The IP I feel is unique enough - people, once they get into it, will see it," Drew Karpyshyn, narrative director of Exodus, tells me in an interview. "The impact of time dilation is something very unique and fresh, I feel, and we really leverage that. We really lean into it. It's an important part of our IP and a very important part of our story.</p>
<p>"I don't know too many other science fiction properties, especially games... Most of them have instant travel or fast travel between planets. We are staying more hard sci-fi and saying it does take literally years to go [there], so that makes a huge impact in how your choices play out. That, to me, is one of our really defining features."</p>

<p>Information of how time dilation will work in Exodus has been kept intentionally vague. We know chunks of time will pass and that we'll be able to see the longer-term consequences of our role-playing decisions in the game, but we don't know more than that, such as how much time will pass and what kind of consequences we'll face. Are we talking months, years, decades, centuries, or even millennia?</p><p>There are, however, significant clues available in <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/expanded-universe?book-uid=01JTH3Z5HCE277YZKRA13WBXN9#trpg-books">an Exodus companion tabletop role-playing book</a> published earlier this year, which I have to hand. But before I dive into the clues within it, here's more scene-setting explanation from the people making the game.</p>
<p>"Time dilation really only impacts as you start to approach the speed of light," Karpyshyn explains. "When you are travelling within your system, if you're going from Earth to Mars for example, you wouldn't really see the effects of time dilation. Technically it would happen but it'd be hundreds of a second, so it wouldn't be anything anyone would notice. It's more once you get into distances of light years, that's more how it impacts. And that's, again, based on real-world science, so we're trying to follow the rules of actual physics as far as space travel [is concerned]."</p>
<p>As to the question of how much time will pass, the assembled interviewees - which include Archetype studio co-founder Chad Robertson and game director Chris King - are cagey about answering. "It's a dangerous one," says Robertson. "We teased generations," adds King. "We said generations." But how long is a generation? A quick internet search tells me somewhere between 20-30 years.</p>



<p>This tallies with the Exodus TTRPG book. Somewhere near the back, there are tables for a Game Master to use when implementing time dilation-related consequences of their own. These consequences can relate to characters close to the player or they can relate to the world and technological advancements.</p><p>Should you return from an 'exodus' - the game's name for a mission away - with a valuable piece of civilisation-altering technology, for example, you may see it begin to change the world you live in, first hand. You might also see major world events occur which change the shape of the world or societies living in it. World peace could come about, according to another table in the book, or ecological collapse or asteroid strikes or the rise of totalitarian rule.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Here's the Exodus book on my lovely carpet.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a guideline for how much time we're talking about, there are tables related to "anchors" in the game, which are characters the player has a meaningful relation with, which list events in the brackets 0-9 years, 10-30 years, and 31+ years. Events that can occur include people dying or being murdered; people falling in love and marrying and having children; and things like deaths in a family or changing career or self destruction.</p>
<p>There's even a table listing events that can occur long after an "anchor" passes away. Here, consequences are listed in brackets of 0-30 years, 31-100 years, and 101+ years, suggesting much more time can potentially pass. Events in these brackets include biographies being written about that person, or that person becoming a pop culture icon, or even the subject of a film. So when Chris King says "generations" of time can pass, it seems he does mean generations, plural.</p><p>More interestingly, these "anchors" are people you'll consider your best friends, parents, mentors, siblings, partners, and even children, which begs the question of whether the video game will go as far as you having children, too. The passing of time will also probably have an effect on your adventuring companions, too.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Time dilation really only impacts as you start to approach the speed of light"</em></blockquote>
<p>You will gather companions as in a game like Mass Effect, but unlike Mass Effect, your spaceship won't be your travelling hub. Instead, your hub will be on your home planet, meaning that if and when you need to fly away, you'll choose the people you want to travel with - the people who'll experience time as you will. Everyone else will experience time relative to the planet they stayed on, meaning, of course, that you might return to find decades have passed.</p>
<p>"A big difference in, say, Mass Effect, where you hang out on the Normandy quite a bit, [is] we don't really have the same hub structure," King tells me. "You'll go travel in the ship but primarily our hub is back on the home world, so the structure is a little bit different there. But yeah, there's some similarities in terms of getting a ship and going into space and traveling to different places and whatnot.</p><p>"You do bring your companions on the ship with you," he adds. "There are times where you may not bring everyone on a quest. It sort of depends on what's going on. And then when you actually land on a planet, you'll pick two companions that will come join you, but then you can call the other ones if you'd like to swap out or bring someone else in."</p>

<p>Time dilation will be a major part of the Exodus experience, then, and form many of the role-playing conundrums within it - a way of showing you short and longer-term consequences I've been fascinated by in games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>, for example. Time dilation will be a fact of life - and a widely understood risk - for people living in the world.</p>
<p>"They understand it as a phenomenon of their existence," Chad Robertson says, "because it's a real, physical element. And so when Jun [the protagonist] goes on his journeys, much like in Interstellar, they understand that there's going to be some ramification that could happen if things don't go as planned, depending on where the journey goes and how long it lasts. It doesn't make it less shocking; we want it to be shocking to players when there's changes that occur at a big scale, both with the world or with companions and other things.</p>
<p>"We hope the players will accept it once they immerse themselves, that this is just a natural reality of this universe that you have to deal with, and then, my gosh, this decision is something that does matter to me more because I can't control the amount of time passing that may occur based on this journey that I'm about to undertake."</p><p>Exodus is due out in 2027 on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X. Notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him">Exodus stars decorated Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey</a> in his first video game role, and it will also, according to Drew Karpyshyn, feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exodus-release-date-moved-thirsty-compaions-mass-effect-comparisons">a roster of "pretty thirsty" game companions</a>.</p>

            <p>The Tomb Raider: Catalyst team has confirmed where the upcoming game sits in the series timeline.</p>
<p>According to game director Will Kerslake, Catalyst - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">which will see the globe trotting Lara Croft heading to Northern India</a> - takes place after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-underworld">Tomb Raider: Underworld</a>. That's the game where Lara pops along to Helheim whilst wielding Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.</p>

<p>"From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld," <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-catalyst-picks-up-years-after-2008s-underworld-finally-continuing-lara-crofts-story-from-the-legend-trilogy-after-almost-two-decades/">Kerslake told GamesRadar+</a>. He added the more recently concluded Survivor reboot trilogy, which saw Lara taking on Trinity in the likes of Siberia and South America, will still serve as Lara's origin story.</p>
<p>"So we're seeing a more experienced Lara Croft," the Catalyst developer said, before adding you won't need to have played or hold a deep knowledge of the other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> to be able to follow along.</p>
<p>"What's important to know is that this is a new chapter in Tomb Raider," he stated. "So whether you followed Lara from the start, or this is your first Tomb Raider game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is designed to stand on its own as an adventure that can be enjoyed by everyone."</p>
<p>If you want a visual representation of how Catalyst and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">newly-announced Legacy of Atlantis remake</a> fit into the unified Tomb Raider timeline, you can check out the infographic by <a href="https://x.com/FeoUltima">@FeoUltima</a> below.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is due to release next year, while Tomb Raider: Catalyst will be arriving on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam in 2027.  </p>
<p>Over the weekend, Lara Croft actress Camilla Luddington passed her bow and arrows over to Alix Wilton Regan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">sharing a farewell post to the character she had embodied for 10 years</a>. "The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget," Luddington wrote. "I could not be prouder of what we created."</p>

            <p>Nothing spreads the festive cheer quite like spooky things, right? Well, ok, I can think of a few other things that are probably higher up the festive list, but for Megabonk fans, spooky is what's on the cards.</p>
<p>Megabonk's "Spooky Update" was initially meant to arrive on a smaller scale around Hallowe'en, but solo developer Vedinad decided they wanted "to make it bigger", and as things grew, naturally so did the work involved. Anyway, while later than first intended, the spooky update for Megabonk is now here.</p>
<p>As for what it includes, along with some general bug fixes such as the Giant Fork's Megacrit not working as intended, this update also adds new items, a new character and a new map.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Megabonk's Spooky Update, as shared by Vedinad, below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>New Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Map</li>
<li>New Character</li>
<li>New Weapon</li>
<li>New Items</li>
<li>New Enemies and Bosses</li>
<li>New Achievements and challenges</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Game</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made a lot of improvements to FPS late-game</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Giant Fork's Megacrit didn't work</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could buy items you didnt have unlocked</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Frost Walker reset opacity when changing attack speed</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Holy Book was not affected by Particle Opacity</li>
<li>Fixed weird text popup when trying to microwave an item that has already hit its max cap (for example Overpowered Lamp)</li>
<li>Fixed a "bug" where you could just use the full map on the Blind Challenge</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you could reset as you teleported to the next stage to keep your progress and not move to the next stage</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where you got an error if you banished every item except one in a specific rarity and then talked to a shady guy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New Game Setting: Advanced Settings - Will enable certain settings that most players don't need to use. This is disabled by default to avoid making the settings cluttered for new players.</li>
<li>New Game Setting: Shrine Counter -&gt; Shows you how many of each shrine is available, and how many you have used</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show HUD -&gt; Shwo or hide the HUD</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Chest Animation -&gt; Skips the chest animation. Note: You won't be able to banish items from chests if you use this setting.</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Skip Portal Animation -&gt; Skips portal spawn animation (on stage 1)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Enable Silver Pots -&gt; Enable / Disable silver pots (Ghost Item in shambles if you do this)</li>
<li>[Advanced] New Game Setting: Show Item Feed -&gt; Show what items you picked up in a feed at the left side of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balancing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tried to fix the "caveman" bug / exploit where you could hide in caves and enemies wouldn't be able to spawn close to you or reach you</li>
<li>Increased Diceheads passive minimum reward potential (0.02 -&gt; 0.04). Basically his late level up rewards will be twice as high, surely won't be OP</li>
<li>Chunkers now start with one more projectile</li>
<li>Amog Passive now increases in radius every level, from 4 to 12 over 220 levels. Previously it was always 4. Also gain 1 percent Poison Damage per level.</li>
<li>Calcium's passive has been changed slightly. Instead of losing half of his momentum upon taking damage, he now loses about 25 percent, which decreases the higher you level up. At level 110 (max) you lose about 6.6 percent</li>
<li>Cursed grabbies now has a proc per tick limit of 250. Similar items (Spicy Meatball, Ice Cube, etc) already have a limit like this (at 50). It's to improve FPS, but it is probably a slight nerf to Cursed Grabbies if you're veeeryy late game.</li>
<li>Poison Flask starting projectile speed increased 12 -&gt; 16</li>
<li>Dragon's Breath now has 200 percent faster rotation speed, and automatically targets enemies instead of following the player rotation. Damage buff 15 -&gt; 16, duration buff 1s -&gt; 1.5s and damage upgrade offer also buffed 3 -&gt; 4</li>
<li>Noelle passive gives less size per level: 1 percent -&gt; 0.75 percent, and the damage she gains per frozen enemy has also been reduced a bit: 2 percent -&gt; 1.5 percent</li>
<li>Max Silver Multiplier in Final Swarm has changed from 16x -&gt; 8x. People seem to have way too much silver, so it doesn't make sense to have such a high multiplier anyway. At some point it would be nice to create some features that use silver, but im not sure what that would be yet</li>
<li>To address some of the flying meta: Final swarm ghosts will start increasing their speed after 20 minutes have passed. Also, normally, an enemy can only be stunned or frozen 15 times (CC cap) before it becomes immune. After this update, starting at 20 minutes, the CC cap will slowly decrease until they can no longer be stunned or frozen.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Console</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can press f10 to open the console</li>
<li>At the moment, this is only really used to set a specific seed for the dungeon if you wanna speedrun it or something</li>
<li>Type "help" in the console to see all the commands and how to use them</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The action roguelike Megabonk recently made headlines after Vedinad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-megabonk-developer-withdraws-from-the-game-awards-following-incorrect-nomination">withdrew from The Game Awards after being nominated for Debut Indie Game</a>. Vedinad admitted Megabonk was not in fact their debut game, as they had already been making games under different studio names for several years.</p>

            <p>Total War Attila has seen a surge in players recently, thanks to the 1.0 release of an ambitious mod that totally overhauls the game into a Lord of the Rings grand strategy experience. Titled The Dawnless Days, the mod has led to the largest peak in concurrent players for Attila in almost a decade.</p>
<p>The Dawnless Days, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/totalwarattila/mods/1">which you can download on Nexus Mods now</a>, adds a full War of the Ring campaign to play through on a custom map on Middle Earth. It also adds a variety of playable factions that fit with the setting, as well as points of interest from throughout Tolkien's works. As of writing, Eriador is currently barren and unplayable, though the mod team are working on it!</p>
<p>Looking at SteamDB, you can see that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/325610/charts/#9y">Total War Attila has seen a 24-hour concurrent player peak of 11,248</a>. This is the largest number of concurrent players that game has seen since 2016 during a Sega strategy bundle. If the mod were to beat the all-time peak, it would need to surpass 26,346 concurrent players from back during the game's initial release.</p>

<p>The Dawnless Days mod was originally uploaded to Nexus Mods back in June 2020, and has been receiving consistent updates since then. The Dawnless Days team is looking for 2D artists, 3D artists, and animators <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/totalwarattila/mods/1?tab=posts">according to a recent post</a> on the modding platform, though it's emphasised that they cannot and will not accept donations for the project. This is likely due to copyright concerns - no one wants to see a project like this get DMCA struck, after all.</p><p>Atilla might be getting a lease of life - in a very Gandalf the White sort of way - but elsewhere Creative Assembly is pushing ahead with new Total War projects. The company <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPIpN9OKKR4">only recently announced Nagash as the latest lord coming to Total War: Warhammer 3</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-medieval-3-announced-bringing-series-back-to-its-historical-roots-for-25th-anniversary">Total War: Medieval 3 during its 25th anniversary stream</a>. Then of course, who could forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-warhammer-40000-is-finally-actually-real-coming-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc-but-has-no-release-date">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 was announced at The Game Awards last week</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi has stated his latest game, To a T, "didn't sell well" and "wasn't a good fit", expressing the difficulties of releasing more experimental games.</p>
<p>Takahashi is best known for the surreal Katamari Damacy series, which sees players rolling a ball around environments collecting increasingly bigger objects. Takahashi left publisher Namco in 2010 and has since lived in Vancouver and San Francisco while working on other projects.</p>
<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/i-wish-i-had-the-katamari-damacy-ip-to-a-t-was-meant-to-counter-the-downer-vibes-of-2019-america-but-keita-takahashi-says-it-didnt-sell-well-and-fears-it-just-wasnt-a-good-fit/">Games Radar</a>, Takahashi revealed he doesn't own the Katamari Damacy IP (with Namco continuing the series itself). What's more, he's now had to move back to Japan due to To a T's lack of success.</p>

<p>"I don't think anyone tries to make a niche game," said Takahashi of his output. "The title 'niche game' is just a result. I know my games are far from mainstream.</p>
<p>"I recently returned to Japan, and one of the reasons I had to do was because To a T didn't sell well. This is a risk of being independent, and I'm willing to take it, but I don't think it's a question of niche or traditional, it's a question of whether people like it or not."</p>
<p>Takahashi believes there's "still room for new ideas", but "unfortunately To a T just wasn't a good fit".</p>
<p>Published by Annapurna and developed by his own studio Uvula, To a T follows a young child who's stuck in a T pose. It's full of joy and humour, but it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability">also a game about living with a disability</a>.</p>
<p>Takahashi told Games Radar he was inspired by the "downer mood/vibes/atmosphere of the place where we live" and so wanted to "make something very positive and silly".</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, but it's definitely getting harder for me," he said, when asked about the difficulties of releasing experimental games. "If anyone wants to invest in a Uvula, let me know. Let's make more fun and weird games!"</p>
<p>"What ultimately worked for me about To a T, about this frustrating, bewildering, clumsy and ingenious game - and I see this in glimpses, and in little starbursts of my own triggered memories - is its abiding sense of just how luridly weird life is when you're young, how boundless and loosely-ruled it seems," wrote Christian Donlan for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is">Eurogamer about understanding the core of To a T</a>.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade's popularity is no secret, with the game selling exceptionally well <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">during its initial release on consoles</a> as well as its eventual port to PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days">the latter breaking records among similar releases on the platform</a>. ShiftUp is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shift-up-to-expand-stellar-blade-franchise-after-successful-launch-across-multiple-platforms">currently working on a sequel to the game, following the <em>stellar</em> performance of the first</a>.</p><p>Goddess of Victory: Nikke is a totally different beast. A mobile-based gacha shooter, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/goddess-of-victory-nikke-hits-1bn-on-mobile-during-romantic-valentine-event/">the game surpassed $1bn in revenue earlier this year during its Valentines event</a>. It's featured crossovers from various other IPs,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-gets-confirmed-pc-release-and-goddess-of-victory-nikke-dlc"> including Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1l7vlvw/rerun_of_the_nier_automata_x_nikke_collab/">Nier Automata</a>, and even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF1PYiEqYVA">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-for-switch-2-reportedly-in-development">is also due for a Switch 2 release</a>, with the port reportedly in development. When we'll see some new big news for the series remains a mystery, but given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">Stellar Blade sequel was aiming for a 2026 release according to an investor presentation</a>, it shouldn't be much longer.</p>

            <p>After starring in the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy, Lara Croft actress Camilla Luddington has passed her bow and arrows to Alix Wilton Regan with a farewell post to the character.</p>
<p>Luddington made her debut as Lara Croft in 2013's reboot, which saw a young and inexperienced Lara wash up on the shores of Yamatai. The actress then reprised the role for both 2015's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, a new actress has now taken over the role of Lara for upcoming release Tomb Raider Catalyst. As announced at The Game Awards last week, Regan will play Lara Croft in Crystal Dynamics and Amazon's all-new Tomb Raider, as well as in the recently announced remake of the first game, known as Legacy of Atlantis.</p>
<p>Soon after this announcement was made, Luddington said her farewell to the character, adding she has "loved" the Tomb Raider fandom.</p>
<p>"To join the list of Lara Crofts before me was an incredible honour and she will forever be a part of me. The Survivor Trilogy was a decade of adventure I will never ever forget. I could not be prouder of what we created," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSLtUFOgTVj/?igsh=bnU3bDFscmh4amxq&amp;img_index=1">Luddington wrote</a>, with an image of her time filming motion capture.</p><p>"And as always, a new actress receives this incredible gift to step into the boots. 👏💫 So with that said-<a href="https://www.instagram.com/alixwiltonregan/"> @alixwiltonregan</a> .. if you're ever in need of a 🏹 , I know the exact spot to look for one at Croft Manor. 😉"</p>
<figure>

<p>Regan also shared a post following The Game Awards announcement, calling being revealed as Lara Croft the "absolute highlight" of her career. It has "surpassed even my wildest dreams", <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSKc_PVEX6y/?igsh=MWZmank3c2NkNGx2bw%3D%3D">Regan said</a>. "This Lara Croft just wanted to say thank you, and get excited. We are just getting started guys.</p>
<p>"We are Just. Getting. Started."</p>
<figure>

<p>Regan has had a number of other prolific roles before being cast as Lara Croft, including Aya in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, Lea in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>: Overture and Alt Cunningham in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name just three. She was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joanna-dark-actor-asks-fans-to-call-for-perfect-dark-to-be-saved-as-adam-jensens-actor-details-financial-loss-due-to-cancellation">also set to portray Joanna Dark in the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot</a>. </p>

<p>Tomb Raider Catalyst is set to take Lara over to Northern India on its release in 2027, when it will launch across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. As for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">due to be released next year</a>. Needless to say, I am incredibly excited about both.</p>
<p>As well as games, Amazon also has a live-action Tomb Raider TV series from Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the pipeline. Filming is expected to begin next month, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Joining Turner are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-adds-another-major-cast-member">British actor Martin Bobb-Semple in an undisclosed "major" role</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver as Wallace</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm very excited. The scripts are incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty, as we have come to expect from Ms Waller-Bridge," Weaver said last week.</p>

            <p>Veteran developer and the director behind the upcoming Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, Casey Hudson, has dismissed rumours that players will have to wait years for the new game's release.</p>
<p>While Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o">suggested</a> that a release by 2030 "is an *optimistic* guess" given Hudson's studio, Arcanaut, was only founded in July, Hudson was quick to correct the record.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-from-knights-of-the-old-republic-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson">The new Star Wars single-player RPG was revealed at The Game Awards</a> just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-big-star-wars-game-announcement-on-the-way-and-the-title-ends-with-the-old-republic-teases-leaker">days after rumours swirled that a new KOTOR game could be on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Now confirmed as a spiritual successor to BioWare's Knights of the Old Republic, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic hails from Arcanaut Studios and Casey Hudson, who was director of BioWare's Star Wars game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>. It's set to be "an epic interactive adventure across a galaxy on the brink of rebirth where every decision shapes your path towards light or darkness".</p><p>"When we developed the original KOTOR, we wanted to create a definitive Star Wars experience - crafting an adventure that consisted of all the things we dreamed of doing as Star Wars fans," Hudson said when the game was announced.
</p>
<p>"Now, 25 years after we started work on that game, our aspirations are equally ambitious. Fate of the Old Republic represents an opportunity to explore a contemporary vision of a definitive Star Wars experience, using state-of-the-art technology and game design, and an all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars that was at the heart of KOTOR."</p>

            <p>New Vampire Survivors-a-like Codex Mortis is perhaps one of the first games to proudly declare that everything, from its assets and code to the music, is "100 percent AI-driven".</p>
<p>Developer Grolaf, aka Crunchfest, admits the game – which has taken three months to make – is created entirely with AI, with artwork created in Chat GPT, and animations created using "a shader written by Claude Code".</p>
<p>No game engine was used – "it's pure TypeScript", apparently – with the developer explaining "I use PIXI.js for rendering, bitECS for the entity-component-system backend, and Electron to wrap it as a desktop app. The whole thing was vibe-coded with Claude Code (mostly Opus 4.1 and 4.5)." You can see it in action in the video below.</p>

<p>"In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4084120/CODEX_MORTIS/">Codex Mortis,</a> Death is your weapon," the blurb teases (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/this-roguelite-claims-to-have-the-dubious-honor-of-being-the-worlds-first-fully-playable-game-created-100-percent-through-ai-in-a-milestone-for-slop-everywhere/">PC Gamer</a>). "Mix five schools of dark magic, unleash devastating spell synergies, and raise undead armies in this necromantic bullet hell. Infinite builds, solo or co-op – embrace the forbidden and dominate. 100% AI-driven development."</p>
<p>The developer said they started with a prototype "just to see if this was even feasible", and iterated from there.</p>
<p>"Maintaining a consistent art style was tricky, but GPT managed to remember what visual style I liked and kept it consistent across different sessions," he told one commenter. "I just used regular GPT, not the image API. I also couldn't get character animations to work properly, so I went with shader-based wobbling instead.</p>
<p>"First time building something without an engine. Integrating Steam with Electron wasn't as smooth as it is with Unity or Unreal. I tried Tauri first but it doesn't play nice with Steam at all.</p>
<p>"And the most important takeaway: compared to traditional app development, this is way less mentally draining – kind of like giving an exoskeleton to a construction worker lol."</p>
<p>While the game is yet to release, its Steam discussion forums are full with threads entitled "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519723340/">Lmao, this looks like ass</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519724563/">Garbage AI slop</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519752152/">Dangerous slippery slope</a>", and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866343519717962/">100% AI generated - don't buy and don't support this</a>".</p>
<p>There's only one thread that I could find that was ambivalent about its development, which simply asks: "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4084120/discussions/0/842866071372396630/">Why everyone is butthurt about IA [sic] in game development?</a>"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/1pidb5g/my_first_vibecoded_game_codex_mortis_demo_is_live/">Commenters over on r/aigamedev were a little less hostile</a>, although several responses have been deleted, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Those intrigued can try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4095390/CODEX_MORTIS_Demo/">free Steam demo</a>, although that's currently sitting on a 'Mixed' rating, with one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wraitholme/recommended/4095390/">reviewer</a> writing "The [free] demo is, at least, worth the price".</p>

            <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's new patch shadow-dropped earlier this week, and Sandfall Interactive sure wasn't kidding when it promised "challenging boss battles for late-game players to overcome within the Endless Tower".</p>
<p>Along with new playable environment Verso's Drafts, localisation efforts, and costumes, Patch 1.5.0 introduced "new boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower", described as "variations of iconic bosses from the main game, designed to be even more challenging". This includes a brutal reimagining of Simon, one of the RPG's hardest bosses.</p>

<p>Almost unbelievably, the Divergent Star version of Simon is even more challenging than his brutal vanilla appearance, and social media is filling up with players who are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmh5y4/the_new_dlc_is_incredible_the_new_endless_tower/">stumped</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmfxij/ok_so_how_are_we_supposed_to_tackle_this/">shocked</a>, and struggling not just with Simon, but the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1plaela/comment/nttdjz4/">new red ring</a> diving board <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmfgxo/33_centimeters_away_from_glory/">challenge</a>, too.</p><p>"I honestly played many games considered 'hard', but this is driving me insane....," said one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmf9va/are_dlc_bosses_one_of_the_hardest_in_video_game/">player</a>. "I beated [sic] Simon in expert within 10 tries, then Osquio also in expert on my second attempt. But these 4 bosses in the Endless Tower are something else...

<p>Another, in a thread entitled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pmefqk/this_dlc_thing_is_a_joke/">"This DLC thing is a joke?"</a>, wrote: "I finally 'beat' Osqio after hours upon hours of trying. The last battle took about 1.5h, no joke. And then I mistime a gradient attack at the end and it’s all over? No reserve team, no resurrection? So I’ll have to go through those 1.5h again without failing just to get another chance, and probably fail, the gradient parry again?</p>
<p>"I mean overall this DLC is amazing, but this is something I honestly hate. I won’t give this more tries probably, I don’t have 8 hours to waste to get maybe 5 tries at parrying something that leads to instant death."</p>
<p>The previously revealed expansion to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is available right now, as announced at The Game Awards. Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">Sandfall Interactive told Eurogamer back in October</a> the update would include "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo", hinting at a focus on lovable sidekick Esquie. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">The expansion's availability was confirmed by director Guillaume Broche as Expedition 33 won Game of the Year</a>, and the free update comes from the team "as our way of saying thank you" to "celebrate an incredible year".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron has once again publicly congratulated Sandfall Interactive</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, this time for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">securing a record-breaking nine wins at The Game Awards earlier this week</a>.</p>

            <p>Saber Interactive and Boss Team Games has released a developer diary for the upcoming horror, Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival, revealing a little more about what we can expect from the all-new story and its, uh, "mature" themes.</p>
<p>Revealed at last night's 2025 Horror Game Awards, the seven-minute teaser includes an interview with Hellraiser himself, Doug Bradley, who reprises the titular role. In the interview, he revealed that when he heard that a Hellraiser game was on the way, his first thought was: "At last! What kept you?"</p>

<p>As art director Petra Nikolic explained, the game has "a lot of sexual[ly] explicit stuff, and a lot of gore, and a lot of violence", so make sure you aren't next to your kids or your boss before the video clicking above. In fact, game director Emil Esov advises anyone "sensitive" to mature themes should "be wary".</p><p>Esov describes Hellraiser: Revival as a "discomforting and dark story about people with inner voids. It's like a mix between violence and action, all wrapped in leather, flesh, and chains" and said it should appeal to fans of psychological horror and Pinhead himself.</p>
<p>The team also discussed working with noted horror writer Clive Barker, who was keen that the developers "understood the soul" of the work before taking on the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead">The first-ever Hellraiser game – described as a single-player, survival horror action release – was announced in July</a>, with the team behind it all promising the chance to experience the series "like never before". It will deliver a totally new Hellraiser story starring Aidan, who is on a journey to save his girlfriend Sunny from Hell and "the realm of terrors ahead".</p>
<p>"Using the Genesis Configuration puzzle box, unlock dark and mysterious powers as you face dark cultist worshippers, sex-crazed deviants, and infernal monstrosities," the blurb teases. "Arm yourself with various jaw-dropping weapons - some cruel, some strangely fun - but will it be enough to spare you from an eternity of torment?"</p>
<p> Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival has no release date at present, but is slated to come to PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series.</p>

            <p>It took about five seconds to figure out Ghost Town might be something a bit special when I first played it earlier this year. Before you even hit the 'start' option, you're transported to a dingy, moonlit South London car park in the driving rain. Fog drifts over litter-strewn tarmac, police sirens wail unseen in the distance, a concrete council block looms overhead, and just for a moment - even though I've not lived in London for over a decade - it felt a little like coming home. I've got a lot of good things to say about Ghost Town - it's easily one of my favourite games this year - but more than anything, its sense of time and place is utterly transporting.</p>

<p>Ghost Town, which just launched on PSVR 2 following its celebrated release on Meta Quest and PC VR earlier this year, is great at this stuff. One minute you're in a haunted theatre - all dusty red velvet and faded splendour - the next you're on a fishing boat, bobbing on the angry grey waters of the North Sea. London's back alleys are so vividly realised you can practically smell the urine! Wherever it takes you, be it the mortal realm or the planes beyond, its gloomy invocation of 1983 England is wonderfully convincing. This is the era of Thatcher, the bedroom coding boom, the birth of the New Romantics, and the £1 coin - a grimier, greyer, and frankly far more refreshing evocation of the 80s than the overplayed crop-top-and-shopping-mall nostalgia of Stranger Things. Not that any of this stuff directly intrudes upon Ghost Town, but there's an air of authenticity to it all (I say this as a child of Willo the Wisp and Manic Miner) that brilliantly grounds an otherwise fantastical game.</p>

<p>This time, you see, developer Fireproof Games trades the occult Victoriana of its award-winning The Room series for full-on urban fantasy (a refreshing turn, given the genre remains curiously underrepresented in video games), dropping players into a world where magic co-exists with the mundane, where witches and wizards do spywork for the Ministry of Defence, and where something dangerous is stirring deep beneath the streets of England's capital. Amid all this is South London witch, ghost hunter, and protagonist Edith Penrose, desperately searching for her missing younger brother, Adam. Admittedly, Ghost Town's take on urban fantasy isn't <em>particularly</em> radical but what it loses in originality it gains in the telling. And on that front, Fireproof's first-person supernatural mystery adventure is a gem.</p><p>Before I get too distracted by the bigger picture, I should probably say Ghost Town is a puzzle game at heart, and if you've played Fireproof's The Room series, the evolution from that to this is clear. Ghost Town is a game similarly obsessed with <em>manipulation</em>, where interactivity and physicality intertwine in a way designed to draw you deeper into its world. And in a world that feels as richly realised as Ghost Town's, that's a particularly potent combination.</p>



<p>Here, Fireproof takes the fascinating tangibility of The Room's beloved puzzle boxes (which the studio expertly translated from touchscreen swipes to 1:1 movement in 2020's The Room VR) and goes further still. Those wonderfully intricate devices - strange, alchemical contraptions fashioned from magic and machinery - are as well-represented as ever here, and their innate <em>inward</em> nature combines with puzzles spanning outward, forming elaborate chains across entire rooms. It's satisfying stuff, if rarely especially challenging; Fireproof sensibly prioritising narrative momentum over difficulty. But you'll also encounter more mundane interactions (levers to yank, elevator buttons to punch, jerryrigged computers with clicky switches and big, chunky dials) adding another layer of engrossing verisimilitude to Ghost Town's world.</p><p>But back to the telling. It's easy to bandy around the word 'cinematic' where games are concerned, but rarely does it mean very much outside of flashy cutscenes. Ghost Town, though, is properly cinematic as it unfolds around you, with a real flair for a set-piece and some impressive mise-en-scène that's genuinely like being plopped into the middle of your own film. It starts with a flashback; you, Edith, are investigating a haunting in a long-abandoned London theatre, and Adam is tagging along for the first time. It's a brilliantly choreographed opener, immediately setting the tone for things to come - the dialogue feels authentic, the naturalistic performances exude warmth and wit, and the vibe is cinematic in all the right ways.</p>



<p>There's a great little moment just a minute or two in, for instance, as your wanderings around the theatre's tatty foyer lead to a barred set of double doors. You grip both handles with your hands (VR, remember?) then fling them wide, doors swinging open to reveal just the most perfectly spooky corridor - all awkward angles, ominous graffiti, and moody lighting - stretching away beyond. Minutes on, you get a first big 'wow' as the claustrophobic corridor suddenly opens out onto the theatre's cavernous auditorium. And it only gets better from there.</p><p>Soon, the past makes way for the present and you're bobbing along in a tugboat out at sea. Two minutes after, you're dodging seagulls and scrambling up jagged rocks as a perfectly framed lighthouse stands stark against the Scottish sky, waves crashing perilously below you. Still later, a flashback to suburban comforts and a hardcut from day to night; then it's back to the rain-lashed present of your towering tenement block, creeping through its grey concrete corridors. You'll scout out grimy London alleyways, explore long-forgotten Underground stations; there's a sequence set on the sea bed, another that launches you skyward on an out-of-control elevator as your surroundings waver unstably back and forth in time. It just feels relentlessly, effortlessly <em>cool</em>, and always, Fireproof finds fun, surprising new ways to present its action. At one point, a conversation plays out simultaneously across two planes of reality and you're free to toggle back and forth at will - the studio just going that extra mile because, one, it works for the story and, two, because it can. And that's before thing gets <em>really</em> weird.</p>
<p>It's just genuinely fantastic stuff; pacey, propulsive, and consistently engaging across its five-or-so hour runtime, every little element, all that attention to detail, coming together in a way that just feels right. I've played a lot of great games this year, but it's Ghost Town - with its many, many brilliantly orchestrated moments - that's perhaps stuck most stubbornly in my brain. All of which is to say that if you have the means - whether that be on PC VR, Meta Quest, or PSVR 2 - this spooky little trip into the magical underbelly of England is well worth your time.</p>

            <p>Former Striking Distance and Sledgehammer founder Glen Schofield has shared his concerns about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">the sale of his former employer, EA</a>, saying it's a "bittersweet moment" that reminds him of the sale of Activision to Microsoft.</p>
<p>"in the span of just a few years, the two publishing giants who shaped the last 20+ years of our industry have both entered new eras," he said.</p>
<p>"I spent roughly a decade at each company, right in their primes," he wrote to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_ea-and-activision-thank-you-when-the-news-activity-7405032019358851072-hPut/">LinkedIn</a>.

<p>"EA was buttoned-up, disciplined, and structured in a way that forced you to rise to the level of the room. Franchise reviews were intense – no shortcuts, no guessing. You had to know every inch of your game. And they’d challenge you, push you, test you. But when you walked out of that meeting, you knew exactly where you stood."</p><p>Reflecting on his first meeting as an executive producer, Schofield revealed that "being [at EA] felt like a creative all-star lineup", with "so many legends in one place". Activision, by contrast, "was a storm of A-type personalities, but in the best possible way".</p>
<p>"Review meetings were loud, passionate, borderline chaotic, with people calling out questions over one another," he said. "But the questions were sharp, focused, and always aimed at making the game better. A one-hour meeting becoming two and a half was normal and somehow, the time always felt well spent.</p>
<p>"So yes, it’s tough to watch these companies step back from what they once were: major publishers, major developers, and incredible places to grow, learn, and sharpen your craft. They trained generations of us. They made careers. Mine included."</p>
<p>But despite the "bittersweet" nature of his message, Schofield did acknowledged that the "bright side" of the acquisition means others will now be able to step up.</p>
<p>"New leaders. New studios. New publishers. Someone will take that mantle, we always do as an industry. And when they do, I hope they lead, teach, and invest in talent the way EA and Activision did. They set a bar that pushed all of us to be better. They’re both still around, and I sincerely wish them success in whatever comes next.</p>
<p>"From the bottom of my heart, thank you EA and Activision for an amazing run and for everything you helped me become."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Eurogamer reported that Dead Space creator Glen Schofield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-hopeful-eas-new-owners-will-let-him-make-dead-space-4-promising-to-save-them-millions-of-dollars">was "already making calls" to EA's new owners in the hope he can make Dead Space 4</a>. Schofield was executive producer on the first Dead Space game in 2008, and while he wasn't involved in its two follow-ups, he later developed the spiritual successor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> at Striking Distance Studios in 2022. He  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">left Striking Distance in 2023 after the game flopped</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Schofield posted on LinkedIn the games industry is "tough" after failing to obtain financial backing for his latest project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-hints-at-retiring-from-game-development-after-struggling-to-fund-latest-project">hinting he may have directed his last game</a>.</p>

            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has once again publicly congratulated Sandfall Interactive for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, this time for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">securing a record-breaking nine wins at The Game Awards earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has just been named Game of the Year in Los Angeles. A historic first for a French title!" Macron announced on Instagram.</p>

<p>"Great pride for Montpellier and for France. Congratulations to the Sandfall Interactive team. For future generations and those that follow!"</p>
<p>Some commenters, however, have taken the opportunity to remind the President that he once suggested video games had "poisoned" the minds of young people during the 2023 riots, although shortly thereafter, Macron did clarify his position, insisting he only said that because " video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks", adding: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-clarifies-view-on-video-games-after-blaming-them-for-riots">it is this violence that I condemn, not video games</a>.</p>

</span></p><p>"Video games are a culture, an entertainment, a spectacle! They are a ground for artistic experimentation, a fascinating learning space, mixing all the arts," he said at the time. "Playing means listening to music, immersing yourself in stories, feeling emotions, travelling through time. It is exploring visual universes that write a new chapter in the history of art."</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also congratulated Sandfall Interactive back in May, calling its RPG a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">"shining example of French audacity and creativity"</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had a pretty fantastic night, taking home not only the coveted Game of the Year gong, but eight other awards too. It won best narrative, best score and music, best art direction, and best game direction, and was named best RPG, best independent game, and best debut indie game too. Additionally, Jennifer English's turn as Maelle was named best performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wasn't the only winner on the night</a>, of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> won best action game, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> walked away with the best action-adventure prize.</p>

            <p>Eidos Montreal is reportedly developing a new game based on the Alien franchise.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-back-in-development/">Insider Gaming</a>, the new game – described as "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> with xenomorphs" — has been in development since 2020 "under a variety of names", including Marathon, and "switched developers multiple times".</p>

<p>With enemy "Al designed to adapt and react to whatever tactics you use", it's thought the gameplay will balance combat with platforming and puzzles, with an emphasis on stealth and resource management in a single-player arcade survival horror game.</p>
<p>The anonymous source also revealed character names and abilities – such as a grappling hook and magnetic boots – and teased the team "hopes" Sigourney Weaver will reprise her fan-favourite role as Ripley, but this is in no way confirmed as yet.</p><p>Interestingly, the source also intimated that the budget for the game is around £56 million ($75 million) and is hoping to release "for all major platforms" in 2028, which means there's plenty of time for details and mechanics to change between now and then.</p>
<p>Eidos Montreal declined to comment.</p>
<p>Alien actress <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-eyes-alien-actress-sigourney-weaver-for-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver will star in the live-action Tomb Raider adaptation from Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> as Wallace.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-trailer-for-netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-season-two">The second and final season of Netflix's Tomb Raider anime debuted on 11th December. </a></p>

            <p>One of the most headline-grabbing things about science-fiction role-playing game Exodus, beyond it looking a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, is that it stars Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role. He plays the role of C.C. Orlev in the game, a character still shrouded in some mystery, and you can hear his voice narrating the new trailer for the games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/11/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice">But McConaughey recently made headlines by signing a deal that will allow his voice to be AI-generated</a> in certain situations by the company Elevenlabs, which he also invested in. Which begs the question: is it really McConaughey in Exodus or has his voice been AI-generated?</p>

<p>"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," Chad Robertson, co-founder of Exodus developer Archetype, told me in an interview. "He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used.</p><p>"The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific. But my point in this is there's a lot more stuff that's going to evolve that way. So if we ask what our long-term studio stance [on AI] is, we want to be smart technologists, and we want to make great games. And if for cost reasons or quality reasons, that becomes something that becomes more acceptable and becomes more commonplace, I think we're gonna have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves. But currently we don't have plans."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that"</em></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, I asked Robertson specifically whether generative AI was used in Exodus' development at all and it's not. "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it," he said, "but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan.</p>
<p>"We, as creators, have a ton of respect for art in general. And don't you know it's a hot topic with our team when it's come up - it consumes some of our team meetings every Friday. So our team is super passionate about it. But there's an evolution happening in the industry where I think it's going to become more prevalent and become something that everybody's facing."</p><p>Archetype unveiled a new trailer for Exodus during The Game Awards, giving us another montaged look at the sci-fi adventure in which we'll try to escape a tech-related plague by assembling a ship and crew of our own. In the game, we'll play as hero Jun Aslan, a seemingly regular person who happens to be compatible with ancient and powerful tech they'll find through the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exodus-release-date-moved-thirsty-compaions-mass-effect-comparisons">Exodus is a game that looks and sounds like Mass Effect, including in how it has some "thirsty" companion romances</a>, and it's made by many former BioWare developers, including the lead writer of Mass Effect 1 and 2, Drew Karpyshyn. Chad Robertson also hails from BioWare.</p>
<p>Despite the similarities, however, there are some key differences, including most notably time dilation. The nearer to the speed of light you travel at, the more time will pass, allowing you to see first-hand the long-term consequences of your actions. I'll write more about this next week.</p>

            <p>Dispatch developer AdHoc has told Eurogamer there's one super-rare game-state that no player has unlocked or achieved yet - something it knows because it has back-end statistics that track these things.</p>
<p>It's to do with a statistic that reflects how you played as Robert, the main character, which is given at the conclusion of the game.</p>
<p>"At the end of the game, we did a little personality test thing, where it's like, 'your Robert was an everyman', based on how you played the game. Or 'your Robert was an anti-hero'," studio co-founder Nick Herman told me.</p>
<p>"There's actually... I've only seen three show up, and there's four. We know the fourth one is actually really hard to get, intentionally. That's just a piece of content I have never seen, and we have stats on the back-end that show that maybe no one's ever gotten it.</p><p>"It's based on gameplay performance," Herman added. "Have you perfected the game, essentially, is what that is. I don't know that anyone's done that." And it's based on perfecting non-randomly generated outcomes in the game, by the way. "We focused it on the non-RNG elements," said Herman.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>However, there's a catch. There is a chance that someone <em>has</em> played Dispatch in such a way that they should earn this elusive game-state, or response, but it simply isn't registering their efforts correctly. "It might just be a bug," Herman said, casually. "It's so hard to do regardless that we were like, 'Well of course no one's gotten it,' but it's probably a bug."</p>
<p>"We have a permutation that you have not seen because you're not allowed to see it because we broke it," added fellow co-founder Pierre Shorette, the writer of the game, laughing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone">Dispatch, a superhero workplace comedy, raced to 2m sales earlier this year</a>, proving that an appetite for Telltale-like episodic series was still very much there. Attention now turns to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">a possible Dispatch sequel, or second series</a>; to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">potential reinstated sex scenes</a>; and to The Game Awards this week, in which Dispatch is nominated for Best Debut Indie Game. These are all things I spoke to Herman and Shorette about at much greater length. Look out for a fuller interview soon.</p>

            <h2>13th December</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing. This week a Game of the Year contender put Tom to sleep, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>'s DLC posed a real challenge, and Unpacking provides order in a messy world.
</p>
<h2>Blue Prince, PS5 Pro</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>If this is an end-game spoiler, I'm sorry. It just looks like a fish. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Dogubomb/Raw Fury</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's a lot of Game of the Year talk going on around the Eurogamer hallways, doorways, and water coolers (it's just Slack, really), and some people here really love Blue Prince. Being a contrarian, I obviously didn't get on with it at all when I gave it a whirl around release earlier in the year. I'm willing to be proven wrong about things (doesn't often happen, mind), so I booted it up on the PS5 again this week to see if I'd just been in the wrong frame of mind for it.</p>
<p>I fell asleep on the sofa after about 20 minutes. Maybe you'll get me at some point, Blue Prince, but your puzzle magic hasn't cast its spell on me yet.</p>
<p><em>-Tom O</em></p>
<h2>Elden Ring: Nightreign, PC</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>I (Tom) wrote all the captions, which is why this one says zilch about Nightreign, a game I know nothing about. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Bandai Namco/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the release of The Forsaken Hollows DLC, I've been spending a lot of time playing Nightreign, and lost my third controller to the game this year. This loss was admittedly not the result of stick-drift or me spamming light attacks so much that RB ceases to work, and instead was thanks to me spilling an energy drink on said controller as I queued for a game.</p><p>Anyways, Nightreign's DLC is exceptionally tough, with Day Two bosses that put the Nightlords who follow them to shame, honestly. It's even tougher when your team is one man down because they're mopping up Monster Energy from their desk, but hopefully you haven't had to have that experience.</p>
<p><em>-Kelsey</em></p>
<h2>Unpacking - Xbox Series X</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>We all wish we could provide the sene of order that comes so easily in Unpacking. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Witch Beam</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's something quite soothing about spending time pulling things out of boxes and putting them away in Unpacking. Plucking out a spoon set and deciding which part of the cutlery organiser it should go in has become quite calming. Especially when I'm currently surrounded by wrapping paper, labels, tags, and things I said I would get to last weekend but they're all judging me from a precarious pile in the corner of the room. But it's all fine, at least I'm organised in Unpacking...</p>
<p><em>-Marie</em></p>
<h2>Metroid Prime 4 - Switch 2</h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Go on Samus, give us a word or two? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a big fan of the Metroid series, I have far too many thoughts to unravel on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> than there's space for here. I desperately want to like it (not least because my partner bought it for me as a gift) but despite its outstanding art design and music, it feels so far removed from what I expect from a Metroid game - from the elongated exploration and world design, to the lack of horror atmosphere. I know it's hard to improve on the perfection of Prime 1, and I don't bemoan the developers for experimenting, but after 18 years of waiting I feel deflated. Good luck to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> next year, I guess.

            <p>Employees at Doom studio id Software have voted in favour of union representation with the Communications Workers of America (CWA), which has been recognised by Microsoft.</p>
<p>The decision follows QA workers becoming the first group at Microsoft to form a union with CWA representation back in 2023. It means id Software is now a wall-to-wall union, including developers, artists, programmers, and more.</p>
<p>"The wall-to-wall organising effort at id Software was much needed; it's incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives," said CWA Local 6215 organising committee member and id Software producer Andrew Willis.</p>

<p>"The union is a way for us, the developers, to take back control of the industry we love and to ensure that it delivers high-quality products from high-quality workers who have health benefits and longevity beyond quarterly profits."</p>
<p>With this representation, it means there are now almost 4000 union-represented workers at Microsoft altogether.</p>
<p>"I'm very proud to be a part of this effort to organise our studio, to have a voice in decisions  that directly affect myself and my coworkers," said CWA Local 6215 organising committee member and id Software senior VFX artist Caroline Pierrot.</p>
<p>"In an industry that has proven to be very unstable over the last few years, more unions means more power to the workers and a real shot at shaping the future of the industry for the better."</p>
<p>In addition, members of the United Videogame Workers CWA union held a demonstration outside The Game Awards ceremony last night in acknowledgement of cancelled video games, studio closures, and layoffs.</p>
<p>The United Videogame Workers was launched earlier this year by the CWA as an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/communications-workers-of-america-announces-industry-wide-united-videogame-workers-union">industry-wide union of video game workers in North America and Canada</a>.</p>
<p>Back in May, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cwa-negotiates-new-contract-for-zenimax-including-substantial-wage-increases-and-a-credits-policy-for-qa-staff">CWA negotiated a new contract with ZeniMax Media staff at Microsoft</a> that set "new standards for the industry".</p>

            <p>Resident Evil Requiem's dual protagonists will represent two styles of gameplay, which its developers describe as like "jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna".</p>
<p>At last night's The Game Awards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">Capcom revealed Leon Kennedy will indeed be playable</a> in the next mainline entry of the horror series, after plenty of fan speculation and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-leak-confirms-leon-will-be-in-resident-evil-requiem-after-all">leak earlier in the week</a>. Since then, director Akifumi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa have shed more light on how the dual protagonists will differ.</p>
<p>"Grace is 'the biggest scaredy-cat in Resident Evil history'," Nakanishi told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/">Automaton</a>, while "Leon is a seasoned veteran, so seeing how those personalities interact is part of the fun."</p>

<p>He also confirmed the two characters are "almost equally split", with a similar structure to 3DS game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-revelations">Resident Evil Revelations</a>.</p>
<p>"I've said before that Leon isn't well suited to horror," said Nakanishi. "Since quiet sections where you cower before monsters don't fit him, his chapters focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action. Grace's sections, on the other hand, are the scarier ones. We're really emphasising the difference in their experiences this time."</p><p>He continued: "It's almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together. Early on, we worried players might not be able to keep up, but now we feel that the contrast gives the game a unique rhythm, like jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna. It was important to combine the slow and fast segments well, and Grace and Leon turned out to be the best combination for that. Leon also has lots of new actions, giving you a strong sense of release compared to Grace's sequences."</p>
<p>As such, Grace's sections resemble <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, while Leon's will be closer to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. After all, these are arguably the two most popular games in the series.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the two characters and their differing gameplay styles also speaks to the "tension and release throughout the game" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet">Nakanishi previously told Eurogamer</a>. "That's something that I think Resident Evil is really unique with among horror games," he said. "We don't just scare you - we offer you a chance to release that tension by overcoming it all."</p>
<p>Nakanishi also spoke to Automaton of Leon's design, who's been refined into an 'ikeoji' - slang for a cool and attractive older man. "There are plenty of Leon fans inside the company too, after all," said Kumazawa.</p>
<p>Added Nakanishi: "Also, this is Leon's first return to Raccoon City since Resident Evil 2, so seeing how he responds to the 'place where it all began' now that he's older is another major point of interest."</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released next year on 27th February across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Steam. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">Resident Evil 7 and Village will also be coming to Nintendo's console</a>.</p>

            <p>UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has responded once again in the continuing war of words with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> developer Rockstar, this time describing the studio's latest statement, on its controversial firing of 34 employees, as an attempt to "reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals."</p>
<p>The IWGB's statement comes after several back-and-forth claims between the two parties. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstar-is-still-insisting-its-controversial-firing-of-employees-had-nothing-to-do-with-unions">Rockstar's own, most recent response</a>, issued yesterday, saw the studio claim the employees in question had "distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations," and that "claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p>
<p>That in turn came<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests"> after a report from People Make Games in late November</a>, which claimed the workers were fired for conversations which took place on an invite-only Discord server for employees and IWGB union members. Most conversations held there were focused on salaries, bonuses, and other HR issues, the report said - topics protected by the Equality Act of 2010 and relevant to the union members.</p>
<p>The employees were initially fired for what Rockstar called "gross misconduct", before it was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">accused of union busting</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">subjected to a lawsuit from the IWGB</a>.</p>
<p>The IWGB's latest full response reads:</p>
<blockquote>"Rockstar's latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation - they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals. Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterise workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as "leaking information". It is hard to understand this statement as anything but a desperate attempt to deflect from the global scrutiny they have come under over the last month. From the UK Prime Minister in the House of Commons, to the game developers across the world erupting in protest - all eyes are on Rockstar and their lawless attack on the people who make them their billions."</blockquote>
<p>The likely trigger for this statement from Rockstar - which had previously refused to comment on the People Make Games report - and the ensuing IWGB response is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer mentioning the situation in parliament</a> earlier this week. There, he called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning" and promised MPs would look into it.</p><p>"Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union," Starmer said. It was the second time the issue had come up in UK parliament, after it was raised by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West, back in November.</p>
<p>Notably, the UK's Labour government had made workers rights a key part of its election manifesto, and is currently aiming to push its flagship employment rights bill through the House of Lords. That context places an additional spotlight on Rockstar, while in the last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-workers-europe-fight-back-against-exploitation-ai-layoffs-historic-milestone-union-efforts">protests have taken place both in the UK and abroad in support of the fired Rockstar staff</a>.</p>

            <p>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve is releasing in 2026, publisher Bandai Namco has revealed. The game, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, was announced during last night's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>It's been seven years since Ace Combat 7 (and JPEG dog - if you know, you know), so this next entry is being developed on Unreal Engine 5 for the first time. Bandai Namco is promising an "emotionally charged" campaign, plus multiplayer modes, although firm details won't arrive until next year.</p>
<p>The first trailer for Ace Combat 8 can be viewed below:</p>

<p>In the campaign players will take on the role of an ace pilot (are there any fighter pilots who aren't ace?) in the fictitious Strangereal, with a fairly classic sounding plot that sees you fighting against the odds alongside three new pilots. Will you be able to be able to live up to the hopes of the people of the Federation of Central Usea? I assume yes, as it won't feel very heroic otherwise!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> released on PS4 and Xbox One back on 18th January, 2019. A PC version arrived two weeks later in February, while a Switch port was released onto Nintendo's hybrid console on 11th July, 2024.</p>

            <p>Film adaptations of video games are pretty hot at the moment, with the likes of The Minecraft Movie and The Super Mario Bros. Movie making big money. Next year we're getting a new take on Street Fighter, and now we've got the first look at it in action.</p>

<p>The trailer, which clocks in at under one minute, shows off many of the movie's (and game's) main characters, including Guile (wrestler Cody Rhodes), M. Bison (David Dastmalchian), and Akuma (wrestler Roman Reigns). If you know what you're looking for you can see Guile's flash kick and the classic car smashing bonus stage from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>

<p>Neat, right? What's even neater is the car carrying the same IC29 licence plate from the game.</p>
<p>Street Fighter is releasing in cinemas on 16th October, 2026. The latest game in the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, released back in June 2023 on PS4, PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S, and was followed by a release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> for the console's launch in June this year.</p>
<p>What do you make of the trailer, and did you spot any more moves from the games? Surely it's got to be better than the Jean-Claude Van Damme-starring adapation from 1994.</p>

            <section><p>You can smash through Terminator 2D: No Fate's story mode in less that the runtime of the movie, but that doesn't stop this side-scrolling action platformer from being a perfectly presented tribute to 90s nostalgia.</p></section>
<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate's story mode opens with a shot of a rolling stretch of tarmac, its yellow centre lines infinitely scrolling past at regular intervals as moody, industrial music plays out behind it. It's a sight that should feel familiar to any fan of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, as it's similar, but not identical, to the final scene of the movie's theatrical release. The monologue that accompanies it is different too, delivered in the game by blocks of text rather than by Sarah Connor's distinctive whispered voice from the film.</p>

<p>In the movie this scene neatly ties up the story with lessons learned, offering the viewer a hopeful glimpse at a better future. But at the beginning of No Fate a large chunk of exposition tells us of the horrors that await us during Judgement Day and beyond, setting up the events of the game that follows. Despite the differences, this feels incredibly authentic to the atmosphere of James Cameron's juggernaut of an action movie, instantly tapping into a vein of T2 nostalgia, while at the same time being handled differently enough to give the game its own unique flavour too. That's the Terminator 2D: No Fate experience in a nutshell really. It's incredibly faithful to the source material, but it's also not afraid to mix things up a bit or add in some unexpected alternatives in order to best serve the gameplay.</p>
<p>Bitmap Bureau's Terminator 2D: No Fate isn't just a love letter to one of the greatest movies ever made though, it's also a tribute to 90s gaming, of Super Nintendo side-scrollers and arcade action games. People who lived through that era will immediately notice similarities between No Fate and the Contra/Probotector series as you run left to right, shooting enemies and occasionally jumping up or down onto different parts of the scenery, but other influences from the time are felt here too. The tutorial level, a brand new scene that doesn't feature in the movie, opens with an homage to Double Dragon as John Connor is punched in the gut and then slung over the shoulder of a musclebound bad guy.</p>

<p>Later that same level, enemies lean out of windows and shoot down at Sarah and you, unable to shoot in any directions other than horizontal, vertical or diagonal, need to position her in just the right way to take them out - just like in the Robocop arcade and home computer games from the late 80s. There are side-on vehicle chase sequences where you need to watch the edges of the screen for oncoming obstacles <em>a la</em> Battletoad's frustrating Turbo Tunnel level (although in No Fate it's nowhere near as aggravating) and Double Dragon's overpowered elbow smash also makes an appearance, albeit in the form of a backhand from Arnie during the game's wonderful barfight level.</p><p>Bringing the comparisons back to Contra though, No Fate's Future War levels where you play as a grizzled John Connor are heavily inspired by Konami's action shooter series. Featuring a very familiar defensive wall boss, weapon pickups that grant things like split shot fire or homing plasma bolts and even a faux Mode 7 set piece where an HK Bomber flies at the screen and napalms the ground. These levels create fun flashbacks to games gone by, whilst also adding in a few simple extras that should satisfy those with more modern appetites, like being able to take cover behind walls or roll out of harm's way. Once the heady buzz of a bunch of rememberberries wears off though, you'll soon realise that these sections are the weakest parts of the package.</p>

<p>You see, No Fate is absolutely at its best when it's trying something different. When it's not being a simple Contra clone it's taking scenes from the movie proper and turning them into playable moments that not only mirror the events of the film, but also add to them in interesting ways. The famous barfight where a naked Arnold asks for clothes, boots and a motorcycle is a good example, as the scene gets extended slightly and momentarily turns the game from a shooter to a beat-em-up, complete with a cheeky little juke box based musical Easter egg. Another highlight is Sarah's escape attempt from Pescadaro Hospital, where she's chased relentlessly by the T-1000. This level briefly turns No Fate into a stealth game which somehow manages to be incredibly tense <em>and</em> feature a jumpscare or two, even though it's all presented in big chunky pixels.</p><p>And what pixels they are. No Fate's retro aesthetics are gorgeous, marrying old school digitised film stills for cutscenes between levels, with stunningly animated sprites during the actual gameplay. Highlights of these include the way Sarah's body swings from side to side due the momentum caused by jumping up and onto the rungs of a ladder, or the start of the aforementioned hospital escape level where the T-1000 kills and then copies the coffee-drinking hospital guard. Out of countless examples I could mention though, I think I love the way the T-1000 staggers backwards as Sarah shoots him with a shotgun the most.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bitmap Bureau</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fluidity in the way that this character is animated embodies Robert Patrick's cold, calculating performance from the films to a tee. It's genuinely chilling to see him melt out of a wall in front of you in the Steel Mill level and then morph into that iconic cop disguise. It reminded me of that feeling of helplessness and dread that ran through my body the first time I watched the movie. So too with that stagger animation as Sarah unloads a shotgun into his chest, however this time the fear is replaced by a feeling of badassery, as his shoulder is hammered backwards by buckshot and silver pockmarks appear on his torso. Yes Sarah! You've got this! This game translates Judgment Day's most epic moments into pixel form in such a perfect way that it's a real shame that it's all very short lived.</p>
<p>Obviously, as a 90s style side scrolling action shooter, brief levels and a short story are to be expected. There weren't as many 90-hour-plus games back then as there are now, that's for sure, but it is possible to smash through the entire Story mode in under an hour and have everything on the main menu unlocked in less than three. This design choice is accurate to old school arcade games that had to be completed in one sitting, mind. The brevity of this experience is fine if you're planning on doing multiple playthroughs, but if you're a one and done kind of person you might feel a bit short changed when the credits roll.</p>



<p>There are a couple of incentives in here which are designed to encourage you to replay the game however. Aside from the four different difficulty levels or trying to best your previous times or scores there are also two alternate endings to aim for, a couple of extra levels to play through, a cheat menu that can be accessed by completing the game on the hardest setting and there are even modes like Boss Rush and Infinite Enemies to unlock, although it's doubtful that these two will hold people's attention for long. Arcade mode and the unlockable Mother of the Future modes add extra challenges by removing continues and shuffling the level orders a bit but they're all still the same game deep down.</p>




<p>Thankfully each level includes a nice amount of variety in the form of its hazards, which keeps things pacy and interesting throughout. There's a huge selection of metallic monstrosities to fight in the Future War levels, including Hunter Killers, Centurions and of course a couple of different types of Terminator, while in the levels set in 1995 to more traditional action platformer perils to avoid, like super hot steam vents, timed lasers and even some of those squishy squashy piston things. None of these obstacles are that tough to bypass, especially after you've been through each level a couple of times over and have memorised their layouts, but they are plentiful enough to cause some mild concern over the health and safety standards of the time. I'm not sure what Cyberdyne was thinking when its building was constructed, but flame-belching exhaust ports on staircases seem like a lawsuit waiting to happen if you ask me.</p>
<p>It's obvious that Bitmap Bureau has a huge amount of love and respect for not only the source material but also the moment in time that Terminator 2: Judgement Day was released and this makes Terminator 2D: No Fate an absolute treat for gamers who grew up in the 90s. With sounds and visuals that will transport you back to when you watched the best bits of the movie for the first time and gameplay that will remind you of wired controllers and inserting coins and cartridges, No Fate itself is a little bit of a time machine. Although thankfully it's not one that will send a naked man back in time to kill you. Despite a very short run time which may be offputting for some, I'll be back for at least a couple more playthroughs before the year is out, so recommending it to you lot is no problemo at all.</p>

            <p>Sigourney Weaver has accepted a role in Amazon's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> from Phoebe Waller-Bridge.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-eyes-alien-actress-sigourney-weaver-for-live-action-tomb-raider-series">reported Weaver was in talks to star in the live-action adaptation</a>, but nothing had been finalised at that time. That's all changed now, though, with Weaver confirming she will join the Tomb Raider cast when filming begins next month.</p>

<p>"I am going to be in Tomb Raider," the actress revealed to <a href="https://x.com/DEADLINE">Deadline</a> while on the red carpet for her new film, Avatar: Fire and Ash. "I'm very excited. The scripts are incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty, as we have come to expect from Ms Waller-Bridge."</p>
<p>Weaver added she has been a fan of Waller-Bridge's for a while now, so is "delighted" to be a part of the Tomb Raider series.</p>
<p>The actress also revealed the character she will play is called Wallace. "A famous English name," she closed, "not always very popular, wouldn't you say."</p>

            <p>
Mega Man! It turns out Capcom hasn't forgotten about the blue robo-dude with the 'tude - last seen in his own mainline game seven years ago - after all. The publisher has unveiled a brand-new entry in its beloved action-platformer series, but you'll need to be patient as it's still a while away from release.
</p>
<p>
Mega Man: Dual Override, as Capcom's newly revealed instalment is officially known, takes a similar 2.5D approach to 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mega-man-11">Mega Man 11</a>, marrying the series' classic side-scrolling action to a 3D (and very pastel) artstyle. All this is coming to Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox, and Steam.
</p>
<p>
If you were hoping for any additional information, however, you're out of luck. Capcom's reveal offered a few seconds of presumably early in-game footage and little else. According to the tiny bit of text accompanying its trailer, though, it'll see players "override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers".

<p>
Mega Man's return is, of course, long overdue, and the main downside to all this is the wait. Mega Man: Dual Override isn't set to release for PC and consoles until 2027 - just in time for the series' 40th birthday.

            <p>The Game Awards has only just wrapped, but already we've already got another (vague) date in our calendars: January 2026. Per an interview with Microsoft’s president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, in <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/">Variety</a>, Xbox will be hosting one of its Dev Direct streams in January.</p>
<p>"I can't share exactly what's there, but we've got a lot of stuff that we're shipping next year," he told the site. "In fact, usually Dev Direct is about highlighting what's coming up for the year ahead. This year, we've got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show</p>
<p>"So I will tell you that Playground Games is going to be in the Dev Direct, but we'll have more stuff next year to ship than we can fit into one Dev Direct show in January, which is a good place to be."</p>
<p>For clarity, that means we can probably expect updates on the upcoming Fable game and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> series, and perhaps a couple of updates from other games that come under the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> umbrella.</p>
<p>This comes after we saw very little from Xbox at The Game Awards proper (you can catch up on all the announcements here), whilst PlayStation made an appearance with a number of games being worked on by PlayStation Studios. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eagerly-awaited-chinese-action-game-phantom-blade-zero-finally-gets-a-release-date-and-yes-its-still-a-ps5-console-exclusive">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, Marvel Tokon, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/housemarques-saros-gets-new-trailer-and-a-short-delay-to-its-release">Housemarque's Saros</a> all have some form of PlayStation relationship that means they'll be console exclusives.</p><p>We did see a new trailer for Diablo, and the shadowdrop of a new class for the game (the Paladin). But besides that, it's been a pretty quiet night for the company. At least <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a> won an award in the Games for Impact category, though.</p>
<p>Microsoft is having a hard time of it, lately. Between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-cannot-work-out-what-this-terrible-new-xbox-game-pass-advert-is-trying-to-say-but-i-know-microsoft-has-once-again-missed-the-point">a series of baffling adverts</a>,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-absent-landord-execs-are-only-part-of-a-much-bigger-problem"> growing mistrust and disillusionment with its execs</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price increases for Game Pass</a>, there is a lot of wariness around the brand. It doesn't help that there is <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/sign-pledge-boycott-microsoft%E2%80%99s-xbox#:~:text=No%20Games%20For%20Genocide%20are,is%20a%20priority%20BDS%20target.">a growing call from the BDS movement to boycott the gaming platform</a> due to parent company Microsoft's reported complicity in Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian population and state.</p>
<p>Overall, the picture for Xbox right now looks pretty rough. As a new year looms, I imagine the folks in charge of the gaming arm of the Microsoft empire are keen to get the gaming audience back on-side.</p>

            <p>The Game Awards 2025 have come and gone, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">Clair Obscur coming away with the coveted GOTY accolade</a>. But, among the awards at the awards show, there was also a very generous smattering of trailers and reveals. And rounding out those trailers and reveals as part of Geoff's big finale was Highguard.</p>
<p>Highguard is a shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of a number of ex-Respawn developers who worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. It sees players using blasters and such while also riding on the backs of spectral beasts, which I found quite jarring at first I won't lie. But, unlike quite a few things we saw this evening (morning), Highguard did come as a surprise!</p>
<p>"From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Steam page's official description</a>. "Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter."</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for Highguard below.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Neon Giant, Swedish developer of cyberpunk shooter-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>, has unveiled its new game No Law at The Game Awards 2025. The game is in development for PC, PS5 and Xbox S/X, and will be published by South Korean company Krafton. There's currently no release date.</p>
<p>No Law takes the action first-person, whereas The Ascent was quasi-isometric, and creates an experience which looks superficially like CD Projekt Red's blockbuster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. However, as I discovered talking to the team before the TGA reveal, No Law will be a more condensed kind of experience, and one made by a much smaller team - there are 24 people working on the game there.</p>
<p>"We focus a lot more on making something that feels more deep and dense and layered," studio co-founder Tor Frick told me in an interview, "instead of making it very big. So the actual physical footprint on a map for Port Desire, where this takes place, is pretty small by open-world standards. We don't really have any open fields; we don't even have big parking lots. It's not about going to that mountain over there, it's about: there's an open window up there, or that rooftop looks interesting. It's more about that kind of scale and that kind of exploration."</p>
<p>Vengeance is the aim in No Law. You play as a retired military veteran called Grey Harker, who's living a quiet life, a bit like Jon Wick, when trouble finds him again. And how you go about exacting that vengeance is up to you. "The narrative is nonlinear," Arcade Berg, another studio co-founder, with possibly the coolest name ever, told me. "We encourage you to figure out how you want to solve everything yourself, and we will make sure that the game responds to that - responds to how you choose to play, be that playstyle or certain decisions you make."</p><p>A large part of No Law will feel familiar to people who play immersive sims such as those made by Arkane, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>, although without the time-looping mechanic of course. "It can be fairly similar to a lot of these games that you're thinking about," Berg told me, "especially when it comes to the gameplay. I am an immersive sim fan - basically everyone in the studio is. If you want to play it that way, you should. The game will be great. That is one way to play the game." But, he added, there is also a story-led way to enjoy the game if you prefer a more linear shooter experience.</p>
<p>No Law will have dialogue choices and character ability customisation and development. There will also be varying ways you can approach combat, be it via stealth, hacking, or kicking the front door down and charging head-first in. "We will give the player all the tools," said Frick. "We will never tell you when to use them or not use them. It's completely up to the player how to tackle each scenario."</p>
<p>Neon Giant's previous game The Ascent was released in 2021 to middling reviews. "The Ascent's arcology setting is splendid, if heavily derivative - shame that all you can do here is gun and grind," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-ascent-review">wrote Edwin in Eurogamer's The Ascent review</a>.</p>

            <p>The annual Geoffs are over for another year, leaving a massive Clair Obscur-shaped celebration in its wake. Not unexpectedly, developer Sandfall Interactive's highly acclaimed RPG was crowned Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025, but what about everything else? Let's find out!</p>
<p>All in all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> had a pretty fantastic night, taking home not only the coveted Game of the Year gong, but eight other awards too. It won best narrative, best score and music, best art direction, and best game direction, and was named best RPG, best independent game, and best debut indie game too. Additionally, Jennifer English's turn as Maelle was named best performance. That's a big old chunk of wins, but it did leave a few awards for other games too. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> won best action game, for instance, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> walked away with the best action-adventure prize.</p>
<p>Fists were a-flying in the best fighting game category, but Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves ultimately took home the crown, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> was deemed best strategy game/sim. Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> drove out the competition to win best sports/racing game, and Donkey Kong Bananza put on its most wholesome face to be named best family game. As for multiplayer, Arc Raiders got the top spot, while No Man's Sky was recognised for its ceaseless evolution as the best ongoing game. And high five to The Midnight Walk, which briefly removed its helmet to accept its award for best VR game.</p>
<p>And still we're not done. South of Midnight came top in the Games for Impact category, and Doom: The Dark Ages took the award for innovation in accessibility. As for the Players' Choice award, that was secured by Wuthering Waves. The full winners list is a lengthy one, however, so let us switch to a more digestible format now. You'll find everything - from best mobile game to best esports team - below, with the winner of each category highlighted in bold.</p>

            <p>It's finally official: we're getting a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 40,000 game. It's finally been announced at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-the-game-awards-2025-with-us-live-how-to-watch-and-when-does-it-start">The Game Awards 2025</a>.
</p>
<p>Controversial actor David Harbour appeared on-stage with GEoff Keighley to profess his love for the universe and announce that he also has a starring role in the game. In a trailer, we saw some Ultramarines engaging with an army of Orks.</p>
<p>But the most impressive thing is some gameplay we see taking place in an urban enviornment before the camera pulls back to see the planet... and then the galaxy. With ships engaged in combat across the system. If that's the scale we're looking at here, we're in for a good time.</p>

<p>"Total War’s award-winning fusion of turn-based strategy and colossal real-time battles descends into the grim, science-fantasy universe of Warhammer 40,000," reads a statement from developers Creative Assembly.</p>
<p>"In the Era Indomitus, the galaxy is aflame with endless war, and every soul’s survival hangs by a thread. Take command of iconic factions, customise your war machine, and engage in devastating battles as you carve a bloody warpath across the stars.</p>
<p>"There is no time for peace. No respite. No forgiveness. There is only war."</p>
<p>You will be able to lead campaigns across the void with four radically distinct factions, each forged with their own unique array of lore-inspired gameplay features, devastating weaponry, apocalyptic war machines, and methods of warfare.</p>
<p>Here are the four confirmed so far:</p>
<blockquote>● Space Marines: Genetically enhanced weapons of war, these warriors are few in number but near unmatched in power. Clad in sacred armour and wielding the Imperium’s most deadly weaponry, each strikes with devastating and unyielding precision.

● Orks: Brutish hordes of destruction, they are unrelenting, countless and live for war. Storming the battlefield in endless mobs, they brandish unpredictable weapons and clanking war machines - all driven by the primal power of the WAAAGH!

● Aeldari: An ancient and waning xenos race, who once ruled the stars, but now rail against their certain fate. Swift and elusive, they strike with psychic precision and elegant weaponry, exploiting weakness before vanishing into shadow.

● Astra Militarum: The massed ranks of humanity’s largest fighting force are a bulwark of flesh and steel. Their legions of soldiers' march beneath the roar of battle-tanks and the thunder of artillery, grinding enemies into ruin with disciplined fury and sheer determination.</blockquote>
<p>Creative Assembly also wants to make it clear we'll be able to "personalise our armies" and "modify our warriors". This means you'll be able to name your warband, choose its sacred colours, and emblazon its regiments with an array of iconography that strikes fear into the hearts of enemies. You can also tailor your faction’s combat philosophy for both campaign and battle, arming them with your own unique fusion of devastating tactical abilities, signature traits, and arcane wargear.</p>

            <p>Chinese action game Phantom Blade Zero finally has a worldwide release date: 9th September 2026.</p>
<p>The news was announced by developer S-Game at tonight's The Game Awards, with a trailer showing some fresh story scenes and a tonne of gameplay.</p>
<p>You can check it all out in the video below - it's looking awesome.</p>

<p>That release date has been eagerly anticipated. The game was first revealed back in 2023 at a Sony showcase, and quickly garnered attention. Details have since come in drips and drabs, with a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-trailer-shows-fresh-gameplay-but-its-still-without-a-release-date">Year of the Snake trailer shown at the start of this year</a>.</p><p>As for how it plays, I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-is-speedy-stylish-and-absolutely-not-a-soulslike">hands-on at Gamescom in 2024</a> and loved its fast and stylish combat. And to be clear for the millionth time - it is not a Soulslike, something the developer has frequently reiterated since Phantom Blade Zero's initial reveal.</p>
<p>Then, at GDC earlier this year, I spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-aims-to-beat-black-myth-wukong-and-revive-the-golden-age-of-kung-fu-cinema">creator "Soulframe" Liang about the key influences on the game</a>. It's been likened not just to FromSoftware's games, but the likes of Ninja Gaiden and Devil May Cry too. "But for us," said Liang, "it's hard to label our game as a pure Souls game, nor hack and slash. It's just something in between. It's a way to tell a story."</p>
<p>"We want to call back the golden age of Hong Kong kung fu movies from the 1970s, starting from Bruce Lee and then Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Donnie Yen," he continued. "The trend has faded out since the early 2000s so we want to go back to that and try to bring the trend back."</p>
<p>The game is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">following in the footsteps of the phenomenally successful Black Myth: Wukong</a>, as one of many Chinese-made action-RPGs alongside the likes of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tides-of-annihilation-continues-to-look-awesome-in-new-dimension-shattering-gameplay">forthcoming Tides of Annihilation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-soul-aside-lacks-the-spirit-of-its-inspirations-id-rather-play-devil-may-cry-again">PlayStation-published Lost Soul Aside</a>.</p>

            <p>To quote a certain Skywalker: "Now this is pod racing!" (almost).</p>
<p>At today's The Game Awards, the lid was lifted on Star Wars: Galactic Racer, which as I am sure you have surmised is a Star Wars-themed racer. More specifically, it is a "runs-based, high-stakes reinvention of racing born in the lawless Outer Rim of the Star Wars galaxy", to quote the development team at Fuse Games (I am quoting as much as I can, because it is nearly 4am). </p>
<p>"With the Empire gone and the galaxy rebuilding, The Galactic League is formed: an underground, unsanctioned circuit where syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged. No Force. No prophecy. Just skill, strategy, and the will to rise."</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for Star Wars Galactic Racer below. It looks like a lot of fun, and something I will absolutely get my brothers to play with me when the time comes. </p>

            <p>
If you've been feeling a lacks of bumps in the night since purchasing your brand-new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, developer Kinetic Games has some spine-tinglingly good news for you: terrifying ghost-hunting horror game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> is making its way to Nintendo's platform next year.
</p>
<p>
Phasmophobia, which was a big hit when it launched into Steam early access back in 2020, sends teams of up to four players on a chilling adventure across a  variety of spooky locales - from suburban homes and tiny diners to high schools and campgrounds - in an attempt to identify the spirits who reside there.
</p>
<p>
To that end, you've got access to a range of tools - including Spirit Boxes, EMF Readers, Thermometers, and Night Vision Cameras - used to gather and cross-reference evidence that'll help you figure out exactly what sort of supernatural entity you're dealing with. It's brilliantly atmospheric stuff and properly scary (particularly on VR devices), especially seeing as you can communicate directly with the departed using your own voice.

<p>
Phasmophobia - which has already sold over 25m copies - got an early access release on PlayStation 5, PSVR2, and Xbox Series X/S last year. Its full 1.0 launch is scheduled for 2026, bringing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-years-phasmophobia-overhaul-will-be-so-significant-it-will-feel-like-playing-a-new-game">significant changes</a> - but it's not yet clear if the newly announced Switch 2 version will coincide with its arrival or if it's targeting a completely different date.
</p><p>
Phasmophobia has, of course, had a pretty big 2025 already. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-has-earned-itself-a-movie-adaptation-from-m3gan-and-five-nights-at-freddys-production-company-blumhouse">movie adaptation has been announced</a> courtesy of Blumhouse, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-ghost-hunting-phenomenon-phasmophobia-work-as-a-board-game-were-about-to-find-out">board game version is on the way</a>. It's also seen a number of significant updates, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobias-new-nells-diner-map-gets-a-release-date-and-will-be-an-example-of-how-the-team-want-all-maps-to-feel-going-forward">addition of Nell's Diner</a>, and its festive Winter's Jest event begins on 16th December. And if you're curious how its success came about, Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">chatted with its creator Daniel Knight</a> earlier this year.

            <p>
Housemarque's forthcoming sci-fi shooter Saros has received a new trailer at tonight's The Game Awards, as well as a slight delay.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-look-at-housemarques-returnal-follow-up-saros-out-next-march">Sony previously announced the game would be out on 20th March next year</a>, but now it's set for 30th April.
</p>
<p>
Below is the new trailer showing more of the game's story - and Jane Perry returns!
</p>

<p>
Perry was Selene in the studio's previous game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, so it's great to see her back in a new role.
</p>

<p>
"Saros is the haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse," reads the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/saros-out-april-30-new-trailer-reveals-gameplay-story-details/">PlayStation Blog</a>. "You play as Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer who will stop at nothing to find who he is looking for."
</p>
<p>
There's an ensemble cast this time around, and seemingly more of an emphasis on story. There's also a mysterious corridor to explore, presumably a bit like the home in Returnal.
</p>
<p>
As for the studio's "bullet ballet", Saros has a new parry move to bounce back all those neon shots. It's looking brilliant!

            <p>Rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz has been revealed as a villain in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s Bond origin game, 007 First Light.</p>
<p>Kravitz plays Bawma in the upcoming release, a character said to be "the largest black-market dealer in the Western Hemisphere", who shares the actor's physical likeness.</p>
<p> As well as dabbling in the black-market, Bawma is also "as charismatic as he is unpredictable", IOI shared. This is all shown off in the latest teaser for 007 First Light, which has Bawma giving a short but conceited speech about the city of Aleph being "an extension of [his] being". He then deals with those who have crossed him in a suitably Bond villain-y way. You can check it out below.</p>

<p>Along with Bond and The Hunger Games, Kravitz has also starred in films such as Shotgun Wedding with Jennifer Lopez and The Butler with Forest Whitaker.</p>
<p>
"The Bond franchise has such an incredible legacy in video games, so to step into it with a brand-new character like Bawma is amazing," shared Kravitz. "He's magnetic and unpredictable, there's danger in him, but also heart and purpose. He's not just a man with power; he is a man who has to fight for every inch of it. </p>
<p>"Bringing that energy into 007's world felt incredible."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-leak-spotlights-one-of-the-games-villains-and-it-probably-isnt-who-youre-expecting">Kravitz's inclusion in 007 First Light actually leaked earlier today</a>, when the above trailer went live ahead of schedule. But, that is all water under the bridge now. 007 First Light will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and PC on 27th March next year. It has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a> at this year's Game Awards.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

            <p>A from the ground up remake of the original Tomb Raider has been announced at The Game Awards.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/major-tomb-raider-announcement-leaks-ahead-of-the-game-awards">leaked earlier today</a>, this remake is known as Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. It places players back in the shoes of Lara Croft as she hops from country to country in search of the Scion of Atlantis. </p>

<p>Unlike the original game and the remastered collection that was released last year, this version of the first Tomb Raider has a certain cinematic 'Uncharted-ness' to it.
</p>
<p>Lara, meanwhile, has had a bit of a makeover, with her character model in Legacy of Atlantis sporting the classic tank top and short shorts look, but with the jade necklace first introduced in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot. You can see how it all looks in the new Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis trailer below.</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is a stunning reimagining of the 1996 genre-defining game," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>"As Lara Croft, harness your wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time-from the jungles of Peru to the ancient ruins of Greece, the deserts of Egypt, and a mysterious Mediterranean island shrouded in myth. Traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators as you hunt for the scattered pieces of the Scion, an artifact of immeasurable power.</p><p>"Whether you're a veteran raider or new to Lara's world, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis delivers jaw-dropping visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, modern game design, and new surprises, while honouring the spirit and atmosphere of Lara Croft's debut adventure."</p>
<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is set for a release in 2026.</p>
<p>Along with the remake, Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> entry with Amazon. It's known as Catalyst, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">and we got a little look at it this evening</a>. </p>

            <p>Crystal Dynamics and Amazon's all new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> has, after years of waiting, finally been revealed.</p>
<p>It is known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst, and as previously rumoured sees a more mature Lara Croft back on her globe-spanning adventures, this time popping over to India for a spot of tomb raiding.</p>
<p>A new trailer, which you can see below, shows Lara using her dual pistols, which makes me very happy. Also, if you think Lara sounds different, that's because she is now played by Alix Wilton Regan (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>).</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them," reads the official blurb. </p>
<p>
"When the most notorious treasure hunters from around the world descend on the region, Lara races to uncover the truth buried beneath the fractured landscape and stop those who would use its power for their own gain. As the ancient world collides with the present, Lara must decide who to trust among rivals and allies to prevent a catastrophe and protect a secret that could reshape the future."</p>
<p>Tomb Raider: Catalyst is expected to release some time in 2027, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. I am beyond excited! </p>

<p>As for Tomb Raider more generally, in addition to today's game announcement, Amazon also has a live-action TV series in the works, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">with Sophie Turner set to play Lara</a>. Earlier this week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-eyes-alien-actress-sigourney-weaver-for-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver was also in talks to star in the show</a>, which is due to begin filming next month.</p>

            <p>You know when you see Remedy's name attached to a project, you are going to bear witness to a surreal and mind-twisting series of events. But with its newly announced action-adventure Control sequel - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-control-trademark-sparks-speculation-remedy-will-be-making-a-the-game-awards-announcement">now officially known as Control Resonant</a> - the studio has taken what it does best, and turned the volume up to 11, thanks to a warped Manhattan hellscape complete with kaleidoscopic pigeons and paranatural entities.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">many had surmised earlier this year</a>, Control Resonant players will take on the mantle of Dylan Faden, the brother of Control's Jesse. And, while Jesse had her gun, Dylan has a mammoth shapeshifting melee weapon, known as the Aberrant, and by the looks of things he will certainly need it as he makes his way through the perception-bending city. You can check out the announcement trailer for Control Resonant below:</p>

<p>"After years in confinement at the hands of the Federal Bureau of Control (FBC), Dylan Faden's former captors are deploying him at the peak of a supernatural crisis," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>"Charged with combating a mysterious cosmic entity as it alters fundamental aspects of our reality, Dylan must harness his new found powers to take the fight to the myriad threats overwhelming Manhattan. On the path to unlocking the full potential of his supernatural abilities Dylan will also seek out his sister, FBC Director Jesse Faden, as he struggles to comprehend and contain the dangers that have spilled beyond the confines of the Oldest House to tear the world apart."</p>
<p>Creative director Mikael Kasurinen said Control Resonant will land players in an "expansive, reality-warping playground of choice, power, and consequence" on its release, adding you won't need to have played the first game to still enjoy the upcoming sequel.</p>

<p>"We've made this one easy to pick up and hard to put down," the developer said. "We're pushing the scale beyond anything we've done before, elevating combat, exploration, and storytelling into a bigger, more memorable experience.</p>
<p>"It's ambitious, a little wild, and we can't wait for players to get lost in it."</p>
<p>Control Resonant is planned for release in 2026 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, and Mac via Steam and the App Store. Will you be playing?</p>

While Remedy's announcement did not indicate a reason for Virtala's departure after 11 years at the company, it followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">profit warning to investors</a> "due to weak sales" of the studio's multiplayer Control spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>

            <p>
Frictional Games, the studio behind the acclaimed Amnesia series, has unveiled its latest endeavour: a "spiritual successor" to its existentially harrowing sci-fi horror Soma. It's called Ontos and it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC next year.
</p>
<p>
Ontos takes place on a repurposed moon hotel known as Samsara, which players - in the role of Aditi Amani - are drawn to following an invitation from their estranged father. As Frictional explains, however, Samsara is no ordinary outpost and is instead a place "where reality fractures [and] where truths are buried beneath layers of deception and obscurity."
</p>
<p>
"Venture through repurposed spaces where the surreal becomes captivating," it continues, "labs built in lavish casinos and dramatic theatre stages; experiments set up in emptied pools; strange machines built in ancient moon caves, and much more. Every corner of Samsara tells a story, and every story has something hiding beneath the surface, waiting to be found."

<p>
The studio is calling Ontos a sci-fi mystery featuring "tactile, systems-driven gameplay" and an immersive narrative. There's talk of materials to scavenge, machinery to manipulate, and ancient analogue systems requiring hands-on interaction - with ingenuity and research said to be your most valuable tools.
</p><p>
"Ontos presents a gauntlet of chilling experiments and disturbing encounters that push the boundaries of both science and morality," Frictional elaborates. "Each test invites you to peel back another layer of a world that takes you one step closer to the ultimate truth. Confront existential questions that will make you question the nature of the soul, suffering, and the very fabric of reality itself... Your choices echo forward, and you must be prepared to face the consequences. Foresight is paramount, but even what you judge to be the best moral actions can lead to devastating outcomes."
</p>
<p>
It's certainly intriguing stuff, even if Ontos' precise nature remains a bit of a mystery right now. Expect more to be reveal in the run-up to its release next year, and you'll find a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924520/ONTOS/">little extra information over on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-reveals-dungeons-dragons-game-warlock<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
        

        <p>"We're not trying to simulate the tabletop RPG experience."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We've been waiting to find out what the new, internally made Wizards of the Coast Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game will be, and now we know: it's a third-person action adventure game called Warlock which is pulling on open-world and immersive sim ideas - and stars Battlestar Galactica's Tricia Helfer. Perhaps more to the point: it's not <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-dd-owner-wizards-says-of-course-we-want-to-do-a-successor-to-baldurs-gate-3-we-wonder-who-will-make-it-and-what-kind-of-game-it-will-be">a follow-up in any way to Baldur's Gate 3, as some people, like me, had expected it might be</a>.</p>
<p>Warlock is in development at Invoke Studios, which has a surprisingly large team of around 180-200 people working on the game, though it's not due until March 2027, as I learned during a press briefing ahead of The Game Awards reveal. And note: while the name Invoke might be unfamiliar, the studio was previously called Tuque Games, which you'll know if you played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-review-a-bad-first-impression-but-its-a-grower">the rather disastrous Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance game from 2021 - a game I was probably too lenient on in my review</a>.</p>
<p>Tuque rebranded to Invoke in late 2022, and the Warlock team assured assembled press during the presentation Q&amp;A that it had little to do with the Dark Alliance game that preceded it. "Ultimately, we're a different team," said studio lead Dominic Guay, who joined the team after Dark Alliance was released, coming from a Ubisoft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> background. "They're focused on making a game that is in a genre that they've - many of them - mastered in the past, as much as we can master any genre in this industry."</p>
<p>So, what is Warlock? We didn't see any gameplay - that's coming next summer - but a cinematic trailer showed a raven-haired and dark-eyed female Warlock using her telltale dark magical powers to lay waste to undead creatures and other iconic Dungeons &amp; Dragons foes.</p><p>"Warlock is a third-person action adventure game built around immersive, expressive magic," Jeff Hattem, VP of creative at Invoke, explained after the trailer was shown. "You use that clever spellcraft across all axes of the game, whether it's exploring the world, solving challenges, taking down monsters, and you do it all in your own creative way, with all spells in all facets of the game."</p>
<p>The main character is Katri, who is obviously a warlock, a kind of character in Dungeons &amp; Dragons who has their magic bestowed upon them by an enormously powerful being, usually as part of a bargain or deal. We don't know who Katri's patron is but keen-eyed people assembled in our press group noticed the raven feathers on Katri, suggesting a possible link to the Raven Queen, who perhaps most famously was used during Critical Role's Vox Machina campaign.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Our focus is on making a video game first, so an immersive, single-player, open-world experience"</em></blockquote>
<p>Note, however, that while this game is D&amp;D based, "we're not trying to simulate the tabletop RPG experience, so there's no dice rolling", Dominic Guay said. "Our focus is on making a video game first, so an immersive, single-player, open-world experience, but it's definitely set in the universe of Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>"So if you're not familiar with Dungeons and Dragons, you're not going to feel friction like you're missing information to understand the story or the game world; you're going to get everything you need to figure out the mysteries of the world. But if you are a fan of the brand of the universe, then I think you're going to be surprised and excited about what we're doing, how we're heavily leaning into the lore and the universe of D&amp;D."</p><p>Actual gameplay details were intentionally limited during the presentation, but it sounds like you'll be a lone adventurer in the game, as in RPGs like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> or Elder Scrolls - or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-darkmessiah-pc">Arkane's Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic</a>, which was name-checked by Wizards' moderator at one point, perhaps tellingly. "You can meet characters but you're going to be focused on the immersion from the eyes of Katri," Guay said.</p>
<p>A better clue as to the game's overall direction might come from the studio's make-up instead, populated as it is by a lot of former Ubisoft Montreal developers, including Guay. "So if you think about games like Far Cry or Watch Dogs, these are games that were trying to have that approach, where, as a player, you can understand the systems and you can play with these systems, and this is definitely how we're thinking about building games. It's part of the DNA of this team, for sure," he said.</p>
<p>"And when you're talking about immersive sims, it's the same thing at a different scale. They're less wide, big, open worlds, but they're also about understanding how things work in the world, discovering, experimenting. So this is definitely part of our DNA."</p>
<p>Warlock constitutes one major part of Wizards of the Coast's big internal push towards making video games. The other is Exodus, a sci-fi RPG made by Archetype Entertainment, that looks a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and is also due to be released in early 2027.</p>

            <p>Exodus, the sci-fi role-playing game that looks more than a little like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, has had its release pushed back a bit. It's now expected in early 2027 rather than 2026.</p>
<p>Developer Archetype Entertainment revealed the early 2027 date at the end of a new Exodus trailer aired at The Game Awards. Exodus, remember, stars Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role. The video showcased the game's main character Jun Aslan and outlined his overarching task to find the right ship and the right crew and save the world. It's a montage of gameplay footage that seems visually improved from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-exodus-gameplay-gives-next-gen-mass-effect-vibes">the Exodus reveal trailer aired last year</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to The Game Awards, I attended a press presentation for Exodus to learn more about the game, which I'll share fuller thoughts from soon - particularly as it relates to the game's key point of difference: time dilation.</p>
<p>As a teaser: "As you progress throughout the game you will go on missions where you leave the world. And as we've mentioned, time dilation is a big part of our IP, so when you leave the world, a few days will pass for you, but years will pass for everyone back home. That's a known fact of science," explained narrative director Drew Karpysyn, who was the lead writer of the first two Mass Effect games.</p><p>"So the faster you travel in space, the closer you get to light speed, the slower time moves for you. So by the time you get back home, years will have passed. So you will see the impact of the choices you made before you left. All the things you've done will change the world in very dramatic ways. And every time you come back, you'll see these changes sort of propagating across the game, across years, across generations."</p>
<p>But I also wanted to share something Karpyshyn said about the way Exodus will handle companion relationships and romance, because they absolutely will be here, presumably involving some of the characters seen in the new trailer for the game. Though not, apparently, the octopus in the space suit, Salt - they're off limits.</p>
<p>"One of the appeals of companions is the romances," said Karpyshyn. "We definitely have worked hard to make as many of them available as possible. We do have quite a few options. We let you, for want of a better term, play the field a little bit. You do have to work for it a little bit but they can be pretty thirsty, let's put it that way. But of course it's a game of consequences too so you have to be careful. You can get yourself into a sticky situation where maybe you have to make some choices."</p>
<p>He said there were also people we could have more platonic relationships with, and that the game might even cater to more business-minded relationships, or political relationships, potentially even of the arranged kind. "We are about Traveler dynasties," he said, "which gets into some interesting relationship prospects. The idea of arranged couplings to further the broader goals of your dynasty is something we touch on.</p>
<p>"It's hard without getting into specifics but I think the folks who are looking for some interesting action are going to find it," he added.</p>
<p>Archetype co-founder Chad Robertson, also formerly of BioWare, made an interesting comment in relation to being consistently compared to Mass Effect. "Many of us hail from BioWare and certainly are proud of our time there and the contributions we made there," he said. "We would be honoured to be compared to a game like Mass Effect. It's certainly one of the hallmarks of space opera science-fiction trilogies. If we can achieve that ourselves, we'd be thrilled to be in that space. And certainly that's our goal, to be a standout science fiction RPG that fans love for many decades to come.</p><p>"If you look at the talent base that we have at the studio, it's much more than just BioWare, though," he added. "We've got talent from some other marquee studios in the industry that I think have helped shape Exodus into its own form and its own game that we hope stands out, even above and beyond some of the things that you experience in a traditional BioWare game. But we also don't want to leave those lessons behind that we learned there too."</p>
<p>Exodus is in development for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X.</p>

            <p>
Fans conspired, and Capcom said no. Rumours swirled and still Capcom appeared to say no. And even after irrefutable evidence surfaced, the developer kept its lips sealed - until now. Leon S. Kennedy has finally <em>officially</em> been confirmed as a playable character in the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem - and much like Chris Redfield before him, the one-time twunk extraordinaire has formally been brushed with the taint of middle age.
</p>
<p>
Resident Evil Requiem (AKA Resident Evil 9) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">got its grand unveiling</a> back in June from Capcom, with its debut trailer introducing us to protagonist Grace Ashcroft - daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from previous Resi games - as well as a decimated Racoon City. It didn't take long for chatter about a potential Leon S. Kennedy appearance to surface, but Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">seemingly dismissed the rumours outright</a> when Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi revealed the character had been considered and rejected as the new game's protagonist, because, "He's actually quite a bad match for horror."
</p>
<p>
However, that didn't entirely distinguish the flames of hope among fans for a potential supporting role, particularly when Nakanishi emerged again to confirm Requiem would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who">feature characters from previous games in the series</a> - just "don't over-expect or hype it", he warned, seemingly aiming his words at Leon stans. And then came a leak pointing to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-leak-points-to-a-second-playable-character-and-it-isnt-leon">completely different second playable character</a> and it looked like Leon's chance had finally been and gone. Until, that is, artwork very prominently featuring a grizzled Mister Kennedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-leak-confirms-leon-will-be-in-resident-evil-requiem-after-all">popped up this week on the PlayStation Store</a>. The game was up, and Capcom has now - via a Game Awards showing - made Leon's role official.

<p>
The new trailer not only showed Leon in a new version of his iconic jacket, but also a snippet of shooting gameplay. It also revealed villain Victor Gideon, who seems to have links to Umbrella.
</p>
<p>
Resident Evil Requiem launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam on 27th February next year, and it's shaping up to be a particularly nerve-fraying series outing. Poor Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">made a right racket when he gave it a look for Eurogamer</a> earlier this year.

            <p>The mystery of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s demonic demon statue in the desert has been solved, and it belongs to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian, as suspected. More to the point, the statue was there to promote Larian's just-announced new role-playing game Divinity.</p>
<p>The game will be the next entry in Larian's homegrown Divinity series, which began back in 2002 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, but didn't really take off until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> was released in 2014. (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-on-signing-baldurs-gate-3-approaching-a-new-era-and-games-youve-never-heard-about">I once spoke to Larian founder Swen Vincke about Divinity's origins</a> and the studio had tried to make Original Sin as its first game, in the late '90s, before being pulled out of position by publishers.)</p><p>

You can check out the new trailer for Divinity below (it is quite something!).

<p>On its announcemet, Larian founder Swen Vincke said: "Despite our long history with the series, this is our first game entitled 'Divinity'. We're ready to bring everything we've done previously into one place. This marks the beginning of something with more breadth, depth, and intimacy than anything we've created before. We've been building toward this moment ever since we took our fate into our own hands. </p>
<p>"This is the Divinity weve always wanted to make and you're going to have loads of fun with it."

<p>The mystery of the desert statue has been building since the start of December, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">The Game Awards creator and host Geoff Keighley shared a photo of a gruesome kind of doorway</a>, decorated by various creatures in tortured poses carved as if trying to break free from it. The doorway seemed to stand alone in the Mojave Desert. Speculation quickly arose around what the doorway could be promoting, ranging from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-statue-fromsoftware-lords-of-the-fallen-studio">a possible FromSoftware game</a> to something from Diablo, Doom or God of War.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-divinity-original-sin-trademark-the-game-awards-statue-larian">the connection to Larian was made</a>, the clues coming from new Divinity trademarks registered in Europe, the logos for which bore more than a passing resemblance to the spindly legged design of the statue.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Larian</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The question of how Larian would follow Baldur's Gate 3 has been whizzing around ever since that game captivated the game-playing world in 2023. Larian has always been fairly open about its desire <em>not </em>to do a sequel but move onto new things. To that end, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">Larian announced in 2024 that it was working on two new projects</a>, both based on the studio's own franchises, or IP - the most well known of those obviously being Divinity.</p><p>"After six years in [Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting] Forgotten Realms and much discussion and rumination, we've decided to seize this opportunity to develop our own IPs," Swen Vincke said at the time. "We're currently working on two new projects and we couldn't be more excited about what the future has in store."</p>

"When we developed the original KOTOR, we wanted to create a definitive Star Wars experience - crafting an adventure that consisted of all the things we dreamed of doing as Star Wars fans," <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer">said Hudson</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Now, 25 years after we started work on that game, our aspirations are equally ambitious. Fate of the Old Republic represents an opportunity to explore a contemporary vision of a definitive Star Wars experience, using state-of-the-art technology and game design, and an all-new story crafted specifically to deliver on the combination of player agency and immersion in Star Wars that was at the heart of KOTOR."
</p>
<p>
It won't be a sequel or continuation of KOTOR, then, but will be following in its footsteps.
</p>
<p>
The game is in early development for PC and consoles, so there's no release date just yet.

            <p>During this evening's (morning's?) Game Awards pre-show, Capcom treated us all to another look at its long in the pipeline astronaut and small girl-starring game, Pragmata.</p>
<p>Along with the footage, the studio announced that Pragmata will also come to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> on its release on 24th April, in addition to previously confirmed platforms. A Diana amiibo is on the way, as well. </p>
<p>On top of that, Capcom has also said there will be a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3357650/PRAGMATA/">gameplay demo to try out available on Steam later today</a>. A demo will then come to other platforms down the line, so keep your eyes out for those. </p>

<p>Once upon a time, Pragmata was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcoms-next-gen-project-pragamata-wont-launch-until-2022">planned for a 2022 release</a>, having been originally revealed in 2020. Now, after a few delays, it is slated to release next year.</p>
<p>"The result is a fascinating mix that was only better in its more difficult and more thought-provoking proper hands-on than it was in the two previous proof-of-concept style demos," our Alex wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pragmatas-unique-action-and-puzzle-blend-may-grab-the-headlines-but-as-its-creators-explain-its-secret-sauce-is-all-about-rhythm-1">Eurogamer's Pragmata preview</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The creator of Mario + Rabbids has revealed his next game, and it's a send up of the games industry as a mascot platformer: Bradley the Badger.</p>
<p>Davide Soliani - affectionately known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-ubisoft-crying-man-did-next">Ubisoft Crying Man</a> - joined with writer Christian Cantamessa (Red Dead Redemption, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor) to found new studio Day 4 Night. Bradley the Badger is its first game.</p>
<p>The adventure will blend live-action and animation as the titular creature explores a variety of unfinished worlds and would-be reboots of his series, each a different genre, as a parody of the games industry - it's been compared to Wreck-it Ralph and Who Framed Roger Rabbit.</p>

<p>Key to gameplay is The Kit, which allows Bradley to modify unfinished assets and solve puzzles, while smacking enemies with a frying pan.</p>
<p>And it looks like there will be plenty of tongue-in-cheek game references too. Badgerborne I'm very interested in.</p>

<p>"We wanted to make something that would reignite us, something capable of taking us back in time to when, with younger eyes, the whole world of videogames seemed to shine," said Soliani. "And we wanted our mechanics to be the perfect bridge between the past and the future."</p><p>"Bradley is part love letter to videogames and part satire of them," added Cantamessa. "Games are an art form and this is a story inspired by our adventures making them. From the inner turmoil of self-doubt to the joy of building worlds, we set out to transform those experiences into a game that anyone can get lost in."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-25-years">Soliani departed from Ubisoft last year</a> after 25 years at Ubisoft, 11 of which were spent on the Mario + Rabbids tactics games for Nintendo Switch. "I have decided to leave Ubisoft to embark on a new adventure," he said at the time. "I can't say more now. Thanks a lot for everything, truly."</p>
<p>Then earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-rabbids-creator-says-players-want-unique-independent-games-willing-to-tell-different-stories">the developer pair revealed Day 4 Night</a>, stating they were working on a "passion project".</p>
<p>Soliani noted there's "a growing interest from the player towards games that are a bit, let's say, out of the chorus. They are a bit different. They are willing to tell different stories…that's what we are observing as developers and as players."</p>
<p>Bradley the Badger certainly seems to fit the bill.</p>

Soon after, the company claimed the affected staff were let go due to gross misconduct, but this didn't appease UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB). The organisation swiftly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a> following the dismissals, again noting that all those affected were members of a union.</p>

<p>Rockstar has now doubled down on its defence, stating that unions and any union related activities were not a factor in its decision to dismiss staff. </p>
<p>Rather, Rockstar claims its former employees "distributed and discussed" confidential studio information regarding game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in a public forum, which breached "company policy and their legal obligations".</p>
<p>You can read Rockstar's full statement, as shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">IGN</a>, below:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations.</p>
<p>"Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p></blockquote>
<p>A previous report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">internal company messages were being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers</a>, rather than on a public forum.</p>
<p>In the last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-workers-europe-fight-back-against-exploitation-ai-layoffs-historic-milestone-union-efforts">protests have taken place both in the UK and abroad in support of the fired Rockstar staff</a>.</p>

<p>Rockstar's latest statement on the matter comes just one day after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK prime minister Keir Starmer called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning"</a>. The PM added that ministers would be looking further into these dismissals.</p>
<p>"Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union," Starmer said.</p>
<p>This was the second time in the last month Rockstar has come up in parliament. Back in mid- November, the issue was raised by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West.</p>
<p>"Video game giant Rockstar has sacked more than 30 workers across the UK, including my constituents working at their Edinburgh office," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Jardine said at the time</a>. "I urged Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again."</p>

            <p>A leaked trailer for 007 First Light - the Bond origin game from Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> - has shined a light on one the villains set to appear in the upcoming release. And, they are played by a name you will likely recognise, but perhaps not expect.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential 007 First Light spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/#post-148736176">leaked trailer for 007: First Light</a> reveals that American rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz will star in the upcoming release as Bawma, who shares Kravitz's likeness. The footage, which evidently went live earlier than intended, shows Bawma sitting in a rather plush armchair, monologuing a bit as many Bond villains seem to find themselves doing.</p>
<p>"I am sometimes asked 'Bawma, how is it that you hear every whisper, of every corner of Aleph'," Bawma says. "And I answer, I have built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole self. This city is an extension of my being. My body. And today, it became infected."</p>
<p>Bawma then gets his cronies to launch some poor soul into a pit of crocs alongside Bond. "Easy girls," the villain coos.</p>
<p>It is fair to assume Kravitz's inclusion in the upcoming game was meant to be revealed at The Game Awards later this evening, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">007 First Light is nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a>. So, stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>007 First Light will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and PC on 27th March next year.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

I am mightily intrigued about Larian's new game, obviously - as I'm sure you all are. Is it really going to be a Divinity game as the leaks suggest? 
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, it makes sense to push the Divinity brand, especially because it's established and, arguably, Larian will never have a bigger platform than post-BG3 to push it from. But I was also rather hoping for something new. Something sci-fi, even.

<p>
Donald Trump's FIFA World Cup 2026: Has AI generated cover art showing Trump scoring the winning goal in the final. Trump is available as an in-game character, with "infinity plus one" in every stat, but is locked behind a paywall. All proceeds to Donald Trump.
</p>
<p>
Half Life 3: But it's a Skibidi Toilet crossover, because that's the only way the kids have interacted with the property and it needs to be kept relevant. 
</p>
<p>
The Last Of Us Part 3 Pre-Mastered: The PS7 remaster of the 2029 PS6 game. Needs a PS7 to run it, so while you can buy the game, you won't be able to play it until 2035. When Naughty Dog goes out of business in 2028, it causes a temporal fault that destroys the universe, which is a bit of a bummer. Still, the graphics are amazing.
</p>
<p>
The Passion of the Robocop: Nacon decides to test the waters in the religious gaming market, while sticking with an established brand for the sake of its core audience. The game's a fairly straightforward adaptation of Mel Gibson's 2004 religious torture-porn extravaganza, but with Robocop instead of Jesus.</p></blockquote>

Wow, any music works apparently. Audio Mech, that's called. It's from Dylan Fitter, the creator of Audio Surf. There's a demo going up on Steam tomorrow. Excuse me if I got those spellings wrong.

Badgerborne! What a name.

You are a moder-looking badger trapped in a Soulslike game, and you can create your own platforms.

Cyberbadger! You can take the badger to a cyber workd.

The Last Badger! The Last of Us. So it's a parody game, or satirical game. And now we're seeing what looks like real hands in someone's real life. Strange!

A Japanese game now based in a wholly original world. Cel-shaded, slightly anime look. Music. Um, the characters are singing. They also look a bit like zombies. Is it a game about making music videos? I don't understand what this is. There are giant versions of the singing characters holding them in their hands. What is going on.
</p>
<p>
Stupido Never Dies, I think it said the game was called. now we're seeing gameplay. It's a third-person brawler with neon coloured accents for the players. Okay, one of them's technically a zombie. Well, that was a hell of a tone shift.

It certainly sounds like Clair Obscur, and there's Clair Obscur imagery on the screen behind. There are two singers in front of an orchestra singing at each other, as if they're saying something to each other, but we don't know what because we don't speak French. Well, I don't. Now a man with an electric guitar has stepped into the middle of them to blast out some music. The singers are really giving it all now.

Geoff's saying some gumpf about us all sharing the love of video games. He's also talking about how he's had a hard year. His home burned down at the start of the year, and he lost his dad this year. He's getting teary. Bless him. His mum's here and they've left an empty chair next to her for him.
</p>
<p>
He's using that as a springboard to talk about how games lift us up when we need lifting up, and that's why we're all connected together.

They're floating in the sky as the screen goes red and shows a cluster of planets. There's a lightning sound. Then we're into a trailer.
</p>
<p>
A man hangs in chains. he is wrapped in sharp chains and sharp crown is on his head. We see a market or festival scene outside a castle's walls. An orc throws up. A fire dancer... dances. This is clearly fantasy inspired.
</p>
<p>
A person in a mask holds up a flaming torch. The character who's chained is possibliy going to be burnt. Yes, the flames lick up a pyre.

    <p>Divinity is a good shout! Those look like Magisters. And that's the Source King? I'm not sure who that is.</p>

      <p>4 Loop is a bit like Left 4 Dead, and JJ Abrams is involved</p>

Bad Robot Games here. I think he said JJ Abrams. That is JJ Abrams, right? OK. They're making a combat sandbox that's unlike anything we've played, apparently. You can sign-up for playtesting too.

<p>
This is Foreloop. Sorry, 4 Loop. A partnership with Sony. 
</p>
<p>
Earth was invaded, lost in less than a minute. So you need a team of four people with guns to run around apocalyptic Earth. But every time you die they'll use a machine to bring you back. I'm not sure what's so brand new about this yet - we die in every multiplayer game and are brought back.

It looks like a jaunty multiplayer co-op game. We'll see.

    <p>
A game from some of the people who brought us the Last of Us now, I think he said. It's a cartoon-looking presentation, or, rather, anime. We see an old lady in a forest and a magical beast comes out to walk with her. 
</p>
<p>
The game looks like a journey between you both, as you each help each other do things the other can't. It's like The Last Guardian but with a friendly bipedal creature and your grandma.

Coven of the Chicken Foot. Is that what it's called? It's reminscent of Ghibli and Howl's moving Castle.

<p>
Police chatter says they've found a person of interest: Victor Gideon. That's the rotting person who stood to face Grace at the beginning of the trailer. Victor has ties to Umbrella.

I saw this presentation ahead of time and spoke to the team about it. Exodus is about getting a ship, getting a crew, and saving the world. It's a lot like Mass Effect. Except, there's time dilation, so the closer you get to the speed of light, the more time dilates and warps. This means you'll be able to see the long-term effects of choices first-hand.

      <p>Wizards of the Coast announces new D&amp;D action adventure Warlock</p>
    <p>
This is Wizards of the Coast studio Invoke's new game, Warlock. It's a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game, but an action adventure based around being a solo fighter exploring an open-world. I saw a presentation for this before tonight, too - I only saw this trailer but I did talk to the team - and they references immersive sims, too. Someone even said Dark Messiah at one point, which I think could be a good guideline for this.

I'm currently thinking Avowed, Elder Scrolls, Dark Messiah, based on what I've heard.

This is for sure Control. And Remedy. A new Control? This is a cool on-stage presentation of a man on a wire being lowered down into a big glowing box.

"Do you feel it?" He says. "Something is coming."
</p>
<p>
Lights flash. Fractal patterns appear. 
</p>
<p>
A coffee cup. Ha! A pigeon stuck in flight. More fractal patterns. Inception-like folded streets. 
</p>
<p>
Oh it sounds like all the stuff they tried to keep inside the Control building got out. Uncontrolled, I guess. 
</p>
<p>
We see a man on a bed. They are attacked. Then there's smoke and alien voices, as the man approaches a monolith. The man has a cool kind of magnetic sword weapon and is emerging into a folded cityscape where there are strange mutated humanoids.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's logo comes up. Now we're seeing gameplay. The man is melee attacking - it seems to be more focused on melee. And he's battling through settings that are too strange to describe.

</p>
<p>
He walks out, shrugs, and walks off. We see a montage of him thumping more people, shooting guns, blowing stuff up. Gang of Dragon, it's called. It looks, at least in tone, a lot like Yakuza. Presentationally, though, that slice we saw was miles ahead.

Felicia Day now, to present an award, I imagine. The TGA Game Changer award. Girls Make Games has won it, I guess. She's an ambassador for them. It helps get girls and then women into games, helping them bridge the gaps from education to work. I think that's what she said, anyway. We're getting a couple of people from the programme on stage to tell us about it.

This must be the new Tomb Raider starring Laura Croft, as Geoff said.

I hope she's got health insurance - that tomb is totally unstable.

Tomb Raider Catalyst, 2027.

<p>
That was brief. We're seeing a big image of her on screen, the big dive into the water.

<p>
Now Amazon Game Studios and a partnership with Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog studios. This must be the reboot.

Miss Piggy is back. Let's say no more. More awards now.

<p>
Ooh! Best Action Adventure now. A fairly big category. Hollow Knight: Silksong and a huge cheer goes up.
</p>
<p>
Best Art Direction goes to Clair Obscur. 
</p>
<p>
Best Sim/Strategy, which I want The Alters to win. Let's see what gets it: Final Fantasy Tactics. Dom will be happy.

This is his first "voyage" into the world of video games, apparently.

Ooh another World Premiere and this is another one I saw ahead of time and talked to the team about. So this is an open-world immersive sim-style cyberpunk game called No Law. It looks very Cyberpunk 2077 but the scale is different, more condensed. It's also got some greenery and blue skies. And the team making it is only 24 people, so temper your expectations a bit.
</p>
<p>

But: dialogue choices, character customisation, freedom of appraoch. I think this has double-A banger written all over it.

Miss Piggy is back, with Rowlf at the piano. They're having a pretty funny exchange. They've broken into song now. How does Geoff get these Muppet slots?
</p>
<p>
Do you know, someone in the play I'm in came up to me the other day and said, "Bertie, don't take this the wrong way, but you have a great Muppet energy about you when you're on stage." I didn't take it the wrong way. I was delighted.

Another world premiere now. First-person, running through a burning building. Characters with what looked like swords. A masked character holding a baby. Asian-style. 
</p>
<p>
S-Game. Ah, they're a Chinese studio.
</p>
<p>
This is more of an action game than a Soulslike. It's got button prompts like God of War to mash big enemies.

Yes! Capcom's logo appears.

      <p>Apex and Titanfall devs reveal Highgard, a hero shooter launching in January</p>
    <p>
We're back with a screen-filling trailer now of a stormy mountainous sea region. Geoff's telling us the teaser we're seeing tonight is for a game that's not far away. This is from the creators of Apex Legends. They've been making their game in complete secrecy.
</p>
<p>
Geoff is praising strong independent creators. So we're getting an announcement and we're going to see it in action.
</p>
<p>
Highgard, it's called. 
</p>
<p>
It's a sort of mix of fantasy and shooting. We're galloping around on a horse but shooting a shotgun.
</p>
<p>
Wildlight Entertainment.
</p>
<p>
Guns and magical powers. It's very fast, slightly cartoonish. Possibly a hero shooter. Set in dream-like mythical worlds. 
</p>
<p>
There's a sword in the stone power-up, that seems to do... something. They summoned a huge Thudercats-like tank. A battering ram. We're seeing a player summon birds. Now there's a werewolf-like character leaping around.
</p>
<p>
Shades of Overwatch in terms of the speed here, and character. That looks pretty good.
</p>
<p>
Highguard, it's called. Play free from 26th January 2026.
</p>

      <p>Clair Obscur makes a clean sweep as it takes Game of the Year</p>
    <p>
And now I think that finally we're on to the Game of the Year award, which I would be amazed if Clair Obscur didn't win. What a night it's been for them. This is being presented by last year's winner Team Asobi.
</p>
<p>
We're getting an orchestral medley from the nominated games. Kingdom Come 2, Death Stranding 2, Clair Obscur, obviously, Silksong, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Hades 2.
</p>
<p>
Flute guy going wild. 
</p>
<p>
And the winner is... Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. What else?

    <p>
Well. I can't think straight any more. Thank you all for joining us. Let's call that a wrap and get some shut-eye.
</p>
<p>
Keep an eye on the site in the coming days for all the usual announcement mop-up and for any other details that spill forth. 
</p>
<p>
That should be a wrap for much of this year's gaming news now, but there's still plenty to talk about as we lead up to the break.
</p>
<p>
Good night all.

<p>Mega Evolutions are having a moment elsewhere in Pokémon too, thanks to their inclusion in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Its DLC arrived yesterday, bringing spatial distortions to Lumiose City, on top of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-fan-favourite-pokemon-gets-a-new-mega-evolution-in-pokemon-legends-z-as-dlc-as-mewtwo-strikes-back">Mewtwo's recent appearance in the base game</a>.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, Pokémon TCG Pocket has a holiday-themed event starting on Christmas Day and running until 8th January, with various seasonal awards.</p>
<p>In addition, January will see a Mareep Drop Event, a fresh Wonder Pick Event, and a Mega Latios ex Drop Event.</p>

            <p>A number of Tomb Raider leaks have started circulating ahead of tonight's The Game Awards show.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, The Game Awards and Tomb Raider accounts both revealed we would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-you-miss-her-she-missed-you-the-future-of-tomb-raider-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards">finding out the "future" of the Lara Croft-fronted franchise as part of the show</a>. The accounts shared an image of a silhouetted Lara standing atop a rocky formation with her dual pistols readied.</p>
<p>Now, what appears to be cover art for a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> along with a number of in-game screenshots have started appearing online, mere hours before their official unveiling.</p>

<p>The cover art in question shows Lara in the same pose she was standing in in the earlier Tomb Raider teaser. Her attire, meanwhile, unites her original 'classic' design from the 90s with the more recent Survivor timeline. She is in her short shorts and tank top, and has accessorised with the jade necklace first introduced in 2013's reboot.</p><p>Written above her is the game's name: Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. Additional screenshots also shared of Lara in action - including the leading lady using some impressive gymnastic skills to traverse - have since led many to surmise a full-fat, from the ground up remake of the series' original game will be announced at The Game Awards this evening.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the Tomb Raider images still appear online, and Crystal Dynamics has not sought to remove them. You can check them out via the embeds below.</p> <div>

<p>As well as this rumoured remake, Crystal Dynamics is also working on a new series entry with Amazon. In August of last year, Amazon said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">the upcoming Tomb Raider game was "a huge, huge task"</a>, but things were "going well". Then, just last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-yet-another-round-of-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics laid off a number of staff</a>, calling it part of a restructuring "for our next generation". At this time, the studio cited the next Tomb Raider release as a factor in its decision.</p>
<p>So, will we be getting more than one Tomb Raider announcement in the next 24 hours? The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Last night, Japanese singer Koda Kumi gave us all a live performance of Real Emotion from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-x">Final Fantasy 10</a>-2, and immediately transported me back to 2003.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 10-2 was the first mainline game in the series to receive a sequel, and its opening song - performed by protagonist Yuna along with returning character Rikku and new face Paine - has proven popular ever since.</p>

<p>I have always found great enjoyment in the Final Fantasy series, with 8, 9 and 10 especially playing a key part into my early video game education (I wanted a dog called Angelo for quite a long time when I was little. I also dyed my hair dark with a blonde steak a la Rinoa once).</p>
<p>But one Final Fantasy game that will always remember playing is 10-2, which opens with 'Yuna' transforming from the relatively reserved summoner we first met in 2001 into a fully fledged pop star. The song she sings at the start of 10-2 quickly became my backing track for the year, and I can still recite the lyrics (in English, at least) at the drop of a hat over two decades later.</p><p>So, when I saw a post yesterday saying that Koda Kumi would be performing Real Emotion from Final Fantasy 10-2 on Japanese TV that night, I was flooded with a sense of nostalgia and the desire to have a little bop in my kitchen. For those unaware, Koda Kumi performed the Japanese version and did the motion capture for the Real Emotion full motion video shown at the start of Final Fantasy 10-2.</p>
<p>I hunted the performance down on YouTube this morning, and even 20 plus years later, Koda Kumi has still got it. Watching it made me feel like I was a pre-teen once again (which is no small feat given that these days I regularly crick my back just by getting out of bed).</p>
<p>You can check out Koda Kumi's live performance of Real Emotion in the video below.</p>

<p>More recently in Final Fantasy news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi revealed that the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-team-almost-downsized-clouds-humongous-buster-sword-to-make-it-more-realistic">once considered downsizing Cloud's iconic Buster Sword</a>.</p>
<p>"How Cloud swings it around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know," the developer explained. "So at the time, when we were making Remake, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword."</p>
<p>Personally, I am glad they decided against this idea.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Bethesda announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrim-switch-2-edition-announced-so-yes-you-can-play-bethesdas-rpg-yet-another-way-before-elder-scrolls-6">Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Anniversary Edition would be arriving on Switch 2</a>, complete with faster load times and enhanced resolution. Along with a gameplay trailer, the developer also shared a playful live-action trailer which focused on Santa's elves getting ready for the festive season.</p>
<p>One of these elves, unfortunately, messes up a bit, and loses Santa's all important list. So, in a bid to save Christmas, another elf suggests giving everyone Skyrim on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. Santa is pleased with this idea, proclaiming "you son of a cup of cocoa", as the elf's speech increases to 27.</p>

<p>Anyway, some online have now suggested that this moment in the live-action Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim Anniversary Edition Switch 2 trailer is actually a little clue for Elder Scrolls 6. "Speech increased to 27… Elder Scrolls 6 confirmed for 2027?" reads one reply on the trailer. "RELEASE DATE CONFIRMED FOR TES VI    20+27 = 2027 " another exclaims.</p>
<p>Some have since said this theory "isn't too far fetched.. because.. why would they [choose] those numbers in particular for level and speech skill level". Why indeed…?</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for yourself below. Do you think it is teasing a 2027 release date for Elder Scrolls 6?</p>

<p>The Elder Scrolls 6 has certainly been a long time coming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">having first been announced back in 2018</a>. Last month, Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off"</a>, though its development is now an "everyday thing". Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Howard didn't rule out the possibility of adapting The Elder Scrolls for TV</a>, though the studio exec added he was "willing to say 'no' for a decade", like he did with Fallout.</p>

            <p>Annapurna has released another trailer for musical RPG People of Note, giving us a full listen to its big musical number, as well as a fresh look at its turn-based combat.</p>
<p>Yes, this is an RPG with rhythmic turn-based combat and big musical numbers, and I can't wait to play it once it's out.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's a corgi shaped like an accordion!</p>

<p>Developed by Iridium Studios, People of Note was first shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-next-three-games-are-a-turn-based-musical-a-zelda-like-adventure-and-a-puzzle-game-exploring-a-utopian-society">Annapurna's showcase back in September</a> alongside the Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>This new trailer gives a deeper look at the game. There's protagonist Cadence singing catchy pop-musical number Under The Lights (its chorus reminds me of Rewrite The Stars from The Greatest Showman), with singer <a href="https://lexxemusic.com/">Lexxe</a> providing vocals. Cadence is on a quest for stardom, apparently, and recruits an ensemble of musicians to back her.</p><p>The trailer description also promises each battle will be "a musical performance with evolving combat conditions and genre-bending mashup attacks". We see glimpses of this in the trailer itself, with rhythmic button presses triggering attacks - though without in-game music it's hard to tell exactly how this will work.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Just look at this little guy! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Annapurna</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We also see more of the game's world - a mix of fantasy and cyberpunk presented in colourful animation. It looks like there'll be exploration and puzzle solving along with combat and extensive music videos.</p>
<p>It's looking brilliant and could be the Kpop Demon Hunters of gaming if it takes off on its release next year, across both PC and consoles.</p>
<p>I just hope combat lives up to its potential. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 raised the bar this year for turn-based combat</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stray-gods-a-roleplaying-musical-review-greek-melodrama-fails-to-reach-lofty-expectations">2023's Stray Gods</a> attempted a melodramatic musical but didn't quite deliver on its genre-mixing promise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Hi-Fi Rush, however, proved how intoxicating a musical animated world can be</a>, so let's see if People Of Note follows suit.</p>

            <p>Here we go: Capcom has finally released an official trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> 4 Title Update 4, which is due to launch for the game on 16th December. But, as exciting as the new content is - featuring returning Elder Dragon, Gogmazios - most players are more interested in another tease of information Capcom has given over the past 24 hours: an optimisation roadmap for the game's performance on PC. This was all revealed during a special showcase Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-capcom-schedules-new-monster-hunter-wilds-presentation-as-its-director-begs-players-to-return-to-the-game">announced last week</a>, which was paired with comments from the game's director asking us all to please "pick up the game again".</p>

<figcaption>Watch the presentation here.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aijx69md9pU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>The roadmap is segmented into three portions: improvements that will arrive next week as part of Title Update 4, then more planned improvements in January 2026, followed by further optimisation in February 2026. These updates were promised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-asks-pc-monster-hunter-wilds-players-to-wait-until-title-update-4-this-winter-for-cpu-and-gpu-related-optimizations">as far back as August this year</a>.</p>
<p>The first update promises to fix CPU/GPU optimisation, targeting processing improvements applicable to all platforms. This means Capcom has updated elements such as frame processing, collision detection, and how many effects are shown on-screen at once. The developer hopes to lower CPU/GPU load by "reducing unnecessary processes", and will implement over 100 improvements to make the game run a bit better. This will target consoles and PC versions of the game.</p><p>Then, in January, we're getting a bit more - and I think this is where the most notable difference from all the updates is going to land. Here, Capcom will introduce "new graphics and CPU settings, as well as new presets, providing additional options to reduce processing load". This will include improving the shader compilation process (which seems to be at the heart of the game's performance woes for many PC players) and improving VRAM usage, too. The devs are also working on a way to improve streaming for the high-resolution texture pack here: another apparent bottleneck for PC players, specifically.</p>
<p>Finally, in February, more general optimisation will be complimented with the addition of level-of-detail quality levels to the polygon mesh on 3D models. To put it simply, this will also help reduce GPU load. This is also PC-only.</p>

<p>That all sounds good, right? Yes. But of course, players aren't happy. "They're even drip feeding optimization lmao," <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjshc0/tu4_optimization_roadmap/">writes one redditor</a>. "Damn now imagine the game was optimised at launch, I might've played more than 30 hours before never touching it again," says another. "It looks like they pushed out the things that might actually make a difference until the January patch. I don't get why they're not focusing on the impactful items first. We don't even have monster LOD until February? That should have been in at launch!" claims a third.</p><p>They all have a point, to be fair. These issues have plagued the game since Monster Hunter Wilds launched in February 2025, and whilst Capcom has acknowledged them, the publisher has been slow on pushing out updates that addressed player concerns. This has led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">less than stellar sales</a> for the game outside its launch window, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">falls in Capcom's share price</a>.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter audience is also concerned that an upcoming expansion (similar to Monster Hunter World's Iceborne, or Rise's Sunbreak) is going to undo all this hard work and revert the optimisation to launch window levels. There's precedent with this: something similar happened with Iceborne, after all.</p>
<p>There's a decent game inside all of these performance issues, so I'm hoping these updates will sort the bulk of the problem for a PC audience that feels it's been largely left behind thanks to ongoing issues with Capcom's RE Engine. But, a whole year after the game's launch, will this be too late to tempt some people back? We'll find out in a few months.</p>

            <p>So, it turns out that Arrowhead actually has a prototype for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> rogue-lite mode kicking about, and I really want to give it a shot!</p>
<p>This news comes from the studio's CCO Johan Pilestedt, who casually shared the titbit on social media last night like it was nothing.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/with_replies">Pilestedt</a> was responding to a Helldivers 2 player, who said they had an idea that would mix things up in Arrowhead's space shooter, which came to them during Into the Gloom. The player in question said they were keen to see "some sort of roguelike/endless mode where we fight waves and waves or keep completing objectives on the same map", which does sound like fun.</p>
<p>To this, Pilestedt replied: "Hey! We have a prototype of a rogue-lite mode." Huh?!</p>
<p>And that's not all. Not only does Arrowhead have that prototype knocking around the studio, this mode apparently also "changes the game fundamentally". The studio exec didn't elaborate on this specific point further than that, but did previously state he was with some other team members to talk about the game's "next four arcs". So, could this rogue-lite mode be the focus of one of these future arcs? </p><p>In a subsequent post, Pilestedt said the team is now "in a better technical space" than it once was, so these arcs should come a little quicker than previous ones. He also would really "love a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Super Destroyer Lego set" at some point, saying this would be a childhood dream come true".</p>
<p>To be honest, that does sound like a pretty great idea for a Lego set.</p>

<p>Away from the game itself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">a Helldivers 2 film is also in the works</a>, from Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin. Earlier this month, Arrowhead's CEO <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-trust-justin-arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-helldivers-2-community-asking-for-film-director-to-play-the-game">Shams Jorjani told fans calling for the director to at least play the game before directing the film to pipe down</a>, saying: "I trust Justin."</p>

            <p>Just a day after more N64 classics were announced for Nintendo Switch Online, another game has been added immediately to the GameCube catalogue on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>: Wario World.</p>
<p>Developed by Treasure, the Japanese developer known for Gunstar Heroes and N64 shooter Sin &amp; Punishment, Wario World was not only the first home console Wario game (the previous games were released for handhelds), it was the first 3D Wario platformer.</p>
<p>It was released back in 2003, which was the same year as the first WarioWare game - and ever since, Wario has been mostly relegated to microgame star. So give this GameCube classic some love and maybe Nintendo will consider a new Wario platformer in future.</p>

<p>Wario World joins a whole host of previous Wario games available on the subscription service, including Wario Land 3 for Game Boy and Wario Land 4 for Game Boy Advance.</p>
<p>Still, Wario World is an intriguing choice of inclusion, not least because it wasn't the console's most successful game. The game wasn't included in the initial announcement of GameCube games coming to Switch 2. The most recent of these was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gamecube-cosy-horror-luigis-mansion-comes-to-switch-2-in-time-for-halloween">Luigi's Mansion, the GameCube launch game that arrived back in October</a>.</p>
<p>The remaining games previously announced but not yet available are: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-path-radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, Pokémon XD Gale of Darkness, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-classic-n64-platformers-join-nintendo-switch-online-later-this-month">two Ubisoft N64 platformers would arrive on the service later this month</a>: Rayman 2 and Tonic Trouble.</p>
