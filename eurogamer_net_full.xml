            <p>Would you believe me if I told you Code Vein 2 is one of the most enjoyable Souls-like games I've played in years? That it not only improves upon systems and quirks present in the original game, but also offers something truly fresh in a genre packed with fierce competition? It's all true! After playing Bandai Namco's upcoming sequel for a few hours I can confidently say it's a bloody good time, and with enough depth that even the most hardened action game fans can sink their teeth into.</p>

<p>Code Vein 2, like its predecessor, throws you as the player into an gothic horror setting filled with gorgeous anime flair. This time around, you find yourself on the precipice of disaster, having to dive back through time to track down a variety of heroes tragically destined to play a part in a great catastrophe. As such it's your job to learn more about these figures, battling through hordes of horrific goons and daunting bosses as you go.</p>
<p>Like the original game, Code Vein 2 is a visual delight. A trip through a human settlement, underground urban sprawl, and the guts of buried machinery showed off the anime stylings, the world design flicking from dark and sketchy to wickedly vivid. When it comes to combat, ribbons of gold jettison off your powerful Jail attacks and combos erupt in brain-buzzing VFX. It's hard to take your eyes off Code Vein 2 when combat starts.</p>

<p>The character creator too is a fantastic first impression, offering much more than many of Code Vein 2's peers have managed. I was surprised by the sheer amount of alterations I could make to my character, the minute differences in colour and shape I could make to the smallest of features. For those unswayed by the joys of an hour-long design process, a rich spread of appealing defaults are of course provided. Regardless of what group of Code Vein 2 players you're in, from minute one to minute 500, it's a gorgeous treat.</p><p>But what about the action itself? Well, there is more to Code Vein 2 than extravagant presentation. Code Vein 2 is one of those special action games that allow you to revel in the cathartic feel of a solid blow. Each strike from a heavy weapon is a cocktail of visual / audio kickback that goes straight to your brain's pleasure boxes. The rapid combos of more dexterous arms trades one larger blow for a cavalcade of smaller ones, their sum the measure of bulkier counterparts.</p>
<p>Ranged weapons, too, manage to retain this gushing game feel. The result: every fight in Code Vein 2 feels exciting. During my stint with it I landed on the hammer weapon type, charging up massive attacks and letting them loose on foes. Sometimes this resulted in a quick death on their part, other times it left them stunned and open to a cinematic finisher. Great stuff, and the most apparent improvement on the original Code Vein which feels a tad sluggish in comparison.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>It's got crazy depth too, an all-around step-forward from its predecessor. At its heart you've got the same core, a typical Souls-like combat system with stamina and various stats that boost different weapon types. If you've played one, you've played them all. Though thanks to the aforementioned excellence at the Code Vein 2's roots even this base combat system is engaging.</p><p>However, it's the sheer amount of customisation available that makes Code Vein 2 stand apart from its peers. Ichor returns, a resource that allows you to activate special attacks (called formae), and I was presented with a vast list of these to play around with and swap out at my leisure. Your Jail attacks can be changed, as can your weapons. The way your character plays is determined by what's called a Blood Code, which act as general archetypes with their own quirks far more interesting than a boring: "strength +5" modifier.</p>
<p>One Blood Code I was allowed to mess around with in the preview was tied to the companion Josée Anjou. Usually, the only way to gain Ichor is through Jail attacks. The result is a combat loop in which you attack an enemy enough to pull off a Jail attack, gain a bunch of Ichor for special moves, then use them to further damage enemies, resulting in more opportunities to suck them dry. Nice, simple, and a solid foundation.</p>
<p>But with Josée's Blood Code, each regular attack provides some Ichor in return, allowing you to gain access to game-changing special attacks without having to rely on Jail attacks. The downside? Gaining beyond the maximum amount of Ichor damages you. This example totally turns Code Vein 2 on its head, and this is a game one assumes has dozens more like it. An inventive way to not only pay homage to different play styles someone may have, but a nice way to keep Code Vein 2 fresh.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>As for what hints of the story we were given during the preview, it certainly has a lot of potential! Hopping back and forth through time, getting to bond with a collective of diverse characters and then leaping forward to clash against their more monstrous forms. It allows those willing to invest themselves into the narrative to connect with a series of individual tragedies, though how well that manages to win-over people will obviously depend on how interesting these heroes of the past are.</p><p>Josée, to her credit, was rowdy and fiery but given time to open up in a more emotionally stimulating fashion, though the speed in which you learn about her familial nightmare was rather fast-paced. If the expectation is that, between continuous melee bouts with a horrific carnival of malformed dudes, I should be interested in the why of this bloody rampage. I do hope Josée is the bar and not an exception, though. Lou, your sidekick of sorts that enables your time-travelling adventure, is someone I saw precious little of during the preview.  Given that your personal relationship with them appears to be a cornerstone of the overarching tale of Code Vein 2, I'm left eager to see if their portrayal impresses in the full release.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>If there is one compliment I can give Code Vein 2 that may perk up the ears of Souls-like fans out there, it's this. Code Vein 2, unlike many of its contemporaries, appears to be going in its own original direction away from the font of inspiration the whole subgenre drinks from. It's doubling down on its strengths, on what won over a dedicated fan following when Code Vein released back in 2019. It is quite evidently climbing out of the Souls-like soup and setting itself apart with ample refinement and rich new ideas.</p>
<p>For those perhaps unfamiliar with the wider Souls-like space, allow me to present a more base descriptor. You can make a handsome guy with an eye-patch and beret in an exhaustive character creator, slap a gun in his hands, and set him loose in a world that's distinct from its peers. For that alone, Code Vein 2 should be worth at least a cursory glance from anyone even vaguely interested in action games.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> didn't cause a commotion when it launched last year, but it quietly became a compelling alternative to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World</a>'s offerings, which many felt were on the simpler (albeit extremely polished) side. Now, a little over a month since the native <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version arrived digitally, we've got confirmation the physical release is coming in March.</p>
<p>Sega (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-physical-switch-2-release-wont-be-a-game-key-card-sega-confirms/">VGC</a>) dropped the long-awaited news on January 13, confirming the date you need to mark on the calendar is March 26. The suggested retail price is $69.99 / £64.99, same as the digital version of CrossWorlds. Perhaps more convincing is the fact the complete base game will be on a regular cartridge versus a game-key card. Mind you, patches and content updates still need to be downloaded, but we know many of you will celebrate.</p>
<p>Though some developers have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">gone on to explain</a> game-key cards enable them to do true physical releases (better than codes in boxes for sure) while avoiding the "data streaming" limitations of the Switch carts, which are slower than Switch 2's internal SSD and microSD cards, there's been a vocal crusade against third-party releases that aren't 100% physical.</p>
<p>This has reportedly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-dev-says-nintendo-has-cheaper-cartridges-coming-as-alternative-to-game-key-cards-then-backtracks-but-either-way-its-title-will-now-be-a-proper-physical-release">pushed Nintendo to look into alternatives</a>, but for now, you can lend and sell game-key cards without issue, as they're rather similar to PlayStation and Xbox discs that only come with part of the games on them. It's more of a distant future-proofing issue.</p><p>In any case, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds' sales should see another boost with this physical release, as many fans of the off-beat racing series were waiting for a Switch 2 release they could add to their physical collection. (It's me, I'm fans.)</p>
<p>Since its September 2025 release, the game has welcomed free crossover characters like Hatsune Miku (really), Joker from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-30th-anniversary-boxing-fitness-more-announcements">Persona</a>, Ichiban Kasuga from Like a Dragon, and even NiGHTS from the underrated series of the same name. Paid content has included Pac-Man, Minecraft content, and even SpongeBob SquarePants. Up next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-mans-finally-making-a-comeback-but-his-first-big-game-in-years-is-still-a-while-away">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and Avatar (the Nickelodeon one) will be making a splash too.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">BioWare's multiplayer shooter Anthem was terminated this week</a> because EA no longer wanted to maintain servers for people to play the game on, and without them, no one can play the game. But the former executive producer of Anthem has revealed that BioWare had technology working, close to the game's release, that would enable us to host our own servers to play the game on.</p>
<p>Mark Darrah, who left BioWare in December 2020, revealed the information at the end of a three-and-a-half hour video discussing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwrCRdqZb8">"The Truth About What Happened on Anthem"</a>, which he posted on his YouTube channel. "Anthem actually had the code for local servers running in a dev environment right up until a few months up to launch," he said. "I don't know that they still work but the code is there to be salvaged and recovered."</p>
<p>This in theory presents a possible lifeline and future for Anthem, and local server hosting is a crucial part of Darrah's even bolder plan for what could be done with Anthem now. His idea? To re-release the game as single-player and remove the multiplayer component entirely.</p>
<p>Darrah, an experienced executive producer, outlined a plan for doing this. You'd need a budget of about $10m, he said, and step one would be to bring the game up to date. This wouldn't be hard. Shift it to current-gen consoles and enable the top-end PC game effects, and lock it at 60 frames-per-second. Step two: local servers. Get rid of EA's need to host servers for the game. Step three: "Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling."</p>
<blockquote><em>"Pivot to something that's more about single-player storytelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>Where players used to fill out groups in Anthem, you could instead have AI companions, as in other BioWare games. "And since this is BioWare," Darrah added, "go all the way into making them companions." You could use some existing characters for this and "promote" them, so to speak. "But I think you'll actually find there's a lower-friction route by making three-to-five new characters, with dialogue, with plot arcs, that are brand new to the series - that are people who'd go with you through the existing story of Anthem with their companion content," he said. "Writing those characters: not very difficult. Making those characters move with you: that's where a lot of the work is going to go."</p>
<p>What you'd have if you could do that is a game much more familiar to BioWare fans, Darrah said - people who potentially skipped Anthem because it was too looter-shooter for them. "What you've essentially re-engineered is a BioWare game," he said, "without romances, with a decent BioWare story, with companions, that can be played as a single-player game." You probably couldn't sell it for $70, he realises, but "for a pretty modest amount of work you could effectively create a brand new single-player game from what already exists for this game".</p>
<p>"Is EA going to do this?" he added. "Almost definitely not."</p>
<p>Darrah's full video covers a lot of ground, chronologically running through Anthem's development since conception in late 2011 or early 2012, through to release in 2019. It talks of the game's originating pitch as being a turning point in BioWare's history, and possibly the basis for all future live service problems to come. The video also highlights a project that crucially lacked a single unifying vision and identity - something ultimately born out in the finished game, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli pointed out in our Anthem review</a>.</p>

            <p>Before 2026 heats up, we've got several small and mid-sized game releases coming our way fast, but unexpected arrivals like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> could be making the coming weeks busier than initially anticipated.</p>
<p>Publisher Daedalic Entertainment has just unveiled a new 'combat deep dive' trailer (which you can watch below) and locked a February 18 launch for the game, which is now coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> too. As for the price tag, it's targeting $39.99 / £34.99 / €39.99, with a Deluxe Edition adding "five additional missions, two new recruitable heroes, and three new technologies" at $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99.</p>

<p>Trapping the full experience behind the Deluxe Edition aside, this "story-driven survival strategy game" has been looking refreshing ever since it was first announced. Strategy games, narrative journeys, and survival experiences are all common nowadays, but it's stranger to see them all come together while using a famous sci-fi property to boot.</p><p>In many ways, Across the Unknown is taking cues from older Star Trek games that had players taking command of starships and entire crews, and that applies to the combat as seen in this trailer (surprisingly involved if you ask me). That said, the bigger scope and focus on what-if scenarios could set it apart from past strategy games set in the iconic universe.</p>
<p>Moreover, the full gameplay loop appears to be quite varied; players can expect scenes which are all about decision-making as well as exploration, management, research, and combat. For each section, <a href="https://www.gamexcite.de/">Gamexcite</a> has leaned on systems and mechanics which look familiar; hopefully, the final result will please trekkies and the more casual crowd alike.</p>
<p>Though the game seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo Switch 2's handheld mode given its chill and menu-heavy rhythm, don't forget it's coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S too. In fact, those platforms have received a demo you can check out before purchasing.</p>

            <p>Oh, Funko Pop. What have you done? Well, unless my eyes are deceiving me, I think you may have let slip a yet-to-be-aired and potentially pivotal plot point for the second season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers (past and perhaps future) for Fallout season two below.</strong></p>

<p>Images of an <a href="https://x.com/AmusementTimeYT/status/2010966559385329789">all-new</a> <a href="https://x.com/FunkoPOPsNews/status/2010946498477928916">Funko Pop</a> based on Amazon's Fallout series have started making the <a href="https://pops.today/television/1915-caesar">rounds online</a>, and correct me if I am wrong, but they appear to show Macaulay Culkin's character Lacerta Legate as Caesar. That is to say, the head of the Fallout faction known as Caesar's Legion.</p>
<p>Caesar's Legion plays a not insignificant part in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, which large parts of the show's second season is based on.</p>
<p>In the show, we meet Caesar's Legion when naive and trusting vault dweller Lucy gets captured by the faction, and popped up on a crucifix to think about what she has done (which was answer a cry for help, damn this wasteland!). We also discover that the Legion is in the midst of a civil war, following the death of the faction's founder. There are now two members who are vying to be the heir, or the new Caesar.</p><p>However, neither of the two potential faction leaders look anything like the upcoming Caesar Funko Pop, which you can see below. Instead, this model looks a lot more like Culkin's high-ranking Lacerta Legate. So, I am going to hazard a guess that something is going to go down at some point during the series' next four episodes, and Lacerta Legate ends up as the man on top.</p>
<p>To compare to the games, in Fallout: New Vegas, players who follow the Legion questline all the way through the end can either cure Caesar of his illness, or kill him. If he dies, Lucius - the leader of the Praetorian Guard - takes over, at least until the finale.</p>
<p>So, do you hope Lacerta Legate becomes the leader of Caesar's Legion in the Fallout show?</p>

            <p>It's gone. In case you didn't know, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fond-anthem-farewells-begin-as-biowares-destiny-like-game-reaches-last-day-of-operation">servers for BioWare's multiplayer game Anthem have been switched off</a>, rendering this online game no longer playable. For all intents and purposes, Anthem no longer exists.</p>
<p>Rewind a week and I found myself in a second-hand trade-in shop eager to buy Anthem to experience its final moments myself. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">Anthem had been earmarked for closure for months</a>, since the summer of last year, when 12th January, 2026 felt like a long time away. But in that shop, the day was nearly upon us. I wanted a physical copy because it was the only way someone who didn't own Anthem could play, since downloads of the game had stopped being sold, and an EA Play subscription no longer granted access to it.</p>
<p>Anthem for £2 - a pittance. Price is a kind of brutal shorthand language in shops like this, used to represent whether games are wanted or not, and Anthem, clearly, was not. In a few days' time, though, it would be worth less, literally worthless, a game you could own but not play. But I wanted it, though I made the mistake of buying for Xbox One and forgetting my Xbox Series S didn't have a disc drive. I had to order another copy online, a brand new PlayStation copy, to rectify my mistake. And it's a bizarre feeling excitedly opening a shrink-wrapped game knowing it only has days of life left.</p>



<p>It's a jarring sense of disbelief that I felt everywhere in Anthem when I played it. Whatever you think of BioWare's ill-fated multiplayer experience, it's shot at doing a Destiny, you can't accuse it of being cheap. Boosting through the skies of the moody jungle world of Coda, filled with colossal architectural ruins, which are grasped at and dragged down by viney tendrils of nature, is a spectacle of face-filling pleasure. Diving from the skies down into the water, and then through it, makes it even better. This dramatic and enlarged playground BioWare has built around the game's foundational idea of flying is frequently stunning. There are gigantic pipes to fly through, waterfalls to race by, and brooding skies to soar towards. Everywhere, massiveness abounds.</p><p>It isn't all zoomed-out detail either, because in the other half of the game, the walking around part in Fort Tarsis, your base, the intricacies are all up close. This is 'the BioWare part of the game', which is where the studio tried to deliver the kind of story-rich, character-rich experience it is famed for. Here you find - or found - dialogue options and characters who you could have relationships, of sorts, with. There was elaborate animation and high-quality voice work, and it was gorgeous, a place that married high tech and low tech, a bit like Star Wars in the desert areas - a place of cobbled stone fortresses housing advanced mech-suit garages. See it in the day, see it in the night. It's a place dense with detail and alive with activity. Six years after release, Anthem is impressive to behold.</p>
<p>I saw a brilliant comment on the Anthem subreddit, which is awash with fond farewells at the moment, in which someone described the game as the "greatest What If game" there's ever been, and they're right. To play Anthem is - or was (I can't quite adjust to the past tense yet) - to imagine what could have been done. Whether it was walking around Tarsiss imagining a single-player, storied BioWare experience taking place there, or flying through the jungles and wondering how a single-player game would work there.</p>
<p>Even as a co-operative multiplayer experience like Destiny, Anthem had potential. There was a mismatch between the two halves of the game but the bones of an enjoyable co-operative multiplayer game there. There was fun to be had. It just hadn't come together enough yet. It needed work, like all live service games do - constant work. And there were plans to do this work, to do a 2.0 overhaul, but they were, like so much else about Anthem, abandoned.</p>



<p>The effort that was poured into Anthem was plain to see. Those long years of development and mountain of invested money: you could see it and feel it. It's a realisation that makes it all the harder to accept something like this just being switched off and discarded - wasted, in a sense. Even harder is reconciling that with the people still playing the game, the people who'd, judging by their high character levels and elaborate paint jobs, been the people who propped the game up and populated it - gave it the life it had. All their time and energy soon to be gone, their characters taken away from them. It doesn't seem fair.</p><p>Plenty returned for the end. A mix of morbid curiosity and last goodbyes and unfinished achievement business has brought them back. How many it's hard to tell, because for all Anthem was an online multiplayer game, it didn't have large social spaces to bring them together - the closest was a Launch Bay where 15 people could get together - but I found people to do missions with easily enough. The Launch Bay was also fairly well populated when I visited an instance of it. And it's there I'd see the endlessly changing parade of people peacocking in their hard-earned armour, some waving, others loitering, wanting to share in some way in this moment.</p>
<p>What makes me angry is EA BioWare didn't do more to celebrate them and see them off with a hearty wave and a thank you. The company <em>said </em>thank you when it announced it was closing the Anthem service, but people say a lot of things - it's the actions that count. The actions here were... nothing. The in-game store still insisted on charging for goods until the end; merchants still expected your coin for crafting components; and mechanically the game still dished out meagre experience for you to slowly level up with. Nothing changed; the grind remained intact until the end.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The Anthem shop, active until the end, no change to the prices offered there. I don't think it was possible to buy any of the purple currency any longer, by the way.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Someone looking after the game could have fiddled with the dials, if there was anyone looking after the game. End-times are perfect times for being silly and breaking the rules, for removing restrictions and letting players who supported you be rewarded with consequence-free doses of delirious generosity. Have a party. Let players leave with a smile. Go wild. But no. Abandoned in death as it was in life, Anthem slipped quietly into oblivion.</p><p>On some level, I understand it, because why draw more attention to something you'd rather move on from?  Anthem has been a ghost ship for years now. The 2.0 overhaul was scrapped in early 2021, which means nothing's really been happening in the game for five years now. Another way of looking at this closure could be that it was kept alive longer than it needed to be. But this moment does bring to the surface an increasingly important question which is what should happen to live service games in Anthem's position?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Anyone want a game?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Should we, as players, really expect a game service to run and run and run if no one is playing it? Should there be protections in place that we won't lose access to games we've bought, or characters we've potentially spent hundreds of hours investing in? How should we handle the end of these live service games? Could their care be given over to the community? There are the sorts of questions movements like Stop Killing Games are trying to address, and they're good questions that deserve proper answers. Who knows? Maybe this won't be the end for Anthem after all.</p>
<p>But for now it's an ending. For now, these copies of Anthem I bought to experience it as it blinked out of existence are effectively useless. They are games I can look at on a shelf but not do anything with. I can't resell them, I can't give them away. Their only value is to a collector. And who would collect this? Endings are powerful because they frame what came before, but Anthem frames a story BioWare would probably rather forget. It's a story of a misguided gamble that ruptured the studio in a way it would never recover from. Anthem changed BioWare, and would have done even if the game was very successful. It was a turning point. Perhaps, in BioWare's history, it's one of its most important games, and now it's gone forever. How long, I wonder, until we say the same about the studio.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions' closure last year</a> remains one of the hardest gut punches the Western games industry has seen recently. From iconic shooters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-fear-pc">FEAR</a> to the inventive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review">Shadow of Mordor</a> &amp; Shadow of War, the studio always excelled, no matter the genre. Now, unearthed materials allegedly recovered from a discarded HDD used at the studio have revealed work done on a non-Arkham Batman game for Warner Bros.</p>
<p>MrTalida, a renowned "video game enthusiast and archivist," shared their findings <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social">via Bluesky</a> on 13th January. Moreover, an Internet Archive upload was made available for anyone curious about the unmade project. Needless to say, those files should only be accessed at your own risk.</p>
<p>According to the user, the materials go back as far as April 2009 and up to January 2010. It all seemingly belongs to a game that never came close to being anywhere near done. The info and videos mostly deal with isolated gameplay ideas, audio systems, concept art, and development schedules.</p>
<p>There are, however, fragments which present an aesthetic closer (if not the same) to Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. If we also take the time frame into account, we can theorize this could've been a tie-in of sorts, or at least a title which existed outside of the continuity started by Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-asylum-review">Arkham Asylum</a> in 2009.</p><p>This isn't the first time we've seen footage of Monolith's cancelled Batman game. In 2024, more substantial clips of an advanced build of the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-game-that-became-shadow-of-mordor-footage-surfaces-online">popped up online</a>. However, this new batch of materials gives us a closer look at the studio's overall plans, as well as the iconic tank-like "tumbler" Batmobile from the Nolan movies.</p>
<p>Eventually, the project was scrapped and gave way to what became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, a refreshing take on the Lord of the Rings IP that borrowed more than a few tricks from Rocksteady's Batman playbook, so in the end, the studio's slightly different approach to the Dark Knight survived… kind of.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>French publisher Ubisoft is promising a nostalgic 2026, with remakes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> nearing completion, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-definitive-edition">the first Division game also getting a re-release</a> of sorts. For many of the developers at key studios, however, the year is off to an awful start.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">Ubisoft's Halifax Studio was promptly shuttered</a> only weeks after unionising. The true motives behind the closure were unclear, but we had reasons to question Ubisoft's short comments on the matter, especially after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fired-employees-at-gta-6-studio-rockstar-denied-interim-pay-by-uk-tribunal-union-highlights-firms-flimsy-grounds-for-defence">everything going on at Rockstar Games</a>. Some voices online pointed out the developers were maybe seeing a closure coming, and thus prepared to face it with better protections. Today, that theory seems stronger, as Ubisoft continued to take "additional steps" <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-to-offer-voluntary-redundancies-to-massive-entertainment-staff">following the "voluntary career transition program" offered last year</a> to Massive Entertainment staffers.</p>
<p>The new layoffs, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-laying-off-55-roles-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-as-cost-cutting-continues">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, have (at the time of writing) translated into 55 roles being cut across the Massive Entertainment and Stockholm teams. Massive's plans for the immediate future haven't changed; the studio will continue to work on the new content coming to The Division 2 this year, as well as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-ubisoft-dev-says">the seemingly massive threequel</a> (and probably that "definitive edition" of the first game).</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-fire-and-ash-player-boost">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora received a stunning third expansion DLC</a>, probably marking the end of substantial support for that game. Last year also saw <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2-pc-graphics-comparison">Star Wars Outlaws being (excellently) ported to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. With those games "out of the way" now, one can see, without downplaying the horrible human cost, why and how Ubisoft is streamlining operations at Massive as it faces uncertainty in spite of the big reorganisation around its core franchises through a subsidiary <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/es-es/article/7GvucOgSm41HwFaXt2ADX1/ubisoft-launches-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios">announced in October 2025</a>.</p><p>Before the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-announces-restructuring-proposal-for-redlynx-60-jobs-may-be-at-risk">RedLynx also faced aggressive restructuring</a>, so this awful news is just a continuation of a company-wide trend that might continue well into 2026. Outside the aforementioned remakes and re-releases, Ubisoft's next 12 months are looking a bit too quiet, so there could be a lot riding on those blasts from the past.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Lego fully unveiled its official Pokémon sets, which include the rather chonky Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model. This chap was notable not only for its size and price tag (it is retailing for £579.99), but the fact that if you pre-ordered it, you would also get your hands on the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection as a gift with purchase while stocks lasted.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chsnos.bsky.social/post/3mcabspu3rs2s">many soon took to social media</a> to say they would actually quite like to just buy the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection, please and thank you, rather than being made to shell out close to £600 (which is more than a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>) for a set they don't really want, just to get the freebie.</p>

<p>Now, and unsurprisingly, the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection is popping up on resale sites such as eBay. And while Lego itself said the set is worth roughly £25 here in the UK, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=pokemon+lego+kanto&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_sop=16">many of those listings already marked as sold have gone for over £100</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=lego+kanto&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;_sop=16">similar story internationally</a> as well.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/page/lego-offers-promotions/latest-terms-and-conditions">Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection's terms and conditions</a>, the gift offer was only valid for the first 8500 pre-orders of the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set here in the UK. In the US, that number was for the first 21,840 pre-orders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while the set itself was available for pre-order yesterday when the collection was first announced, sales pages in the UK and internationally now simply state that the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise set is "coming soon", and interested parties are currently no longer able to secure themselves a model ahead of release through Lego.</p><p>It should be noted here, that even though the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection is appearing for sale on the likes of eBay, the sellers will not yet have the set in their hands, as it is not due to be shipped until 27th February.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">Lego x Pokémon partnership was first teased back in March,</a> before getting fully revealed yesterday. As well as the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-unveiled-but-catching-em-all-will-cost-you">this collection also includes a Pikachu and Poké Ball set</a>, and a smaller, cheaper model of Eevee with posable features.</p>
<p>Other Nintendo-themed Lego sets also released so far include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">The Legend of Zelda's Great Deku Tree</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-taps-into-nostalgia-with-1980s-inspired-lego-game-boy-trailer">Lego Game Boy model</a> and the fiery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-big-bowser-lego-set">Lego Bowser</a>, to name a few.</p>

            <p>The new year is upon us! Actually it's been upon us for a couple weeks now, but listen: this is a very long list, so you'll understand if it took us a little while to pull together.</p>
<p>In what is now approaching an honest-to-goodness tradition, below we've put together our list of the many games we're most excited about for the year ahead. This, of course, isn't a comprehensive list of releases by design - for that we've got a dedicated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases">2026 video game release schedule</a>, assembled by our ever-dilligent guides team - but instead our curated selection of games we either expect or hope to be worth a proper look. (And yes, so many games come out each year now that a list of 80+ still counts as curated).</p>
<p>Naturally, we're bound to miss some and be happily surprised by plenty more as the year develops, and so if you've spotted a gem of your own that didn't make the cut, we'd love to hear it as ever. Otherwise, here's to another year of wonderful video games.</p>
<p>We've ordered the below chronologically in terms of release date, with a separate section at the end for the (many) as yet undated games due some time in 2026. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Hytale</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Hypixel Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 13th January (Early Access)</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Hytale was first announced way back in 2015 as a hugely ambitious-looking spin-off from Minecraft, made by the co-founders of Hypixel, some of Minecraft's own most dedicated in-game creators. After a decade of development hell with the once-backing of Riot Games, expect a rough-around-the-edges - but very exciting - fresh start. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 Edition</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 15th January, 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch 2</li>
</ul>
<p>Years after the last major update, our patience has finally been rewarded. Cram up to 12 players into one session, yell out a Villager's name through the Megaphone Tool to locate them and enjoy an increased resolution as well as new mouse controls perfect for Custom Designs, all alongside extra free content - a nice way to kick off 2026! - <em>Marie P</em></p>
<h3>Highguard</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wildlight Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 26th January</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong>  PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>Huge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> vibes from this one. A "raid shooter" made lots of former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> people. Colourful, slick, punchy - the action looks great. Is it a kind of MOBA? I'm not sure. Is it a hero shooter? I'm not sure. But I am certain it'll be worth a look. -<em>Bertie</em></p>
<h3>Cairn</h3>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>The Game Bakers</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 29th January</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers of the rather lovely Furi and Haven are behind this one, a mountain climbing simulator-slash-survival game. A pure concept with some unexpected beauty, seemingly quite hardcore challenge, and above all gangly limb physics that look just delightfully awkward. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, watch out. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

With an innovative 2v2 tag system, expertly constructed online infrastructure and features, and beloved characters brought lovingly from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>… It's one all fighting game fans must play. - <em>Connor M</em></p>

<p>Anything Inkle is worth getting excited about, and I'm doubly excited for this World War 2-era codebreaking game because it's unusual and it reminds me a lot of Sam Barlow's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/her-story">Her Story</a>, in how it's an elaborate keyword-searching mystery. That game was great. Will this be?  - <em>Bertie P</em></p>

</ul>
<p>Dragon Quest 7 has always been considered something of a masterpiece by fans of the genre and series, but it is also doubtless a game with a complicated ownership of that title. That which makes it special - a unique episodic structure that sees the narrative play out through a series of enclosed vignettes rather than the usual overarching world-saving - is also something of a weakness. To be blunt, the original game is paced like molasses, and no matter how good it is, there's almost certainly too much of it.</p><p>In stems Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined. The reimagining is largely to the game's structure - where developers have been brave enough to take a scalpel to a classic in order to try to excise some of the bloat and give a classic some brevity instead. It's a delicate operation to perform, but if they succeed this could be something really special. <em>- Alex D</em></p>

<p>I played Nioh 3 towards the end of last year, and I've not really been able to stop thinking about it since. All the hardcore action-RPG bells and whistles of the first two games, compounded by a solid 'open field' design philosophy, a dual set of loadouts (samurai and ninja) and more enemy variety? It's everything a Team Ninja sicko like me could ask for. I just hope you've got the patience to spend as much time menuing as you do in combat. - <em>Dom P</em></p>

<p>The duo of Edmund Mcmillen and Tyler Glaiel are bringing out a freakishly fun turn-based RPG with Mewgenics.

<p>While obviously I would like Camelot to be let out of the Sports mines to make a Golden Sun again, I do admit I always eagerly await their Mario Sports offerings. I felt 2018's Mario Tennis Aces was pretty sound, and it does appear that Fever is simply going to build on that game in smart ways, offering up more characters and options than any Mario Tennis title before. I really hope the Adventure Mode is RPG-like, and channels the all-time-great Mario Tennis Game Boy Color story mode. <em>- Alex D</em></p>

<p>Reanimal is being brought to us by the original developers of Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2, promising us yet another eerie co-op adventure that follows two siblings as they face real horrors in an attempt to be reunited with their friends.</p><p>Despite the initial dark impressions you'll no doubt get from Reanimal's trailer, Tarsier Studios' prior Little Nightmares games - which look undeniably similar to Reanimal - also possess a lot of charm throughout them, mainly via their characters and their interactions with the beautiful but haunting worlds they find themselves in. This is one world I really can't wait to immerse myself in, especially after the sore disappointment that was Little Nightmares 3 (which I must mention was developed by Supermassive Games, rather than Tarsier Studios). - <em>Kelsey R</em></p>

<p>What do you get when you cross a grumpy git of a goblin with stealthy infiltration? Styx: Blades of Greed, that's what. Blades of Greed is the the next entry in Cyanide Studio's Styx series, and takes place after the events of Shards of Darkness (though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release). I know I won't be any good at this game, I have never been the best at 'subtle', but dammit I am going to give it a bash anyway. It looks like a hoot! - <em>Victoria PK</em></p>

<p>A fluorescent post-apocalyptic water world action adventure with a startlingly novel twist: multiplayer ghosts that affect your world. Exactly how they work is unclear, but following other people's progress has the ability to change your game.

<p>Look at this gloriously intricate city-builder coming out of Early Access this year. It's from Quite OK Games (back yourselves folks!), a new indie studio, and published by Future Friends, who we reckon have more than Quite OK Taste (they also handled Exo One, Europa, Clover Pit and Summerhouse). Looks smack bang in the taxing-yet-relaxing sweet spot of management sims. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Having bounced off Village having got just a couple of hours in around launch, I went back to it early last year and had a brilliant time. I also really enjoyed the Resident Evil 4 remake, even if it couldn't possibly have the same impact the original did way back in 2005. Add in the brilliant Resident Evil 7, the wonderful Resident Evil 2 and the perfectly decent Resident Evil 3 remakes, and Resi fans have been eating well for a long time. Leon being in Requiem has raised my anticipation level quite dramatically, and I can't wait to go back to Raccoon City. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<p>The rule goes that every year must now have a semi-viral Horse Game. Last year we even got two - what a treat! - and this year we're declaring it to be The Legend of Khiimori, a game where you play as a 13th century Mongolian courier. Its mix of horse-management depth and the subtle beauty of a real place and moment in history looks to be a winner. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>What happens when you bake Animal Crossing and Pokémon together? Well you get Pokémon Pokopia of course, with a side helping of 'that Ditto child certainly looks creepy'.

<p>Survival horror series Fatal Frame (AKA Project Zero in Europe) has had a bit of a resurgence in recent years, thanks to remasters of 2008’s Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and 2014’s Maiden of Black Water. And while they’re entertaining enough entries, neither comes close to matching the impressive chills of 2003’s acclaimed Fatal Frame 2: The Crimson Butterfly. Tracking two twins as they become lost in an abandoned village where vengeful spirits roam, it's a phenomenal slice of survival horror, and a whole new generation of fans will finally get a chance to experience its masterful camera-snapping frights, courtesy of a full-scale remake arriving in March. The original’s an absolute classic, so here’s hoping the remake can do it justice - and perhaps even usher in a proper series revival - <em>Matt </em></p>

<p>I'm not the biggest fan of the Monster Hunter Stories series in general, however everything I've seen from the third entry in Capcom's spin-off RPG so far fills me with optimism. It looks a little more series, a sidestep away from some of the daft churn that defined the previous titles. It also introduces some darker themes, bigger monsters, and (it seems) more interesting mechanics than some of the arbitrary battle ideas that beefed out the previous two games. Capcom is on a roll at the moment, and I trust it with this. - <em>Dom P</em></p>

<p>Coffee Talk Tokyo is the third installment in the visual novel series where you brew drinks while helping supernatural beings solve their problems. As the title reveals, this game has switched the previous Seattle setting for Tokyo - a change that will bring a host of characters inspired by Japanese folklore and mythology, such as kitsune and kappa, to your little coffee shop. - <em>Lottie L</em></p>

<p>After a number of delays, 2.5D retro-futuristic sci-fi platformer Replaced is now only a couple of months away from release, and oooh I am excited. Set in an alternative version of the 1980s, Replaced has all the trappings you would expect from the cyberpunk genre. A dystopian neon-lit setting? Check. A corrupt corporation? Check? Flying cars? You betcha! Developer Sad Cat has promised a blend of "cinematic exploration with fluid, free-flow action" on the game's release, which all sounds delicious. This is definitely one to keep an eye out for. - <em>Victoria PK</em></p>

</ul>
<p>It may be John Carpenter's Toxic Commando, but it can also be yours in March if you like the sound of a bloodsoaked mis-mash of Left 4 Dead style zombie horde action and Spintire's mud-mushing driving mechanics. Toxic Commando is an unashamed, turn your brain off co-op shooter where up to four players enter small, swampy, sandbox maps to shoot, drive and explode hundreds of onscreen mutants into glorious fountains of body bits. The story may be comic book nonsense but the gameplay is solid, thrilling and it will absolutely cause loads of arguments between you and your friends as they drive off into the distance while you're left alone and surrounded by a mosh-pit's worth of sludge infected shamblers. - <em>Ian H</em></p>
<h3>Solasta 2</h3>

<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>All the Solasta 2 comparisons are to Baldur's Gate 3, and it doesn't take long to see why. It's a faithful fantasy Dungeons &amp; Dragons game presented from an isometric kind of view. But this is not a copycat. Solasta 1 was well regarded in 2021, so there's a very solid foundation, and Solasta 2 ups the ambition with a new engine and a voice cast including Ben Starr, and Devora Wilde and Amelia Tyler from Baldur's Gate 3. It's also one of the first D&amp;D games to use the recently revised ruleset. This is an early access release so it's only a beginning, but this is one to watch. <em>- Bertie P</em></p>

<p>Reading the name might still make me think of red velvet cake before a video game (maybe a black forest gateaux?), but Crimson Desert looks set to make a big old splash when it finally lands next year. It's an open-world fantasy-medieval RPG with a dashing-if-generic protagonist called Kliff, and it has capital-G Graphics in abundance. It's bound to do well, and we're very keen to find out what new twists, if any, Black Desert Online developer Pearl Abyss might bring with it. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

</ul>
<p>A Geoff Keighley showcase favourite, Mouse: PI's distinctive definitely-not-Mickey classic cartoon style - mixed in with actual 3D spaces - is an immediate eye-catcher. It's also, despite the name, a first-person shooter rather than a detective point-and-click, I <em>really hope </em>I'm not the only one to have first assumed it to be. In motion it's strangely unncanny. Hopefully it turns out this mouse is the cat's meow, see! - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 26th March</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>Look, I am not overly sold on this being great, but it's a new arcade racer from a series I loved way back when 3D graphics were taking off. The original is a proper PC classic that only real ones remember. New Screamer, with anime-stylings and a story centred on a big racing tournament, isn't really old Screamer in anything but name, but it does have a control/power-up system that might give it an edge. It's broadly similar to how the underappreciated Inertia Drift placed drift on the right stick, but also includes mechanics tied to gear changes, boosts, shields, and powerful attack barges. OK, this sounds great - I'm more in than I thought! - <em>Tom O</em></p>

</ul>
<p>007 First Light, coming from Hitman developer IO Interactive, is an origin story for James Bond, popping us into the shoes of an inexperienced and somewhat reckless MI6 agent. As you would expect from IO, the game promises some spectacularly opulent settings, along with gun fights, car chases, and - of course - gadgets.

<p>OK, hear me out. Yes, the development of this game has been cursed. Yes, Bungie is a shadow of its former self. But with all the attention Arc Raiders has garnered since its barn-storming release last year, it looks like the extraction shooter genre has finally barged its way into the mainstream, and people may actually be willing to give this one a chance. Bungie has been, traditionally, best-in-class when it comes to gunplay and production value, so maybe - just maybe - Marathon can shake off its horrid pre-launch legacy and really make a splash in 2026. - <em>Dom P</em></p>

<p>The roguelike deck-building card game that birthed a genre. Slay the Spire 2 isn't going to reinvent the wheel but present a very similar experience with more variation.

<p>Lana and Mui are returning later this year, in Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf, where players will once again be plopped into the series' picturesque 2D world. On its release, developer Wishfully promises another profound sci-fi story, but this time with more challenging puzzles to solve along with a deeper narrative to unravel. Planet of Lana 2 will also feature refined stealth mechanics, new underwater sections, and fresh abilities for Lana's sidekick Mui. Planet of Lana 2 essentially hopes to take everything that was praised on the original's release, and make it even better. <em>- Victoria PK</em></p>

<p>The original Tomodachi Life is a Nintendo 3DS game that has you managing your own island of Miis, and despite its simple nature, it possessed many hilarious and outright bizarre interactions which made it as beloved as it was, and still is. I was one of many who always hoped for a sequel or remaster of this game but after years of waiting, frankly never thought it would happen, yet here we are!</p><p>Once again, it looks like Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream will follow the same suit as its predecessor: you get to play God with an island of Miis, and will help shape their lives, looks, and relationships however you see fit. Even if Living the Dream brings nothing particularly new to the table, I am excited to ride the nostalgia train more than anything here (and play it on Switch 2 rather than my 3DS no less), but I do also hope same-sex relationships will finally be present in-game. - <em>Kelsey R</em></p>

<p>If it feels like you've played Tankrat before, it's probably because you have! Tankrat is a revamped and evolved version of Tankhead, an Epic exclusive game which launched at the end of 2024. Tankrat features epic tank on tank action across a variety of post-apocalyptic maps and it has a rather unique twist to accompany its mecha-Ghibli visuals - any tank you destroy can be salvaged for parts which can then be placed directly onto your own tank! As a lover of action shooters and roguelites, I thought Tankhead so I'm excited to see how Tankrat has evolved the game's already unique formula - <em>Ian H </em></p>

<p>Experimental Capcom is hands-down the best Capcom. This is a publisher that has a pretty fabulously high batting average for when it steps outside of its franchise IP comfort zone to make something new. We got Dead Rising and Dragon's Dogma out of this sort of experimentation. Even when such games haven't been commercial hits, they're almost always interesting - like 2024's Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. I will always sit up and listen when Capcom says they have something new and unconventional that isn't another run-out of an established property.</p><p>Pragmata has Capcom at its experimental best written all over it, as far as I'm concerned - esoteric, strange, unique… a bit weird, probably rather wonderful. I've loved every hands-on opportunity I've had, and I can't wait to experience the final thing. <em>- Alex D</em></p>

<p>For a game that you can play happily for hundreds of hours, with regular season updates, dozens of end-game modes and an almost overwhelming amount of #content, Diablo 4 still feels unfinished.

<p>One of my favourite games of the PS5 era, Returnal, finally gets a sequel this year. Except it's not actually a sequel but it might as well be a sequel because it's basically a sequel even though it's allegedly a new IP. That's right, Housemarque's third-person, bullet hell roguelike game Saros with its mysterious sci-fi horror narrative, moody visuals and epic audio design might sound identical to 2021's Returnal but in terms of storyline and characters, it's completely different. With Rahul Kohli in the leading role, Saros combines star power with Housemarque's signature rock-solid arcade action and I cannot wait to explore its worlds and uncover whatever mysteries lie within - whilst also doing a bunch of swears because it's really fricking hard, probably. - <em>Ian H</em></p>

<p>It's hard to think of a more fitting setting for a 'cosy' management game than a small town Japanese convenience store, or konbini. With key art referencing that one (in)famous Lawson that had to put up a screen to stop the flood of tourists looking to photograph it in front of Mt. Fuji, it's pretty clear what developer Nagai Industries is shooting for here.

<p>Half Sword is one of those games that seems to have been flittering about the social media algorithms for years, but never actually released. But anyway, if you've ever spotted two semi-naked medieval mannequins battering the absolute snot out of each other in a square pen, then you've seen Half Sword, a physics-based dueller that seems to be trying to solve the riddle of what happens when you cross Bennet Foddy with a slightly worrying amount of gore.

<p>With The Sims 5 still seemingly forever away, enter a new wave of avatar-management life sim games, of which Paralives might be one of the most exciting. A perfectly pitched art style - sort of eerily realistic but also pastel-hued and cutesy too - an appropriately thorough character-creator and an intriguing Patreon-funded development model, before it even reaches Early Access this year, all add to the interest. And there's never been a better time for EA to have some proper competition. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>I'm a sucker for the Supermassive formula, the choose your own horror story which works surprisingly well as a social experience when played with other people in the room. Directive 8020 is a big step for the series. It's an upgrade visually, a move to more standalone settings for the games, and mechanically it's got a new 'turning point' system whereby you can go back and change pivotal decisions you made. There've been a few wobbles, Directive 8020 suffering a big delay last year, but here's hoping it's stabilised in the months since. - <em>Bertie P</em></p>

<p>Good vibes: the video game this one. Fancy going camper vanning in a sunny open world with a very friendly looking collie and a seemingly magically expansive amount of storage? Me too!

<p>Super Mario Bros. Wonder is probably my favourite 2D Mario game. No, it's not just recency bias - there's something about this wonderful little game (no pun intended) that just plastered a smile on my face from beginning to end. It's so playful. It's so musical. It's so knowing. Getting the chance to play it again, on better hardware, makes me more excited than most of the games on this list, to be honest. Even the obnoxious flowers yelling at me as I trample over them can't dull the shine of this beautiful little platformer. <em>- Dom P</em></p>

<p>If you like to look at incomprehensibly fast and complex action choreography and yell PHWOARRR, this is the game for you. I've played a bit of it, back at a Summer Game Fest of yore, and that combat is deeply impressive in person too. The boss fights are where it shines - if it can lace those together with equal intricacy, this'll be a winner. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Listen, they know exactly what they're doing with that name.

<p>Well then. GTA 6 is coming this year, and you can absolutely not count on that because who knows at this point whether Rockstar's latest release date (at the time of writing) will stick. Alleged union-busting has cast a shadow on the usual megahype-cycle, just as serious issues with crunch did back with Red Dead Redemption 2, but this game will be bigger than big, whenever it arrives, and we expect it to be spectacular. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>FromSoftware is, of course, having a bit of a multiplayer moment, and following last year's successful Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign, the studio is readying to release its intriguing The Duskbloods as a Switch 2 exclusive in 2026. Officially a "PvPvE title with online multiplayer", it sees up to eight players - cast as vampire-like Bloodsworn - battling each other and powerful enemies in a bid to claim the mysterious First Blood. It's a battle that unfolds across space and time, giving From license to mash together a chaotic assortment of styles creating a vibe that feels something like Bloodborne meets Sekiro meets Dark Souls, with dinosaurs and jetpacks thrown in. There's still plenty we don't know about The Duskbloods, but excitement is unquestionably (and understandably) high for this one - <em>Matt W</em></p>

<p>The Ghostrunner devs know how to make a game that feels good in the hands, all momentum and spectacle. Pushing you into a doomed European wasteland armed with a sabre, a pistol, and a handful of magic (think Dishonored or BioShock), One More Level has absolutely nailed the grimdark vibe I'd expect from Ghostrunner-goes-Napoleonic fantasy. It's hard, it's compelling, and it's janky in a way that's charming and interesting. I can't wait to see what monstrous bosses await in the trenches of a doomed France. - <em>Dom P</em></p>

<p>I was late to the Dave the Diver party, only playing it last year via PlayStaion Plus. But when I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. A sumptuous celebration of food, community, and the importance of balancing ecological responsibility and sustainability with keeping small, indie businesses alive, the game has such a sweet, pure heart. More of that, but set in a jungle and moving from sushi to a grill!? Count me in. A game that appeals to both my inner Bourdain and my inner Indiana Jones, what a treat. - <em>Dom P</em></p>

<p>Look, I really enjoyed Deadpool &amp; Wolverine - so much so that it was one of the most fun films I saw in 2024. Counter point: I don't love Insomniac's Spider-Man games. Counter counter point: I love the studio's Ratchet &amp; Clank games. Which brings us to Marvel's Wolverine, a game I might love or find a little dull. No matter, if it releases in 2026 it's going to be huge on PS5. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<p>Control Resonant is the sequel to Remedy's hit 2019 game, Control. This time round you'll be playing as Dylan Faden as he searches for his sister Jesse, the original game's protagonist, after the Federal Bureau of Control fails to prevent a supernatural force from escaping their clutches. (I'm starting to think that the FBC aren't very good at their job.) Let's just hope Ahti the janitor is around to offer some good advice… - <em>Lottie L</em></p>

<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the next game from Amy Hennig, a name you may recognise from PlayStation's Uncharted series. In the upcoming superhero romp, players will be able to assume the role of four central characters. Those characters? First, we have a young Steve Rogers, so yes, Captain America himself. Then, we have the World War 2 era's Black Panther, which is to say T'Challa's grandfather Azzuri. Joining these two iconic Marvel heroes are Gabriel Jones - a US soldier and member of the Howling Commandos - and Nanali, a Wakandan spy who is embedded in Occupied Paris.</p><p>We still haven't seen a <em>huge </em>amount from the game, though we have had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-details-and-first-look-at-wakanda-revealed-by-writer-amy-hennig">peek at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's take on Wakanda</a>, as well as a look at its<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game"> use of Epic's MetaHuman Creator</a>, which gives each character remarkable detail.

<p>I reckon recent Fire Emblem games have something of an on-off thing, at least for me. Discounting spin-offs and remakes, I reckon 2012's Awakening was a genre-defining masterpiece. Then 2015's Fates was an interesting evolution, but ultimately not really as good. Then 2019's Three Houses was, again, a genre-shaking and franchise-altering classic. But in 2023, Engage just couldn't ignite the same spark. And now, in 2026, we have Fortune's Weave. My hope, my dream, is for a return of that feeling Three Houses and Awakening gave me. If that's there, this could well be a GOTY contender for me. <em>- Alex D</em></p>

<p>Guess who's back, back again. Lara's back, tell your friends! 2026 is the Tomb Raider series' 30th anniversary, and to celebrate we are getting a from the ground up remake of the original 1996 game, known as Legacy of Atlantis. This chap has been developed in Unreal Engine 5, and promises fans old and new a game that will 'honour the spirit' of Lara's debut adventure. While those who have played the original will have a pretty decent idea of what lies ahead, developers Crystal Dynamics and Flying Wild Hog have said there will still be plenty of surprises to uncover on Legacy of Atlantis' release later this year. Personally, I absolutely cannot wait for this one! -<em> Victoria PK</em></p>

<p>I will not apologise for being a card-carrying Gears of War fan. I've loved or enjoyed every game in the series, and it's been an absolute age since we got Gears 5 (2019) and Hivebusters (2020). I am ready for a big comeback. A prequel set 14 years before the original game didn't please some, but I'm onboard with the idea of seeing Emergence Day play out alongside Marcus and Dom. It should be part of a big year for Xbox's key franchises, and its success may well determine what the future holds for the series. No pressure, then. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<p>One of the great real-time strategy series is back from the dead. The sadness at it being away from its home with Relic is mitigated somewhat, too, by the fact my first hands-on impressions with it were fantastic. DoW 4 is a booming, immensely satisfying take, at least from the one mission I've played many times over. Suitably dark and suitably camp, if it all comes together in the full game I expect the entirety of my free time to disappear into the Warp. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

</ul>
<p>A Witcher-like role-playing game made by people who made The Witcher games, including Witcher 3 director Konrad Tomaskiewicz. That heritage is plain to see. But there are differences. You are a part-human, part-vampire hero whose abilities change in the day and night; and there's a brave, open-ended approach to the game that The Witcher 3 didn't have. I get tremendously excited when people get an opportunity to rethink RPGs, and Rebel Wolves is doing this with Blood of Dawnwalker. Will it rival the series it heralds from? We'll see. - <em>Bertie P</em></p>

<p>It's the Untitled Goose Game devs' new thing! That alone should be enough. No? Alright fine: it's a game about some very odd Morph-from-UK-kids-TV-style bird characters who must all work together - in co-op! - to solve environmental and traversal puzzles, using proximity voice chat and scribbling on signs and more. This is one of those that's going to be tough to sell on the page, I'm realising at this very moment, but almost certainly a joy in the hands. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Corrrrrrrrrrrrr. I first got a super-secret look at Orbitals some time ago and have had to suppress all memory of it since, simply because it would've been far too exciting to sit around waiting for otherwise.

<p>What if Stardew Valley was bleak as all sin? That's more or less it with Neverway, a life sim horror action RPG genre-magpie with very nice pixel art and very horrible sound design, if the trailer's anything to go by. I sense a very specific subset of witchy-cosy-farming-fans being absolutely laser-targeted here, and why not? The result looks like a (horrible) treat. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>Super-chewy pixelated tactical roguelike RPG anyone? That's Neath. It's a grid-based affair where positioning in combat - and manipulating enemy positioning in combat - is paramount.

<p>Philosophy and sci-fi have always been perfect bedfellows, as have the sinister vibes and dark mystery we've come to expect from the developer of Soma, Penumbra and Amnesia. As for pitches, that'll do it, and if that wasn't enough: Stellan Skarsgard's in it, which is a bit of a coup. And it's published by Kepler Interactive (Clair Obscur, Pacific Drive, Rematch, Ultros, several others on this list…) which as a publisher-collective has been on an absolute tear. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>While Galactic Racer doesn't seem to be a pod racing game, as per the classic game developed to tie into the racing sequence in Star Wars: Episode One, a new Star Wars racing game of any kind is a very exciting thing (I'd even be mildly interested in a new Super Bombad Racing, but very mildly), and this one could have the juice (Force?). In development at Fuse Games, the studio created by former Criterion leaders, the racing pedigree should hopefully shine through. I'm not expecting a huge game, but fast, technical racing set in glorious Star Wars locations will be plenty. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<p>The idea for Out of Words came from a Danish poet, Morten Søndergaard. It's a co-op-only game - by couch or cross-platform online - about the first time its two protagonists held hands.

<p>A John Wick-style 'gun fu' single-player shooter, Spine looks ferocious. Rapid, kinetic animation and some extremely cool choreography meet a bit of good old punk attitude and lots and lots of very nice <em>whapack</em> punching sounds. And the enemy's an evil AI regime!

<p>It never fails to amaze me how influential Heroes 3 was and still is as a game. Olden Era is a newly made prequel to the turn-based strategy Heroes series, but it's clearly serving game number three. The styling is the same, the gameplay is broadly the same - though as a modern interpretation it can use improvements made to the genre since. The question is, can it recapture the magic? - <em>Bertie</em></p>

<p>Rumours abound that Starfield is getting a Cyberpunk 2077-style '2.0' update some time this year, and with the PS5 release still to come there's a nicely pre-aligned marketing beat sitting there ready to go if that were to happen. Bethesda is in a very interesting place at the moment, with the Oblivion remaster reigniting The Elder Scrolls excitement and Fallout riding a TV-boosted high.

<p>I've played Mixtape and I will tell you right now, it is <em>funny</em>. Trailers, being trailers, have largely focused on the general overall vibe, but the brilliance in this one is going to be in all the little beats of attention to detail. Like any great coming-of-age story it'll be equal parts raw and awkward, goofy and sincere. It's a whip-smart narrative game. It's nostalgic and autumnal and bittersweet. It's very West Coast. It's from the team behind the cult favourite The Artful Escape. And it is, from what I've played, really very good. - <em>Chris T</em></p>

<p>This is a funny one for me. I'm a Forza Horizon fan, for sure, but my interest has waned a little as the series has gone on. I also really enjoyed Ubisoft's The Crew Motorfest, which sort of scratched that open-world racer itch, and I am not one of the vocal crowd that was calling for a game set in Japan. But, I think back to the Tokyo tracks in PGR4, the hours I spent time-trialing for medals, and the excitement builds. I do think FH6 will need to shake the formula up a bit rather than just offer what FH5 did in a new location, but if Playground Games can do that we might well get one of the best games of 2026. - <em>Tom O</em></p>

<p>I've got a soft spot for the Plague Tale series and this is a big departure. The story of Hugo and Amicia, brother and sister, is done. Resonance is the story of Sophia, the person you meet in Plague Tale: Requiem, but told 15 years beforehand. There's an intriguing-sounding dual timeline that flashes back to a Sophia of ancient times, and there's puzzling, buried treasure, curses, and more. I'm fascinated to see what the series feels like away from its original sibling duo. <em>- Bertie P</em></p>

<p>Once upon a time, it was easy to get excited at the prospect of more Subnautica - the original underwater survival adventure is a gem; an enormously compelling blend of often terrifying exploration, scavenging and crafting, and propulsive sci-fi storytelling. Developer Unknown Worlds’ standalone expansion, Below Zero, didn’t quite reach the same dizzy heights (depths?) but the studio seemed to know where it had gone wrong when it hinted at a more back-to-basics approach - plus a few cooperative knobs - for Subnautica 2. The problem? The acrimonious legal battle between Unknown Worlds’ ousted leadership (including original Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland) and studio owner Krafton, which has gone some way to tainting enthusiasm for the project <em>- Matt</em></p>
<h3>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</h3>

</ul>
<p>I think this might be the best 'power fantasy' pick of 2026. Miyamoto Musashi is a famed swordsman, and perhaps one of the most influential folk heroes of Japanese history. Capcom knows this, and isn't shy about making you feel that way in this game. With swordplay and motion-capture that felt best-in-class last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-one-of-those-rare-game-previews-that-made-me-think-ok-yeah-im-going-to-platinum-this-one">when I previewed it in the summer</a>, I think more time in the oven can really show off what Capcom can do in the RE Engine when the scope is narrowed down a bit and presented in a super cinematic way. I just hope there's enough to it to keep us all engaged for a full campaign.  - <em>Dom P</em></p>
<h3>Over the Hill</h3>

<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the Hill - properly styled "over the hill" but we can't be having that - is the follow up from the equally-lowercased Art of Rally studio Funselektor. A mix of nice driving mechanics and even nicer atmosphere are added to this time by a focus on exploration and survival. If you never quite managed to fill up that "quit your job and drive a Defender across the world" piggy bank, this might at least take the edge off. - <em>- Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Nivalis</h3>

</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>You might remember a game called Cloudpunk from a couple years back, which had you drive (pilot?) a flying taxi around a quite breathtaking cyberpunk city of the future. Nivalis is the name of the city, and a smartly opportunistic follow-up from the developer that instead focuses on the narrative side of getting by, slice-of-life style, in a typically noiry, neon-rich voxel-style world. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Chronicles: Medieval</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Raw Power Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026 (Early Access)</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>A lavish medieval sandbox action-RPG, Chronicles: Medieval is a winner if we're going purely by back-of-box descriptions. Gameplay details are thin, and it's only coming to Early Access this year, but from the lone trailer it's certainly an eye-catcher, with promise of 'visceral large-scale battles' and bowl cuts galore. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Wanderburg</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Randwerk</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Something a bit different, this: castles! On wheels! Why didn't we think of this sooner?! It's from Randwerk, the developer-cooperative being a game called Abriss, which you might've spotted from back in 2023 as the one about big buildings falling over very impressively. (No really - it's great!). In this one a different kind of building looks to get destroyed in a different kind of way, but still. We love a dev with a signature. And in all seriousness, this looks pretty, silly, and kind of smart all in one. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Game of Thrones: War for Westeros</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>PlaySide</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Real-time strategy is a perfect fit for the army-based warmongering and political conquest of A Game of Thrones / A Song of Fire and Ice, and this looks like a glossy and satisfying realisation of this. Will the Winds of Winter, the next book in the series, ever be released? Who knows? But I can play this and pretend to be Tywin Lannister all the same. - <em>Bertie P</em></p>
<h3>At Fate's End</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Thunder Lotus</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>At Fate's End is the next from Thunder Lotus, developer of the excellent Spiritfarer. A lavish cutscene animation style and very snappy-looking combat are the big sellers here, alongside some good old sword-maiden pazzazz, in an action-adventure game which promises a no less "intimate" story than the studio's previous. Looks rad. - <em>Chris T</em></p>
<h3>Fable</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X/S</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing there's still a fair bit of uncertainty over Fable's 2026 release date, and to be honest until I see a date appear at the end of a new trailer I'm operating on the assumption this one might get bumped into 2027. I really hope not, though, as I love Fable. Playground Games knows how to make big hits, but this action adventure game will need to capture the magic of the original games and then some in order to make a big impact some 16 years after Lionhead released Fable 3. - <em>Tom O</em></p>
<h3>Earth Must Die</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> Q1 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>After strange dalliances in other realms - namely fast-paced stealth action in The Swindle, arcade football in Behold the Kickmen, and at least half a platform game in Lair of the Clockwork God - developer Size Five Games is properly returning to the point-and-click genre where it made its name in this year’s Earth Must Die. Or is it? This time around, the comedic point-and-clickery is hampered by an alien protagonist - specifically a “fascist dictator bellend” - who refuses to pick anything up. So, much of the time, you’ll be attempting to get things done by coercing other characters into doing your bidding. It sounds fascinating, looks great, and has an impressive Brit cast, including Alex Horne, Tamsin Greig, Matthew Holness, Stevie Martin, Sally Beaumont, and (inevitably) Ben Starr <em>- Matt</em></p>
<h3>Toem 2</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> Q1 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Developer Something We Made’s original Toem was a lovely thing; a charmingly quirky  handdrawn puzzle adventure with a photography twist. So word of a sequel was a very pleasant surprise - and it’ll finally be with us this year. As before, you're touring a whimsical world to snap pictures of strange phenomena, and by making friends and completing quests, you’ll upgrade your camera with tools like scissors for snipping stuff and a hammer for smashing things. On top of that, you’ve got expanded mobility options, a new artstyle that adapts the original’s striking black-and-white looks into more detailed 3D, and more, suggesting fans of the laidback original are in for a good time - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Denshattack!</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>What if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> but runaway trains? It’s easy to imagine that was the pitch for developer Undercoders’ eye-catching debut Denshattack. Its nods to Sega’s Dreamcast classic, from its striking cell-shaded aesthetic to its trick-based grinding action, are undeniable - even if it <em>does</em> swap inline skating for graffiti-strewn, gravity defying trains. As you rail-ride across a vibrant dystopian Japan, you'll ollie and kickflip to rack up points and win over rivals in a bid to thwart the sinister Miraidō corporation. It looks like an absolute riot, and that’s before we get to mechanical worms, roving castles, and magical mech girls - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Professor Layton and the World of Steam</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch 2, Switch</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh how I’ve missed you Professor! It’s frankly been far too long an absence for developer Level-5’s esteemed puzzle solver and his sidekick Luke, but finally - well over a decade after the series’ prequel trilogy wrapped up with Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy - Hershel Layton and his magnificent hat are back. Sure, we’ve had spin-offs and crossovers since then, but this year’s Professor Layton and the World of Steam looks like a proper return to the wonderfully compelling world that started it all. Picking up after 2010’s Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, Luke and the Professor this time face a new mystery - and a whole bunch of new puzzles - in the American town of Steam Bison. I can’t wait - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Moves of the Diamond Hand</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026 (EA)</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</li>
</ul>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Cosmo D might not be a name on everybody’s radar, but the musician and game designer has been releasing fascinating, richly atmospheric oddities for over a decade now. His most recent effort, 2022’s Betrayal at Club Low, took the exploratory narrative adventuring of his earlier games and infused it with table-top style dice rolling as players, in the role of a pizzaiolo-spy, attempted to infiltrate the titular club. And dice are back in this year’s Moves of the Diamond Hand - a noir RPG set to the backdrop of a “surreal dystopian jazz-drenched city”. Expect a return to the first-person exploration of Cosmo D’s earliest games, alongside deeper dicing, and a richer, grander narrative. All of which sounds fab - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Dosa Divas</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC and unspecified consoles</li>
</ul>
<p>Two years after impressing with its cooking-and-skating mash-up Thirsty Suitors, developer Outerloop Games is back with another high-energy culinary adventure in Dosa Divas. Officially a "spicy RPG", it sees players embarking on a chaotic road trip filled with evil corporate goons and communities in need of help as they attempt to bring down their sister’s fast-food empire. You’ll ride mechs, reconcile relationships, and battle enemies using a timing-based turn-based combat system reminiscent of Paper Mario, but with a flavour-matching twist. Consider me intrigued - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>There are No Ghosts at the Grand</h3>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>Developer Friday Sundae’s There Are No Ghosts at The Grand is one of those games that feels like it’s somehow been designed specifically to cater to my interests. It's part musical, part home renovation sim, and part ghostbusting mystery adventure, that even squeezes in a malevolent talking cat. Amid all this, you’ve unexpectedly inherited a dilapidated hotel in the British seaside town of Kingswood-on-Sea, and have 30 days to do it up. By day, you’ll demolish rooms and redecorate them, or perhaps you’ll explore the town’s cobblestone streets, take a boat out to sea, or a scooter into the countryside in your search to uncover the hotel’s secrets. By night you’ll bust ghosts as something evil draws nearer, and throughout it all you’ll encounter songs, a cast of eccentrics, and a protagonist with motives so secret he’ll even try and hide them from the player. Frankly, it sounds brilliant - <em>Matt</em></p>
<h3>Phasmophobia 1.0</h3>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Kinetic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>Release date:</strong> 2026</li>
<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve played Phasmophobia for a grand total of about 20 minutes in my lifetime, ten of which I spent hiding in the van. As much as I love horror, Kinetic Games’ co-operative ghost hunting adventure is just a little bit too intense for me. That said, I might finally be tempted back to brave its much-expanded haunts when it finally leaves early access and gets its eagerly awaited 1.0 launch later this year. Phasmophobia had a busy 2025 update-wise, and it sounds like the road to 1.0 will be all about finessing, with talk of map reworks, character model overhauls, and loads more. So much, in fact, that Kinetic has said 1.0 will almost be like “playing a new game”. Hopefully my nerves will hold up - <em>Matt</em></p>

            <p>No matter how you feel about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders</a>' use of AI for NPC voices, it's hard to deny the game has been a massive success that's "cracked open" the extraction shooter subgenre for casual players and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-games-performed-really-well-on-steam-last-year-shaking-the-dominance-of-the-same-old-live-service-games">even harpooned some older live service whales</a>. Now, it's hit a new milestone which positions it as one of the new online shooters to watch out for.</p>
<p>On 13th January, developer Embark Studios announced <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620?s=20">via its social channels</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has recruited over 12 million players to date. That means over 12m copies of the game sold, as the studio made a "premium entry" bet which has paid off big time. <a href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/arc-raiders-sold-over-12-4-million-units-in-just-ten-weeks/">GamesMarkt</a> shared a more specific number: 12.4m copies sold in just 10 weeks. Moreover, the game reached "960,000 concurrent players on all platforms in January 2026."</p>
<p>For Embark Studios, the most important fact might be that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">player retention has been notable</a>, with the game holding its ground against <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players">Battlefield 6's massive success</a> and capturing much of the attention that normally would've gone towards Call of Duty after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> was a disappointment that many longtime fans feared.</p>
<p>To celebrate, Embark Studios is gifting everyone "who logged in since launch till 23:59 CET, 13th Jan" a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool that will be added to their inventory upon logging into the game. The update is rolling out today.</p>

<p>We could also argue Arc Raiders is partially responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Steam setting a new concurrent users record earlier this month</a> as it's managed to comfortably sit among olden heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-update-wipes-nearly-2-billion-off-skin-market-value-by-making-fancy-knives-and-gloves-easier-to-get">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">DOTA 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>. That's no small feat.</p>
<p>With PlayStation and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Marathon</a> seeking to capture at least part of the same crowd's attention come March, more players being into PvPvE shooters after Arc Raiders could be a surprise blessing for the beleaguered game.</p>
<p>So, what's the next stop for this newborn franchise? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-sure-sounds-keen-to-make-an-arc-raiders-film">A movie, probably</a>.</p>

            <p>The dispute between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> studio Rockstar and over 30 of its former developers rages on, with those affected denied interim pay by a UK tribunal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 12th January, a judge ruled against making Rockstar to pay interim relief to its former developers, which the studio fired in October of last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">in a move called by many "union busting"</a>. Rockstar itself has claimed the affected staff were let go due to gross misconduct, but this didn't appease UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB). Soon after the dismissals, the organisation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a>, noting that all those affected were members of a union.</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-games-and-iwgb-clash-at-preliminary-hearing-for-fired-gta-6-workers">IWGB asked a judge to grant the fired developers interim relief</a>, which  is a method of financial support for people awaiting a full hearing. If the motion had been granted, the fired employees would have returned to Rockstar's payroll. However, it was not, though the union and its members remain undeterred in the fight for justice.</p>

<p>"We are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar's flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful," the IWGB said in a statement shared with Eurogamer.</p><p>It added "the judge stated in her ruling that: 'There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings'". The IWGB additionally said Rockstar had broken multiple procedural guidelines with its firing of the affected employees. This included the lack of disciplinary meetings, employees being unable to appeal "until six weeks later", and zero evidence of an investigation.</p>
<p>"Comments relied on by Rockstar's lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using a private union Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring'," the union said. It added the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">Discord members Rockstar claimed were journalists and competitors were in fact union officials and employees who had recently left the company</a>. The IWGB said those in the server were still bound by the same non-disclosure agreements as then-current employees.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the judge's decision to deny interim relief to the former Rockstar employees, the IWGB said it knew this was going to be a long shot, and had it been secured it would have been "unprecedented" for a group of this number. However, the union said this latest development does not mean that "Rockstar will not be found guilty of unfair dismissal" when the case goes to trial. IWGB president Alex Marshall stated the union is "more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar's calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful", despite the refusal for interim relief.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an anonymous former Rockstar employee said: "This decision to fail to award [interim relief] is a gut-punch to everyone legitimately engaged in trade union activities. The real world consequences of this are forcing valuable people to leave this country, upending their families and destroying their lives, and all because of the actions of a ruthless, uncaring employer's quest to crush a trade union." </p><p>They added they will "continue to fight" in order to clear their name, and the names of other affected employees. "This decision, while not in our favour, is not an exoneration of Rockstar's behaviour and actions. Merely a stumbling block on the road to justice," they closed.</p>
<p><strong>[UPDATE 11.43am]</strong> A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> has just shared a statement with Eurogamer regarding this week's rejection of interim relief, which you can read below:</p>
<p>“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union's application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar's position throughout.</p>
<p>"We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing."</p>

<p>In addition to the IWGB's legal case against Rockstar, over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">200 employees at Rockstar have signed a letter to management condemning the firing</a> of their fellow staff members.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">dismissals were also discussed in the UK Parliament last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK prime minister Keir Starmer has since called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning"</a>. The PM added that ministers would be looking further into the dismissals at Rockstar.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Much has been written about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a>'s handling of its lead female character, the culture war surrounding it, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/stellar-blade-cuts-unintentional-reference-to-racial-slur-3750534">developer Shift Up's several eyebrow-raising missteps</a> as the game broke through into mainstream consciousness. Regardless, the PS5 title was a big success and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">a sequel is now in development</a>. Before we even get a first look at it, however, a new storm appears to be brewing.</p>
<p>AI, generative or not, is the talk of town, and by town I mean the entire games industry. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Larian tries to toy with gen-AI while not using the tech for final assets</a> and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-cancerous-manor-lords-publisher-hooded-horse-wants-to-avoid-genai-like-the-plague">publishers like Hooded Horse unequivocally dunk on studios using it</a>, the debate refuses to go away. 2026 may be defined by the widespread adoption or rejection of AI tools, and hopefully, by people finally figuring out the difference between tools that have been around for a while and the controversial gen-AI. The well has already been poisoned, sadly.</p>
<p>Shift Up CEO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> director Hyung-tae Kim is bullish on the whole package, it seems. During a national briefing on South Korea's 2026 Economic Growth Strategy, the developer claimed it's "an essential tool for going up against large competitors like China on a global level". <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">Automaton</a> reported on (and translated) the news first shared by <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1770030">GameMeca</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who's been paying attention to the games industry for the last few years is well aware of China's increasingly large presence, with behemoths like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chinese-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-reaches-two-million-players-in-just-24-hours-of-global-release">Where Winds Meet</a> making waves and rising to compete against the Japanese and Western giants that have typically dominated the market. Meanwhile, South Korea has started to exit the MMO-oriented creative trends and begun to punch above its weight with triple-A projects. It comes as no surprise to see more and more developers in the country betting on AI (even if it's not of the <em>generative</em> kind) as its ambitions grow larger, too.</p><p>Kim "argues that widespread use of AI will not result in people losing their jobs, because competing with major industries like China and the US will require not only utilising all available manpower, but also making everyone proficient in AI". Press X to doubt, as immediately, he stated one person could "perform the work of 100 people" with the assistance of these tools.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the adoption of AI assistance into the general pipeline really will make games bigger, better, or more profitable for publishers, but either way, it seems like the conversation around this topic - and the consequences of its general usage - will not go away any time soon.</p>

            <p>Capcom has announced a Resident Evil showcase, which will give us all a closer look at what the team has in store for its upcoming release, Requiem.</p>
<p>The showcase itself will take place this Thursday, 15th January (that's our Lottie's birthday, if you want to send her a message :D). It will begin at 10pm UK time, which for those across the pond is 2pm PST / 3pm MST / 4pm CST / 5pm EST.</p>

<p>As for what we will see, Capcom has assured gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem. The showcase will run for roughly 12 minutes, <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/showcase/en-us/">the studio has said</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to be released across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a> on 27th February. Along with Grace Ashcroft  - who is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character that featured in spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-outbreak">Resident Evil Outbreak</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">fan favourite Leon Kennedy will also be returning for Requiem</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-leak-points-to-a-second-playable-character-and-it-isnt-leon">another potential returning face from the series that could show up</a>, if earlier store page leaks are to be believed (I won't spoil it here, don't worry).</p>
<p>So, will you be joining in for the Resident Evil Requiem showcase this Thursday?</p>

<p>Last year, Capcom assured its Resi fans the team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-pc-woes-like-monster-hunter-wilds-says-capcom">working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC</a>, after a multitude of technical issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. So, that bodes well!</p>

We already knew Hytale was likely to have a major early access release this week, but developer Hypixel Studios has now revealed the long-awaited Minecraft-a-like has sold so many copies ahead of its launch that it's made enough money to fund the next two years of development.

Development of Hytale, an RPG-like Minecraft-style sandbox experience, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">began in 2015</a>, garnering plenty of attention - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games investing millions into the project before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>. But last year it seemed like Hytale's adventure might have reached an end after Riot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">made the decision to pull the plug</a>, forcing Hypixel to announce it would be "winding down" its operations as a result.

<p>
Somewhat miraculously, however, Hytale survived; Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced he'd <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year, and the whole dramatic saga appears to have created massively renewed interest in the project. Ahead of Hytale's early access launch on 13th January this week, Collins-Laflamme revealed Hypixel is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">expecting 1m players on release day</a> - and encouraged purchasers to download the game's launcher in advance (Hytale is only available for purchase via the studio's website during early access) to reduce server stress.
</p><p>
Now, Collins-Laflamme has explained what the massive number of pre-purchases means for Hytale's continued development. "Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases," he wrote <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614?s=20">on social media</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," he continued, "we are looking very strong for the future." That's clearly encouraging news, both for early adopters and for the studio as it works to fulfil Hytale's early promise.
</p>
<p>
Players wanting to get involved in Hytale's early access have three options, with Hypixel <a href="https://store.hytale.com/">currently selling</a> a $23.99 USD standard edition, a $41.99 Supporter Edition, and an $83.99 Founder's Edition on its site - with the latter two versions including a selection of additional cosmetic outfits and capes.

            <p>Peter Molyneux's Masters of Albion - which the game creator has said is the "culmination" of his life's work - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>Masters of Albion is coming from Molyneux and 22cans, and will arrive on 22nd April for PC via Steam. "Masters of Albion is a bold reimagining of the God Game genre, from the creator who defined it," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/">official Steam description</a>. "Revel in the freedom of true Godhood. In [Masters of Albion], there is no single solution, only your solution. Build whatever, wherever. Hire whoever, whenever. Kill or carry, crush or coax.</p>
<p>"You are the ultimate power."</p>

<p>Molyneux said Masters of Albion's forthcoming release owes "so much" to other games already out there, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>, Black &amp; White and Fable, which he famously also worked on.</p>
<p>"It's a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/masters-of-albion-is-the-culmination-of-my-lifes-work-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-has-a-release-date-and-a-new-trailer">the developer said</a> of Masters of Albion.</p>
<p>The game itself will allow players to command the world with ancient powers. You want to build it, you go for it. The world of Albion is, quite literally, in your hands.</p>
<p>You can check out the new launch date trailer for Masters of Albion below.</p>

<p>Masters of Albion was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">revealed during Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>. Our former editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance">Tom Phillips spoke to Molyneux all about Masters of Albion ahead of its reveal</a>, where the developer said:</p>
<p>"I'm in my 60s now… My lifestyle is so awful. My life expectancy is probably measured in seconds rather than years. So if I'm going to design another game, it's got to <em>matter</em>."</p>

            <p>Gaming can't escape the shadow of global economic uncertainty, and things are going to get worse following <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/microsoft-xbox-prices-tariffs-macroeconomic-conditions.html">2025's price hikes</a> due to the memory shortages caused by the AI and data centre gold rush (which doesn't seem to be producing much gold just yet). What about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> following a strong summer launch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">but slow Christmas</a>? Will it be safe from the price hikes?</p>
<p>According to an interview for <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> (read and extracted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-monitoring-high-ram-prices-and-tariff-impacts-very-closely-president-shuntaro-furukawa-says/">VGC</a>), Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa isn't ready to sound the alarm yet, but he acknowledges things aren't looking too great at the moment.</p>
<p>"We procure from suppliers based on our medium- to long-term business plans, but the current memory market is very volatile… There is no immediate impact on earnings, but it is something we must monitor closely."</p>
<p>Furukawa also went on to explain Nintendo is trying to reduce the impact of the annoying RAM shortages and fluctuating tariffs (not limited to the United Sates) by "advancing component procurement over the medium to long term." Of course, at some point the company might run out of runway, which could lead to increased prices<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them"> in line with PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">Xbox's</a> unwelcome adjustments.</p><p>For now, Furukawa won't comment on potential price increases, only saying it's hypothetical talk until things get more difficult. He was more open about the impact of tariffs though: "While it's difficult to accurately gauge the future impact, our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost and pass them on to prices as much as possible, not just in the US."</p>
<p>For those unaware, consoles' profit margins have traditionally been lower than you'd expect, which is why they're especially susceptible to sudden shifts in the market conditions around tech components and tariffs. Even before the hiccups caused by the madness around AI services and infrastructure we've seen over the past few months, we'd been facing a tricky decade when it comes to resources used for hardware production, so these are rough waters we'll collectively have to learn to navigate in the future.</p>

            <p>A lot of you are gaming hard, it seems. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> has been on a steady growth trajectory for years now, with the Covid pandemic alone adding five million unique users only in 2020. On 1th January, Valve's platform crossed the 42 million barrier, setting a new record.</p>
<p>As reported and explained by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/">Wccftech</a>, the PC distribution platform has now more than doubled its concurrent user average since 2020, with new record peaks of activity becoming more and more common in recent years. The previous activity record was 41.6 million users in October 2025.</p>
<p>The full analysis solidifies the feeling that Steam (and PC gaming as a whole) has blown up in popularity in the post-pandemic era: "A quick data analysis reveals distinct growth phases during this period. Before the pandemic, the Steam platform was growing slowly, at a rate of +4.5 percent per year. The lockdown year obviously exploded the platform (as well as all other gaming platforms) with +31.5 percent in a single year, followed by a stabilisation phase and the current phase, which are both between 13.9 percent and 12.6 percent annual growth rate."</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">Last month also was Steam's highest-grossing yet</a>, partly thanks to recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-expeditions-one-in-ten">Arc Raiders</a> and viral indie sensations like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Peak</a>, on top of everything else. The quality of the more recent Steam sales has also been on the upswing, often countering the deep deals found on other storefronts.</p><p>Another reason behind this growth is the rising popularity of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a>, Valve's portable PC that's cracked open PC gaming for plenty of folks who wanted the benefits of Steam and other platforms without the technical hassles which typically come with gaming computers. Even with its technical limitations, it’s become the go-to "console" for plenty of more casual players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/">Epic Games Store has also seen plenty of growth</a> over six years, but as we expected, most users only show up for the free games given out each week, refusing to spend money on a platform that isn’t nearly as fleshed out as Valve’s beyond the games themselves.</p>

            <p>Lego has lifted the lid on its previously announced Pokémon sets, which include Pikachu and Poké Ball, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise and Eevee.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/pikachu-and-poke-ball-72152">Pikachu and Poké Ball set</a> includes 2050 pieces, and retails for £179.99. This model of Pikachu can be displayed in either a battle stance or resting pose. Meanwhile, the Poké Ball can be displayed either opened or closed. In a nice homage for fans of the Pokémon series, the studs of the display base form a '25', which is a a nod to Pikachu's Pokédex number.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/venusaur-charizard-and-blastoise-72153">next set features Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise</a>, which has 6838 pieces and retails for £579.99. This model includes the three posable Kanto partner Pokémon in their fierce and final evolution forms. The vines and feet on Venusaur are moveable, while Blastoise has an "articulated head, arms and water cannons". As for Charizard, users will be able to pose their wings, legs, arms and head.</p>
<p>The model's stands, meanwhile, are set on beach, jungle and volcano-themed bases, to represent each Pokémon type. Lego has also teased an Easter egg for users to find.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/eevee-72151">smaller build is Eevee</a>, with this model coming in at 587 pieces and retailing for £54.99. As with the other models, Eevee can be posed, with Lego saying users will be able to make it look as though the Pokémon is "on the move". You will also be able to move the model's ears, feet and legs. Eevee also has an articulated tail.</p>
<p>Again, Eevee's model features a hidden Easter egg, which Lego says highlights the Pokémon's "many evolutions".</p>
<p>These Lego sets are all available to pre-order now, and will be shipped on 27th February. Those that pre-order the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model will also receive the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/kanto-region-badge-collection-40892">Kanto Region Badge Collection set</a>, providing stocks last.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Call of Duty is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. That we know for sure. Key Xbox and Activision figures have underlined how important Nintendo's hardware is for the brand moving forward, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">their last comments on the matter</a> happening last year following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a>'s reveal.</p>
<p>The more important question, now, is <em>when</em> that's actually happening. We've heard all sorts of rumblings over the last few months, with insiders and other industry figures pointing to a big release coming at some point in 2026. Now, a datamine (via Reality <a href="https://x.com/realityuk">on X/Twitter</a>) could point to it happening sooner rather than later.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>The account has a history of looking through Call of Duty files and the latest updates, and shared this new finding on 11th January. Several lines added with a recent Call of Duty HQ (the dreadful multi-game launcher the series has been using for years now) reference the Nintendo "platform family" and "account type" along consoles and PC platforms that have access to the games already.</p><p>Though the news isn't a shock, it's still good to see work on whatever Call of Duty game is coming first to Nintendo Switch 2 (and maybe the original Switch, too) hasn't stalled. Other live-service hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> have enjoyed a great deal of success there, and with a handful of recent Switch 2 ports raising the bar for ambitious third-party efforts, it's not hard to see Call of Duty finding gold on Nintendo's hybrid console(s), too.</p>
<p>That said, we'd recommend proceeding with caution for now, as the shared datamine also references the Ubisoft Connect platform, which (at least right now) isn't selling the Call of Duty games. Activision's devs could be including those references and tags in the files for whatever reason, and the same could apply to the Nintendo lines. We know that CoD is taking aim at Nintendo straight from the horse's mouth though, so we're just sitting here waiting for the Direct stream that finally confirms what's been in the works for a very long time. Watch this space.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Activision for comment about Call of Duty on Switch.</p>

            <p>Pocketpair has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> Official Card Game, which is, yes, an official card game based on the developer's monster catching survival game, Palworld.</p>
<p>It's coming on 30th July in collaboration with Bushiroad, and has been designed as a two-player competitive card game.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As you would expect, Palworld Official Card Game has been created with many of the core ideas which made Palworld so popular on its debut (remember, this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">chap managed to become only the second game to pass two million concurrent Steam players on its release in 2024</a>). Players will be able to "enjoy strategic and tactical battles" in the upcoming card game, and this will be done by deploying Pals.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.palworld-official-cardgame.com/news/post-1">official website</a>, those who take Palworld Official Card Game for a spin will have to fight alongside the Pal companions while also gathering resources and building up their bases. The Pals, meanwhile, will have "unique traits" which will help lead players to victory.</p><p>"Team up with your trusty Pals and experience the thrill of overcoming formidable enemies through this exciting trading card game," the site reads. At the time of writing, the team hasn't yet released any pricing or specific card details, though on the Palworld Discord server, Pocketpair has said to stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<p>You can check out a short teaser for Palworld Official Card Game below.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, Palworld and Pocketpair continue to march along all this time after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-xbox-us-player-numbers-briefly-surpass-fortnite-as-steam-sales-hit-8m-in-six-days">the game's explosive release almost two years ago</a>. Not all headlines have been positive, though, and the developer has been in the midst of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">a legal battle with Nintendo over alleged patent infringement</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, this has actually been leaning in Pocketpair's favour, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-palworld-triumph-over-pokemon-in-lawsuit-japans-rejection-of-nintendo-patent-might-make-things-more-interesting">with a rejection of Nintendo's patent</a> in October throwing a spanner in the works for Nintendo.</p>

            <p>With the first expedition window for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> concluded in December, Embark Studios has revealed that just over a million players opted in to reset their characters in exchange for various rewards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Having sold over 12m copies according to analyst estimates</a>, that's under 10 percent of all players.</p>
<p>Expeditions, for those unaware, allow players to send off their levelled up character (alongside all the goodies stored in their stash) off on a grand adventure. In return your account gets cosmetics, an XP boost on your next character, expanded stash space, and for those able to gather up to five million credits additional skill points above the cap on their next character. A powerful boon!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics">In an interview with PCGamesN</a>, design director Virgil Watkins stated that of that roughly one million players, around 35-40 percent of them managed to scrape together the five million credits required for the full spread of skill point boosts during the expedition window.</p>

</figure>
<p>Watkins also shared learnings from the game's first expedition window, stating: "One of the bigger topics [of feedback] was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points, and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on.</p><p>"So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, [we set] that as an aspirational goal that some players might achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, 'Well, now I have to do that to get it.'"</p>
<p>With just over a month until the next expedition window, it looks like the next opportunity for a reset will work largely in the same fashion as this initial run, though as PCGamesN points out changes to the final rush for credits can absolutely change. Watkins said that the team is looking at ways to "bring a little more variety" to the system, poring over player data.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders, unlike many other extraction games, have an opt-in reset mechanic rather than a forced progression wipe. As such, those not especially concerned with extra stash space or a few extra skill points don't <em>have</em> to worry about it too much. Given how hard it can be to build up a hoard of loot, one wanders if casual Arc Raiders players will be inclined to cash it all in for such bonuses.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders itself appears to be maintaining momentum going into 2026, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-sure-sounds-keen-to-make-an-arc-raiders-film">with Hollywood seemingly keen to chat about a theatrical adaptation of some sort</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-arc-raiders-cheaper-than-most-triple-a-games-thanks-to-helldivers-2-mostly">its cheaper price point</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">some well-timed holiday discounts</a>, it doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 7.30PM GMT: </strong>And it's gone. It's unclear exactly when the servers went down but I checked shortly before 7pm GMT and I couldn't connect to the game's server. That appears to be it, then, the end of Anthem.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>An unceremonious end. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11.30AM GMT:</strong> At some point today, EA will turn the Anthem servers off, rendering BioWare's multiplayer online shooter inaccessible and unplayable, presumably forever. And fond farewells have already started to pour in.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the exact end-time is unclear. All we have officially to go by is today's date, 12th January, and as of this morning, the game's servers were still active for me. Presumably that means they'll remain up until the end of the day, until the clock strikes midnight - but midnight in which timezone? My best guess would be Pacific Time, as that's the timezone EA's Redwood City, California headquarters is located in. 12am midnight PT is 8am tomorrow morning GMT.</p><p>But I've also seen suggestions the Anthem servers could come down in line with the game's maintenance window, which was apparently 8am Eastern Time or thereabouts, which is 1pm GMT. I'll keep an eye on it and keep trying to clarify with EA.</p>
<p>Perhaps fuelled by this uncertainty, players have already begun saying their goodbyes to the game. The Anthem subreddit right now is filled with them; it makes for quite touching reading, actually. The general format seems to be people sharing a picture or short clip of their Javelin-suited Freelancer character, while sharing a word or two about the game.</p>

</ul>
<p>There are lots of variations of the "strongest together" sentiment.</p>
<p>The posts highlight what a startlingly attractive game Anthem can be, particularly as you fly around the often stormy jungle world of Coda, through enormous crumbling ruins and alongside flocks of strange birds. I've been playing Anthem this past week in the hope of seeing a community come together one final time and I've been struck again by the beauty of it. Even the streets of your home base in Tarsis are beautiful to wander around - that crumbled, almost Persian-style architectural fortress.</p><p>There has been increased activity in the game, too, as people return for a final fly-around, or as they - as in many cases - finish the game's achievements while they still can. To think that characters they've poured hundreds hours into - and that they're proudly parading around the game's social Launch Bay space - will cease to exist is a sobering reminder of the temporary nature of our virtual, server-based heroes.</p>
<p>Whether anything will happen in Anthem to mark its last moments is also unclear, but I expect it won't, as there appears to be no change anywhere else in the game - the shop still charges for items, and XP and currency is all still awarded in the same way. For all intents and purposes, the game seems untouched. Again, I'll keep an eye out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">Anthem was earmarked for closure in July last year</a>, at which point EA removed the game from digital sale. EA thanked people for their "dedication, passion and support" and confirmed that you won't be able to play Anthem offline. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-very-disappointed-in-anthem-launch-issues">Anthem was originally released in 2019 but failed to catch on in the way EA BioWare hoped</a>. There were plans for a big overhaul - a 2.0 - but they were eventually abandoned, as, it seems, the game was.</p>

            <p>When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was sort of relaunched with its 2.0 update and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-liberty-is-a-remarkable-expansion-and-a-bittersweet-end-for-cyberpunk-2077">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion, female V took over as the face of the game. More than two years later, and with the RPG still selling well and attracting new players, that hasn't changed.</p>
<p>At some point, fans of the game started to wonder what happened with male V, who had spearheaded all of the game's pre-launch marketing efforts. If you own a physical copy as released in 2020, he’s on the cover by default. As the game fixed what was broken and evolved into one of the best games in recent memory, he became a relic of sorts. Now, the short-haired bloke is nowhere to be found in official promotional materials. This has raised some eyebrows across the internet and given conspiracy theorists a couple of inventive reasons for the change, but the truth is far more simple than simply some market research saying folks preferred female V, or something more sinister.</p>
<p>"Male V had whole base game marketing for himself", stated Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski when asked <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbrejiy3ok2w">via BlueSky</a> last week. The team simply decided to go 50/50 for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a>. "One game for each V."</p>
<p>Of course, such a huge change to the initially-troubled game's promotion as it relaunched probably went through deeper discussions than what Sarzynski is saying here. While we don't have the data on the percentage of male and female V runs of the game, the consensus among the most dedicated players is that people enjoy both versions of the character equally. This isn't a clear <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-a-vast-and-generous-voyage">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a> situation where most folks ultimately agreed Kassandra was far superior to Alexios as a main character.</p><p>The thing is that going with male or female V isn't just a matter of who you prefer for purely aesthetic and voice acting reasons, as the pick also enables or disables certain romantic relationships. Most veterans agree doing at least two runs of the game is recommended to experience its branching narratives and different partners worth meeting (and smooching) while you try to save the character's life.</p>
<p>We're inclined to say female V is ultimately the more substantial choice since it has access to the Judy romance, which adds to the main storyline in ways the other relationships don't, but either way, you're getting excellent opportunities and voice acting across the board. We definitely are curious about actual data behind Cyberpunk 2077's protagonist pick (and life paths for that matter), but if we take Sarzynski at his word, CD Projekt Red didn't give the official swap much thought.</p>

            <p>Tom Clancy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-the-division-2-review-an-accomplished-sequel-with-an-awful-story">The Division 2</a> is still trucking along, and with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-2-kicks-off-10th-anniversary-year-with-the-division-2-survivors-an-updated-take-on-the-survival-extraction-experience">ambitious 2026 roadmap</a> to boot, while development on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-ubisoft-dev-says">the third game</a> continues. More shocking, though, is the apparent tease that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-review">The Division 1</a> is making a return for its 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>We've had no shortage of leaks on Ubisoft’s upcoming releases, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>'s remakes (the latter of which was announced ages ago), but we hadn't heard a peep regarding a remaster or re-release of the first Division game. On 11th January, the noise began when users on X/Twitter like <a href="https://x.com/domen0204">Domen Gaming</a> started sharing a photo of a banner taken at the grand finale of the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5JKjM9XlbV6Lyd2xNYzkIf/apac-cup-at-fps-day-details">APAC Cup of R6 Siege</a> currently taking place in Tokyo, Japan:</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2010471227387740286?s=20">KAMI</a> on X/Twitter adds folks at the event heard Ubisoft is holding a "10th anniversary commemorative premiere" this weekend, which we assume is later this week unless something was lost in translation. Technically, The Division 1 launched on March 8, 2016, so we're still a ways off from the actual anniversary, but if a re-release of sorts is happening, it makes sense Ubisoft would move it forward a bit to boost its Q1 2026 numbers as much as possible (and we're not ruling out Assassin's Creed or Prince of Persia shadow drops, either).</p><p>Anniversary aside, the timing of the news is odd, as the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/the-division-yes-the-first-one-gets-a-ps5-update/">finally received a 60 FPS patch on current-gen consoles last month</a>. Moreover, most of the series' community is playing The Division 2 instead, which is the meatier game that will seemingly be supported until the threequel arrives. On the other hand, The Division’s snowy New York City setting remains one of the most captivating and moodiest modern open worlds to the point much of The Division 2's DLC efforts has catered to players who preferred that location over the less inspired Washington DC map.</p>
<p>Unless substantial graphical updates taken from Massive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-fire-and-ash-player-boost">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> are coming as part of this Definitive Edition, we're only expecting a repackaged and complete edition for newcomers looking to go back to the beginning. We wouldn't rule out a surprise <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> port of the game, though, especially since Ubisoft has been keen to support the young console so far. It would explain this marketing push in Japan and would continue Ubisoft's trend of supporting Nintendo’s hybrid hardware, which has been off to a great start this generation with the excellent Star Wars Outlaws and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> ports.</p>

            <p>Hytale's founder Simon Collins-Laflamme has revealed the team expects over a million players on the game's Early Access launch day on the 13th January.</p>
<p>This statement, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636">posted on Laflamme's personal Twitter account</a>, came alongside a call-to-action for players to download the game's launcher today to help reduce development-side stress on the day of release.</p>
<p>Hytale, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">a game revived by Laflamme</a> following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">cancellation by Riot Games last year</a>, has seen a surge in interest since the unexpected return. Shortly after switching hands from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> creator to Laflamme and co, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-will-finally-be-launching-early-next-year-after-years-of-development-woes">Early Access plans for the game were revealed back in a matter of months</a>. This, after the game had been in development for roughly ten years.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-release-date-time">In terms of release time</a>, the game is set to launch early morning on Tuesday morning in the Americas, and early evening in Europe, so one would expect it'll steadily gain momentum throughout the week once it launches. Not that we'll be able to track it live, as the game is not releasing to Steam during its initial Early Access period.</p><p>The game<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-price-where-to-buy"> is being sold at three price points via the official Hytale website</a>, starting off at a pretty cheap $19.99 for the standard version. The creator has warned folks ahead of time that this is an Early Access game in the truest sense of the word, so given the shaky history of Hytale expect a few bumps when it first launches.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Hytale when it finally comes out later this week? Let us know below!</p>

            <p>It wasn't Larian's choice to not release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>That's coming from studio head Swen Vincke, who shared this titbit during an AMA which Larian hosted on Reddit towards the end of last week.</p>

<p>Here, the team was asked about potentially getting the critically acclaimed and award winning Baldur's Gate 3 onto Switch 2.</p>
<p>"We would have loved to but it wasn't our decision to make," came Vincke's reply. This was met with a number of disappointed community comments, such as "super bummed by this decision especially if you wanted to do it but somehow were not green lit by [the] publisher…" and "I'm shattered to read this news".</p>
<p>While Vincke did not go into further details about the lack of a Baldur's Gate 3 Switch 2 release, many have surmised it was probably due to licensing issues.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="219"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nymeyhg/">Comment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wombat_Medic/">u/Wombat_Medic</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/"></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/">Games</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>But, while it doesn't sound like we will be getting Baldur's Gate 3 on Switch 2 any time soon, if ever, there is a little bit more hope that Larian's next game - Divinity - may release on Nintendo's hybrid console. During the same AMA, the studio's technical director noted Larian had just recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">Divinity Original Sin 2 on Nintendo's latest console</a>, saying: "We love the platform." They then assured the community that Larian would of course also keep the Switch 2 in mind for Divinity, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">which it announced during The Game Awards last month</a>, with a rather horrifying trailer.</p><p>At this time, Larian's technical director also said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-will-certainly-consider-a-divinity-switch-2-release">the team was keen to ensure Divinity was playable on Steam Deck when it releases</a> (whenever that may be). The developer remarked that Baldur's Gate 3 was one of the Steam Deck's most played games, and so the studio would do its "best" to get Divinity on there as well.</p>

            <p>Awesome Games Done Quick 2026 has raised $2.44 million (£1.8m) for its latest cause, Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>
<p>The annual speedrunning fundraiser - just one of several of Games Done Quick's yearly events - finished up early today in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with a Pokémon Emerald speedrun.</p>

<p>As always, while thousands of guests attended in person, the speedrunning feats were also simultaneously broadcast live on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube.</p>
<p>Highlights from the event include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a> run played on a Guitar Hero controller, a 70-person relay race of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>, and "a packed room of French-styled cosplayers during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>".</p>
<p>Since 2010, Games Done Quick has collectively raised more than $59.8 million for charities worldwide, including Malala Fund and Organization for Autism Research. The next event kicks off on 5th February in Minneapolis to raise funds for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières.</p>

            <p>US game retailer GameStop has reportedly shut hundreds of stores.</p>
<p>While CEO Ryan Cohen gets set for a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2026/01/07/business/gamestop-ceo-ryan-cohen-compensation-package">$35 billion ($26bn) pay package</a> if he successfully gets GameStop's market cap to $100 billion - ten times its current value - <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-closing-stores-as-ceo-payday/">Polygon</a> reports hundreds of workers have been let go in a series of abrupt store closures.</p>
<p>Some employees are claiming that the closures came as a "shock" and with very little notice, affecting even well-performing staff and stores.</p>

</span></p><p>According to the <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/">GameStop Closing List</a>, more than 400 stores have confirmed they have closed or plan to close in January 2026. It's the highest for any month on record and equates to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q80n3u/so_on_the_topic_of_closures/">20-25 percent</a> of all GameStop stores across the United States.</p><p>"I had heard [my local GameStop] was closing and wanted to stop by for the last time because that store was my childhood. Once I arrived it had already been closed," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q7j34w/thank_you_to_my_local_gamestop/">wrote</a> one unhappy customer. "I wanted to say thank you to the one manager there. He had been there since I was a kid and I always recognised him when I went to the store. Thank you for the memories. It may have just been your job but that store gave me some good memories."</p>
<p>"Only one store left within about an hour of me and I'm sure that's going to be next," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1q7j34w/comment/nypkmfl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another. "Really sucks because I enjoy walking in and buying physical on launch day, or poking through the used shelves."</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores">RNZ</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-gamestop-closing-hundreds-of-stores-in-the-united-states">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) reports that the company is also eying up closures to its EB Games subsidiary in New Zealand, too. Staff have reportedly received emails notifying them that they're in scope of redundancy, although no "final" decisions will be made "until we have completed a full consultation process in good faith with affected team members".</p>
<p>If true, New Zealand will join Ireland, Germany, and Austria as countries where GameStop has recently closed its local operations.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed director Alexandre Amancio has shared his thoughts about AAA development, suggesting we need "smaller teams" and admitting that big-budget developers cannot "solve a problem by throwing people at it".</p>
<p>In an interview with our sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-assassins-creed-director-alexandre-amancio-explains-how-to-fix-aaa-development">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Amancio - who currently works at FunPlus - talked frankly about his time at Ubisoft, suggesting it's not "tenable" to keep making bigger and bigger games with more and more people.</p>

<p>"There's this theory that says that whenever humans create something that surpasses a hundred people, it completely changes the dynamic of it. As soon as you surpass that, the ratio of management to people working on the game explodes. You start having a very management-heavy structure: You need to have people to coordinate the people coordinating," he said.</p><p>"Something that a lot of AAA studios mistakenly do, or certainly did in the past, is think that you can solve a problem by throwing people at it. But adding people to a problem stagnates the people that were already being efficient on it. It just creates a lot of variable noise.</p>
<p>"So I think the future lies in smaller teams."</p>
<p>Amancio then reflected on how the film industry has "coalesced" into smaller, core teams, where each crew is "built for that project, it's a temporary crew", but gaming is different from films as in projects change and evolve over time, whilst in the film industry, "you have a script, it's solid, and then you just go and shoot it".</p>
<p>"Since its inception, I think that the gaming industry has treated itself as being part of the software industry, but it is kind of a weird hybrid," he added. "I think the future lies in taking that learning from the film industry, where you have core teams that are complimented with either outsourcing or with co-dev for specific needs. You get the right crew for the right project at the right time."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-cast">Don't forget that Netflix has an Assassin's Creed adaptation on the way</a>. It recently announced two more of the actors cast, although we don't yet know what character they will portray.</p>

            <p>As X/Twitter owner Elon Musk moves Grok's widely condemned AI image manipulation feature to paid-only and users flood the "town square" with thousands of sexualised images, Epic Games boss said that senators calling for the removal of X from the Apple and Google stores are trying to "censor all of their political opponents".</p> <div>

            <p>Surprise! We finally have a release date and a subtitle - "Broken Things" -  for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> 5: 18th February, 2026. The console release for Chapter 5 will reportedly "follow in the months ahead".</p>
<p>To celebrate the news, developer Mob Entertainment shared a new terrifying cinematic teaser (which is very heavy on the red-brown stuff), and shows off the gigantic Experiment 1006, AKA The Prototype.</p>
<p>You can check it out below:</p>

<p>"Deep within the vacant halls of the Playtime Co. lab, The Prototype stalks its unfinished work… the tattered, lifeless remains of toys that once were. Broken things," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>"In Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5 - Broken Things, players must prepare to face off against the deadly puppetmaster behind the horrifying events of Playtime Co’s dark past. Solve devious puzzles and overcome dangerous obstacles as the true rotten heart at the center of Playtime Co. draws nearer."</p>
<p>You can expect "stomach-churning terror" in a new area of the factory, new "tortured denizens", puzzles, deadly environmental obstacles, and new GrabPack tools.</p>
<p>It's been a long wait for fans. The prior chapter, called Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, predictably enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-coming-to-consoles-this-month">on consoles over the summer</a>.</p>
<p>In May of last year, the studio announced that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works</a> with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time. "This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p>

            <p>EA has stressed to its community that "the values of The Sims are unchanged" as we head into 2026.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA shareholders approved</a> the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law"> proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms, leaving only the US government in the way of what would be the largest corporate buyout in history. The acquisition, first announced back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>As news about the acquisition spread, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-creators-quit-ea-partnerships-amid-buyout-concerns">a number of prolific The Sims content creators "removed themselves" from the EA Creator Network</a>, claiming the game's inclusive community is at odds with the well-documented conservative and anti-LGBTQIA+ values of EA's buyers, which include the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p>

<p>The Sims team, however, wrote on its blog yesterday (9th January) that the values that have always shaped The Sims "are unchanged", adding: "The Sims has always been more than a game. It’s a canvas for life in all its unpredictable forms…the chaotic moments, the tiny joys, the big dreams, every identity, every version of you. And, thanks to you, The Sims has grown into something bigger than we ever imagined: a living world bursting with creativity, expression, humour, chaos, and heart.</p>
<p>"Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future."</p>
<p>Following this pledge, the team opened up on the future of the franchise, saying it's "building a family of new Sims experiences across PC, console, and mobile", and will put "single-player life simulation experiences" at the heart of its work, confirming singleplayer games will "always be a part" of the games' future.</p><p>As for "Project Rene?" Thanks to your feedback, that has evolved into a "social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game", but is "not the successor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> and is a separate experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience". Playtesting for The Sims Lab continues, with the team assuring players that "these tests are works in progress with experimental game features, concept imagery, naming conventions (The Sims Labs: Life Together, The Sims Labs: Town Stories) and ideas in motion. Some concepts evolve and sometimes an experiment won’t move forward at all".</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-a-replacement-seemingly-waiting-in-the-wings-ea-announces-the-sims-mobile-is-shutting-down-in-january">EA is shutting down The Sims Mobile</a> after seven years, with servers going offline - and all content becoming unplayable - on 20th January. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sims-mobile">The Sims Mobile</a> launched for iOS and Android in 2017, delivering a free-to-play Sims-style experience broadly similar to that of the main series.</p>
<p>From this month, however, EA announced there would be no further content updates or events for The Sims Mobile, and the publisher has now confirmed the game's imminent closure, sharing a detailed timeline for its shutdown. While EA hasn't given a reason for The Sims Mobile's shutdown, it's likely in order to clear the way for its new mobile game, currently being referred to as The Sims Labs: Town Stories.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be "one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game.</p>
<p>The team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>
<p>This is on top of new death and revive animations, and the delayed Player Character Update, which is now coming anytime between now and March 2026.</p>

<p>"We’ve created brand new character models, improved animations and fine-tuned how it feels to play Phasmophobia," the team explains. "Our overall aim is to create the most immersive experience we can, and we believe our current player character models and animations can snap (pun intended) you out of the game with a disjointed arm there, a bendy back here. With these changes, our characters will move with more realism and present a more life-like experience for players. This update is a key part of our road to Phasmophobia 1.0, creating the most immersive experience possible."</p>
<p>This was initially set to launch before the end of 2025, but unfortunately, the team "weren't able to meet that date – but for good reason".</p> <div>

<p>"As we saw with Chronicle earlier this year, giving the update more breathing room to evolve pays off," Kinetic adds. "So while there’s a little longer to wait, we’re excited to share that we’ll be launching the Player Character Update in Q1 2026."</p><p>And in line with the reworked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobias-long-awaited-bleasdale-farmhouse-redesign-is-coming-next-week-heres-whats-new">farmhouses</a> - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobias-new-nells-diner-map-gets-a-release-date-and-will-be-an-example-of-how-the-team-want-all-maps-to-feel-going-forward">all-new Nell's Diner</a>, of course - Tanglewood is getting a makeover, too. Acutely aware that some players are very apprehensive about seeing their favourite level changed, the team promises it will "provide a similar experience to the one Ghost Hunters know and love to this day while still feeling fresh and exciting".</p>
<p>Interestingly, for players that enjoy piecing together environmental clues and storytelling, "a mystery lies behind 6 Tanglewood Drive that's just waiting to be uncovered".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-studio-kinetic-moves-into-indie-publishing">Kinetic Games recently announced it's branching out into indie game publishing</a> with Kinetic Publishing. It is actively seeking "creative games from small teams and solo developers globally, who have a clear vision for their title and are 12-18 months from release".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> has reportedly sold more than 5 million copies on PS5.</p>
<p>According to Alinea Analytics analyst Rhys Elliott, that means the four-year-old port has generated an estimated $300 million (£223m) for IP owner Microsoft.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">Microsoft has announced another Developer Direct, set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. It'll feature Fable and Beast of Reincarnation, as well as a "deep dive" into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, with a focus on gameplay and reveals of new features.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 will be set in Japan, as revealed by Microsoft at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Not only that, it will be the biggest and "most full" of any map in the series so far.
</p>
<p>"This map that we've created for Japan, or Horizon's version of Japan, is big, but also dense," art director Don Arceta recently said. "There's always something around the corner for you to discover and see." What's more, the map will include Tokyo too - "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-integrate-japanese-culture-into-the-most-full-series-location-so-far">the biggest city that we've done in a Horizon game yet</a>."

            <h2>10th January</h2>
<p>Hello and Happy New Year - is it okay to say that now? I'm not sure where the cut-off point is. Some people still have their Christmas trees up. We had ours out before New Year. Welcome back to What We've Been Playing! Or as I like to call this particular edition of it: What We Played Over Christmas, because it's been a couple of weeks since we've talked.</p>
<p>This week, Bertie's obsessed with balls - you did try to tell him; Connor does his best Lottie impression and gets hooked on old-school <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>; Tom thinks he's experienced the pinnacle of gaming; Dom can't resist going back to Atlus' best game; and Marie finds life as a dinosaur rather exciting.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjhnRdLkn-w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><h2>Ball x Pit, PC</h2>
<p>Why did no one tell me <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ball-x-pit-the-kenny-sun-story">Ball x Pit</a> was good? Oh - *looks at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">Eurogamer's</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-readers-top-50-games-of-2025">Eurogamer Readers' top 50</a>* (in which Ball x Pit placed in almost the same position) - they/you did. To be fair, anything baked with Vampire Survivors ingredients is likely to tempt me, though there's a lot of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> here too, which again is a good thing, and plenty of Breakout. It's inspired, really, how creator Kenny Sun has taken that old Breakout template and reimagined it by way of popular modern roguelikes.</p><p>I love the presentation, I love the way the ball-bouncing concept stretches into the base-building part of the game. But most of all I love how <em>in love</em> the game is with the idea of delirious overpoweredness, because that's the real draw of Vampire Survivors and Slay the Spire, the quest to break the game in your favour to make your power outrageous. So it is here: build cleverly and your projectiles will ricochet around the game's arenas like demolition balls. There are few things quite so satisfying.</p>
<p>Bonus entry: I also played a chunk more Sektori and discovered there is a mode almost exactly like Geometry Wars - Classic - where you fight in a fixed arena, rather than those that keep morphing and changing around you. It's just brilliant - a faceful of energy, an arcade rave on your screen.</p>
<p><em>-Bertie</em></p>
<h2>Old School RuneScape, PC</h2>
<p>A good friend of mine has been recommending I play Old School RuneScape for years, and during the holidays I decided to finally give it a shot. It has dominated my life ever since. This morning before work, I was killing 80-ish crabs for a Slayer task. I then made fishcakes and fed them to a time-frozen lad called Pirate Pete.</p><p>One thing I've started valuing immensely over the years is the degree of British-ness in games. I'll admit, I do get joy from seeing lines like: "would you like a cuppa tea?" after a furniture-building house call. Or when my character shouts Oi when kicking a golem awake in a dwarven ruin.</p>
<p>Right now I've hit a bit of a wall though. I need <em>loads</em> of money to continue building out my fancy new sloop for sailing the open seas, and am dead broke. Oh well, an excuse to go out and explore I suppose!</p>
<p><em>-Connor </em></p>
<h2>Thank Goodness You're Here!, PS5</h2>
<p>I've not played much of this, certainly not as much as I'd have liked - for that I'll blame a Christmas lethargy, children, football, and general things. But what I have played has been brilliant fun. I don't know if I'm really doing much other than wandering about until stuff happens, but when a sausage-making machine spurted out an enormous banger only to end up on a woman's lap, then for her to draw a nice face on the end of it and put on a silly voice, well, I think I may have experienced the pinnacle of gaming.</p>

<h2>Persona 5 Royal, PS5 Pro</h2>
<p>I have no idea why I was drawn back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> over the break. Something about it was just tugging at my heartstrings, like a pack of thieves had left a calling card deep inside me summoning me into my cognition to examine some deep part of myself all over again. It hasn't aged a day, has it? I think it's still pretty easy by Atlus standards, but where this lack of friction annoyed me on a first pass, I'm finding it a really nice coast as I gird my proverbial loins for the likes of Nioh 3 early this year.</p><p>Incredible production values, music so good I let fights linger longer just to hear the choruses, and some tasty narrative hooks all combine to make this one of the best all-around packages Atlus has ever produced. Roll on Persona 6, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> Revival, whichever comes first.</p>
<p><em>-Dom</em></p>
<h2>Lego Jurassic World, Switch 2</h2>
<p>I've already made a start on my 2026 gaming resolution by picking up Lego Jurassic World again after watching the original film and Lost World this past week. While I will say that, currently, Marvel Super Heroes is still my favourite Lego game, Jurassic World has a charm I'd previously overlooked.</p>
<p>Fitting multiple movie plots into one game is a feat, and it strikes a nice balance between having enough to keep me interested but not too much as to overwhelm me. Smashing everything in sight to collect Studs is deeply satisfying, as ever, but I think I've found something this time that's even better: charging around as a dinosaur!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian "will certainly consider" getting its upcoming release Divinity onto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>This small nugget of hope for Nintendo users comes from today's AMA with Larian, which the developer hosted over on Reddit. Here, the studio was asked about releasing Divinity - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">which it announced at The Game Awards last month</a> - on Switch 2.</p>

<p>To this, the studio's technical director <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bert_Larian/">u/Bert_Larian</a> noted Larian had just recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">Divinity Original Sin 2 on Nintendo's latest console</a>, saying: "We love the platform." The developer then assured the community that Larian would of course also keep the Switch 2 in mind for Divinity.</p>
<p>During this same AMA, the developer was also asked about Divinity being playable on Steam Deck, because who doesn't enjoy that welcome portability. Again, Bert was very enthusiastic about the platform, and just like the studio loves Switch 2, it also loves Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Since [Baldur's Gate 3] was one of the most played games on the platform, we will do our best to again release on the platform," Bert said.</p>

<p>Following Divinity's announcement last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Larian's CEO stated the studio was using generative AI to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text</a>. It then faced its fair share of backlash following this comment, and Swen Vincke responded, stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Holy **** guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI</a>."</p>
<p>He then announced the AMA, and today the studio head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Larian had changed its stance on generative AI following the backlash</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has begun its global rollout of facial age verification onto the popular gaming platform starting today, in an attempt to improve child safety following a deluge of criticism. This comes after a partial rollout of the technology back in December.</p>
<p><a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat">In a blog post on the official Roblox website</a>, chief safety officer Matt Kaufman and VP of user discovery Rajiv Bhatia explained how these new age checks will work. Over the next week, users will find this new security measure added to Roblox as a barrier between them and the gaming platform's chat feature.</p>
<p>The blog post states: "As the first large online gaming platform to require facial age checks for users of all ages to access chat, this implementation is our next step toward what we believe will be the gold standard for communication safety. It enables age-based chat, which promotes a positive, age-appropriate experience for all users globally, and limits communication between adults and children younger than 16."</p>

<p>The post also features statistics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">from its earlier partial rollout</a>. It claims that following the facial age verification implementation in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands more than 50 percent of daily active users had completed the process.</p>
<p>For Roblox users younger than nine-years-old, parental permission will be required to use the chat functionality. Those aged 13 or older will be able to chat with those from a wider age group ranging from nine to seventeen thanks to what Roblox is calling their "Trusted Connections Feature". This age group will not be able to speak to those above or below that range, and similar restrictions are present for different detected age groups. Those over the age of 13 can instead verify their age using ID.</p><p>Roblox claims that user privacy is paramount, and that images taken to verify the age of users are deleted immediately after the security check is completed. <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/37725513985812-Unlocking-Trusted-Connections-Expressive-Chat-Features-Party-Voice-chat-without-filters">On a Roblox help page dedicated to this Trusted Connections feature</a>, it states that occasionally users may have to redo this age verification process. In the event that the age verification software places a user into an age bracket that's incorrect, an appeal process is available where real-world ID or parental controls can manually circumvent the user's assigned age.</p>
<p>These age verification checks come following a period of intense scrutiny aimed at Roblox in regard to what many believe to be subpar efforts in child safety. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louisiana-sues-roblox-for-allegedly-choosing-profits-over-child-safety-claiming-its-basically-open-season-for-sex-predators-on-this-app">The platform was sued by the state of Louisiana</a> last year over child safety, with Roblox's CEO previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">stating that parents not comfortable with their children playing the game shouldn't let them Roblox</a>. Months later, he would return to the forefront of this debate in a trainwreck interview, in which he stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">the game's predator problem was an "opportunity" for the platform</a>.</p>
<p>While undoubtedly a step in the right direction, this type of facial recognition technology has been circumvented by younger users in recent months. When the UK rolled out its online safety bill requiring larger websites to verify the ages of users, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">many used Norman Reedus in Death Stranding 2 to trick the facial recognition software</a>. Whether or not this is a great stride towards a safer Roblox for kids remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, reports indicated that big moves were happening at Discord. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-06/chat-platform-discord-is-said-to-file-confidentially-for-ipo">According to Bloomberg</a>, the company responsible for gaming's most popular social platform had confidentially filed for IPO, indicating a major move towards going public.</p>
<p>This would open up Discord to an era of substantial change, both for the leadership of the company and the millions of users who use it every day. Over the years Discord has become the host for an incredible amount of user-generated content and information, and has become a core part of community management for modern releases. Changes to the platform could have a widespread impact on PC gaming, for good or ill.</p>
<p>So what would going public mean for Discord, why has it done so, what challenges does it pose, and should users be worried? To find out, Eurogamer spoke to George Osborn, creator of the Video Games Industry Memo and author of Power Play: Video Games, Politics, and The Global Battle for Influence, to find out.</p>

<p><strong>Eurogamer: What does potentially going public mean for Discord?</strong></p>
<p>Osborn: "The first thing I'll say is that I don't think it's much of a surprise that it's going public, it's been talked about for many years. Companies receive lots of investment over the past decade, there was a $500m round that happened in 2022. When you're getting a business that's valued at $15bn, whether or not that's what its final public valuation is, those investors are going to want to cash out at some point. If there's not an obvious route to an acquisition, going public is the obvious way to go, and it's the way they've gone.</p><p>"In terms of the impact on users and the business, I think the most obvious impact is that Discord is going to have to monetise as effectively as possible. It's a business that has made a decent amount of cash each year, but it's never achieved profitability by all accounts. "When you look at what it's made each year, again based upon what figures are reported, people have been talking about figures in the region of half a billion. Let's not pretend that's not a big amount of money, but if you're comparing it to the amount of cash people are expecting from game businesses or social media businesses, the first thing they'll be expecting is profitability and the second is profitability by a much greater degree than that.</p>
<p>"So, I think the most obvious impact is that the company is going to have to find ways to monetise more aggressively. The question will be how can it achieve that without aggravating its user base too much. Discord <em>is </em>completely reliant on those hundreds of thousands of users, and it's going to have to strike a different balance than other social networks and media platforms that have gone public before."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: How challenging will striking that balance be?</strong></p>
<p>Osborn: "I think it's quite a big challenge for Discord, probably quite a similar challenge Reddit faced when it went public. Here is a platform with a large number of users, genuine influence, and real value. That value though is not necessarily tied to what people are paying for. Discord Nitro obviously does make a decent chunk of cash for the business by all accounts, I've seen figures around 200-250 million dollars, so in proportion 40-50 percent of cash. That does offer specific benefit to users, but if you're talking about this hyper-scale of growth, subscriptions are generally consistent revenue. They aren't necessarily the massive whopping amounts of cash you need to be generating per-user.</p><p>"If you think about free-to-play mobile games, they only actually make a small amount of cash from people spending small amounts. They make much more from people spending large amounts. I don't know if Discord itself has an obvious pathway to do that, so I think instead the way it'll have to do it is through two big things.</p>
<p>"One is advertising. They've been expanding their ads team and I think they're probably looking at other social media platforms, in particular Meta, and have seen the amount of money Meta generates from targeted advertising that has transformed it as a business from being at one point unprofitable to one of the largest companies in the world.</p>
<p>"The second interesting option is developing around commerce. They rolled out some stuff around Marvel Rivals in December, where you could buy in-game items and gift them through Discord to other players. They're probably going to be taking advantage of changing competition and market rules around the world, and in-game economies are being opened up to more direct-to-consumer platforms.</p>
<p>"Discord might well try to suggest to businesses, now let's say a mobile gaming company has seen that Apple and Google have been told to open up their app stores, actually setting up an entire app store for yourself is a pain in the backside. Partnering with Discord which has a huge community of players to sell items and content to on your behalf may be a much better avenue to go through. I think if they were able to make that model work, that could offer the scale and reach they're looking for. The trust from the community is there, players would be in support of it because they do want to buy items for their favourite games, and companies will be in support too as it really helps the bottom line."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>A sign of how strong a grip Discord has on modern gaming is its presence on gaming consoles, a boon for groups playing across platforms.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: Discord has a dominated presence in the gaming social / community space, and as such possesses a huge amount of user data. Is there a chance this data gets sold off once the company goes public?</strong></p>
<p>Osborn: "In terms of individual user data, there are still lots of data protection rules that can limit what can be done with that data. However, what Discord could be able to say is that while it's tried to expand to have other Discords in other sectors, say WallStreetBets for stock and trading tips, Discord's big strength is to say you can reach gaming communities.</p><p>"Gaming communities are often difficult to reach in the direct space they're inhabiting when they're playing. Yeah sure you can reach people on social media where they're talking, but Discord is this almost-always operating platform on top of the game. You have people talking and playing at the same time, so it's in a unique position to reach people while they're playing.</p>
<p>"Considering the number of people who do play video games and the interest of that audience, I think there would be a lot of advertisers who would be interested in reaching people in that context."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: There are people who get concerned when they see a company whose service or product they use go public, due to those growth aspirations you mentioned earlier. Are those concerns valid in Discord's case?</strong></p>
<p>Osborn: "Really interesting question. I would say, whenever a business goes public the pressure changes. With Discord we've talked about how much money its made and the number of users it's got. I can't actually tell you with absolute certainty that those figures are particularly accurate. Once you go public, especially in the US, you are reporting every quarter. Investors don't just want to see how much cash you're making, they want to see user growth.</p><p>"So it creates a lot of short-term incentives to create growth quarter-by-quarter. There are lots of companies that found this quite hard. King, for example, went public and then it was very happy to be acquired by Activision Blizzard because the pressure of always having to bring a better quarter than the last one.</p>
<p>"I would also say, on the flip side, Discord is probably looking to go public because it wants more money quite frankly. This could be used to expand the service, especially the audience of the service. It's obviously been controversial around online safety, but Discord has historically had problems with user safety especially with how the Far Right have used it or for child sexual exploitation. When you become a public company, those kinds of issues become so much more serious that you have to go handle them. I think in particular when you talk about younger users, user safety will likely be prioritised on Discord.</p>
<p>"The question of whether it's good or not will come down to whether the leadership understands that the value in Discord is within all of its communities, and can it create a sustainable business model that brings together the value players need, that companies need, and frankly they need to make the cash to continue."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">In a Reddit Ask Me Anything</a> hosted by the studio this afternoon, founder Swen Vincke said, "to ensure there is no room for doubt, we've decided to refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development". "That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art."</p>
<p>It was the use of gen-AI in relation to concept art that people had been especially concerned about. Vincke, in an interview in December, which coincided with the studio's Divinity game reveal, seemed to suggest Larian was using gen-AI to develop concept art. Controversy erupted, prompting Vincke to clarify that information had been "lost in translation", and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">the studio was only using gen-AI to explore references for concept art</a>, not generate the images themselves.</p>
<p>Evidently, in the few weeks since, a decision has been made to remove all sources of ambiguity entirely. As if to reinforce this, Vincke's Reddit post led with: "there is not going to be any gen-AI art in Divinity". But the ambiguity hasn't been entirely dispersed.</p><p>Vincke said Larian is still exploring gen-AI use in other applications at the studio. "We continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out," he wrote. "The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is. We think gen-AI can help with this and so we're trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p>
<p>"The important bit to note," he added, "is that we will not generate 'creative assets' that end up in a game without being 100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a gen-AI model to create in-game assets, then it'll be trained on data we own."</p>
<p>Larian lead writer Adam Smith joined the thread to clarify that the 'no gen-AI' approach to art would also be true for writing in Divinity. "The stance applies to writing as well," he wrote. "We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity."</p>

It shares the same series name as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 1 and 2, of course, but it's a completely new, detached game, and Larian is cooking up a new turn-based RPG system for it.</p>

            <p>Eve Online - the sci-fi MMO space-faring epic - saw a surge in players at the tail end of 2025. The game had over a million players take to the stars in 2025, and it has benefited from the largest influx of new and returning players in years.</p>
<p>Why has a nearly 23-year-old MMO seen such an influx of fresh faces? The game has continued to receive updates, with the recent Catalyst expansion bringing an exciting new material to mine, hidden among the stars. But can that truly be <em>all</em> that's going on here?</p>
<p>To find out more, Eurogamer sat down to speak with creative director for Eve Online, Bergur Finnbogason. During the conversation, I quizzed Finnbogason on what on Earth (and beyond) was going on with Eve, what sort of players the game is attracting these days, and his thoughts on wider shifts in the MMO landscape right now.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Here's a trailer for Eve Online's latest expansion: Catalyst!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZh-PDW085g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>"We're getting close to our 23rd birthday so… That's something! To see these numbers at this point shows the game is very much alive and kicking," Finnbogason stated when asked why the game has seen such an influx of players this year. "Over the last few years, we've been getting back to the core of the game, really trying to fix the deeper, harder things. Steering the evil Icelandic killer ship, staring deep into its eyes and feeling the consequences of that.</p><p>"I think that's paying off! We've been seeing a healthy uptick in players over the last three-or-four years, and of course we've just released a really fantastic expansion looking at mining, something we've not touched for years. There's been some really cool player activity happening at the same time, too!"</p>
<p>The catalyst expansion, released on the 18th November, brought with it new ships to pilot, a new valuable ore to mine, a mining overhaul to help revitalise the system, a new epic narrative arc, and a new 2D map, among other slick new features. It is doubtless an interesting time to be an Eve player, but what sort of new faces has Eve been attracting into the fold with such additions to the MMO? Totally new folk, or lapsed pilots?</p>
<p>Finnbogason explained: "By the nature of the game, it's very complex. It's brimming with possibilities - you can be whoever you want to be! That can be a very daunting thing when you come into it for the first time. As human beings, we give ourselves, what, 23 years to decide what we want to be when we grow up? Some people decide when they're five, others when they're 46, and that's fine.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>New ships, added with the recent Catalyst expansion, are being manufactured (and destroyed) en masse. | <span>Image credit: <cite>CCP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Somehow we think with Eve players, they should have a concrete idea of what they should want to be in-game within 180 minutes, and that's a tall order. So it's been common for us to see people who tried the game a couple of years ago and are coming back to us now. We view them as returning players, but in all honesty we [should] see them as fresh players. We also see people who played 10-15 years ago come back to meet old friends and get the band back together.</p><p>"The beauty there is even if the core DNA of the game still remains, the journey is still there. We've swapped out the windows, we've changed the roof and fixed up the bathroom. So it's not the same crammed, sticky old den that it used to be. Now it's all the things a new building should be."</p>
<p>It is obvious that an influx of new life into a game like Eve is a good thing for players and developers alike, as would be true for any online game. But for a game so dependant on community-narratives, and steeped in such history, what doors does such an occasion open?</p>
<p>"It changes a lot. We're seeing a lot of new players, and the game of course would never survive without an influx of new players, new blood flowing into the game," Finnbogason elaborates. "Our game is built a lot around the community - it's fundamental to the success of the game. More players means more content, which means more fun. More players doesn't just mean more people shooting you in the face, it also means there are more people to play with, more to take on those epic projects that Eve players take on. That's the essence of our game and universe.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Eve, known for big battles, continues to act as a sandbox for such moments.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"So this surge really helps us plan into the future. The player who starts playing today, they start contributing to the game meaningfully tomorrow, though we know most players won't get into player organisations or deep faction warfare until maybe a month-or-two in. It's important that new players now reap the benefits down the line."</p><p>Finally, it's no secret that MMOs in general are in a weird spot right now. New releases aren't having the staying power one would expect, with games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-last-mmo-import-throne-and-liberty-gets-off-to-a-strong-start-on-steam-despite-mixed-reviews">Throne and Liberty largely fizzling out</a>. New World has been hit with the five point palm exploding heart technique by Amazon higher ups <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026">as the company moves away from game development, walking solemnly into 2026 without much life left</a>.</p>
<p>In the same breath <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-amazon-dev-suggests-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-following-recent-studio-gutting">its Lord of the Rings MMO has been killed</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Ghostcrawler/status/1976377531600338953">Fantastic Pixel Castle's MMO has been cancelled</a>, T-Minus Zero was shut down in September <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-netease-studio-t-minus-zero-entertainment-rescued-by-small-group-of-veteran-directors-and-founders">but thankfully saved last month</a>. Zenimax had to cancel project Blackbird <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-union-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-states-those-impacted-will-depart-with-dignity">during the Microsoft cuts earlier this year - it's a brutal time for the genre</a>. With all this context in mind, and the rising popularity of these older MMOs right now, what does Finnbogason think about what's going on?</p>
<p>"We're living in really interesting times. You can also see it in first-person shooters and, like, all games, " Finnbogason states with raised hands. "You're seeing a lot of returning old IPs. Five, six, seven years ago it was all about the new. A fresh IP, a new IP, a fresh, cool, new thing. But it feels now like the new and shiny, people aren't buying into it as easily as they used to. They're relying more on existing IPs. I think maybe that's the reason why people are coming back to these OG MMOs.</p>
<p>"It's funny because we've been doing this for so long. Eve Online feels so normal for us. But we've gone through times where we were definitely the bell of the ball. Then we've also had times when we were definitely a turd in the corner, when people were like 'oh it's a game for game-makers'. But I'm super excited - I think Eve is always relevant.</p><p>"I'm a big sci-fi nerd. Sci-fi is a mirror to the time it's created in, and because of how we lean on the community, looking at the world through the lens of Eve is a very interesting way of viewing things. We're going through some turbulent times, and Eve is a good way of trying to quantify and understand it."</p>

<p>Eve Online is available now on PC, you can download it for free on Steam and the game's official website.</p>

            <p>Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin would probably be quite surprised by how the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> - which he helped developer FromSoftware create a backstory for - actually turned out in the end.</p>
<p>That's according to Elden Ring game director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>, who has said that while Martin was part of the game's development in terms of laying foundations for its world-building and such, it was the studio's own narrative team that actually took what Martin devised and then built upon it. And, there are some cases where the team and Miyazaki built upon it so much, that Martin himself may not actually recognise it.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/the-soul-of-soulslike">Game Informer</a>, Miyazaki said "as a player walks through this world, [...] they have a very fragmented understanding of the lore, the surroundings, and the type of monsters, whereas I don't" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martins-starting-point-for-elden-ring-evolved-so-drastically-that-hidetaka-miyazaki-reckons-hed-be-surprised-how-the-open-world-rpg-turned-out/">Games Radar</a>).</p>
<p>As Miyazaki knew the world of Elden Ring in its entirety, the director therefore wanted to ensure that the important moments for those who did not have the same level of knowledge didn't get "lost". This saw the director bringing "the map and level design" of Elden Ring together, so it could "serve as a guide" which would "help players pick up more information and piece together what they think that world is", he explained.</p><p>But while Martin may be perhaps be surprised by how some of his lore building efforts evolved for the final release, Miyazaki doesn't have any regrets about the necessary changes which made Elden Ring an all-round experience for players. In fact, the director said Elden Ring even now remains "in a league of its own".</p>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/george-r-r-martin-admits-he-hasnt-played-elden-ring-as-people-seem-to-want-this-winds-of-winter-book">Martin admitted he hadn't played Elden Ring</a>, despite providing backstory. Before its release, though, the author did say <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2021/12/18/long-long-ago/">he thought Elden Ring looked pretty incredible</a>.</p>
<p>As for expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, Martin didn't provide any new material for FromSoftware. "Essentially it is the same as it was with the base game," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">Miyazaki told Eurogamer ahead of the DLC's release in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>"The DLC Shadow of the Erdtree is based on one part of that original mythos that he penned for us. It's not a brand new mythos that he's written specifically for Shadow of the Erdtree, he has not created something new which informed the design of the DLC. It's simply another part of the original story that we thought fit to tell as a new expansion."</p>

            <p>January is the month that, where I live, in the south of England, everyone gets serious again. All the paraphernalia of Christmas - all the merriment and cheer and colourful lighting - is cleared away in favour of sobering goals for the year ahead. It's never something that's appealed strongly to me, making goals, but I do feel the allure of wiping a slate clean and starting again. It's like a run in a roguelike game, I like to think. Time for a new me.</p>
<p>With that spirit in mind, but without being all LinkedIn about it, we're going to set some gaming goals for 2026. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-years-gaming-resolutions-were-definitely-going-to-stick-to">You might remember we did this at the beginning of 2025</a>, so there's a horrifying record there every year to remind us of what we probably didn't achieve - or did we? This article is a chance to look back, reflect, then look forwards again. And we'd like you to join in and do the same.</p>
<p>The question is simple: what would you like to achieve, in a gaming sense, this year? Perhaps you feel now is the time to get into speedrunning, or maybe you've got an eye on streaming, or perhaps you're going to make a game. Whatever it is - even if it's simply clearing a backlog (which is anything but simple) - tell us about it. Pitch in. Pipe up. Bonus points will be awarded for outrageous ambition.</p>

<h2>Play a game in every genre</h2>
<p>Last year I pledged to beat five bosses in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>. I kept the task simple to avoid overwhelm and failure, but I failed all the same. I started enthusiastically but something caught my eye and I turned away and I forgot all about Elden Ring. Once I've turned I find it hard to go back, especially if I haven't already gelled with a game-series' quirky way of doing things, which in this case I hadn't. I want to go back, I want to try again, but I'm not putting any pressure on it.</p><p>One small gaming win from last year: I did run a tabletop role-playing game which I've been talking about doing for years. I ran <a href="https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/eat-the-reich/?v=7885444af42e">Eat the Reich, a wonderfully approachable and action-packed game by Rowan, Rook and Decard</a>, which has some of the most striking art I've ever seen in a TTRPG.</p>
<p>This year I'm trying something different. I want to expand my palette a bit more and challenge myself to play games I wouldn't normally. I usually end up enjoying whatever I play but I often convince myself I won't before I begin, meaning I miss wonderful stuff. So, sports games, racing games, shooters, gacha games: this year I'm going to taste it all. Promise.</p>

<h2>Properly move to Linux</h2>
<p>There's a meme in computer nerd circles that <em>this </em>year is always "the year of Linux on the desktop". After all, Linux is always improving as an operating system, it's free, and it already runs most of the servers in the world, so surely Linux is going to dethrone Windows and become the default choice for desktop PCs too, right?</p><p>When I first heard the phrase, it was the early 2000s, and I was ordering free Ubuntu Linux CDs - because I was still on dial-up internet and I couldn't afford a Windows license. I heard it a lot more at uni from 2007 to 2011 too, where Linux is the de facto choice for coding and even the game we built ran on Linux (Descent meets the tunnels of The Matrix with three player co-op, since you asked). Now, nearly 20 years later (!!), it's with great pleasure that I say to you that, <em>for real this time</em>, 2026 is going to be the year of (Will Judd using) Linux on the desktop.</p>
<p>After all, it's never been easier - Valve's efforts with the Linux-based Steam OS and the Proton compatibility layer have meant that a huge proportion of Steam games run on Linux with no user configuration required, and that's like 99 percent of what I want to do with a computer. That's true across multiple devices and flavours of Linux too, from handheld PCs (like the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wsjudd.bsky.social/post/3m4qvl4par22r">Ayaneo 2S</a> I'm running <a href="https://bazzite.gg/">Bazzite</a> on) to laptops (an old <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-chillblast-defiant-16-tuxedo-infinitybook-pro-16-review-rtx-3060-laptop">Tuxedo InfinityBook 16 RTX 3060 laptop</a> running Tuxedo OS) and full-fat desktop PCs (a small form factor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wsjudd.bsky.social/post/3m6iftmeez22b">AMD-based PC</a> made to look like a shipping container that runs <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a>). And with Windows 11 continuing to load up on telemetry and AI features I don't want, Linux is looking increasingly attractive.</p>
<p>With three Linux machines easily accessible, my goal is to turn to them first - and only resort to gaming on Windows if I really can't avoid it. I already know games with anti-cheat don't work (though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-battlefield-6-work-on-steam-machine-valve-hopes-its-new-hardware-will-prompt-a-fresh-discussion-with-developers-over-kernel-level-anti-cheat">Valve wants to change that</a>), but will there be any other challenges? How will the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-steam-machine-preview-a-powerful-customisable-mini-pc-for-couch-gaming">release of the Steam Machine</a> change things? Can I become a bona fide Linux zealot? I aim to find out - and, if you're interested, I'll take you along for the ride.</p>
<p>-<em>Will</em></p>
<h2>Play more big games through to completion</h2>

<p>"What do you mean you don't finish games? Aren't you a games journalist?" asks GitGud2004. Good question. Well, yes, I do finish games, but in recent times these have almost always been games I've played for work. It's a little sad to lay it out like this, but for games I want to play just because I fancy playing them I have about 3-4 hours a week, split over four days. The big problem with this is that I find it really hard to properly get into a new game if I have to put it down after 40 minutes, so I've developed a bad habit. I've found myself either giving up and moving on to something else or returning to an old game I know I can just play without any need for a commitment.</p><p>This must change in 2026. No longer will I be put off by a playtime of 20+ hours. My gaming won't be ruled by quick-fire experiences I can finish in a week. I'm sorry, Rematch, but I think it's time I moved on (mostly). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, I will finish you, finally! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, this is your year (maybe).</p>
<p><em>-Tom</em></p>
<h2>Spend more time playing games with friends (no but really this time)</h2>
<p>I am currently in the exact opposite moment to the boom-bust cycle of "I can finish big games that I'm not reviewing" optimism to my colleague Tom, above. For so many reasons right now, I just can't do it. There will be a time in the future, but that time is not now.</p>
<p>Anyway, my solution to this has mostly been playing smaller, more snackable games - either ones I can finish in single-digit hours, like the wonderful Despelote, or ones I can play for a while in shorter chunks, like the also-wonderful Sektori, and almost always ones I can play on something handheld. The issue is, wonderful as they really are, a lot of these games tend to be single-player. There's nothing wrong with that on its own, but over time it can, I've found, build up to be a little isolating. Over the holidays I played some Dawn of War: Definitive Edition games with old friends and it was glorious.</p>
<p>Which makes sense actually, because - oops! - turns out this was the exact resolution I had last year, which I have only just been reminded of now. Shows how well I stick to these…</p>
<p>Anyway, long ago, playing the original with those same friends was how I went from liking video games to becoming infatuated with them. Today - and this is hardly unique to me - it's how I catch up with people I can't see in-person as much as I'd like. Last year I still didn't do enough of it. This year, I promise, it'll be how I fall in love with games all over again.</p>
<p><em>-Chris</em></p>
<h2>Complete all of the Lego games</h2>
<p>Last year my resolution was to return to more games that bring me joy, like Rollercoaster Tycoon and The Sims. For once, I achieved my goal without thinking too hard about it! Can I do the same this year?</p>
<p>As my half-finished Game Boy Lego set judges me from my desk, and with a new Lego Batman game coming out midway through the year, my resolution is quite literally staring me in the face. I've always enjoyed Lego sets and games alike - I could say so much about why but I'll summarise it by saying their specific brand of humour always tickles me.</p><p>My resolution is to complete more Lego games, including the new Lego Batman due out in May. I've already completed a few games over the years, such as Marvel Super Heroes and Indiana Jones, but there are many more sitting on my Switch waiting to be finished. The first one on my list may very well be the Jurassic World I abandoned a year ago...</p>
<p><em>-Marie</em></p>
<h2>Get my money's worth from subscription services</h2>
<p>OK, this year, I am going to actually try and get my money's worth from subscription services. While this is not limited to games - I have a Now TV account I have hardly touched since The Last of Us Season Two wrapped up - my game-based subscriptions account for a chunk of my outgoings and I don't think I've ever used them enough to truly feel like they're giving me a better deal. I have both PS Plus Premium and Game Pass Ultimate. I probably use Game Pass more than PS Plus, but even so, I don't think I am using it <em>enough</em>. That is for both the number of games I play as well as hours I play any particular game overall.</p>
<p>But that changes this year! This year, those subscriptions will be worth every penny. If not, I should really think about cancelling them...</p>
<p><em>-Victoria </em></p>
<h2>Have a 24-hour Majora's Mask marathon</h2>
<p>Every year I complete a ritual of replaying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a>. Not only is it my favourite Zelda game thanks to its supreme surreal and creepy vibes, but it's my second favourite game ever. (The first is Okami if you're interested.) This year, however, I want to do the traditional replay a little differently. Rather than taking the reasonable path and spreading it out over a couple of weeks, I want to see how close I can get to 100 percenting the game in 24 hours.</p><p>We're talking starting at midnight, ending at midnight. 1440 minutes - that's 86,400 seconds - of straight, non-stop, Majora's Mask. The game which used to give me night terrors every time I played it as a child! What could go wrong? (I will be taking toilet breaks. I'm not an animal.)</p>
<p>It's a fitting challenge for a game based around a time loop and, considering how many times I've completed it, I really think I've got a good shot at doing it! Hopefully. The main stumbling block I foresee is the Goron Hide and Seek Dungeon. I haven't mastered it yet...</p>
<p><em>-Lottie</em></p>
<h2>Be a speedrunner again</h2>
<p>Once upon a time, I was a speedrunner. Thank you, ADHD. I love the Crash Bandicoot series, and something about the momentum and slickness of Crash 3: Warped, in particular, appealed so much to my teenage brain that I basically memorised the platinum relic routes in a matter of weeks. Fast-forward to my university days, and to my introduction to speedrunning, and I found my niche. Here it is, the game I wanted to master. Over the course of a couple of months, I learned the routes and started clearing the 105 percent category in under five hours. That's not that impressive by today's leaderboard standards, but I promise it was pretty lofty a goal back then!</p><p>Watching AGDQ this week has lit the fire in me again, and now I'm keen to edge back into the world of speedrunning with something else - maybe something shorter. I think my reflexes are too shot for a platformer like Crash, but I've been eyeing up Inside and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/limbo">Limbo</a> as maybe my next challenge. I could even go for something longer like Pentiment or Citizen Sleeper... Let's see what my schedule looks like when the start-of-year melee settles down.</p>

            <p>Cygames, the Japanese video game developer responsible for a variety of popular games including Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has announced its intention to create an AI-focused subsidiary company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/">A blog post</a> on the official website states Cygames AI Studio Inc will be developing "AI-based services and tools". A breakdown of key information at the bottom of the post also indicates it'll be involved in operation support and consulting as part of its AI services.</p>
<p>The post also features a paragraph detailing the background for this company, including the reasoning for why it's been established. The statement, translated into English using built-in Google tools, reads: "Generative AI, which has emerged in recent years, is an important technology with the potential to transform accumulated knowledge into the driving force behind the next wave of creativity.</p>

<p>"At the AI Studio, Cygames will pursue AI technology that creators can use safely and securely, drawing on the experience it has cultivated in game development. From research and development of its own models to providing services and tools for production sites, the company will build a unique creative cycle that goes beyond simply improving efficiency to expand creators' creativity</p>
<p>"Through the establishment of the AI Studio, Cygames will take on the challenge of creating new user experiences to realize its vision of being "a company that creates the best content."</p>
<p>Japanese video game companies such as Cygames appear to be largely embracing generative AI technology. In a poll during last year's Tokyo Game Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of companies that responded stated generative AI was being used in development</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has indicated its desire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">to replace much of its QA work with generative AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">Sega too has expressed eagerness to use the tech in spite of "strong resistance"</a>.</p>
<p>Cygames' current golden goose in Western markets, Umamusume: Pretty Derby, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">won the best mobile game award at last year's TGAs</a>.</p>

            <p>Former Xbox exclusive role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> is coming to PlayStation 5, and it'll be released on the game's first anniversary: 17th February 2026 (note: the original PC and Xbox Series S/X release happened on 18th February 2025 but it's only a day's difference).</p>
<p>The benefit of a year-long wait for Avowed on PS5 means there's been a year's worth of game improvements. Among them are expanded/reworked abilities for the Ranger and Fighter skill trees, a New Game Plus mode, a Photo Mode, and the option of playing as a species other than human. You'll be able to play as the big, scaly Amauan, the small furry Orlan, and the broad-shouldered Dwarves. I wish I'd had this choice when I played.</p>

These improvements will all be available on other existing platforms, of course, but as they say: you can only make a first impression once.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Avowed made a very good impression on me</a>. It has a slightly dated feel to it, but look past that and there's an adventure here with playful mechanics and a delightfully earnest approach to fantasy - one packed with colour and wide-eyed wonder.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall underestimated just how much players would engage with the game's various sidequests and optional content, and as a result of this extra grinding would find the final boss fight a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>As we all know by now, Clair Obscur became quite a sensation following its release last year. The first game from Sandfall, many weren't sure exactly what to expect on its debut, but before long many were deeply invested in its world and characters. In fact, players were so invested in Clair Obscur, they completed a lot of optional side content and dungeons, leveling up their characters in the process. </p>
<p>This meant, though, that by the time it came to the final showdown (don't worry, I won't spoil it here), a lot of players were actually a lot stronger than Sandfall anticipated, and so the fight itself was a little <em>too</em> easy.</p>

<p>"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Clair Obscur's lead game designer Michel Nohra said in a recent interview with Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">Games Radar</a>).</p><p>Nohra added: "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>"I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur's lead programmer Tom Guillermin believes a lot of this was due to Sandfall's "humility", as no one at the studio really expected the game to become quite such a success.</p>
<p>"We weren't sure if our game was going to be that good," Guillermin said. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon."</p>
<p>Closing, Guillermin said of course the team was "happy about that", however Sandfall just "didn't see it coming".</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>Last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have - perhaps slightly ironically now - proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been a busy year so far for a game that's over 10 years old. If you've not been following, last week, we asked "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion">is there really going to be a new Witcher 3 expansion this year?</a>", responding to comments from Borys Nieśpielak, a trusted source of Polish games industry information. Following his remarks, a Noble Securities analyst then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">added fuel to the fire</a> this week.</p>
<p>Now, more information about this decade-late DLC seems to have surfaced. Per <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw">IGN Poland</a>, it seems that CD Projekt's developers have mentioned a past interest in exploring the region of Zerrikania. Now, this isn't particularly new information, but the fact that it's resurfacing now - as multiple sources indicate CD Projekt Red is cooking <em>something </em>to do with the game - is worth interrogating.</p>
<p>I actually spent some time reading the Witcher books last year, and remember Zerrikania being referred to as a vast (human!) realm located to the east of both the Northern Kingdoms and the Nilfgaardian Empire. There are two huge forests in the region - one in a deep canyon and one resting in the foothills of the Fiery Mountains. Good setting for a big open-world DLC, then…</p>
<p>The region has actually been mentioned in the games, to date. If you (or Geralt) don't invite Letho to Kaer Morhen at the end of the Ghosts of the Past quest in the base game of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>, Letho notes he will flee to Zerrikania. You can also get some Zerrikania clothes in the 'alternative look for Ciri' free DLC. Was that a hint at things to come, perhaps?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Given the lore of the books - and, I think, one season of the Netflix adaptation - you can expect dragons in this region. The culture there worships them as god-like beings, but they have been known to run rampant on occasion… perhaps leading towards the need for a Witcher - or Witcher<em>s</em> - to deal with.</p><p>As for CD Projekt Red, the company hasn't released a new game since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> in late 2023 (though Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-three-quarters-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical">did come to Switch 2</a> alongside the console's release in 2025, to some very impressive sales). The game continues to sell well - whoda thought, after that launch - having passed 35 million sales mark and claiming an almost-permanent spot on Steam's best-sellers list.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red has previously told Eurogamer "it does not comment on rumour or speculation", regarding this Witcher 3 DLC rumour: the company's standard line on these things. So it remains to be seen whether this is all legit, or just some fanciful thinking. Watch this space.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> studio Kinetic Games is branching out into indie game publishing, and is actively seeking "creative games from small teams and solo developers globally, who have a clear vision for their title and are 12-18 months from release", a press release said.</p>
<p>Studio founder and Phasmophobia creator Daniel Knight launched <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/publishing">Kinetic Publishing</a> to provide the kind of assistance "I'd have appreciated at the start of my journey". The website stipulates "no blockchain, web3 or AI generated games", and lays out some of the services Kinetic will offer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">I spoke to Knight last year about making Phasmophobia</a>, and I was surprised by how difficult the game's gigantic success was to deal with. It was the business admin he struggled with, such as setting up a company and paying server costs and hiring people. Mundane stuff, but stuff that pulled him away from actually making the game.</p><p>Knight now has a team of 30 people at Kinetic to help him, though - plenty of people to finally complete Phasmophobia and get the game to version 1.0. It's been in early access for over five years now. But this year's the year, and the 1.0 release will be a big one.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/">In a Steam update post for Phasmophobia</a> on 25th December, Kinetic wrote: "Our aim with the 1.0 launch is to be able to, as a team, look at Phasmophobia after many years of updating, iterating and evolving and know we’ve fulfilled our vision for the game.</p>
<p>"Our horror update will be the meatiest part of the 1.0 release and will give even the most seasoned Ghost Hunter a host of new scares and surprises. While we aren’t going to share too many details on it as we want that 1.0 release to feel as fresh and exciting as the original release did, keep an eye out for a few details throughout the year.</p>
<p>"Phasmophobia 1.0 will launch in 2026 for all players, across all available platforms at the same time."</p>

            <p>Microsoft has announced another Developer Direct, set to take place on the 22nd January. It'll feature Fable, Forza, and Beast of Reincarnation.</p>
<p>As for exact timing, eager spectators can tune in to this Developer Direct at 10am Pacific / 1pm Eastern / 6pm UK on the official Xbox YouTube channel to watch it live.</p>
<p>What exactly will be shown off remains largely a mystery, though <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/">the official Xbox Wire post</a> announcing the show states we'll be seeing the "first in-depth look" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveals-beast-of-reincarnation-at-xbox-games-showcase#:~:text=Beast%20of%20Reincarnation%20takes%20place,world's%20corruption%20to%20save%20humanity.">at Beast of Reincarnation since its reveal last June at the Xbox Showcase</a>.</p>

<p>There will also be a "deep dive" into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, with a focus on gameplay and reveals of new features.

The game made a mostly cinematic appearance in 2024, with a few glimpses of gameplay sprinkled throughout. But a proper lenghty gameplay deep dive, with UI and all the trimmings, has been on the top of people's wants ever since. Those desires will seemingly be met on the 22nd.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced two pastelly new Joy-Con 2 controller colours for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and said they'll release next month.</p>
<p>The colours - officially Light Purple and Light Green (though I'd have called them Lavender and Turquoise) - are due to arrive 12th February, alongside Mario Tennis Fever on Switch 2. As far as I'm aware, these are the first new Joy-Con 2 colour variants offered for Switch 2. I'm sure they won't be the last.</p>

<p>Speaking of Mario Tennis Fever: Nintendo released a sizable overview trailer for the game today, detailing modes and characters as well as things like GameShare and amiibo support.</p>

            <p>The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> have traded more blows following a preliminary tribunal hearing this week. There, the IWGB asked a judge to grant the fired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> developers interim relief.</p>
<p>Interim relief is a method of financial support for people awaiting a full hearing. If the motion is granted, the fired GTA 6 workers will go back on Rockstar's payroll, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims">IGN reports</a> - presumably until an overall outcome is reached.</p>
<p>The IWGB said in a statement issued to IGN that, "We hope this week's tribunal will grant urgently needed relief to the workers whose lives were turned upside down by Rockstar's brutal union-busting, leaving them and their families without incomes, without secure futures, and in some cases without even the right to remain in the country they have made their home.</p>

<p>"However, no matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of the case we have brought against Rockstar Games. We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing."</p><p>Rockstar suddenly fired 34 staff in November last year (31 of them in the UK, hence being covered by the IWGB) who happened to be unionising. Rockstar, however, said this was not why they were fired, pointing to alleged gross misconduct instead. Rockstar said the fired staff shared confidential information with people outside of the company on Discord.</p>
<p>The dismissals went viral and sparked protests outside of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a>'s studio in Edinburgh, Scotland, and even reached parliament in the UK, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">prime minister Keir Starmer calling the sudden firings "deeply concerning"</a>.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage"</em></blockquote>
<p>"This case is not just about the suffering of the 31 people who lost their livelihoods in the blink of an eye," the IWGB added. "This is about the arrogance of a company like Rockstar thinking that its size and profitability grant it an unlimited licence to abuse its workers, and to do so with impunity."</p>
<p>Rockstar denied all claims in a counter-issued statement. "We have consistently made clear that we took necessary action against a group of individuals across the UK and Canada who discussed highly confidential information," Rockstar told IGN, "including relating to game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an insecure and public social channel. This was a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies.</p><p>"We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled. Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage - as we have seen in the past - and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team.</p>
<p>"This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorised releases of information - and we always will."</p>

            <p>Netease has finally released a gameplay trailer for its pirate Adventure RPG Sea of Remnants, which showcases a variety of features including ship combat, open area exploration, drinking competitions, and Mahjong.</p>
<p>The trailer, published on the official Sea of Remnants YouTube account, has reached over 1.3m views in less than 12 hours. Just under six minutes in length, it highlights what players will actually be able to do in the wood-carved puppet world entirely with early in-game footage.</p>
<p>According to the game's Steam page, it'll feature a dynamic weather system based, over 300 companions, and a mix of sea combat and turn-based party fighting. It's also free-to-play, with a 2026 release window.</p>

<p>Sea of Remnants is being developed by Joker Studio, which previously worked on an asymmetrical horror game also featuring a distinct gothic art style with doll characters. That game, also free, featured crossovers with a variety of popular franchises like Dangenrompa, Persona, and even KFC.</p><p>Sea of Remnants <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">was first revealed to the world at a Sony State of Play last June</a>. For those who like the look of this interesting new venture into open waters, a testing period is kicking off this month <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633680/Sea_of_Remnants/">that you can sign up for on the game's official Steam store page</a>.</p>
<p>Sea of Remnants is of course just one Netease game set to come out in the near future. While Sea of Remnants appears to be tackling the free-to-play market, the Chinese gaming giant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blood-message-reveal-trailer-netease">is also tackling the AAA single player space with the upcoming Blood Message</a>. Though, in that game's case, no release date has been revealed.</p>

            <p>The world has gone blue once again. James Cameron's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-fire-and-ash-review">Avatar: Fire and Ash</a> is torching the box office, having already passed the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1757678/">$1 billion global mark</a> and probably kickstarting serious conversations about Avatar 4 and 5 (both are written but waiting for the green light). And it looks like 2023's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> is also benefitting from some brand synergy.</p>
<p>Against all expectations, the Massive Entertainment-developed and Ubisoft-published game failed to find a sizable audience after it launched. Considering The Way of Water, the second Avatar movie, had absorbed $2.3 billion worldwide at the box office in 2022, it was a surprising flop for Ubisoft. For the first time, Eywa didn’t show up to save the day.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to early 2026, less than a month after the release of Fire and Ash’s and the arrival of the game's new <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes">From the Ashes DLC</a>, and we’re looking at a different picture: via the charts on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2840770/charts/#1m">SteamDB</a>, we can see the game was averaging around 2,000 concurrent players. Over the Christmas holidays and into January 2026, it's broken its all-time peak player record several times, with the highest count now being 15,283 concurrents. We don't have the data for the Ubisoft Connect platform or the console versions of the game, but social media chatter is indicating the change of tide isn't limited to just Steam (a metric the Splitgate devs would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-charts-dont-measure-fun-splitgate-arena-reloaded-developer-responds-to-concerning-pc-launch-numbers">like us to keep in mind</a>).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Since Ubisoft announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-will-get-third-person-mode-in-free-update-ahead-of-new-film">Frontiers of Pandora would be getting further post-launch support</a> in the shape of a much-requested third-person mode, New Game Plus, and a standalone DLC which tied into the third movie, buzz surrounding the open-world action-adventure game has been more positive. With the recent updates delivering on those promises and the expansion taking things into a darker and more cinematic territory with a different protagonist, the result isn't super surprising, but it’s still nice to see a "dead game" getting a second shot at finding an audience, especially when it's part of such an internationally-renowned franchise.</p><p>For all its faults, Ubisoft has been excelling at bringing troubled games back from the dead or partial failure. <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ubisoft-best-service-games-for-honor">For Honor may be the most glowing example</a> of such an approach, but even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> and The Division (both entries) faced rough beginnings. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">Skull &amp; Bones</a> is getting a shot at redemption. With Disney and a massive IP behind it, the Na'vi-centric open-world game always had a fighting chance, but its future was uncertain after the original DLC plans were wrapped up.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the best part is the paid From the Ashes expansion (which I'm currently playing through) isn't just more of the same, as it actually takes the familiar formula in a different direction that feels more focused and rawer in its approach to combat encounters, stealth, and character abilities. By focusing on a warrior character we already knew from the base game, So'lek, and the Ash clan of Na'vi who reject Eywa (on top of evil human invaders, of course), the DLC quickly finds its own voice and hits surprisingly hard, too.</p>
<p>Whether you enjoy the Avatar movies or think they don't live up to the potential of Pandora as a setting, I sincerely think Frontiers of Pandora is one of the most stimulating open-world games of this generation, and a truly stunning tech showcase worth checking out. More than two years later, it might be finally getting the recognition it deserves.</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game, titled Life is Strange: Reunion, has been rated in Europe. Since being discovered by fans, the game's presence on the PEGI website has since been removed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/life-is-strange-reunion-rated-in-europe">Still viewable on Gematsu</a>, Life is Strange: Reunion, was rated 16 like every entry in the series since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-true-colors">Life is Strange: True Colors</a>. According to the rating, the filing was published back in March of 2025.</p>
<p>There was a description of Life is Strange: Reunion too, outlining that Chloe Price would come to Caledon University to seek out Max Cauldfield's help, haunted by nightmares and "impossible memories". However, with an inferno set to destroy the campus in three days, Max is already in crisis.</p>

<p>The rating states that Life is Strange: Reunion is set to feature the use of illegal drugs, and that purchasable outfits are available for real money, as well as a digital deluxe upgrade. Aside from that, there's little else in terms of information about the release.</p><p>The previous entry in the Life is Strange series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, was released in November of 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-was-a-large-loss-for-square-enix-report">Reportedly a loss for Square Enix</a>, the game teased the return of franchise favourite Max Caufield. Following its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">developer Deck Nine suffered layoffs</a>. CEO Mark Lyons stated at the time: "This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times our industry is currently facing."</p>
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure itself received mixed reviews from players and critics alike. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">In Eurogamer's review</a>, Tom Phillips wrote: Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future."</p>

            <p>Netflix has today confirmed that the fifth and final season of The Witcher will air on the streaming service this year. It follows Season 4 in rapid succession - that series having launched at the end of October last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/new-shows-on-netflix-2026">Netflix listed The Witcher as a 2026 release</a> in the "coming soon" section of a list on its website. A synopsis for the series reads:</p>
<blockquote>"The time of the end is nigh: dark forces are aligning all across the Continent with villainous designs on Ciri. Even if Geralt and Yennefer can save their daughter and fulfill their last wish of reuniting as a family, they’ll have to face obstacles — and enemies — the likes of which they've never faced before."</blockquote>
<p>Season 5 was expected to follow Season 4 quickly, with the two being filmed back to back. Showrunner Lauren Hissrich said the Witcher team treated the two series as "one large story". <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-witcher-season-5-season-4-one-story-schmidt-hissrich-batey-response/">Jaskier actor Joey Batey added, speaking to ScreenRant</a>, "It sort of feels like Season 4, Part 1 and 2. I think that's how I read it."</p><p>Viewing figures for The Witcher Netflix series have fallen sharply since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-tracking-to-be-our-biggest-season-one-tv-series-ever-says-netflix">The Witcher's remarkably strong start in 2019</a>. Even with Henry Cavill, the series was in decline season on season, and the fourth series, which saw Liam Hemsworth replace Cavill, dropped even further. Season 4 had 7.4m views across its first four days of availability, Season 3 had 15.2m, and Season 2 had 18.5m. Season 1 saw 76m households tune in for at least two minutes, Netflix said at the time.</p>
<p>I watched a few episodes of Season 4 but bounced off it after that. Did anyone make it all the way through?</p>

            <p>The analyst who forecasted a Witcher 3 expansion release in 2026 has told me they're "100 percent certain [CD Projekt Red] will release significant new content this year".</p>
<p>I messaged Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski following a prediction made in a company report that said: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-there-really-going-to-be-a-2026-witcher-3-expansion">We expect the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026</a>." I wanted to know how confident Chrzanowski was in that prediction and what it was based upon.</p>
<p>If you recall, I asked a similar question of Borys Nieśpielak, who is the other person credited with originating rumours of this unexpected Witcher 3 content release. Nieśpielak stood by the information and said it had been verified by several independent sources.</p>
<p>Chrzanowski - whose information I'm told comes from a mix of publicly available sources and conversations with CD Projekt Red - seems similarly confident. "I'm 100 percent certain CDPR will release significant new content this year," Chrzanowski told me, "as the incentive program is still 700 million PLN short [GBP 144m]."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHuw6gZxqcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>This "incentive program" is at the core of Chrzanowski's reasoning. It's a part of the salary for key employees at CDPR, usually management, and it aims to incentivise them by granting additional shares should certain financial targets be met. Do well, gain wealth, basically.</p><p>In order to meet the requirements, CDPR has to earn PLN 2bn (£412m) cumulative net profit between 2023 and 2026, PLN 3bn (£617m) between 2024 and 2027, and PLN 4bn (£823m) between 2025 and 2028, Chrzanowski explained. And it's the first threshold bracket the pressure is particularly on. "Currently, PLN 700 million [£144m] is needed to meet the first threshold, with only five quarters remaining," Chrzanowski said. "This implies the need for something significantly larger than just another update or a version for a niche platform."</p>
<p>But what has CDPR got that it can release? The company hasn't released a new game since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> in late 2023, though it did bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-three-quarters-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical">Cyberpunk 2077 to Switch alongside the console's release last year, which seemed to work very well</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 continues to sell surprisingly well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">passing 35 million sales-mark</a> last year and holding strong as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-games-performed-really-well-on-steam-last-year-shaking-the-dominance-of-the-same-old-live-service-games">a top-grossing game on Steam</a>, but in order to make up the incentive program shortfall it will need something more. The next announced game in the pipeline, however, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-whole-new-witcher-trilogy-of-games-released-within-six-years-of-each-other-is-that-even-possible-cd-projekt-red-thinks-so">The Witcher 4, which won't be released before 2027</a>, and probably not for a while after. In other words: after the first threshold bracket ends.</p>

<p>Incidentally, <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">CDPR referenced this incentive program in an earnings call at the end of last year</a>, when it said there was "a chance" it would release new content to help achieve the first stage of it. "Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program."</p>
<blockquote><em>"90 percent of the time it's pointed to a Witcher 3 expansion"</em></blockquote>
<p>This is what's behind Chrzanowski's prediction. "90 percent of the time it's pointed to a Witcher 3 expansion," Chrzanowski said. "This is a natural direction in terms of the required revenue scale. However, a Witcher-themed game like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-thaumaturge">The Thaumaturge</a> (Fool's Theory's latest production) would also be possible. Remember, Fool's Theory was built on a foundation of Witcher veterans."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-thaumaturge-review-a-refreshingly-different-polish-rpg">I reviewed The Thaumaturge in 2024</a> and was encouraged by it. Presentationally, it was a bit dated, or rather limited by what a small team could achieve, but excitingly, it felt different. It told a story set in Warsaw, Poland, at the turn of the 20th century - a setting I hadn't played in before - that revolved around a magic user known as a Thaumaturge: a person capable of reading people's thoughts and battling literal demons living there. It was strategic, thoughtful, authentic and unique.</p><p>Naturally, my interest was also heightened by The Thaumaturge being the debut game of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-1-remake-will-be-open-world-modern-reimagining">a studio hired to remake The Witcher 1</a>. We know that remake has stalled a bit as Fool's Theory helps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> team grapple with Unreal Engine 5, which The Witcher 1 remake will also use - CDPR's Red Engine has been left behind. But Fool's Theory is rumoured to be making this new Witcher 3 expansion as well.</p>
<p>"It's worth noting that CDPR is sparing with words," Chrzanowski added, "so such a strong indication of new content in the report and during the conference provides certainty, especially since declarations about meeting the incentive program goals have been communicated for a long time. The Thaumaturge premiered in March 2023, so The Witcher has been a priority since then. The team has grown from 60 to 100 people. However, some support the development of The Witcher 4 and are waiting for joint assets to be developed."</p>
<p>It's a convincing argument but there remain plenty of reasons to be sceptical. If something as considerable as a Witcher 3 expansion were in development - something which will be compared to existing Witcher 3 expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine - would CDPR risk not making it in-house? Those previous expansions have been generous, celebrated things. But to make it in-house would mean re-establishing a team that moved on nearly 10 years ago and working on old tech, and it has its more than full making The Witcher 4. Perhaps Fool's Theory has been entrusted with it.</p>
<p>There's also the question of what an expansion would be if it were in development. Geralt effectively retired at the end of Blood and Wine, and The Witcher 4 is led by Ciri. Presumably Ciri's story will be handled by The Witcher 4, so would that mean Geralt would come back? Wouldn't that be confusing in terms of stealing thunder away from Ciri? Or could it be a game about someone else entirely - the sorcerer Yennefer, perhaps? And how big would it be and how much would CDPR charge for it? Questions, questions. Let's hope we get some answers, and soon.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We've been hearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">rumblings of a full-blown remake of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> for the longest time now. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">Skull &amp; Bones</a>' troubled development, those current-gen assets could boost the production of such a project, so the idea never sounded too far-fetched. We've yet to receive official news on it though. Now, a new <a href="https://raidshadowlegends.com/">Raid: Shadow Legends</a> event has got hungry Assassin's Creed fans all hot under the collar.</p>
<p>The free-to-play "battle collection RPG" has been enjoying lots of success on mobile devices since it launched in 2018, but we don't blame you if you've never heard about it (other than in sponsored intros in YouTube video essays). That said, a quick glance at YouTube’s massive community around the Plarium Games-developed gacha will shock you: it's one of those games that trundles on quietly in the background, seemingly forever.</p>
<p>This week, it's been getting ready to welcome characters from the Assassin's Creed series via a new event which starts tomorrow, 8th January (hat tip to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/accesstheanimus.com/post/3mbtha4s4u22z">Access the Animus on BlueSky</a>).</p>
<p>The key here is the short teaser - which hasn't hit YouTube yet as far as we can tell - that ends with pirate-turned-assassin Edward Kenway joining the fantasy battleground. We don't get to see the full design, which seems to resemble the original CGI model rather, than the in-game one we got in 2013.</p><p>Given the choice to end on him and <em>not</em> to reveal his full look, all the recent info we have about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced being real</a> and close by, and buzz suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">Ubisoft might have a surprise in store for us before Q1 2026 ends</a>, it’s easy to see why fans are shaking right now.</p>
<p>Personally, I'm of the opinion the January release schedule is looking a bit light on big new releases. With February and March looking way more packed, could Ubisoft be planning to shadow-drop the Black Flag remake on us out of nowhere? Considering <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-a-shadow-dropped-title-made-it-into-the-top-10-best-selling-games-of-2025.1387183/">last year's Oblivion remaster snuck into the list of best-selling video games in the US</a> with no lead-up marketing, such an approach to Black Flag Resynced and/or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> would make sense. That's just me theorising, however, so don't cannonball us if the ship isn't ready to sail yet.</p>

            <p>Apparently, there are many studios out there that are interested in making a film or TV show based on Embark's shooter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>.</p>
<p>We live in an age where every game under the sun seems to be - at least in the eyes of producers - ripe for adaptation. These range from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">Amazon's Toejam and Earl movie</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivor's TV show</a> (both of which are still to materialise), to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">acclaimed dramatisations like The Last of Us and Fallout</a>.</p>
<p>And, well, it seems that Arc Raiders could be joining the ever growing list of games-to-screen releases, if it gets "done in the right way".</p>

<p>Embark founder Patrick Söderlund was recently a guest on GamesBeat's YouTube channel, when the subject of an Arc Raiders adaptation came up. "I can't tell you how many companies have reached out to us wanting to make a TV series [or] a movie out of this," the exec revealed.</p><p>When asked if he was tempted to go for it, Söderlund said it could be "fun" to see an adaptation of Arc Raiders. "It needs to be done in the right way," he added. "I hope that we will do that."</p>
<p>Closing down this train of thought, Söderlund said he believes the Arc Raiders "IP fits quite well with something like that". 

So, would you be keen to see an Arc Raiders film? I assume it would have to feature plenty of rubber ducks to be totally lore accurate. Also, would any adaptation be able to stand out from other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-film-adaptation-officially-in-the-works-from-paramount">already confirmed film projects like Helldivers and Call of Duty</a>?</p>
<p>You can check out the full conversation with Söderlund via the video below.</p>

<p>According to analyst estimates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders recently passed the 12m sales milestone</a>, bringing in over $350m in revenue. Meanwhile, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">one of Steam's best selling games over the festive period</a>, thanks in part to a well-timed discount as well as an ongoing wave of positive word-of-mouth.</p>

            <p>If you haven't been watching, Fallout Season 2 is pretty great and has been enjoying a good deal of success. So much so that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">Season 3 is already well into the writing stage</a>. New games are sadly still a ways off, however, which is why both veteran and new players are flocking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> and other entries to go post-apocalyptic.</p>
<p>That’s what <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a> has been saying, at least. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-season-2-has-doubled-the-number-of-people-playing-the-fallout-games-on-steam/">PC Gamer</a> took a look at the data before and after Season 2 premiered back in December 2025. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, which recently received an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-announces-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-confirms-nintendo-switch-2-version-for-2026">Anniversary Edition</a>, seems to be the biggest winner, with its concurrent players count going from 20,000 on average to 40,000 as of last Sunday. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and 2010's New Vegas also saw similar bumps, with the latter being the most relevant to Season 2's plot and setting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> has also doubled its concurrent players from a hundred-ish to around 200. For a single-player game released on 2008 that’s also available elsewhere and doesn’t have as many direct ties to the TV show as the other three we’ve mentioned, that’s not bad. Even free-to-play, mobile-oriented <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a> saw an increase in activity.</p>
<p>The New Vegas-oriented second season of Fallout, which is currently airing new episodes each week via Amazon’s Prime Video, takes Lucy, The Ghoul, Maximus, and many other characters to very familiar places, yet the key creatives behind the show have been smart enough to avoid the usual interconnected universe, franchise-building issues.</p><p>Needless to say, Microsoft-owned and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>-led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> has done a great job of shepherding the show alongside the creative team led by Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy, Graham Wagner, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, making it not just the perfect gateway into the video game franchise, but also a respectable companion piece that’s defining the post-Fallout 4 timeline <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">the fifth game will be acknowledging when it finally arrives</a>. For now, we have more Fallout 76 content updates and the Switch 2 port of Fallout 4 to look forward to.</p>

            <p>Kazutaka Kodaka is one of the most recognisable names in the games industry for those who really enjoy anime-inspired visual novels. Recently, he led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>'s development, and the his name may be familiar to anyone au fait with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/danganronpa-and-the-surprising-joys-of-clumsy-queer-representation">Danganronpa</a> series. But the creator's journey to get back into the world of game development wasn't exactly a straight line.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/danganronpa-creator-became-a-game-dev-because-of-an-argument-he-had-while-working-part-time-that-made-him-think-what-am-i-doing-with-my-life/">Automaton</a> (who also translated the original comments), we've learned that, during last year's Computer Entertainment Developers Conference (CEDEC+KYUSHU 2025), the director explained how he landed the position his Spike Chunsoft, which led to the creation of the original Danganronpa. The main twist? He decided to focus on games after having a heated exchange with a co-worker while working part-time at a game shop.</p>
<p>After a few games-related gigs, Kodaka spent quite some time in his twenties making indie films and working part-time jobs. One day, at the aforementioned game shop, he scolded a fellow university student working alongside him for a mistake she made, saying she wouldn't make it in society. Her answer was pointing out that he "hadn't been out in society" for a while, which made him stop, ask himself "What am I even doing", and rethink his life choices and how he interacted with others (as revealed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1zJH-dl-kw">another interview</a>) going forward.</p>
<p>This exchange ended his game development hiatus after working in minor roles on projects like Clock Tower 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil 2</a>, as he started a job hunt which landed him a position at Spike. The rest is history. Danganronpa became a hit praised for its mix of dark comedy, heavy themes, and engaging mystery before spawning a larger series of well-received titles. By the late 2010s, he departed Spike and founded the studio Too Kyo Games alongside other veterans.</p><p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-hundred-line-and-danganronpa-creator-says-there-would-be-more-uniquely-japanese-games-if-development-was-more-creator-oriented-and-focused-on-individuality/">Kodaka has been vocal in the past</a> about the huge impact anime, manga, and "borrowed" video games had on his personal storytelling style and the visual aspect of Danganronpa and The Hundred Line. It's nice to hear about his life before becoming a massive name in the Japanese games industry, though. Yet another reminder you never know what might be around the corner.</p>

            <p>My household is tricky to please. A 12-year-old who essentially wants to play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> 24/7, a four-year-old who wants to do what the 12-year-old is doing but can't because she's four, and me and my wife who want to do anything that'll keep those two happy for more than five minutes so we can sit on the sofa and drink a coffee because we deserve FIVE GODDAMN MINUTES! It doesn't sound like much of an ask, but it really is, trust me. I needed a Christmas Golden Goose, something I could tap into whenever family harmony started to teeter towards a level of chaos no amount of Cadbury's Heroes could remedy - while the Bluey scavenger hunt game is good, it definitely skews more four-year-old, and traditional video games were off the menu. In my festive hour of need, as if sent by Santa himself, Netflix provided. Yes, Netflix. And no, we didn't just watch The Grinch on repeat (although we did watch it a lot - the animated one, not the naff Jim Carrey one).</p>
<p>I think it's fair to say that Netflix has approached video games like a lot of companies trying to break into that industry do: there's money to be made so they throw money at it and hope something good happens. Amazon, Apple, and Google are three giants who have tried or are trying with very mixed results, seemingly oblivious to why the biggest names in gaming became the biggest names. Netflix, while dabbling with console and PC games, has focused mainly on mobile, accessed directly from its app as part of your subscription - and this has borne some tidy exclusives (both developed and acquired). While I have enjoyed the likes of Poinpy and Red Dead Redemption on my phone, it is only thanks to the relatively new Game Night offerings that I've seen the potential of Netflix games on the family TV.</p>

<p>Having just finished watching Santa Clause: The Movie for the third time in two days (the odd Dudley Moore film I remembered from my childhood and suggested my kids watch, only to discover it opens with a Middle Ages pre-Santa Mr. Clause freezing to death in a snowstorm alongside his wife and reindeer having got stuck while attempting to deliver homemade presents to children in a remote village - it's fine as he is brought back to life by elves - but then does end up having to compete with an impossibly old-looking evil 40-year-old toy-manufacturing John Lithgow to win back the affections of disillusioned 80s children after Lithgow opportunistically used elven magic to create a lollipop that makes people fly after the head elf sought new employment after initiating a disastrous manufacturing switch in the North Pole, changing from elf-made to machine-made toys that all fell apart. Got it? Who doesn't love a bit of Christmas Day Santa-themed trauma?!) there was a loud call for more The Grinch. On opening Netflix a games promo appeared, and these were games we could play on the TV using our phones.</p><p>Pictionary? Yes please. The Grinch had been banished, at least for a while. My four-year-old obviously doesn't have her own phone (we're not terrible parents), but she knows how to use an iPad better than I do, so we quickly fired up a three-player game (kids together as one team) and never looked back. This kind of setup has been done before (the Jackbox games offer great fun via a phone controller), but I'd not seen this directly integrated into a popular streaming service. Availability matters a lot, and the Netflix home screen has a lot of power. There's nothing new in Pictionary on Netflix, it's super stripped down to the basics of drawing and guessing with three categories for the words, but it was an instant and long-lasting hit in my house pretty much because of this ease of play. Lego Party, a game that's a more traditional console gaming experience, was also a hit, albeit one that was a little too much for my four-year-old to manage. Boggle, the classic word-finding game, also worked a treat with the eldest, even tapping into the Netflix world to offer avatars based on popular films and shows, such as the members of K-Pop Demon Hunters' Huntrix.</p>

<p>There are other games on offer that we're yet to try out, but these three alone must have been played for more than 10 hours in the week following Christmas. They are, and maybe I need to hand over my gamer card, also the only games I played over the holiday. Maybe this says more about me than it does Netflix, but I do think this is the right direction for the firm. Games definitely used to be more welcoming to newcomers than they are today. We had EyeToy, Buzz, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playstation-move">PlayStation Move</a>, Kinect, Wii Remotes, and plastic guitars. Sony attempted to bring some of this back with a bunch of phone-controlled games on PS4 under the PlayLink banner (I enjoyed That's You!), but these didn't really reignite the casual gaming space and fizzled out.</p>
<p>In today's world where getting attention is harder than ever, these kinds of games just fit better on Netflix - they're there to jump into if you've got 10 minutes after watching a film, but also entertaining enough that they could become game night regulars. There's no real barrier to entry, almost everyone can handle what's being asked of them, and it's all good fun. Well done Netflix, you've managed to do something the majority of other big, gaming-curious tech companies haven't - you've made me care. Let's see if anything more is built on the top of this promising start.</p>

            <p>Filming for the third season of Amazon's Fallout adaptation is kicking off sooner that we first expected.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks ago (ok, possibly slightly longer than that), the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-will-begin-filming-summer-2026-as-showrunners-want-to-get-series-back-on-air-as-soon-as-we-can">series' executive producer Jonathan Nolan said the Fallout crew hoped to start filming sometime this summer</a>, however we now know that filming is actually going to start this May. To be more specific, filming is scheduled for 1st May, in Santa Clarita.</p>

<p>Frederick E.O. Toye is once again going to be handling director duties during Fallout's third season, which according to a <a href="https://productionlist.com/filming-may-frederick-e-o-toye-direct-upcoming-series-fallout-season-3-santa-clarita-ca-united-states/">production post on Film and Television Industry Alliance</a> will bring "continuity and seasoned genre expertise" to the new episodes.</p>
<p>"Toye's contributions behind the camera have been notable across seasons one and two, providing a consistent visual and narrative rhythm that anchors the show's sprawling world," the post reads.</p>
<p>As for the California location, this is the "logical return point" for Fallout season three, as the team has already built a number of set pieces and such there, after filming moved from New York to The Golden State for the second season.</p><p>"The early May shoot date gives department heads and crew ample time to position themselves for hiring. Set builders and art departments should prepare to expand practical landscapes and terrain builds that reflect the saga's continuation through the Classic Wasteland and into new territory," the production post for Fallout season three adds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">Fallout was renewed for a third season back in May of last year</a>, months before season two made its debut. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-3-now-being-written-collaborations-between-show-and-games-discussed">Bethesda's Todd Howard confirmed the third season was already being written</a>.</p>
<p>As for season two, its episodes are currently airing weekly over on Amazon Prime. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>And as for other potential Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since we last had news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> (beyond talk of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">more crunch</a>), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s newest IP, but boss Neil Druckmann has been able to openly talk about other things, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-three-to-recast-manny">HBO's ongoing The Last of Us show</a>. Next month, however, he'll be found in the open again as he presents former partner Evan Wells with DICE's esteemed Hall of Fame Award.</p>
<p>We've learned the PlayStation veterans <a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/evan_wells_hof_29th_dice_awards.asp">will be meeting again</a> at the Aria Resort in Las Vegas on 12th February, 2026. Those who have been following the renowned studio for decades might remember Wells as one of the key creatives behind the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter series. This led to him becoming co-president of Naughty Dog in 2004. As the studio transitioned into more cinematic and blockbuster-y titles in its post-Uncharted era, he stuck around overseeing the creation and development of that series and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>. In 2023, he announced his retirement.</p>
<p>Ahead of the DICE 2026 summit, Druckmann took some time to praise Wells' leadership and celebrate what he did to make Naughty Dog one of the industry's most respected companies over many years:</p>
<blockquote>"Naughty Dog was able to create some truly incredible games and leave a lasting mark on the industry because of Evan’s unwavering leadership and the trust he placed in all of us... I know I speak for many across the industry when I congratulate Evan on this well-deserved recognition. It’s a profound honor to present him with this Hall of Fame induction."</blockquote>
<p>In the past, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences' Lifetime Achievement award has gone to names like PlayStation's Ken Kutaragi (2007), Nintendo legend Satoru Iwata (2015), and Xbox honcho <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> (2022), among many others.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, The Last of Us co-director and ex-Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/generative-ai-is-a-snake-eating-its-own-tail-says-the-last-of-us-co-director-but-the-term-ai-is-easily-misinterpreted">Bruce Straley is working on the debut game of his new studio Wildflower Interactive</a>: Coven of the Chicken Foot. He's also gone on to explain he left the PlayStation-owned studio after feeling he was "answering the same questions over and over again," which sounds like a nice way to say maybe there's life beyond cinematic action-adventure games. Intergalactic doesn't appear to be substantially altering Naughty Dog's current direction though.</p>

            <p>New games performed really well on Steam last year - notably better than the year before.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-steams-best-of-2025-revenue">Data analysed by GamesDiscoverCo</a> shows that there were more new games (classified as being released this year or the previous year) in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025?tab=2">Steam's Top 100 highest-grossing games chart</a> than last year - 31 to 24, respectively - and that games released in 2025 made collectively significantly more money than games released in other years.</p>
<p>Steam categorises games into Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze tier in terms of the money made. The Platinum tier does feature Steam's perennial juggernauts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, but the eight other Platinum games are all newly released this year.</p>
<p>They are: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Arc Raiders, Marvel Rivals, Battlefield 6, and, surprisingly, drug-pushing game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuUX7qWQvG8">Schedule 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-hit-repo-hides-real-class-and-an-understanding-of-gaming-greats-behind-its-chummy-chaos-and-crude-emojis">co-op horror game REPO</a>. Call of Duty is considered new there courtesy of technical change to using a Call of Duty app.</p>

<p>In the Gold tier, there's Borderlands 4, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Split Fiction, Elden Ring Nightrein, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion remaster, and EA Sports FC 26. In the Silver tier there's Dune: Awakening, Silksong, Civ 7, Inzoi, Delta Force, Dispatch, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Stellar Blade, Peak and Where Winds Meet.</p><p>It's an encouraging result in a market that seems to be dominated by perennial juggernauts. Just yesterday we saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-top-five-most-played-games-of-2025-are-exactly-the-same-as-2024s">PlayStation data highlight that the most played games in 2025 were exactly the same as in 2024</a> - Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5, Roblox, and Minecraft. And yes, 'most played' isn't the same as 'highest grossing', but the data paints a picture of apparent stagnation all the same - a market dominated by the endless tails of massive live service games.</p>
<p>In reference to the Steam data, GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless said: "It's more front-loaded for recency than we expected. Why would this be? It's possible that 2025 was just a super-strong year for new games." It's also possible that perennial sellers had heavy discounts so weren't able to take as much money as full-priced games. "It's probably.. a combo of these things?" he reasoned.</p>

<p>Other tidbits from GameDiscoverCo's analysis show Warframe and Dead by Daylight - both games that are more than 10 years old now - staying strong as Gold-tier revenue-makers for the past four years. Elsewhere, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to show remarkable staying power as a Gold-tier game (the previous two years it was Platinum), as does Cyberpunk 2077, which is still Gold-tier five years after release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">CD Projekt Red announced recently that Cyberpunk 2077 had sold 35 million copies</a>.</p>
<p>Which new games will feature this time next year, I wonder...</p>

            <p>More than five years after its troubled original release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> continues to be one of the most relevant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">open-world RPGs</a> of the modern era. Much of its success comes from the believable relationships it quickly establishes between its key characters and V, but the pre-disaster prologue with preem choom Jackie was never meant to go on for too long.</p>
<p>"It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff," said Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27">on his BlueSky account</a> on 5th January, after a few too many comments from the community on how a longer Act 1 alongside doomed partner-in-crime Jackie Welles would've made the game better.</p>
<p>Considering how long <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-walkthrough-main-story-quest-list-main-missions-order-5077">the prologue</a> already felt - though it's topped by other recent sandbox games' early hours for sure - we’re inclined to agree with Sarzynski here, though we also understand where some players are coming from. Cyberpunk 2077 gets quite a bit of their time together out of the way with a quick montage that shows us some highlights of their chaotic gigs and good times at bars before things take a darker turn. And, in case you were wondering, the "half-year montage is not cut content".</p>
<p>"The game cannot be infinite," the creative director also stated. "I think we struck a good balance." After all, Cyberpunk 2077's early beats were never meant to represent the far more open experience that kicks off when the Relic comes into play and we get an unhealthy dose of Keanu Reeves injected into our head. You can roam around for a bit with Jackie, sure, but most players would agree it's more of an on-rails introduction to Night City's underworld and Arasaka's family drama.</p><p>In any case, the fact people are still yapping about whether we should've had more time with Jackie or not after half a decade and many discussions about CDPR essentially finishing the game for real in late 2023 is yet another reminder Cyberpunk 2077 has the staying power we rarely see in the single-player space. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">it’s performed even better than The Witcher 3</a>.</p>

            <p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded developer 1047 Games has shared some words regarding how its rereleased and repackaged game is doing over on Valve's PC platform, stating: "Steam Charts don't measure fun."</p>
<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded started life as Splitgate 2. However, Splitgate 2 as it was failed to hit the mark, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">1047 Games took the game back to beta in July of last year</a>, which resulted in a number of layoffs at the studio. In November, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-take-two-coming-next-month-as-1047-games-announces-relaunch-for-its-free-to-play-shooter">Splitgate 2 would relaunch in December</a>. A new name - Splitgate Arena Reloaded - was then revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-returning-to-beta-splitgate-2-is-coming-back-with-a-new-name">along with a relaunch date of 17th December</a>.</p>

<p>Since that relaunch less than a month ago, many picked up that Splitgate Arena Reloaded still wasn't bringing in big numbers over on Steam. As our Connor reported just this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-controversial-marketing-campaign-splitgate-2-fails-to-find-an-audience-despite-two-official-launches">the relaunch saw an initial peak concurrent player count of 2,297</a> on the PC platform, before that number dropped down to a relatively stable concurrent count of around 1,000 players in more recent days. It is unclear what its console player base is.</p>
<p>1047 Games has now addressed these Steam figures, saying you can't simply equate player numbers on a single platform with the amount of fun that is being had. "They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment," the Splitgate Arena Reloaded team said.</p>
<p>"They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale)."</p>
<p>Continuing, the developer said: "Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible."</p><p>It went on to thank Splitgate's community of players for their passion and feedback, before closing with an encouragement for others to give the game a go and "form your own opinion" on the relaunch. "To everyone who hasn't played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been... A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it."</p>

<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded is hosting a selection of competitive events in an effort to drum up interest. This includes a $5,000 tournament with Splitgate content creators, as well as a $25,000 community challenge. There's also a welcome back event, in which players can earn the T200 character skin, a popular relic of the original Splitgate.</p>
<p>Will this second go at things still yet be the time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">Splitgate makes FPS great again</a>? We will see.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Embark Studios' founder Patrick Soderlund has stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, a game initially meant to release as a free-to-play title, launched as a $40 premium price point in part due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s approach.</p>
<p>Speaking to Gamesbeat, Soderlund stated: "It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit'</p>
<p>Soderlund continued: "We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."</p>

</figure>
<p>A further reason why the $40 price point was decided was a desire to sell the game without its cost acting as an "offender" to anyone, given that Arc Raiders is a purely multiplayer game without a campaign. Soderlund remarked: "We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be."</p><p>It appears to have been the correct decision. According to analyst estimates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders recently passed the 12m sales milestone</a>, bringing in over $350m in revenue. It also was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">one of Steam's best selling games over the Christmas period</a>, thanks in part to a well-timed discount as well as an ongoing wave of positive word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>Part of this word of mouth surrounds the interesting social dynamics at play in Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">with a significant portion of the community opting out of PvP gameplay where they can</a>. This, supported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">by matchmaking that takes aggressiveness into account</a>, has resulted in a surprisingly friendly extraction shooter for many players.</p>

            <p>The Duffer brothers, creators of Stranger Things, have said the final battle of the TV series was partially inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. Matt Duffer was apparently playing the game while devising the showdown.</p>
<p>Note: there are spoilers for the final battle ahead.</p>
<p>"We were thinking about D&amp;D and I was playing Baldur's Gate 3 at the time," <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/">Duffer told Variety</a>, "and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat [the mind flayer] was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realised — either through self-acceptance or they've resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they're absolutely primed. They're the ultimate team, and it's the party working all together to defeat this thing.</p>
<p>"And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that's where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons and something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>. Because that's how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle."</p><p>The final battle of Stranger Things pits nearly the entire cast of goodies against a colossal spidery crab monster in the wasteland of Dimension X. This is the physical manifestation of the shadowy mind flayer we see repeatedly through the series, and which Henry Creel, AKA Vecna, partners with - he takes up residence literally inside the beast.</p>
<p>Links to Baldur's Gate 3 are to be expected of course, with both entertainment properties being heavily rooted in, or based upon, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and both revolving around a mind flayer plot. In Stranger Things it's more euphemistic, however, used as a kind of lingo the central characters - the kids - apply to strange enemies they face. In BG3 you face an actual mind flayer threat, coincidentally also having to destroy the mega-mind controlling it (which isn't a giant spidery crab).</p>
<p>Whether Matt Duffer played Baldur's Gate 3 for inspiration or for entertainment purposes is unclear - the interview doesn't touch upon it - but I expect it's a bit of both. The Duffer brothers have said before that they aren't, despite appearances, long-serving D&amp;D fans - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXSsXbFfwXU">they didn't grow up playing it</a>. Perhaps BG3 was a more approachable way into learning the game.</p>
<p>Matt Duffer also didn't clarify which other video game references were in the final Stranger Things battle, though if you ask me, that mind flayer spider crab thing looks a lot like a corpser from the Gears of War series. It being a giant enemy crab also brings to mind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-genjidaysofblade-ps3">Sony's infamous 'giant enemy crab' meme from Genji: Days of the Blade</a>.</p>

            <p>The top five games played on the PlayStation in 2025 by US players were exactly the same as in 2024, according to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker.</p>
<p>This information, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">published on social media by senior director at Circana Mat Piscatella</a>, states that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> took the top spot in 2025, followed by Call of Duty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, then Minecraft. This is interesting as this list is an exact replication of the top five games played on US PlayStations in 2024.</p>
<p>Looking at the top five games played on US Xbox's in 2025, there's a slight different in the order of the games which take the top five spots, but the games themselves remain the same. In 2025, Fortnite took the number one spot, followed by Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, and Roblox. Whereas in 2024, Call of Duty was number one, followed by Fortnite, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, then Roblox at number five.</p>

<p>It's safe to say that, judging by these stats, the upper echelon of popular games right now are somewhat cemented in place right now. With the biggest live service games bringing in absurd profit and player engagement metrics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">it's a tricky task to break into the space and survive</a> let alone thrive. A year after its launch, <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20696836/epic-apple-trial-epic-games-exhibit.pdf">Fortnite made over $5bn,</a> and has shown little sign of slowing down ever since.</p><p>That should provide some context as to why developers keep attempting to make big live service hits, as if they can catch on the potential profits are staggering. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders would be an example of this going well</a>, while examples of these sorts of games not catching on are far more numerous. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-big-team-pvp-warhaven-announces-closure-just-4-months-after-its-early-access-launch">Just look at Warhaven</a>, which shut down only four months after its early access release.</p><p>

Will 2026's top five list be different? Even with Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">having hit a bit of a roadbump with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> performing exceptionally well, it's likely the top five list itself will stay very similar. If <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Grand Theft Auto VI wasn't delayed to November</a> perhaps we'd have seen a passing of the torch to the sequel, but oh well.

            <p>Amazon has announced more cast members joining its live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Renowned actress, beloved Faithful and nervous farter from last year's Celebrity Traitors Celia Imrie has joined already announced Tomb Raider cast members Sophie Turner, Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver and Martin Bobb-Semple.</p>
<p>Other newly announced cast members include Jack Bannon, John Heffernan, Bill Paterson and August Wittgenstein, to name just four.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>So, who is playing who? Well, along with Turner as Lara Croft, the following cast are confirmed in canon roles from the Tomb Raider video games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Bobb-Semple is <strong>Zip</strong>, Lara Croft's long-standing tech support and friend (many suspected this is who Bobb-Semple would be playing) </li>
<li>Jason Isaacs is <strong>Atlas DeMornay</strong>, Lara's uncle</li>
<li>Bill Paterson is <strong>Winston</strong>, the long-standing Croft family butler</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the following roles are new to the Tomb Raider universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack Bannon is <strong>Gerry</strong>, Lara's personal pilot and snack collector</li>
<li>John Heffernan is <strong>David</strong>, an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara's unusual world</li>
<li>Celia Imrie is <strong>Francine</strong>, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne</li>
<li>Paterson Joseph is <strong>Thomas Warner</strong>, a senior government official brought in to clean up an almighty mess</li>
<li>Sasha Luss is <strong>Sasha</strong>, a fierce, deeply competitive new adversary of Lara's</li>
<li>Juliette Motamed is <strong>Georgia</strong>, a devoted, by-the-books curator at the British Museum, dedicated to the "proper" preservation of history</li>
<li>Sigourney Weaver is <strong>Evelyn Wallis</strong>, a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's talents</li>
<li>August Wittgenstein is <strong>Lukas</strong>, an illegal raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these descriptions, I am going to say Lukas is a love interest in a similar vein to Daniel Craig's Alex West from the first Angelina Jolie-fronted Tomb Raider film.</p>
<p>I am curious to see what Isaacs' Uncle Atlus will be like. The last time I remember hearing his name pop up was in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>: Blood Ties DLC, when he was trying to get Croft Manor from Lara. It didn't sound like he and Lara exactly saw eye to eye. Also, I hope we don't get too bogged down in any Daddy issues, as I am going to assume Lara is once again an orphan in the upcoming series.</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider has always been defined by bold storytelling and unforgettable characters, and these new cast members bring incredible depth and gravitas to the series,"  <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner">said Peter Friedlander</a>, head of Amazon MGM Studios. "With talents like Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs joining the ensemble, we're elevating this world in exciting new ways, and can't wait for our global Prime Video audience to experience this next chapter of Tomb Raider."</p><p>Weaver previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>. Meanwhile, Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>Filming for Tomb Raider is expected to kick off later this month, on 19th January.</p>

</figure>
<p>As well as Amazon's show, the game side of the business is currently collaborating with Crystal Dynamics on an all-new Tomb Raider known as Catalyst. Revealed last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Tomb Raider: Catalyst sends Lara to Northern India</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">takes place some time after series entry Underworld</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-newest-lara-croft-is-frightened-about-losing-the-role-after-being-absolutely-blindsided-by-perfect-dark-cancellation">Alix Wilton Regan will portray Lara in both Catalyst and next year's Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>, which is a remake of the first game.</p>

            <p>Troy Baker, one of the most well known actors working in video games, believes generative AI could have a positive effect overall on performing arts. Baker thinks it'll cause a reaction whereby people will seek out "authentic" experiences more - live shows, live theatre - and turn away from "gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror".</p>
<p>"AI can create content but it cannot create art," <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we">Baker told The Game Business</a> in an interview. "And the reason why is because that invariably requires the human experience.</p>
<p>"There's a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it's that it requires artists. People go, 'look what AI can do.' It's like, 'yeah, okay. I see what it's capable of doing. It doesn't matter.' And we don't need to diminish it, we don't need to denigrate it, we don't need to demonise it. We need to just go, 'okay, it's there'.</p>
<p>"For the last 2,500 years since we first set foot out onto a stage, humans have been doing this. So maybe we trust that. Maybe we trust that this will be part of the process."</p>
<p>The fear comes from looking at AI from a business point of view, he said. From that perspective, yes, AI is threatening. "There is no doubt that AI can make content way better than humans," Baker said. "By far, it can crank it out no problem." But that's where the adverse reaction will come from.</p><p>"What I see happening is that this birth of AI, and this burgeoning industry of it, is actually going to drive people to the authentic. And we're going to see opportunities of, 'I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.' 'I want to see theater'. 'I want to read books'. 'I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror'.</p>
<p>"I think that it's a good thing. It's a revolution."</p>
<p>Troy Baker, whose performances in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> last year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> earned him award nominations, is no stranger to dabbling in controversial new tech. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-voice-actor-troy-baker-is-now-promoting-nfts">Baker partnered with an NFT company</a> that was making what it claimed were the world's first voice <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> - voices you'd own to create content with. Baker's provocative marketing resulted in a fierce backlash and he backed off a bit, but the idea itself doesn't sound far removed from <a href="https://artlist.io/voice-over?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=21312164614&amp;utm_content=181685845406&amp;utm_term=elevenlabs&amp;keyword=elevenlabs&amp;ad=774546804639&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21312164614&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACuwFJ3tEZLqB63gRxh9YtijrhqoX&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EoMuf-EoB1zrFJuepfrM3VN8tZh-XFA7o1IZyYg_5eyStbfw5zRM8kaAtihEALw_wcB">companies like Elevenlabs that are training gen-AIs on actors' voices</a> now.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Troy Baker will also star in the vintage Disney noir shooter Mouse: PI for Hire, which is due this year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>

<p>So, what of those games? Well, I know our Ian was very taken with Atomfall, and he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-let-me-bash-a-mans-head-in-with-a-cricket-bat-while-he-was-having-a-wee-and-i-think-i-love-it">celebrated being able to bop a chap over the head with a cricket bat as the poor blighter was having a wee against a wall</a>.</p>
<p>"If you can get over a difficult start and fancy a lean take on the survival genre, Atomfall delivers an intriguing tale worth discovering," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-review">Eurogamer's Atomfall review</a>.</p>
<p>Another favourite, at least with me, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>. "Capcom's follow-up to its first-person Resi reinvention is a fantastic horror romp - for its first half, at least." reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror">our Resident Evil Village review</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> was a bit hit and miss for many of us here at Eurogamer. I had a decent enough time with it, others not so much. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>.</p>

<p>Along with the requirements, the studio has announced a partnership with Nvidia for 007 First Light, saying the power of GeForce's latest RTX technologies will allow the team to "deliver a PC experience that matches the level of quality we believe the Bond franchise deserves".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/merry-christmas-james-bond-game-007-first-light-has-been-delayed">007 First Light is set to arrive on 27th May</a>. As well as PC, the game will also be available across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox ROG Ally X, Xbox ROG Ally and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At The Game Awards last month, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-unveils-lenny-kravitzs-villainous-side">announced that rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz will star in 007 First Light as black market dealer Bawma</a>.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> has released its latest Savage-tier raid today, pushing the game's best and brightest to race through this new challenge group content to earn powerful loot and see which region can take it down first. However, for Americans, this is proving difficult due to ongoing DDOS attacks and server outages.</p>
<p>With the release of patch 7.4 last month, players were welcomed back to the game with a bunch of new content to pour over. The Savage difficulty for the Heavyweight raid, which was delayed until after the holiday season, has just come out resulting in the usual rush to see which team can take it down first.</p>
<p>The problem comes from DDOS attacks. American players, obviously present on different servers than like-minded raiders in other regions, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1q5f3a8/3_ddos_attacks_within_30_minutes_on_savage_launch/">are facing a spree of connection issues</a> as the servers are bombarded with digital assaults from nefarious parties. Checking the FF14 server status page, <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/worldstatus/">you can see a sizable portion of America servers under strain</a>.</p>

<p>This has resulted in chaos for the race for world first Heavyweight Savage clears, as American teams are scrambling to contend with these extra hurdles. Players looking to temporarily hop to different servers, such as Oceania's Materia server cluster, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/elanortrevelyan.bsky.social/post/3mbqtnxkwgk2i">aren't safe from these attacks either</a>. The only way to dodge such attacks at this time appears to be a full-on server transfer to another region, which would add additional latency to play which top-end players tackling difficult content wouldn't want anyway. A messy situation.</p><p>Funnily enough, it appears as though Japanese servers are largely doing just fine during the initial release of Savage Heavyweights so far! This is both good and bad. It's good because these server outages are annoying and the less people experience them the better. It's bad because, from the perspective of competitive raiders looking to race each other to a world first clear, it adds a degree of unfairness to the mix. It takes what should be a joyful moment and sours it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this Savage raid release isn't the first time problems like these have hit Final Fantasy 14. In fact,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1prw7jp/ongoing_ddos_issues_megathread/"> it was only around two weeks ago when the American servers suffered several DDOS attacks</a>. For Western FF14 players, this is a problem in desperate need of addressing, especially now that it's impacted one of the more climactic moments in the Dawntrail expansion's life cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/95416d3ef7713bab8490aab037051362b63a074b">A short post on the Final Fantasy 14 website</a> has acknowledged the problem, and states that it's being looked into. However, given the time sensitive nature of these Savage raid races, it's possible for the most dedicated FF14 players, the damage has been done.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-patented-an-ai-gaming-ghost-that-will-play-playstation-games-for-you-when-you-get-stuck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A patent filed by Sony over a year ago has resurfaced, and shows the company has ideas for an AI 'ghost' that could assist players if they get stuck in a game.</p>
<p>The aforementioned patent, which was recently noticed by <a href="https://www.allaboutai.com/ai-news/sony-ai-ghost-player-patent/">allaboutAI</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, describes an "overlay" version of a player's character. When in use, this overlay character would be able to demonstrate actions, such as how to solve a puzzle or by providing "example controller input button sequences", which would in turn allow a player to then progress with the game.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In some cases, an AI 'ghost' could also have a conversation with the player's character and give some "guidance or instruction" about what to do. Other times, the ghost could complete a section for the player. It sounds like an evolution of PlayStation's Game Help on PS5, which offers users tips and guides via videos and images on screen.</p>
<p>An image within the patent also describes mode switching, which would encapsulate four different options for users to be able to choose from. These are: Story Mode, Combat Mode, Exploration Mode and Full Game Mode .</p>
<p>"Although video game technology has seen many advances, some players find themselves in need of assistance. Games become very complicated, so players who are not experts oftentimes quit playing or find it hard to complete tasks," <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">the filing reads</a>. "Players are able to do research for the game or even look up prior gameplays on internet sites, but that process is time consuming and many times not very relevant to tasks and/or scenarios currently being encountered by the player."</p>
<p>Should these AI Ghost helpers become a reality, it appears that they would be trained on existing footage of any given PlayStation game.</p>



<p>Assistance in games is, of course, nothing new. As I have already mentioned, the PS5 has Game Help, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-soon-add-ai-copilot-to-minecraft-offering-real-time-advice">Microsoft has its own Copilot AI feature</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, games more broadly often include a range of features to make them more accessible for as wide an audience as possible. This includes everything from adjustable difficulty levels to controller remapping, colour-blind modes and in-game hint systems (I personally quite liked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returning-to-monkey-island-with-its-legendary-creators">book that Guybrush had tucked away in Return to Monkey Island</a>, but there are plenty of other examples out there).</p>

<p>As for AI, it remains an area of heated debate within the industry. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. That number is now likely to be higher, and a more recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Last year, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>

            <p>The PC graphics market might be in peril in hardware terms, with prices spiraling and availability inconsistent, but on the software side things are at least reliably moving forward - with Nvidia today announcing the latest upgrade to its DLSS technology.</p>
<p>DLSS 4.5 is shadow dropping today, and is already available across a suite of hundreds of compatible PC games. It'll offer performance enhancements to a variety of games across a wide gamut of Nvidia gaming hardware.</p>
<p>If you're among the uninitiated, DLSS stands for Deep Learning Super Sampling, and is an AI-powered piece of tech aimed at increasing game image quality and performance. This is, it has to be said, one of the more readily accepted pieces of AI used in and around video games - used to stretch your hardware further rather than replace the work of any humans.</p>
<p>The way it works is complex, obviously, but it can be summed up fairly simply: DLSS initially renders a game at a lower resolution - for the sake of this example let's say 720p rather than 1440p. Rendering at a lower res in turn allows the game to display at higher frame rates thanks to the lowered visual fidelity. But then that super sampling kicks in - using a custom-trained neutral network to upscale the 720p output image to your target resolution (in this case, 1440p). The result is you get the 720p frame rate, but you get a visual fidelity and image quality that is very close indeed to a native 1440p output.</p><p>DLSS is Nvidia's proprietary version of this tech, but other versions exist. PlayStation 5 has PSSR, its equivalent. AMD PC GPUs have FidelityFX Super Resolution. Nvidia has always sat at the cutting edge of this technology, however - and with an Nvidia chip inside, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> actually uses a version of Nvidia's DLSS too - so upgrades to DLSS have potential implications there.</p>
<p>This tech is useful at a base line, but it can also be especially handy in games that make use of graphical features that absolutely tank performance, like real-time ray tracing. In the end, there is always an argument to be made about untouched rendering - raw rasterisation - versus these 'processed' images, and if a 'pure' and pristine frame is better. But for many users, this upscaling is unnoticeable - and indeed, on consoles many users are playing without even realising their games are being AI-upscaled from lower resolutions.</p>

<p>DLSS 4.5 is Nvidia's latest evolution, and is as previously mentioned out today. DLSS 4.5 is centered around two upgrades to the tech. First up is the second generation version of the 'Super Resolution Transformer'.</p>
<p>We could get into this at length, but in short the Super Resolution Transformer was a new version of the upscaler introduced in the last version of DLSS - though users still broadly have the choice between the old technique and the new transformer-based model. Each had its pros and cons. But with this second iteration of the transformer model, Nvidia now seems confident that it is hands-down the best they have to offer, with the new version trained much more extensively.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From this Nvidia says it sees better image quality - with more stability, reduced ghosting, and smoother edges. The transformer is now less likely to be tripped up by fast-moving action or smaller bits of detail in the distance. This is largely consistent with the gradual upgrades DLSS has seen over the years.</p><p>The new super resolution transformer model is fully-compatible with the GeForce RTX 40 and 50 series graphics cards, but if you have an older piece of hardware there is still a benefit to you. GeForce RTX 30 and 20 series cards can <em>also</em> enjoy some of the benefits of DLSS 4.5 - though due to differences in the hardware, those cards will see a less impressive performance increase - but an increase nevertheless. Older cards from six or seven years ago being included in the party can only be a good thing, especially with upgrade prices presently so ridiculous.</p>
<p>The second and more controversial element of this upgrade is to the Multi Frame Generation feature, which was also first introduced in base DLSS4. This one requires a tiny bit of additional explanation.</p>
<p>If you didn't follow the RTX 50-series reviews, MFG is exactly what it sounds like - generating all-new frames for games from scratch. To cut an extremely long story short, frame generation involves not just upscaling frames created by the game to get smoother performance… but also creating <em>whole new frames</em> with AI. Basically, this means Nvidia's technology looks at two frames of your game, then generates and inserts an extra frame that is visually the 'midpoint' between them, slipping it into the flow to create a higher frame rate and a smoother-feeling image.</p>
<p>This has been controversial, creating a divide between those who feel 'fake frames' are an equally fake way of generating 'performance' from expensive graphics cards, and those who just feel like this feature is part of the future march of gaming graphics tech. Certainly it is useful for trying to drive games up to 120fps or even 240fps for higher-end displays.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Multi frame generation is exactly what it sounds like, generating <em>multiple</em> frames rather than just one. This is where the upgrade comes in: the first version of MFG topped out at generating a maximum of four frames between each game frame - but the DLSS 4.5 version of this technology ups that to six frames.</p>
<p>In real terms, this could turn a 60fps base frame rate into 360fps. Which sounds ridiculous when you write it out like that - but that is theoretically the maths that this technology can achieve.</p>
<p>Added alongside the 6X MFG is a new dynamic setting for frame generation. This basically means rather than select 2, 3, 4, or 6X MFG, you can simply tell your GPU a target FPS - at which point your GPU will automatically adjust the MFG rate as necessary to hit that target.</p>
<p>The 6X MFG is limited only to RTX 50-series GPUs, however. It's set to release at some point this Spring.</p>
<p>All of this naturally requires access to an Nvidia 'RTX' GPU, and for the games you're playing to support Nvidia's DLSS technology. But Nvidia is quick to point out that over 250 games and apps support DLSS4, with 80 percent of the top-twenty new games of 2025 (by some metric - they did not explain that one) supporting DLSS4. This tracks, as well - if you buy a new PC game, it probably supports it - be that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, or Oblivion Remastered, or Battlefield, or Game of the Year nominees like Expedition 33 and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p><p>At a CES where Nvidia has seemed largely focused on broader AI developments, DLSS stands as the one area where the company continues to show its gaming chops, striving forwards with improvements that gamers can actually see, touch, and use. It's good stuff. If you can get your hands on the hardware, anyway.</p>

            <p>An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> player calling for help while playing the game had their door kicked in by a concerned neighbour, who thought their wails were a sign of real-world distress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/">User Dreamthorp on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a> was house-sitting for a friend and decided to boot up some Arc Raiders. While playing ,they claim to have been calling to their squadmates for help when a nearby neighbour heard the commotion. Fearing the worst, they came to the rescue, kicking the door.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the door didn't break thanks to the two deadbolts keeping it locked and secure. Dreamthorp claims that the friend they were house-sitting finds the whole situation funny, and the whole story has a happy ending, with Dreamthorp posting a picture of a six-pack of Shiners left at the neighbour's door as thanks.</p>

<p>Arc Raiders continues its hot streak as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">both a top seller over the Christmas holiday</a> and one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">of the most popular games out right now</a>, players remain engaged with its blend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">hyper aggressive extraction-style PvP gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">the interesting social dynamics present in an otherwise perilous experience</a>.</p><p>As for what's to come in 2026 for Arc Raiders? There's still little in terms of official confirmation on what's coming up for the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-snow-map-condition-flickering-flames">following its winter Cold Snap event</a>. With the year well underway, there's no doubt big news for Arc Raiders is just around the corner.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Rick Lane wrote: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> David Rosen, the co-founder of Sega - a key person involved in so much of the company's early arcade and console success - has passed away. He was 95 years old. He died on Christmas Day at his home in the Hollywood Hills part of Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.replaymag.com/segas-dave-rosen-passes-on-christmas-day-in-l-a/">RePlay magazine reports</a>.</p>
<p>Rosen, an American, found himself in Japan following the Korean war, in which he served as a US Air Force pilot. Rosen's business ventures began by importing photo booths from the US to serve an ID card demand at the time. From there, he moved to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, which led to him collaborating with Nihon Goraku Bussan, another coin-op importer, whose business Service Games was shortened to Sega, to mark the beginning of a new joint venture, reports <a href="http://i/">The Guardian</a>.</p><p>Sega's gaming business began in arcades, of course, but when Rosen returned to the US in the 80s, he had eyes on the emerging home console market. An early attempt didn't get very far but the 1986 Master System did, especially in Europe and South America. And Rosen noticed that the success was driven by the older-aged games, the Golden Axes and Shinobis, which contrasted starkly with the brighter and more family friendly Mario games Nintendo was pushing.</p>
<p>This led to the edgier and beloved Mega Drive or Genesis (renamed so as to appear as a fresh start in the US), which launched at the end of the 80s ('88 in Japan, '89 in the US, and '90 in Europe), that cemented Sega as a household gaming name.</p>
<p>Rosen stayed on at Sega until 1996, leaving two years before Sega would launch the Dreamcast - a console that didn't sell well enough and ultimately led to the company bowing out of gaming hardware to focus on making games instead.</p>
<p>Rest in peace, David Rosen. What a legacy.</p>

            <p>The team over at Xbox has added two previously unannounced games to its Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>Game Pass subscribers can now play <strong>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</strong> and <strong>Brews and Bastards</strong> through the service. These two titles were not previously said to be coming when Microsoft laid out its most recent Game Pass line-up plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> Enhanced Edition and Brews and Bastards <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-december">join the likes of Dome Keeper and other recent Xbox Game Pass additions</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is a remaster of the unsettling puzzle platformer, which tells the tale of a yellow-raincoated girl named Six, as she attempts to escape The Maw. That is to say, a strange underwater vessel inhabited by a multitude of bizarre residents.</p>
<p>The adventure was warmly received on release, with Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a "masterpiece of meat and malice" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-review">Eurogamer's Little Nightmares review</a>.</p>
<p>Brews and Bastards, meanwhile, is described as an "intoxicating" dungeon crawler, which developer Mune Studio says is "overflowing with action-packed combat, potent brews and outlandish bosses". Players will need to choose an "inebriated" hero to then make their way through "hordes of drunken demons" as they try to search for the stolen Brew Stone.</p><p>As well as these two new Game Pass additions, Xbox has also detailed five games that will be leaving the service in the coming weeks. These are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, Road 96, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Merry and Mischievous Edition and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the most recent game from Tango Gameworks, is getting a special re-release in collaboration with Limited Run Games.</p>
<p>With pre-orders set to open from 16th January up until the 1st March, Hi-Fi Rush Rhythm Edition will feature the deluxe version of the game alongside three special DLC costumes. These costumes are the Bossplay, Traditional Garb, and Teamplay outfits. It'll be available for the Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p>
<p>Extra keen fans go opt for an even grander package with the Hi-Fi Rush Smidge Edition. This features the same Deluxe version of the game and DLC costumes, alongside a special three disc soundtrack, developer notes, and a custom box designed after the tutorial robot present in the game. There's also a bunch of in-game skins and gears for gameplay upgrades.</p>

<p>Then there's an even bolder option, the Project Armstrong Edition. This contains everything in the Smidge Edition alongside an 808 plush, a small replica of Chai's guitar, a Chai Project Armstrong pass, a glow-in-the-dark MP3 player pin, an hard cover art book, and an individually numbered certificate of authenticity.</p><p>Both the Smidge and Project Armstrong Edition will be going up for pre-order during the same period as the regular Rhythm Edition, <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/hi-fi-RUSH">and prices for each are viewable on the Limited Run website</a>. The Rhythm Edition will sell for $39.99, the Smidge Edition for $69.99, and the Project Armstrong Edition for $174.99.</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush has been through something of a journey over the past few years. Dropping suddenly back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">the game proved an exceptional release, receiving ample critical praise</a>. Its developer, Tango Gameworks, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">later shut down by Microsoft as part of widespread cuts</a>, which Xbox executive Matt Booty stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">was partly due to the studio's leadership change</a>, as Shinji Mikami left shortly after Hi-Fi Rush's release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">The studio would then be saved by Krafton</a>, who acquired the team shortly after. Late last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">Krafton would then declare itself an "AI-first company"</a>.</p>

            <p>HP is always a major player at CES in Las Vegas, and it has announced a raft of HyperX-branded and OLED-equipped gaming laptops with next-gen Intel and AMD processors - including one it claims is the "world's most powerful gaming laptop with fully internal cooling". HP has also unveiled a series of (mostly) OLED gaming monitors, including a tantalising 34-inch 360Hz ultra-wide.</p>
<p>HP is also launching a small collection of PC and console peripherals to accompany their new machines, including in-ear headsets, keyboards and a fight stick. These include some interesting options that set a promising tone for 2026. </p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Omen Max 16, Omen 16 and Omen 15 laptops</strong></h2>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>HP's Omen laptops have continued to garner largely positive reviews since they launched in 2023, and now new generation models have broken cover at CES. The flagship HyperX Omen Max 16 looks particularly interesting, with a high-end spec sheet that tops out with an RTX 5090 24GB laptop graphics card and a next-gen Intel processor, consuming up to 300W of power - up 50W from the prior-gen design. HP claim that's the fastest gaming laptop on the market, barring ones that rely on external CPU or GPU cooling. Given how draining this laptop could be at full bore, it's only natural that it's fed by a redesigned 460W GaN charger. For context, that's three times more wattage than the fastest MacBook Pro charger, allowing the laptop to reach 50 percent from empty in around 30 minutes.</p><p>This laptop is also the first Omen laptop to carry the HyperX branding. Over the next year, HP is going to be moving all of its gaming PCs under the HyperX umbrella, with the Omen Max 16 being the first.</p>
<p>Other highlights from the Omen Max 16 include a 16-inch 2560x1600 OLED display rated for 240Hz play, a 1000Hz keyboard (a 4x faster polling rate than prior models) and a triple-fan cooling system. There's also AI software, as is apparently required for CES announcements, which is meant to smartly adjust system, hardware and game settings to attain the best balance of performance, fidelity and noise.</p>
<p>Finally, configurations are available with up to 64GB of DDR5 RAM and 2TB of PCIe 5.0 NVMe storage, with recent component price surges ensuring that these models will cost an arm and a leg. Thankfully, more modest configurations with RTX 5070 Ti or 5080 GPUs, 16 or 32GB of memory and 512GB or 1TB of storage are also available, though as with all of HP's announcements, no pricing information has been provided.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>That's a clean-looking laptop. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HP/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The vanilla HyperX Omen 16 looks like a more mainstream option at the same 16-inch size, with a wider range of current and next-gen AMD and Intel processors paired with RTX 5060 or RTX 5070 graphics solutions. The Omen 16 therefore tops out at 200W of total platform power, with a proportionately smaller battery and charger. Interestingly, one model supports an 8000Hz keyboard polling rate, something I'm surprised isn't available on the Omen 16 Max; the only other notable difference is that the 2560x1600 display is limited to 165Hz versus the 240Hz on the Max model. Expect a better value proposition here, even if you're missing out on blistering-edge performance.</p><p>The Omen 15 is likely to be the most popular offering, with an even wider range of configurations available that top out at 170W of combined CPU and GPU power. This time, some 15 different next-gen Intel (and some AMD) processors are paired with RTX 5050, 5060 or 5070 graphics cards. Memory maxes out at 48GB, storage at 1TB and screens range from a 2880x1800 120Hz OLED to a more mainstream 1920x1200 165Hz IPS display. Once again, an 8000Hz polling rate keyboard is available for minimising input lag on some models, while Omen AI optimisations are available on every variant.</p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Omen OLED 34, OLED 27q, OLED 27qs and 24 G2 gaming monitors</strong></h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>While the OLED 34 is the only one to feature a next-gen panel, the smaller options are worth considering too - especially for gaming. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>HP is going (almost) all-in on OLED gaming monitors this year, with three new OLED models and a single smaller IPS screen.</p>
<p>The flagship is the HyperX Omen OLED 34, a 3440x1440 360Hz ultra-wide monitor. Ultra-wides of this size and resolution previously topped out at 240Hz, so the OLED 34 ought to be an even better choice for playing the sorts of fast-paced esports titles that can conceivably maintain this high of a frame-rate.</p><p>The Omen OLED 34 is built around Samsung Display's new 34-inch "V-Stripe" QD-OLED panel. This next-gen screen follows LG Display's lead in moving to a vertical RGB stripe instead of the triangular subpixel arrangement found in the previous four QD-OLED generations. That ought to improve the clarity of fine elements like text, one of the very few weaknesses of OLED panels and one of the major reasons they're not as keenly recommended for productivity work as they are for playing games or watching videos. Subpar text rendering is especially noticeable on displays with relatively low pixel density values, and a 34-inch 1440p ultra-wide definitely qualifies. The screen also appears less purple under bright light than prior generation QD-OLED panels, can produce brighter highlights and is more resistant to scratches. </p>

<p>The Omen OLED 34 also boasts factory colour calibration (with a quoted average DeltaE value of less than 1.0), nearly complete coverage of the DCI P3 and Adobe RGB colour spaces (99 percent and 96 percent respectively), and the rare ability to change OSD settings from within Windows, all of which are nice additions for colour-sensitive work. If you normally work on a laptop, you'll also be glad to hear that the Omen OLED 34 supports up to 100W of USB-C charging and comes with a two-device KVM. Finally, the OLED 34 comes with a three-year warranty that covers burn-in, and HP has also shored up their burn-in and colour shift countermeasures under the "OLED CoreProtect" moniker.</p>
<p>OLED may not be the default choice for productivity, but as someone that does mix in writing, coding and photo editing amongst longer bouts of gaming, these improvements (especially the new subpixel structure) do sound appealing.</p>
<p>The HyperX Omen OLED 27q and Omen OLED 27qs are both built around 27-inch 2560x1440 panels, with the 27q clocked at a modest 240Hz and the 27qs at a blistering 500Hz. The more expensive model also benefits from a brighter display (rated for at least 500 nits in HDR), with the same excellent colour gamut coverage, factory colour calibration and other productivity-minded features as the OLED 34.</p><p>Finally, the Omen 24 G2 is the firm's new budget option, with a solid 24-inch 1920x1080 IPS panel clocked at 180Hz. This looks like a Fast IPS panel, with a quoted 1ms GtG response time, making it a good all-rounder for gaming and content creation at a significantly lower price than the OLEDs that make up the rest of the new lineup.</p>
<h2><strong>HyperX Origins 2 and Eve 1800 keyboards, Cloud Earbuds III and III S, Clutch Tachi fight stick</strong></h2>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>It's nice to see the vintage 1800 form factor appear in mainstream keyboards. | <span>Image credit: <cite>HP</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rounding out the announcements, HP unveiled a small collection of PC and console peripherals. The highlight for me is an Xbox-compatible fight stick, the Clutch Tachi, which uses trendy TMR switches, sports light-up pudding keycaps and can be customised with 3D-printed parts, like the Omen 34 and Omen 27qs monitors above. It also supports four SOCD modes, allowing you to set up exactly what happens when up and down or left and right inputs are sent simultaneously.</p>
<p>HP is also going magnetic with one of its keyboards, the Origins 2 Pro 65, which allows it to offer the usual raft of FPS-focused features like rapid trigger and SOCD. If you don't need that tech, you can opt for the cheaper but equally compact Origins 2 65 - or the larger Origins 2 1800 with a more compacted layout that retains all keys. Both of these use standard mechanical switches with acoustic improvements, support up to 8K polling, and can be customised with frosted cases, replacement switches and keycaps. There's even a membrane-based 1800 layout board, the Eve 1800, which probably won't be ideal for FPS but does at least come with some nifty features, such as 10-zone RGB lighting and dedicated media buttons along the left side.</p><p>Rounding out the accessories is the HyperX Cloud Earbuds III, available in a vanilla model and an upgraded Cloud Earbuds III S variant. The standard option looks affordable, with a 3.5mm output and a simple in-line remote, while a collection of four silicone ear tips aim to offer a comfortable fit. The upgraded III S instead opts for a USB connection, allowing for virtual surround sound; these also come with a small carrying case and have an up-rated microphone.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>It's interesting to see that HP has turned to the HyperX brand for seemingly their whole gaming lineup these days, after acquiring the peripherals company from former owners Kingston in 2021. HP Omen definitely sounds more natural to me than "HyperX Omen", but I guess it's something I'll have to get used to. </p>

            <p>The upcoming third season of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation will feature a new actor playing WLF member Manny.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/exclusive-the-last-of-us-season-3-set-to-recast-danny-ramirez">nexuspointnews</a>, Danny Ramirez has departed the show due to scheduling conflicts. As such, the role is now being recast, though who will fill Manny's shoes is yet to be determined.</p>

<p>As well as The Last of Us, Ramirez is also known to many as Joaquin Torres/Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is due to appear in Avengers: Doomsday, as well as in the upcoming Jean-Michel Basquiat biopic Samo Lives.</p>
<p>As for Manny, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">when Ramirez was first announced to be joining The Last of Us</a>, the showrunners described his character as "a loyal soldier whose sunny outlook belies the pain of old wounds and a fear that he will fail his friends when they need him most".</p><p>Ramirez's Manny joined fellow newcomers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, Tati Gabrielle as Nora, Ariela Barer as Mel, Spencer Lord as Owen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara as Gail </a>and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Isabela Merced as Dina</a> for the second season of The Last of Us.

<p>Ramirez is not the only key team member to be leaving the show for season three. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.

            <p>Toshiyuki Itahana, character artist for the Final Fantasy series, including games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>: Dawntrail, has left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://note.com/itahana/n/n277aa9cc7148?sub_rt=share_pb">Writing to fans online</a>,  Itahana expressed that he decided to leave Square Enix last year after the 25th anniversary of the Final Fantasy series, feeling both "a strong sense of accomplishment" and that it was the "right moment" to move on.</p>
<p>Itahana revealed in the same post that he intends to move forward as a freelance illustrator and character designer, stating he's currently learning from senior freelance illustrators as well as asking fans of his to support him moving forward.</p>

<p>Itahana concluded the message by thanking fans who experienced his work so far, writing: "To everyone who played the games I worked on at Square Enix, and to all those I had the pleasure of working with over the years, thank you very much. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude, and I sincerely hope for your continued support in the future."</p><p>It's certainly an interesting time for the Final Fantasy franchise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-major-shareholder-fundamental-reassessment-final-fantasy-future">Not only have major shareholders recently urged for a reassessment of the series</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-do-you-want-to-happen-to-the-final-fantasy-franchise-youve-got-a-few-days-to-tell-square-enix-directly">Square Enix is asking fans directly what they want to see with Final Fantasy moving forward</a>. We may be in the verge of an era of great change with the series, who can say.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Itahana's departure Square Enix is waving goodbye to one of its most beloved artists. One that's likely to get a lot of work as a freelance in the future.</p>

            <p>Alicia Vikander's turn as Lara Croft in 2018's Tomb Raider adaptation is having a bit of a renaissance it seems. The film, which is largely based on the rebooted Survivor timeline, recently popped up on the Netflix top 10 films list, seven years (give or take) since its initial release.</p>
<p>Most recent Netflix data reveals Tomb Raider is sitting at number nine for global film releases, ahead of the more seasonal Jingle Bell Heist, making it one of the most watched films worldwide between 22nd and 28th December.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10">According to Netflix</a>, Tomb Raider has so far enjoyed two weeks on the streaming service's top 10 for films, with over 4m views. That equates to 8.2m hours watched.</p>
<p>The rest of the top 10 is made up of seasonal favourites such as Dr. Seuss' The Grinch or more recent releases like Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery. K Pop Demon Hunters is, of course, still in there as well.</p><p>So, why the sudden interest in Tomb Raider? Well, there are a number of factors that have likely had an impact on its renewed popularity. Netflix could have seen an uptick in Tomb Raider viewers as this year marks the series' 30th anniversary. Yep, the first Tomb Raider came out in 1996, which is wild because I am still only 21, so not sure how that works…</p>
<p>Another reason could be the announcement last month that two new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> are in the pipeline. The first, known as Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">from the ground up remake of the original Tomb Raider</a>, with Flying Wild Hog handling development with Crystal Dynamics. This chap is due to be released some time this year, though we don't have an exact date yet.</p>
<p>The second game, meanwhile, is coming from Crystal Dynamics and Amazon, and is known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst. This will be an all-new series entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">which takes place after Tomb Raider: Underworld</a> (that's the game where Lara pops along to Helheim whilst wielding Thor's hammer, Mjolnir). Catalyst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">will see the globe-trotting Lara Croft heading to Northern India</a>, and is due to be released in 2027.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikanders-tomb-raider-sequel-in-limbo-following-amazon-buyout">a sequel to Vikander's Tomb Raider film was being planned</a>. However, in 2022, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alicia-vikander-no-longer-lara-croft-as-tomb-raider-movie-series-sits-in-limbo">MGM had lost the rights to the Tomb Raider films</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Amazon is working on a live action Tomb Raider TV series, with Sophie Turner as Lara Croft. Filming is expected to kick off later this month. Other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">cast members include Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs</a>.</p>
<p>Weaver will play a character called Wallace on the show's release, and has stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> may have surpassed 12m sales at the start of 2026, according to video game industry analysts.</p>
<p>According to Rhys Elliot from Alinea Analytics, the game passed the milestone through PC, Xbox, and PS5 sales combined. Alinea also claims that the 4th January was the game's biggest day in terms of daily active users: roughly 3.2 million players across all platforms.</p>
<p>According to Elliot, the cause of this new peak of daily active users stems from a well-timed sale that coincided with the Christmas holidays, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/superhys.bsky.social/post/3mbocqp3vzc2w">writing on Bluesky</a>: "Daily copies sold started to stabilise by early Dec, but a well-timed 20 percent discount across all platforms - and the holiday boost - reversed that."</p>

</figure>
<p>Alinea Analytics obviously are not privy to internal data from Embark Studios, but it has made accurate estimates on game sales before. These include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-may-have-already-sold-25m-copies-according-to-industry-analyst">accurately deducing when Arc Raiders passed 2.5m sales</a>, as well as noting when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> passed 7m sales only five days after it launched. So while a grain of salt should be taken with such estimates, there's a history of accuracy here.</p><p>Elliot also highlighted other interesting figures from Alinea Analytics estimates of Arc Raiders, including the fact that over 50 percent of players can be found on Steam. Alinea also claims that by passing 12m sales, the game will have made at least over $350m in revenue.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders indeed appears to be maintaining its strong momentum ever since launching last year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">It was confirmed to be the best-selling game over the holiday period</a>, all while new information keeps creeping out about how the popular extraction shooter works, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">such as its aggressive matchmaking system</a>.</p>

            <p>Polish developer Rebel Wolves has unveiled the main musical theme for its promising dark fantasy role-playing The Blood of Dawnwalker, and surprise surprise, it sounds a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>.</p>
<p>The theme was unveiled in a new year update video and with a special chamber orchestra performance of it. The main theme features eerie folk-like singing and scraped violin accompaniment that builds, propelled by strong drum beats, to wailing-like singing and more frantic violin. The similarities with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9zqXmraFKQ">the main Witcher 3 theme</a> are striking.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker theme is composed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWhjvpqc17suOImkZwclnug">Nikola Kołodziejczyk</a>, and features Polish folk singer and musician <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@karolina.matuszkiewicz">Karolina Matuszkiewicz</a>, and Polish <a href="https://www.instagram.com/malisz.music/?hl=en">folk violinist Kacper Malisz</a>. The creators and performers, then, are different.</p>

<p>But The Witcher 3 also went for a strong Polish folk music sound, co-composed by CD Projekt Red's Marcin Przybyłowicz and Polish <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/percivalschuttenbach">folk-metal group Percival</a>. It was that group's influence that gave the game so much of its distinctive sound.</p><p>Incidentally, Percival hasn't been confirmed as a collaborator on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> yet, and CD Projekt Red didn't have anything to share when I asked directly about this back in November last year. But the group did perform music from The Witcher 4 trailer at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-organising-a-second-european-tour-for-the-witcher-in-concert-in-2026-and-its-well-worth-going-if-you-can">a Witcher anniversary concert that month</a>, which is where my question originated from (I watched the show), and I'd be surprised if Percival wasn't involved given how identifiable its sound is as 'The Witcher' now.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker musical similarities follow many other similarities to the Witcher 3 in the game. Both are dark fantasies centred around a supernaturally capable main character, and both have a similar adult tone and are presented in a similar third-person way, with similar gameplay. Given who's making the game, though, these similarities are to be expected.</p>

<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is directed by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz who directed The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. What's more, he's fitted out his Rebel Wolves studio with other former CDPR developers who made that celebrated role-playing game.</p>
<p>But as I learnt recently talking to Tomaskiewicz, while The Blood of Dawnwalker might look and sound a lot like The Witcher 3, there are notable differences. Chief among them is you being a part-human, part-vampire character in Dawnwalker, called Coen, who's able to walk up walls and teleport at night.</p><p>A bigger change as far as I'm concerned, though, is the structure of the game. It's pitched as a far less led experience than The Witcher 3, in so much that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">The Blood of Dawnwalker doesn't have a main campaign</a>. There's a main objective - to find and free your family in a 30 day timeframe - but how you go about that is up to you. There's a forested valley ahead of you, where do you want to go?</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves is aiming to release The Blood of Dawnwalker on PC and consoles this year.</p>

            <p>On its release back in 2023, Nintendo kept the Imprisoning War Sages from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> shrouded in a certain amount of mystery. In fact, despite them playing a fairly key role in terms of the overall backstory, we only saw them in the game very briefly.</p>
<p>That changed in last year's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which was set before the events of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. Here, the Hyrule Warriors team was able to shine more of a light on the war's Sages, who we now know to be Ardi of the Gerudo, Qia of the Zora, Raphica of the Rito and Agraston of the Goron.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, players are able to take on the role of each Sage as well as the likes of Princess Zelda and Rauru, as they fight through waves upon waves of bokoblins, Lynels and more.</p>
<p>But, why did Nintendo keep Tears of the Kingdom's Imprisoning War Sages under wraps like it did until the spin-off prequel? Well, director Hidemaro Fujibayashi has now said if the developer had shown the Sages' faces and shared their names before then, the story of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom "would have naturally grown too much" for the game.</p><p>"In Tears of the Kingdom there was a central theme running through the main story, and the Sages are depicted with their faces hidden by masks and without names," Fujibayashi said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">4Gamer</a> (translated by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-explains-why-it-kept-the-imprisoning-war-sages-a-mystery-in-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">NintendoEverything</a>). The director then went on to state there were "many things" Nintendo "intentionally held back" for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> sequel.</p>
<p>"If we had shown [the Sages'] personalities and faces, the story would have naturally grown too much," Fujibayashi further explained. "That's why I'm truly happy that the Sages have been more carefully picked up upon here in the Imprisoning War."</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex took Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment out for a spin</a> ahead of its release, calling it the series' "richest offering yet".</p>
<p>Since its release in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-free-update-adds-more-weapons-and-enemies-to-the-chaos">updates for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment have added additional weapons</a>, as well as new Vicious enemies.</p>

            <p>There are a few series staples you can expect from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>: a guy called Cid, moogles, chocobos, that lovely arpeggio motif in the music, and… surveys? If you've been reading this site for a while - or, indeed, following the Final Fantasy series - you'll know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> likes to lobby the fanbase to hear our thoughts about the series' identity and future.</p>
<p>The publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-15-survey-hints-at-possible-future-updates">did it for Final Fantasy 15 back in 2017</a>, it did to find out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-polling-final-fantasy-fans-on-moogles-in-ff15">what we all thought about moogles in 2015</a>, Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">regularly uses surveys</a> to poll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">FF14</a> players, and Square Enix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-successfully-expanded-the-series-audience-says-dlc-director">found out that more young people played Final Fantasy 16</a> via a survey in 2024. Keeping with tradition, then, we're seeing the Japanese company once again ask players about the storied series in a poll. And it closes on 9th January.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, we don't really know anything about where the mainline series is going. Yoshi-P said in an interview last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-final-fantasy-17-will-be-turn-based-says-naoki-yoshida-following-clair-obscurs-success">the team isn't even sure whether the game will be turn-based or not</a> (though we do know, at least, Square Enix wants to keep whatever game comes out of its current work a 'cinematic experience').</p>
<p>If you've got big thoughts about what you want to see - something more turn-based, maybe? Something more in line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> or Metaphor Refantazio, perhaps? - then you can <a href="https://questant.jp/q/6K9FPT4N">head on over to the link</a> and have your say about what you'd like to see more (or less) of in the series going forward.</p><p>Personally, I was electrified by the comments Kazutoyo Maehiro, director of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-could-open-the-door-to-a-sequel-if-it-sells-well-says-director">made in an interview last year</a>. Basically, he mentioned that if the re-release sold well, then it would "open the door" to a sequel and "prove the business viability of the strategy RPG genre."</p>
<p>There's an open field at the end of the survey where you can leave whatever comments you like. This is where I've opted to pop my interest in more Final Fantasy Tactics-related titles. Feel free to add what you want, but please, keep it civil.</p>

            <p>Popular MOBA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> was briefly unplayable over the past 24 hours, as the digital licence for the game expired.</p>
<p>The game's digital certificate, which verifies a program's authenticity within a set period of time, was valid from the 7th January 2016 up until the 4th January 2026. As such, as clocks flicked over to Sunday around the world, the certificate was made void and the game made unbootable.</p>
<p>There was, however, a clever workaround some players discovered. By turning your system clock back before this expiration date, League of Legends could be tricked into working yet again. This trick could lead to other apps breaking, but nonetheless was a salve for especially keen LoL fanatics.</p>

<p>As of writing, this problem has thankfully been fixed, though it does stand out as a fairly funny example of the house of cards digital services usually are. <a href="https://www.digicert.com/news/digicert-survey-finds-manual-processes-expose-organizations">A Digicert survey last year found that almost half of questioned companies experienced an outage due to digital certificate expiration</a>. If you're a Steam Deck user, <a href="https://www.techbuzz.ai/articles/stream-deck-device-not-supported-error-fixed-after-certificate-bug">a 'Device Not Supported' bug last year was caused by a Digital Certificate bug too</a>. It's a common problem.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-is-remaking-league-of-legends-in-2027">League of Legends itself is on the brink of a vast overhaul</a>, with a whole new version of the game set to be released sometime in 2027. More information on that is set to be revealed in the coming month or so, but given the scope of these changes it's probably a good idea to get a new set of certifications ready to go. The game has also found itself home to a new seasonal structure, aiming to keep things fresh for regular players.</p>
<p>This period of revitalisation for League of Legends comes following a rough spell, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-announces-second-round-of-layoffs-this-year">as Riot Games went through two waves of layoffs in 2024</a>, insisting it was a "necessity", saying its costs had "grown to the point where they're unsustainable... [leaving] no room for experimentation or failure".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall will focus on what those at the studio personally think is "cool" for its next game, rather than feel any pressure to focus on what anyone else thinks it should do.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was met with widespread acclaim on its release last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">rounded out 2025 by scooping up the coveted Game of the Year accolade at The Game Awards</a>. This success has meant many eyes are now on Sandfall and what the studio will do next, with plenty of high expectations.</p>
<p>So, has this pressure changed how those at the studio will approach the developer's next game? Well, according to Sandfall's chief operating officer and production director François Meurisse, this new-found pressure is "not so important to us".</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=2961&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=grd-gb-3689496626345421370&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Fuk%2Fedge-subscription%2Fdp%2F39f150bb">Edge magazine</a>, Meurisse said Sandfall already has "some great ideas" which it is "excited to explore". He also noted the studio isn't starting "from the same point" that it was when it began work on Clair Obscur. "The team already has five more years of experience. So maybe we can do some great stuff," he said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/">GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen added she is "a bit of a people pleaser", and therefore it is "always in the back of [her] mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings towards the game". She admitted she would be kidding herself and us if she said she "didn't think about that" from time to time. However even though this may be the case, she said the team's creative "North Star" will always be its "own personal taste" in terms of what it thinks "is cool", and what the team itself enjoys.</p>
<p>"I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there," Clair Obscur's lead writer said.</p>
<p>"So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>During the awards show last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>

            <p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded, an overhauled relaunch of arena shooter Splitgate 2, appears to be facing a rocky start in its efforts to revitalise the game.</p>
<p>Released on Steam and consoles on the 17th December, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#1m">the game's SteamDB figures</a> show an initial peak concurrent player count of 2,297, before drifting down to a relatively stable concurrent count of roughly 1,000 players in recent days. Looking at the original Splitgate's SteamDB stats however shows that game had a concurrent peak of 67,724 during its open beta.</p>
<p>It is of course worth noting that this figure doesn't take into account its new console playerbase, with Splitgate Arena Reloaded available on both PlayStation and Xbox. <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-update-dec-24-2025">In addition, a blog post by the developers</a> over 150,000 players tried Splitgate Arena Reloaded out in its first five days. It also claims: "retention is the best it's ever been".</p>

<p>That same blog post pledges a major marketing push this year, and various new updates to the shooter as shown in handy roadmap. This month the game is set to receive a new map, the Arena Royale, the One in the Chamber mode, and other additions.</p><p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded came about after a series of rough moments for developer 1047 Games. After launching the original Splitgate, a popular indie shooter with a back-to-basics approach to FPS gameplay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-is-ending-feature-development-so-dev-can-focus-on-new-game-in-same-universe">the studio would stop servicing that game</a> in favour of a bigger, bolder sequel with faction abilities. This sequel did not prove as popular as 1047 Games hoped, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">being pulled back into beta following community feedback and lacklustre traction</a>.</p>
<p>At Summer Game Fest last year, game director Ian Proulx wore a MAGA-style "Make FPS Great Again" hat which drew much criticism to both himself and the studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">which he later apologised for</a>. Fast forward to last month, and Splitgate Arena Reloaded released echoing the core arena FPS experience found in the original game.</p>
<p>Alongside hopes that these new updates and a broader marketing push can reignite excitement around the shooter, Splitgate Arena Reloaded is also hosting a selection of competitive events to drum up hype. This includes a $5,000 tournament with Splitgate content creators, as well as a $25,000 community challenge. There's also a welcome back event, in which players can earn the T200 character skin, a popular relic of the original Splitgate.</p>

            <p>If you've found you've been coming up against tougher players in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> just recently, that could well be because you've been deemed an "aggressive" player.</p>
<p>For the last week or so, players who naturally gravitate to PvP modes and shoot on sight without hesitation have found themselves facing much more aggressive combatants, leading to discussions about whether <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ptzhmr/why_do_people_suddenly_believe_in_aggression/">the team at Embark Studios had quietly introduced "aggression-based" matchmaking</a> (ABMM).</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview, Embark Studios' Patrick Söderlund has confirmed that that's "exactly" what it's done.</p>

<p>"Obviously, first it's skill-based, of course," Söderlund said in the interview with <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/">GamesBeat</a>. "Then you have solos, duos, and trios. And then we also - since a week ago or so - we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE.</p>
<p>"So, if your preference is to do PvE, and you have less conflict with players, you'll get more matched up. Obviously it's not a full science."</p>
<p>Asked directly if the change could be described as "aggression-based matchmaking", he added: "That's exactly what it is."</p>
<p>Quite what it means to be "aggressive" or "prone" to PvP or PvE is unclear and likely never will be, to prevent less scrupulous players from gaming the system. It does, however, at least confirm that those who'd felt there'd been a quiet change to how matchmaking worked weren't imagining it.</p><p>This backs up a prior interview with Arc Raiders art director Robert Sammelin, who recently said that when it comes to the extraction shooter's matchmaking system - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">which was Steam's biggest-selling game over the holiday period</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-developer-confirms-player-behaviour-is-factor-in-matchmaking">player behaviour is indeed a factor</a> in the "complex" process of assigning players to online matches.</p>

            <p>Capcom cut an entire chapter in which you played as Ashley in the opening of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Modder and content creator Michael "Thekempy" Kemp has reportedly restored the cut chapter that was meant to open the game. While there are no cutscenes or even enemies, there are enough "leftover pieces" in the game files to put "Chapter 0" back together and "get a rough idea of how it would have played out". So that's exactly what they did in the video below:</p>

<p>"It would have started with Ashley in the woods at night," Thekempy explains. "She stumbles upon Los Illuminados in the middle of performing a ritual sacrifice."</p>
<p>If that sounds a little familiar, that's because it is - the sequence was briefly seen in the story trailer Capcom released back in October 2022. And while it seemingly didn't make the final cut and the area is not accessible in the final build, Thekempy was able to find the path Ashley took to witness the sacrifice, and then a fork in the road, which takes her down to the village.</p>
<p>"There are a number of leftover spawn locations for scripted events that would have happened in this chapter," thekempy added (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/resident-evil/an-entire-intro-where-you-play-as-ashley-was-cut-from-the-resident-evil-4-remake/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"I am unable to restore all of their functionality, but I can tell you what they're labelled as. There's one here for the spawn of a Ganado who would begin walking around, and Ashley has to sneak past him."</p>
<p>While the cutscenes seemingly no longer exist, Thekempy did manage to trigger autosaves and give a little detail on what each cutscene may have entailed from their labels and descriptions in the code.</p>
<p>We may never know why, exactly, the opening sequence was binned, but it's possible Capcom was a little wary of kicking off the horror with a comparatively slow, non-combat sequence so at odds with the game's action-heavy playstyle.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released next year on 27th February across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Steam. Its dual protagonists will represent two styles of gameplay, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-leon-grace-differing-gameplay">its developers describe as like "jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna"</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">Resident Evil 7 and Village are also coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>Delving into the backend of Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4, a group of Chinese dataminers believe they've found references to a Switch 2 port, including information about wireless multiplayer, graphical presets, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q201pw/datamining_group_leaks_detailed_presets_for/">reportedly</a> "300 detailed parameters across four platforms: PS5, PC, Xbox Series, and Switch 2".</p>

<p>Right now, there's no formal word from Capcom that the game could be making the jump to Switch 2, but Capcom has long been a supporter of Nintendo's platform. It may be that the Switch port was paused until last month's Title Update 4 rolled out, along with that all-important <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-finally-gets-pc-optimisation-roadmap-to-coincide-with-title-update-4-but-players-still-arent-really-happy">optimisation roadmap for the game's performance on PC</a>.</p><p>These issues have plagued the game since Monster Hunter Wilds launched in February 2025, and whilst Capcom has acknowledged them, the publisher has been slow on pushing out updates that addressed player concerns. This has led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">less than stellar sales</a> for the game outside its launch window, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">falls in Capcom's share price</a>. It's plausible, then, that Capcom's waiting for the PC version to improve before adding another platform into the mix. Maybe we'll find out more at a Nintendo Direct presentation soon...</p>

<p>Dring didn't share his workings or comparative data for elsewhere in the world, but it's broadly in line with other data shared across the year. While all three major hardware manufacturers - Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft - have reportedly seen year-on-year (YoY) declines, Xbox sales in the US are allegedly down a whopping 70 percent, according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-us-console-unit-sales-just-reached-an-all-time-november-low">IGN</a>, thanks in no small part to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">two price hikes in quick succession</a>.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sales of Xbox consoles were down 39% in the UK during 2025, making it comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox consoles.

<p>Of course, we've long known that profits are tight in gaming hardware, and it's software and games that typically make money. That currently seems to be Microsoft's focus: bringing its first-party games and its Game Pass subscription service to hitherto rival systems to maximise reach and sales.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it's a sobering read, especially for fans who have committed to Microsoft's console.</p>
<p>It's been a tough year for Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">with thousands of layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">cancelled games</a>, including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO, flagging hardware sales, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">even its tentpole shooter, Call of Duty series, is struggling</a>. In fact, marketing budget constraints were rumoured to be the reason why Xbox may have been the only company on the planet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-claims-xbox-wrapped-2025-isnt-happening-this-year-due-to-marketing-budget-constraints">not to release a "2025 wrapped"-esque summary of the year</a>.</p><p>Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, however, reports, Xbox will be hosting one of its Dev Direct streams later this month, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/well-have-more-stuff-next-year-after-being-somewhat-absent-from-the-game-awards-xbox-boss-teases-a-dev-direct-for-january-2026">"we've got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show"</a>. That means we can probably expect updates on the upcoming Fable game and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> series, and perhaps a couple of updates from other games that come under the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> umbrella.</p>

<p>The word popped up as a <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">URL</a> which contains nowt but a timer, which seems to expire on or around Valentine's Day, depending upon where you are in the world.

<p>Mooch about in the source file and you'll find links to video files - they seem to do nothing but provide the oscillating patterns of the animated background - but given the copyright notice at the bottom at the page makes absolutely no reference to Konami or the Silent Hill franchise, it looks unlikely that this relates to the Silent Hill 1 Remake.</p> <div>

<p>The reason we're reaching for a horror game in oppose to any other genre is that the tweet that directed us to the website on X/Twitter gave the link alongside the text: "dare to peek into the darkness…"</p>
<p>As for what, exactly, remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd could be? It's possible that this pertains to the studio's upcoming Switch-exclusive horror game, but the letters <em>not</em> bolded spell Cronos, leaving some presuming it could be DLC or even a sequel for Bloober's own horror series. Others are <a href="https://x.com/Effetendo/status/2006788616824172581?s=20">hoping</a> for a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/eternal-darkness">Eternal Darkness</a> game, while some fans are just having fun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1q0tk3i/i_think_i_have_some_of_the_words/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">making</a> some <a href="http://v/">bizarre</a> anagrams.</p><p>More interestingly still, fans recently discovered Bloober had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q15g0q/bloober_team_trademarks_onyx_the_dark_grip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">trademarked</a> the name <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019026286">Onyx: The Dark Grip</a> back in 2024, so make of that what you will. The good news is that even if no one deciphers it, we only have 42 days until we find out for sure.</p>
<p>Polish developer Bloober released Cronos back in September and it reviewed well. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Kelsey gave the game four stars in their Cronos: The New Dawn review</a>, calling it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s best original game yet". Bloober recently released an additional, easier difficulty mode for players who want to enjoy the story and worldbuilding with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-easy-mode">less challenging gameplay</a>.</p>

            <p>Time flies (like a Javelin suit): there are only 10 days left to play BioWare's ill-fated multiplayer game Anthem before the servers are switched off, presumably forever.</p>
<p>We've had this end-date in the diary <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">since EA announced it last summer</a>. "After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026," the company said. That day seemed far away then; now, it does not.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear whether there'll be a 'switching off event' of any kind. I'm trying to find out.</p>

<p>Because Anthem is an online multiplayer game, once EA switches the servers off, you won't be able to play it, regardless of if you own it or not. This is an aspect of modern live service gaming many people are frustrated by - this disappearance of games they bought but can no longer play. It's led to movements like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-offshoot-confident-eu-petition-will-progress-to-legislative-phase-with-almost-half-of-signatures-now-verified">Stop Destroying Games and Stop Killing Games, which are petitioning governments</a> in the hope of putting protections in place to stop this happening.</p><p>But if a game is not attracting a large enough audience to justify the expenditure of ongoing server costs, which I don't think Anthem was, then what's a company to do - run it at a loss? Or does it release the code to the community to host servers themselves? I'm sure the latter option is not as straightforward as it sounds.</p>

<p>Regardless, Anthem's end seems symbolic in the story of BioWare - a company famed for single-player role-playing experiences that was encouraged and perhaps pressured to make a huge bet on a multiplayer game that didn't work out. It was, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-mass-effect-from-the-birth-of-a-trilogy-to-andromeda-and-beyond">as one of the key people involved in the project once told me</a>, a "dichotomy" - a game that tried to be two things (a BioWare experience and a multiplayer game) but ended up being neither. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli called Anthem a game "shaken apart by its own identity crisis" in Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>
<p>There were plans to overhaul Anthem - ambitious plans for a 2.0 reboot that would revitalise the experience, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-work-on-major-anthem-overhaul-has-officially-ceased">but these were eventually abandoned</a>.</p>
<p>Anthem's misfortunes in 2019 piled onto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>'s misfortunes from 2017, leaving BioWare in a precarious and pressurised position after the relative high-point of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> in 2014. The eventual release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> in 2024, after 10 years of topsy turvy development - which included a few years as a multiplayer game - did nothing to remedy this.</p><p>All eyes now turn to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-midst-of-eas-controversial-acquisition-bioware-moves-to-reassure-fans-that-a-new-mass-effect-is-definitely-still-in-development">the elusive in-development fifth Mass Effect game</a>, the success of which BioWare's existence may hinge upon.

            <p>According to a new report, both AMD and Nvidia will raise the prices of their consumer GPUs "significantly" this year. If this report is true, both companies will have pushed these price hikes by next month.</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273#_endPass">This information comes from Newsis</a>, which claims these price hikes will come as a result of the high cost of memory in the computer hardware market right now. This increased cost has been caused by construction of widespread AI data centres, which has resulted in a huge demand for such components.</p>
<p>This price hike will continue to get worse too, according to Newsis industry sources. While an initial price increase will reportedly go into place in January for AMD and February for Nvidia, both companies will continue gradually increasing the price throughout the year.</p>

<figcaption>Here's why Blue Prince is why Eurogamer's game of 2025!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzksL5Az7ro" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Expectations are that these price increases will impact certain GPUs, including Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50 series and AMD's Radeon RX 9000 series which are already expensive. According to Newsis, the Nvidia RTX 5090 which was released at a price point of $1,999 could eventually increase to $5,000 this year.</p><p>The reasons why these price hikes are coming are clear. Not only are GPus getting more expensive to make due to the increased cost of construction, but AI companies such as OpenAI are hardware guzzling behemoths. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/nvidia-ceo-huang-says-next-generation-ai-will-need-more-compute.html">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that next generation AI will need "100 times more compute" than older models</a>, and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-the-company-doesnt-have-enough-electricity-to-install-all-the-ai-gpus-in-its-inventory-you-may-actually-have-a-bunch-of-chips-sitting-in-inventory-that-i-cant-plug-in">Microsoft's CEO mused that they don't have the electricity to install the GPUs sitting in their inventory</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not you buy into the hype regarding Generative AI and LLMs, the reality is these companies are buying GPUs (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">and RAM</a>) with the expectation that they'll need an absurd amount of hardware for future models, and the consumer demand for those models. Thus, we have a massive demand for GPUs, thus the price increase. Nvidia and AMD know they can charge AI companies more too, as these companies rely on such hardware for continued growth.</p>
<p>What this means for the average consumer of PC parts for gaming purposes is that your PC parts are going to get drastically more expensive over the coming months if this report is accurate, and they'll likely get more expensive due to basic supply / demand problems in the hardware market.</p>
<p>All the while video game companies state their intention to embrace AI through development. Take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">which intends to replace 70% of its QA wit hAI by 2027</a>, and Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">whose CEO believes AI will be as big a revolution as the shift to 3D</a>.</p>
