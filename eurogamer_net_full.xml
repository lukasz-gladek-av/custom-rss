            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> - the ever-lasting sci-fi action MMORPG - is at a turning point. Nearing the release of The Old Peace update, players will be able to look back through memory at an integral part of Warframe's history. There will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-destiny-heres-how-warframe-makes-us-care-about-its-space-stuff">narrative twists</a>, new weapons to collect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-is-getting-two-new-protoframes-and-yes-theyre-romanceable">and people to romance</a>, and perhaps most intriguing of all a suite of ultimate abilities called Tauron Strikes.</p>
<p>These ultimates stem from Tetkolyst artifacts, a new tier of armament which offer cinematic attacks for each of the game's six focus schools. Fans of the game will already be familiar with one, a giant sword introduced at Tennocon earlier this year. The rest are equally enticing: one is even a Kamehameha.</p>
<p>Why and how were these made? How big of a game-changer are they for Warframe, and just what inspired the over-the-top animations that go alongside them? To find out, Eurogamer sat down with Warframe game director Rebecca Ford for an interview which you can read below.</p>

<p><strong>Eurogamer:</strong> How did the idea of these big new ultimate attacks come about?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "Whenever you ask the big broad question I always like to look back to find out when the first time it was brought up. My recollection is that I really wanted to do focus ultimates that were very anime-inspired, ways for each school to have this potent culmination of their respective traits. I can see that all the way back in February they were brought up as a concept! Pablo (game design director) was asking what we wanted them to be and, this is such an obvious answer from my brain, but I was like: 'Giant sword. How do we get a giant sword?'</p>
<p>"It's like a balsamic glaze reduction, you just boil something down until it's this sickly sweet or sour version of itself. That's what the focus school ultimates feel like, they're each a teaspoon of concentrated combat prowess."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: Anime-inspired! </strong>In the Tennocon show earlier this year Final Fantasy came up as an inspiration for these, and some of the poses made seem vaguely Jojo's Bizarre Adventure esq… What were the specific inspirations here?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "We needed to go into the direction of - we have five focus schools and each of them need a signature weapon. Naramon was very easy because it's a melee school and a giant sword would do the trick. We were looking into moments where the protagonists of an anime would bring out a giant sword for this big attack, as a kind of animation and presentation base for that.</p><p>"Things started to get a bit more sensible as we started to look at our favourite inspirations - I don't want to say tropes - for flavour. The bow and arrow came from us, that was our own Warframe slice. We know we wanted Vazarin - our healing school - to have a staff. This mage moment came a lot from Frieren. For the hammer: everyone loves a giant rockin' hammer.</p>
<p>"Zenurik was the hardest one. We wanted it to be a Kamehameha. It had to be an energy beam attack, but it needed a conduit. We actually have an anime channel at work, and one of our designers said: 'oh my god we could just do a book, a tome'. So we got the page doing the beam attack, it came through for us. It's a little bit of a Nier: Replicant throwback with Grimoire Weiss."</p>

</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer:</strong> How do you make these play into the fantasy of each school, aside from just the aesthetics?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "Sometimes it's the wanting, it's the cooldown. You can only do it so many times every five minutes. But it's all in figuring out what the best in to cycle it into your gameplay. You'll use it when you want a lot of damage, and the secondary buffs that come with it. It's truly like casting an 'ultimate' - it's something we've never done this aggressively in Warframe.</p><p>"We used to have ultimates that animation-locked you, but Warframe got too fast for watching these drawn out attacks. We got rid of it for Ash when you use to do his Bladestorm. But we're going back to try it out, there was this tug of war around how long these would be. At Tennocon, we showed off this 16-second-cast. That will never ship, we just needed to show off what we were making. Three seconds is way too short, so we're right in the middle at around six seconds. Each represents an attribute of the focus school and as you upgrade these via the skill tree you hone in on these attributes."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: </strong>How do you anticipate these ultimates will impact the way general action will work in Warframe going forward, now that players have a new tool to use?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "They're really meant to work well in the 12-minute war. That's been proven at this point with the grappling points and other new things present there. As far as people bringing it back to the regular world, I feel it's just a user expression thing. If you want to do something lethal, you'd be able to do it on a cooldown we assign. There's nothing really anything in the game with cooldowns, aside from your Necramech. So if anything, it'll make things more accessible depending on where you are in the game."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer:</strong> How is it balanced for Conclave?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "You f- You know the answer to that, it's not! I don't even know if you can do… I don't even know if you can use Operators in Conclave, can you?"</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer:</strong> I don't know!</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "I don't think you can. That's embarrassing for me. I literally don't even know if you can. Lol."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: </strong>Do you now have to design encounters in the future with these ultimates in mind? Are there considerations that have to be made?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "It will impact it in the same way all these vertical levels of power growth do, in that we're aware of it and we account for it. The way we handle this case is by attaching a more significant cooldown than with anything we've ever done.</p><p>"We know what we're doing next year and it's all figured out. So this is like a dance move you can bust out, a big animation with a big number at the end of it. You can measure it, and address it systemically."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Recalling the past, new narrative twists will be revealed later this month. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Digital Extremes</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: </strong>One final question on this: why is it valuable to have the big narrative lead-up to obtaining one of these weapons? What do you gain from taking this approach?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "Honestly, it's completely a creative choice derived from the myth of excalibur. We don't really have a lot of named legendary weapons in Warframe. We have the Paracesis, we have Broken War / War. There are all the primes and some quest weapons that are important, but it felt as though we hadn't delved into the world of 'relic weapons'.</p><p>"The experience of designing these felt as though we had hit a tier of legendary weapons that we hadn't hit before. It was a full commitment to flavour. It adds a level of attachment to these new weapons, and also provides an opportunity for us to make new ones. There could be another ancient book. It's a new school of things we can keep expanding."</p>
<p><strong>Eurogamer: </strong>What makes a weapon legendary?</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong>: "It's the ceremony. I just came back from England. There's something to be said about ritual and celebration. Like, the crown jewels. What makes that legendary? You know what they represent, there's such a potency there. Some games do it so well, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>! You know what Sephiroth or Cloud's swords are. I love how unique this feels for Warframe - it's like an untouched diamond mine for us."</p>
<hr>
<p>Warframe's next update - The Old Peace - in which Tauron Strikes and a variety of other new features will be making their dubut is set to launch on the 10th December. You can play Warframe on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Mobile. The game is also coming to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> some time next year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-studio-would-love-to-do-a-proper-switch-2-version-but-its-still-waiting-on-a-dev-kit-so-if-you-know-anyone">after Digital Extremes struggled to get dev kits for the hardware earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <p>
Skyblivion - the ambitious, highly anticipated mod remaking the entirety of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion using Skyrim's engine - won't hit its originally anticipated 2025 release, its development team has confirmed, with the project now expected next year.
</p>
<p>
Developer TESRenewal originally announced its 2025 release target back in 2023, but in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc">new update video</a>, project lead Rebelzize confirmed the delay, explained the team still has "some last challenges to overcome that are going to require a little bit more time."
</p>
<p>
"This is something we have known for a while," he continued, "but we did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project." To that end, the remainder of the eight-and-a-half-minute video takes a closer look at its current state, with Rebelzize stressing many parts are now "in great shape".

</div><figcaption>Will Skyblivion really be better than Oblivion Remastered?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmspR2xIL38" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Skyblivion's world map is "100 percent finished", for instance, and the team has <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">uploaded an interactive satellite version of the map</a> for closer perusal. Similarly, all quest dungeons, which have been remade for the project, are complete, while the remaining random dungeons are "mostly finished".
</p><p>
As for other key elements, interiors for houses, shops, castles, stables, inns, and chapels are complete, but there's still some work to be done on the Imperial City before they can all find a home. It sounds like the Imperial City - which is still awaiting final assets - is the last major roadblock as far as locations go. Other cities are complete and the studio believes it'll have all locations wrapped up and ready to go by the end of this year, at which point it can focus on quest finalisation, navmesh work, and QA as 2026 gets underway.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, weapons, armour, clothing, plants, clutter, and the majority of architecture assets are complete, meaning 3D modelling work is virtually done, leaving a few low priority assets to go. Additionally, UI work continues, with the team transitioning to a more Skyrim-like interface, and the mechanics team is said to be making "solid progress" as it focuses on enhancing player experience, based on feedback from the team. Most major systems are anticipated to be complete by the end of the year, and the goal is to open Skyblivion out for wider play-testing at a later date. The team has, however, hit a snag with cinematics, and is seeking volunteers to finish a major scene.
</p>
<p>
Once major work is complete, Rebelzize says the goal is to spend "as much time as possible polishing, balancing, and fixing" ready for launch day. And that work will likely continue after release, as it addresses issues spotted by players once they get their hands on the game. Additionally, there are robust plans for post-release updates, with the team hoping to implement custom content, original Oblivion DLC such as Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine, and other features - including spell crafting, Oblivion-like UI reskins, dynamic dungeons, grave robbing, increased creature variety, followers and hirelings, more unique weapons and armours, additional unique spells, and more.
</p>
<p>
One previously discussed element that won't make release is underwater combat. Despite getting the feature "partially working", the team opted to drop it due to conflicts with animation mods and other technical issues. There is, however, still hope it can be revisited and added at a later date. 
</p><p>
"We thank you all for your continued support of this ambitious project I started more than ten years ago," Rebelzize concludes. "And I really, genuinely cannot wait to get Skyblivion into your hands". Following today's delay announcement, the mod is expected to launch sometime next year.

            <p>Arrowhead trusts the newly-announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film director, and has shut down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Fast &amp; Furious' Justin Lin would be taking the director reins for Sony's upcoming Helldivers adaptation</a>, which will be based on Arrowhead's game. On this announcement, it was revealed that Lin is not a gamer himself, and actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>

<p>However, while this move was clearly enough to win over those within the film business, it caused a bit of scepticism with some over on the game's Discord server. In fact, one user tagged Arrowhead's studio head Shams Jorjani asking if they could direct the adaptation instead.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Jorjani did not take the user up on the offer, and instead showed his support for Lin's work. "Let Justin Lin work his magic," <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1445530210098352138">Jorjani replied</a>.</p>
<p>In a further exchange, another member of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> Discord asked the Arrowhead exec to ensure Lin "plays the game at least once" or checks out some gameplay footage. Again, Jorjani affirmed that Lin is the right person for the job.</p>
<p>"I trust Justin," the Helldivers 2 CEO said, adding: "He did a great job on the Star Trek movie."</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the fantastic musical action game, is losing Denuvo anti-tamper support early next year, according to a post on the game's official Steam page.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1817230/view/542250073650626840?l=english">The post</a>, succinct in scope, announced suddenly that the software would be removed in a mandatory patch on the 16th January, 2026. However, it also states the game's own anti-tamper measures will still remain in place, so it shouldn't become totally unguarded from tampering hands.</p>
<p>The reason why? Well, the post gives the following justification: "This adjustment is intended to provide a more stable and efficient service environment. We sincerely appreciate all players who continue to support the game through legitimate use."</p>

<p>So important is this update in the eyes of developer Tango Gameworks that Hi-Fi Rush will apparently not launch unless this patch has been installed. The comments responding to this Steam post are largely filled with fans celebrating the removal of Denuvo. The software has proven controversial for a variety of reasons - one of them being the online connection requirement which has rubbed folks the wrong way over the years.</p><p>We do know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-sequel-being-considered-positively-but-tango-gameworks-considering-various-opportunities">Tango Gameworks is considering a Hi-Fi Rush sequel, among other potential projects</a>. It had been in development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-2-already-in-development-six-months-when-krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks">for six months at the point when Krafton bought the studio</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-hi-fi-rush-redfall-sign-game-pass-xbox-publishing-model-failing">Tango Gameworks' sudden closure by Microsoft</a>. In recent news, new-owners Krafton has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">its intention to become an "AI-first" company</a> - good luck Tango!</p>
<p>If you've not tried out Hi-Fi, we recommend you remedy that as soon as possible. You can give <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's review</a> a read for an idea of what you've been missing, in which Ed Nightingale wrote: "Vibrant and self-assured, Hi-Fi Rush happily embraces the 00s' cheese - and is all the better for it."</p>

            <p>Supertrick Games, the developer of Let it Die sequel Inferno, which launches today, has issued a statement on the game's AI use following controversy from earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The controversy surrounded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">Let it Die: Inferno's AI disclosure on Steam</a>, which suggested substantial use of generative AI during development, across art, music, and voice, but it did not specify in detail exactly how AI had been used. The statement issued in response to the reaction provides that detail, and in general, the game's AI use seems less than suspected.</p>
<p>For example, the game does use generative AI to create the voices of two characters, but these characters are an AI-driven machine and a "mysterious life form", so the AI-generated voices were a deliberate, creative choice to fit the character, rather than a cost-cutting exercise.</p>

<p>"These specific cases use AI-generated voices intentionally to match the nature of the characters," the statement read. "These voices are not derived from or modeled after any human performers, ensuring no copyright concerns." Otherwise, "All in-game characters are voiced by human performers."</p><p>AI-generated art was used, meanwhile, "to generate rough base images" for background posters, InfoCast (news) insert images and in-game reading material, which the team's artists then "painted over, refined, and adjusted by hand". The AI tool also apparently helped the team observe copyright laws, although there's no explanatory detail on how.</p>
<p>Finally with regards to music, AI was used to begin the creation process for music you'll hear in the background in Iron Perch. Specifically, and I don't really understand this, so excuse my lack of sound creation technicalities, AI was used to generate stems, which I believe are collections of audio tracks, or mixes. "Once all stems were exported," the statement read, "few were manually edited, but most were rebuilt from scratch."</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">eccentric and asymmetrical multiplayer game Let it Die</a>, by Suda51's studio Grasshopper - Supertrick was a co-creator. This new game ditches the asymmetrical multiplayer idea for direct, real-time multiplayer, in an on-trend PvEvP framework. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/#app_reviews_hash">Initial reviews on Steam don't seem to be positive</a>, however, with a Mixed overall response.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has been banned in Russia, accused of distributing LGBTQ+ propaganda and terrorism-related extremist materials.</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor, the Russian watchdog for communications and censorship, described Roblox as "rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children". It also flagged reports of sexual harassment of children.</p>
<p>"We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate," a Roblox spokesperson told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/">Reuters</a>, "and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added Roblox has "a deep commitment to safety and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform."</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor has a track record of restricting access to Western media and tech it deems to be in breach of Russian laws, from Duolingo to WhatsApp and Telegram. Last week, the watchdog <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-threatens-full-ban-whatsapp-tass-reports-2025-11-28/">threatened to block WhatsApp entirely</a>.</p>
<p>Russia has of course long had anti-LGBT laws in place, in 2013 banning the "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors.</p>
<p>Yet Roblox also has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>, with a report last year claiming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">platform had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a>. This year, Roblox has been steadily improving its safety standards, most recently <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">requiring age checks for all those wishing to communicate through the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Russia isn't the first country to ban Roblox. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-responds-to-platform-ban-in-turkiye">Türkiye also banned access to the platform last year</a> to "ensure the protection of our children".</p>
<p>"We've spent almost 20 years making Roblox one of the safest online platforms for our users, particularly the youngest, and ensuring the safety of our users is at the core of everything we do," said a Roblox spokesperson to Eurogamer at the time.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">Roblox boss David Baszucki appeared on the New York Times podcast Hard Fork to discuss safety measures</a>, but he described the problem of predators on the platform as an "opportunity", in what amounted to a disastrous interview.</p>

            <p>Dispatch studio AdHoc knew it was taking a risk releasing the game in weekly episodic installments, and was actually advised not to do it. However, the studio did it anyway, and the risk paid off.</p>
<p>AdHoc itself has been around for seven years, with its superhero workplace comedy being in full production for three of those. Dispatch is the studio's first game, so it was understandably a big deal when its first episodes were released back in October of this year.</p>

<p>"Seven years, <em>one </em>game," AdHoc's CEO and executive producer Michael Choung reflected in a recent interview with <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1">Knowledge</a>, before adding: "But what's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a videogame, all meshing and rubbing up against each other."</p>
<p>The studio exec noted the team decided it wanted to go with a completely original narrative driven episodic format, and was not simply about making life easy for them. "And part of it was because we weren't really thinking about feasibility," Choung said. "We were just thinking in terms of creative and player experience."</p>
<p>But, while this approach worked for AdHoc and Dispatch, Choung admitted releasing the game in one go would have been "the conventional wisdom".</p>
<p>"Everyone was telling us not to do it," Choung said of the game's episodic format. "We had internal debates about it but the story was always structured that way." So while other release cadences were floated - such as bringing the game out in two halves or even one episode per week - the studio eventually settled on two episodes, once a week.</p><p>"A lot of the reasons for it we're now seeing the results of," Choung furthered. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered." The developer remarked that we have been seeing this kind of release schedule with TV series for decades now.</p>
<p>"We knew that it gives a 'the train is leaving the station, but not just yet - I can still make it' kind of feeling across weeks, and people catch on. When we look at concurrent user numbers across the drops, it's exactly that - it just kept doubling every week. Again, conventional wisdom says: whatever you guys do in the first week, the second week is going to be half that number. It was literally the opposite. Those things, we anticipated.</p>
<p>"I don't think we anticipated the scale of it."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But while Dispatch has seen immense success with its release schedule, Choung admits this is not something every studio should now attempt, especially if there isn't the creative backbone to support it. "It's insane to do," he said. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!"</p><p>The exec continued: "If the creative is strong, you can cut it up however you like, and it probably is going to make it through, even if it's a poor decision. If we'd said, 'We're just going to release the whole thing', it probably would have done ok. But it probably wouldn't have been as big as this… If you go episodic with a not-so-great story, you're flirting with people that aren't attracted to you whatsoever."</p>
<p>But while Choung cautioned releasing a game with an episodic format, he said if others did try, AdHoc would of course "be thrilled if it worked out".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p><p>Meanwhile last month, AdHoc said it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">no interest in using AI to replace voice actors or game development</a>. "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," creative director Nick Herman said, before adding: "Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p>

            <p>
Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has recently being doing the rounds to chat about to his company Absurd Ventures, and his latest tidbit from his time at the Grand Theft Auto studio is the surprisingly revelation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> perhaps owes as much to Victorian literature as it does cowboy films.
</p>
<p>
"I binged on Victorian novels for that," he explains in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/03/i-binged-on-victorian-novels-dan-houser-on-dickens-red-dead-redemption-and-redefining-open-world-games">new interview with the Guardian</a>. "I listened to the audiobook of [George Elliot's] Middlemarch walking to and from the office every day. I loved it."
</p>
<p>
As to why Houser turned to this perhaps unexpected source of inspiration, he explained, "I wanted [Red Dead Redemption 2] to feel from the writing perspective, slightly more novelistic. I thought that was a way of doing something new on the story side – and the game was going to look so pretty, the art was so strong, I thought the story had better really set it up."

<p>
It was his search for the right tone that ultimately led him not just to Middlemarch, but other Victorian fiction, including Sherlock Holmes. And as he noted elsewhere, big 19th-century novels perhaps have more in common with open-world games than is immediately obvious, bringing a "sense of slightly spread out storytelling" that's paralleled in the likes of GTA.
</p><p>
Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">departed Rockstar Games in 2020</a>, formally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiled his new media company Absurd Ventures</a> in 2023. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">currently working on A Better Paradise</a>, charting the "ill-fated development of an ambitious but addictive video game project that goes very wrong", which so far spans a novel and podcast series, with a TV series and game on the way.
</p>
<p>
It's also developing a new crime fiction universe, American Caper, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">Absurdaverse</a>, a "story-driven action-comedy adventure game".

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has agreed to halt all promotion and public testing of Light of Motiram - the post-apocalyptic open-world survival game Sony previously accused of being a "slavish clone" of PlayStation's Horizon series in a lawsuit - as the two companies battle it out in court.
</p>
<p>
Light of Motiram, developed by Tencent's Polaris Quest studio, emerged at the end of last year, and its accompanying images - featuring mechanised animal-like creatures and very Aloy like key character art - immediately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">drew comparisons with Horizon</a>. And Sony agreed, mounting legal action against Tencent, who it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">accused of copyright and trademark infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, we've had a bit of back-and-forth - Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">accused Sony</a> of seeking an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions", a claim Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">called "nonsense"</a> - and Tencent even went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">quietly update Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> to tone down the more "egregious" Horizon similarities. But the lawsuit rumbles on.

<p>
Sony wants the court to block Light of Motiram from sale when its legal hearing gets underway next year, but in the interim Tencent has agreed to keep the game out of the spotlight. As <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">reported by TheGamePost</a>, Tencent this week submitted a new California court filing agreeing there will be "no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram" while Sony's injunction request is being argued. This is part of a deal in which Sony will give Tencent more time to respond to its injunction motion.
</p><p>
"SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agreed, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction," the filing reads, "(b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the Light of Motiram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary injunction".
</p>
<p>
TheGamePost notes Sony and Tencent have jointly requested the court hearings - covering both Sony's injunction request and Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit - be moved to the same day in January next year.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update, which is set to go live on the 9th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171?s=20">Announced in a Battlefield Comms post</a>, the developers have stated that work continues to enhance both components of online play. This is especially noteworthy as issues surrounding both online netcode and hit registration have been points of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to build on our work to make hit registration feel consistent, reliable, and predictable during every engagement," the post states. "With this update, we have improved how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including cases where shots were fired while transitioning into a zoom. These improvements correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and the readability of where your shots were landing. We have also made updates to better handle high-density combat scenarios to ensure bullets register more reliably when multiple players are fighting in close proximity."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the new Battlefield 6 update has included additional gameplay adjustments to better the overall experience of getting into a firefight. The post elaborates: "In parallel, we have tightened the clarity of damage feedback so that health UI changes and damage cues feel more immediate and easier to understand during combat. While this is separate from Netcode itself, improving how damage is presented plays a key role in making hit registration feel responsive and intuitive.
</p><p>"Lastly, we have resolved an issue where clients could briefly display certain pieces of geometry as intact even though they had already been destroyed on the server. Fixing this eliminates cases where incoming damage could appear to pass through walls."</p>
<p>Other improvements include a general tweak to soldier visibility. There have also been adjustments to various weapons including changes to weapon-handling, first shot accuracy and more. Certain game modes include Rush and Breakthrough have also been altered to improve the attacker flow, aiming to stop oversaturation when it comes to defending objectives.</p>
<p>Finally, the post pledges further improvements to "clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat". So it seems as though this continued string of gameplay shifts from EA and Battlefield Studios won't be stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>This update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of games post-launch were cheater free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amazon's upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> from Pheobe Waller-Bridge will interconnect with the video games, rather than being a standalone story with its own continuity in the vein of the Angelina Jolie films.</p>
<p>This latest nugget of Tomb Raider-laced information comes from Story Kitchen, a production company tied to the series.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As shared on the <a href="https://www.story-kitchen.com/projects/tombraider">company's website</a>, and spotted by social media account <a href="https://x.com/infinityTRaider">Infinity Tomb Raider</a>, the deal between Story Kitchen and Amazon MGM studios "will reinvent the franchise on a massive scale, interconnecting a new live-action television series and video games into a unified storytelling universe".</p>
<p>Along with the show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon's game department is also assisting on the next mainline Tomb Raider entry with developer Crystal Dynamics</a>. Story Kitchen's wording here could therefore suggest that whichever comes first - the show or the game - will perhaps lead into the other somehow, or at least drop some clues at what Tomb Raider fans can perhaps expect from the franchise's future.</p><p>It will also be interesting to see how Amazon's interconnecting of the games will differ from what Netflix did with its own Tomb Raider animated series, The Legend of Lara Croft. This series took place after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, and included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-series-ptsd-focus-was-something-game-writers-werent-allowed-to-explore-rhianna-pratchett-says">brief  flashbacks to Lara's time on Yamatai from the 2013 reboot</a>. Meanwhile, both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Jonah and Sam from this trilogy of games make an appearance in Netflix's Tomb Raider animated series</a>.</p>
<p>However, other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, we are yet to find out which other characters from the Tomb Raider series more generally will be popping up in Amazon's live-action adventure. Will Turner's Lara also meet those from earlier games such as Jonah? Or even someone like Werner Von Croy, Lara's former mentor who popped up in the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-last-revelation">Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation</a>? </p>
<p>The wording from Story Kitchen doesn't make it totally clear which games, past or future, it will be unifying. It's unclear if the company is referring to Amazon and Crystal Dynamics' new game in the franchise, or if it will be canon with previous games in the series.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-adds-another-major-cast-member">actor Martin Bobb-Semple was cast in Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider series</a>, but as who remains to be seen (though, some have speculated he will play tech-expert Zip).</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will hear more information about Amazon's Tomb Raider series and game soon!</p>

            <p>Antireal, the artist at the heart of a plagiarism scandal involving Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, has posted a statement on social media indicating the saga has come to a close.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1995907613004018047?s=20">Antireal posted the following tweet</a>: "The Marathon art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction." There has been no follow-up by Antireal elaborating on the situation, nor has any statement been released <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame">on the official Marathon social media account</a>.</p>
<p>This appears to be the end of Marathon's plagiarism woes. Some, responding to Antireal's statement, are speculating that it was made as part of a deal between Antireal and Bungie / Sony. However, this has not been verified.</p>

<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Antireal first posted a lengthy breakdown</a> of where their art appeared in Marathon's first public Closed Beta back in May of this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Following this, Bungie announced an investigation into the matter</a>, eventually admitting that yes, Antireal's art had been used during the development of Marathon. Following this controversy as well as the mixed reception to its initial beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">morale at Bungie was reportedly in freefall</a>, though it is worth noting vast changes have been made to the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">in the run up to its release in March, 2026</a>.</p><p>Marathon's cinematic short director also chipped in last month, stating in now-deleted social media posts that the plagiarism scandal was "blown out of proportion". He also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-not-ai-oscar-winning-marathon-cinematic-short-director-hits-back-at-online-accusations">pushed back passionately against claims that AI was used in the creation of the frankly fantastic looking cinematic he directed</a>.</p>

            <p>
Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione's first-person narrative horror Horses has received a last-minute ban from the Epic Games Store. Epic was one of several storefronts confirmed to have approved a build for release when news of Horses' ban from Steam emerged, but it has now reversed its decision, citing what Santa Ragione calls "broad and demonstrably incorrect claims".
</p>
<p>
Horses unfolds across 14 days on a farm where humans are held captive as "horses", using the imagery to explore what Santa Ragione describes as "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility". Last week, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">revealed Steam had refused to distribute Horses</a> - citing concerns around an early, unfinished build, and declining to reappraise the game once it was finished. Despite Valve's rejection, Horses was approved for distribution on all other major PC storefronts, but Epic has now made an eleventh hour reversal.

<p>
In an <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/index.html#Q17">FAQ discussing the U-turn</a> on its website, Santa Ragione says it received notification from Epic 24 hours before Horses' release, the storefront explaining it would no longer distribute the game after its "review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines". Epic's email specifically referenced its policies around "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content" - saying Horses contravenes guidelines prohibiting content that "promotes abuse and animal abuse", that "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour or [that is] not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated". On this latter point, Epic said it had filled out an IARC Questionnaire based on the content it reviewed, receiving an Adult Only (AO) rating - a rating category it does not distribute on its storefront.

Epic noted Santa Ragione had several options, including updating Horses to ensure compliance and resubmitting it for review. However, the studio says Epic did not specifically highlight the content it had found objectionable, nor would it have been possible to make significant changes so close to launch.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Santa Ragione chose to immediately appeal Epic's decision, addressing each of the storefront's concerns. It noted the "four brief" sex scenes featured in Horses - two occurring "mainly off camera" - are censored using pixellation, use "stylised and unrealistic" animations, and do not involve involve genitalia. As to Epic's other point, Santa Ragione stressed Horses "does not promote abuse (including animal abuse)" and is rather a "strong critique of violence and abuse in general." It also reiterated that its own IARC submission - filed "more than five weeks" before release - resulted in PEGI 18 and ESRB M ratings, as displayed on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Epic's Horses page</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione says it then received an automated response from Epic 12 hours later rejecting its appeal, with the storefront insisting it had determined its original decision was "appropriately applied and will remain in place". It remains unclear what prompted Epic's apparent decision to instigate a last-minute re-review of Horses; Santa Ragione insists the storefront had received and reviewed a build two months ago, with its final achievements-ready build being approved for release 18 days prior to launch. Eurogamer has contacted Epic for comment on the story.
</p>
<p>
Horses continues to be available via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a> and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch.io</a>, where it costs £4.99/$4.99. Epic's decision has temporarily impacted its availability on Humble, but Santa Ragione says it's received confirmation from Humble that it will still be distributing the game - although a build is yet to go live.
</p><p>If you're curious about Horses itself, I reviewed it earlier this week ahead of launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">awarding it four out of five stars</a> and calling it a "rallying cry against hypocrisy, institutional or otherwise, and one that feels particularly potent right now, as puritanism and anti-intellectualism continue to exert themselves".

            <p>Fresh footage of Resident Evil Requiem was shown on Japanese television, and it's very reminiscent of classic series gameplay.</p>
<p>The footage was part of a special programme, and has been shared on social media by series insider Dusk Golem.</p>
<p>It's only thirty seconds long, but it shows protagonist Grace Ashcroft exploring a creepy mansion in third-person, shooting at zombies before being grabbed and nibbled on.</p>

<p>It's not much to go on, admittedly, and that description alone probably sounds incredibly trite. But it does suggest a return to the sort of gameplay and setting that made Resident Evil such a popular series, which will be music to the ears of longtime fans.</p>
<p>Specifically, it looks very reminiscent of Resident Evil 1 - although that's likely not the iconic Spencer Mansion we'll be exploring.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There was some new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay of a new area with Grace fighting a zombie in the Resident Evil special program that aired on Japanese television. <a href="https://t.co/FToPeqi4HW">pic.twitter.com/FToPeqi4HW</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1996158141793489389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>Dusk Golem clarified the footage will be from a censored Japanese version, which typically censors headshots and dismemberment, for example.</p>
<p>The mainline series has strayed from its roots somewhat from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a> onwards, experimenting with new settings, new perspectives, and new protagonists. Resident Evil Requiem, meanwhile, seems to be attempting to appease a wide spectrum of fans: there's a new protagonist, but linked to the older games; it allows players to shift between first and third-person perspectives; and it returns to Racoon City at last. </p>
<p>Now we know there's a new mansion to explore, to boot.</p>
<p>Further, producer Masato Kumazawa <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who">confirmed characters from previous games in the series will return</a>, though told fans not to "over-expect or hype it". Fans have long been speculating the return of series favourite Leon Kennedy, but we still don't know for sure if he'll appear.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is the biggest third-party launch on Xbox Game Pass this year, with game director Guillaume Broche stating the subscription service allowed the studio to reach a wider audience.</p>
<p>The stat, shared on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/03/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-pass-biggest-launch/">Xbox Wire</a>, is based on the number of unique users in the first 30 days of the game's availability, meaning it made an immediate impact on the service.</p>
<p>"This year has been so far beyond what any of us could have imagined, and it's down to how passionate and supportive our fans have been to make that a reality," said Broche. "It's really nerve-wracking to be a new studio releasing our first game, but the support of everyone has really made everything feel like a dream."</p>

<p>Broche added the game's inclusion on Game Pass let "a lot of people try our game when maybe they might not have before".</p>
<p>He continued: "The turn-based RPG genre has a lot of fans but sometimes it might put people who prefer more real-time action games off, but Game Pass lowered that barrier of entry. They could just try it and see how it feels. So a lot of curious players could start the game, explore Lumière and the early game, and realise there's a lot to enjoy here, even if they weren't expecting it at first."</p><p>Expedition 33 also released on PC and PlayStation 5 at the same time as its inclusion on Xbox Game Pass. In its first three days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">the game sold a million copies</a>. It then reached the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">fitting milestone of 3.3m copies in a month</a>; most recently, the studio announced it had sold over 5m copies worldwide across all formats. Presumably, the number of overall players is even larger thanks to Game Pass.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">stiff competition at launch with the surprise release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which also released on Game Pass. However, publisher Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan said "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>
<p>Xbox will be keen for positivity around Game Pass following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price hike earlier this year</a>. And while Expedition 33 is a success for the subscription, without actual numbers it's hard to ascertain how it compares with other platforms. Still, it's further proof <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-xbox-game-pass-dies-then-well-have-lost-one-of-gamings-best-tools-for-discovery">Game Pass remains a great tool for discovery</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">An update is in the works for Expedition 33</a>, which Broche teased to Eurogamer will have "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well". He also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">reflected on the game's success</a>, stating the team is "incredibly moved and grateful at how big [the game] got and how it emotionally resonated with people".</p>

            <p>I've got an issue with people saying 'turn-based games are back, baby'. For those with the eyes to see, they never went away. Yes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor Refantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> might have reminded the masses that tactical min/maxing is video game catnip, and that there are so many brain-scratching things you can do with the formula, but the past few generations has been rife with gems in the genre: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeon-encounters-review-all-star-team-assembles-for-one-of-square-enixs-most-fascinating-rpgs-in-an-age">Dungeon Encounters</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chained-echoes">Chained Echoes</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes">Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</a> immediately spring to mind, but there are dozens more, too.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> 0 has come at a tough time. To stand tall amongst the wealth of RPGs we've had over the past five years alone would be a mammoth task, let alone coming after the first two games in the Octopath series, which are juggernauts in their own right. To make things even harder for the third attempt at the series, Octopath Traveler 0 is a 'reimagining' of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mobile-game-octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent-due-this-year">mobile gacha game, Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</a>. The bones of this mobile effort are still propping up all the flesh of 0, for better and - mostly - worse.</p>
<p>The core of Octopath Traveler 0 is made up of three story arcs, dubbed 'Masters Of': there's power, wealth, and fame, and whilst the first 30 or so hours of the game have you working through each of these tales incrementally, the latter portion of the game (probably about 70 hours) dovetails into something more linear. I like this. I found the eight very separate narratives in the original game a bit jarring and arrhythmic, this feels more in line with the second game's attempt to write a story that's more cohesive and put-together.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Break stuff. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Initially, these stories were separate arcs you could churn through in Champions of the Continent, and whilst 0 does an adequate job of finding a through-line to connect them, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has not managed to erase their standalone nature in the final product. It is fun to struggle through level-appropriate arcs in one breath, and then go and obliterate weaker bosses in early stages of other tales, but it never feels that rewarding to do so: the experience scaling is pretty brutal, so going back overpowered often feels like it leaves you at a disadvantage. You're better cycling through the stories as you go, which summons that feeling of arrhythmia from the first game. It's a shame, really.</p><p>The writing is pretty decent, and I even played a lot of this game with English dub (something I tend not to do in most Japanese RPGs because, frankly, the VO is usually awful). But, similarly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> from earlier this year, the English voice work is superb, and engaging, and natural. The art, too, is gorgeous. I've been playing on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and running in handheld, it looks incredibly pretty. Particular credit goes to the locations and world map, painted by Italian painter and cartographer Francesca Baerald. Using the talents of an actual honest-to-God cartographer makes the whole thing feel Tolkien-esque, and given the setting of Osterra is a big part of the game's driving force, it's money and time well-spent.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Rebuilt this city. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a shame about the rest of it, then. The piecemeal nature of the original mobile game is evident no matter where you look. Even giving you a hometown that you have to rebuild (which puts me in mind of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bravely-default">Bravely Default</a>, actually) does little to plaster over the very obvious joins in the facade. As you meander from story to story, you can just feel how different bits have been glued together, the only constant being your team of heroes that are getting stronger and more bullish as you dispatch the various political, social, and religious evils that plague the fair land of Osterra.</p>
<p>In a year when we've seen such lofty and emotionally-driven stories such as Tactics and Clair Obscur, it feels archaic and a little misguided. The eventual way the narratives meet is fine, I guess, but after 30 or 40 hours of tolerating this stop-start pacing, it's not the payoff I'd expect. Even when you do reach the 'Master of All' arc - surprise, surprise! - the game segments things off again. And there are more false endings than Peter Jackson's take on Return of the King. Maybe if I was playing the game with fewer constraints, I'd have more patience for this, but paired with the sheer length of some of the boss battles and even regular encounters, I found Octopath Traveler 0 to be a real slog at times - and that's coming from someone with a high tolerance for this kind-of setup.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The festive season. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>I do really enjoy the synergy you can have with eight characters, though: an upgrade to the four-member parties of the previous games. But when you need to rely on swapping everyone in just to have a realistic crack at finishing off an overly tanky boss, even that novelty begins to lose its impact around 50 hours in. There is a purity to the combat I found compelling, though: there're no flashy mega-special moves, and talking to townsfolk to recruit them for one-off attacks that may cover weaknesses your current party isn't equipped to exploit feels like a meta in and of itself.</p><p>Octopath Traveler 0 is weaker than the sum of its parts. On their own, the mini stories, the town-building mechanic, and the combat all feel pretty good (if not revolutionary). But mashed together into this lumbering, uncoordinated chimera, it misses the mark. Games in this genre, operating at this scope and scale, need to feel more cohesive to keep your attention into the triple digits, and I think the experiment Square Enix has toyed with here proves you can't really do that when your trying to hammer so many pegs of various shapes into one, singular round hole.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has cast a new voice actress for Samus.</p>
<p>If (or should that be when) you succumb to the barrage of enemies that will be heading your way on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's release tomorrow, it will not be Jennifer Hale that you will hear screaming in pain. </p>
<p>Rather for this release, Hale - who lent her vocal talents to the role of Samus in the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> trilogy - has instead been replaced with American stage and voice actress Erin Yvette.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>You may have already heard Yvette's voice in many of earlier works. Yvette's previous video game roles include Snow White in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/telltale-games">Telltale Games</a>' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-wolf-among-us">The Wolf Among Us</a> and Alex in Night School Studio's debut Oxenfree.</p>
<p>More recently, the actress also voiced Blonde Blazer in AdHoc's brilliant (I honestly can't recommend this game enough) superhero workplace comedy, Dispatch.</p>
<p>It is worth noting though, that while Yvette is credited with voicing Samus in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, the character doesn't exactly talk your ear off in the game. Rather, it is more about those all important effort noises when Samus is making her way through the world, and of course that death scream. To give more context, Yvette's performance in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is on par with Hale's own performance as Samus in Metroid Prime 3, I am reliably told.</p>

<p>For more on Samus' chatter (or lack thereof), our Alex recently shared his thoughts about Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's almost silent protagonist.

"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Eurogamer's Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review</a>.</p>

            <p>There's been a lot of chatter surrounding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> since its launch. The latest release in a juggernaut franchise, some are seeing cracks in the armour due to a mixed reception to various parts of the game, as well as the little data we have pointing to surprising sales figures.</p>
<p>It is no secret that this year is a tough one all round for the video games industry, but it's also true that the last month or so has been packed full of big releases that could theoretically challenge Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, as mentioned previously, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> which remains a powerhouse. Are these the main two sources of what ails CoD, or is it something else? Or, perhaps, is Call of Duty totally fine.</p>
<p>To help me find out what's going on with Microsoft's heaviest hitter, I sat down with two experts on the numbers behind the headlines in the video game industry. The first, Chris Dring from The Game Business. He first reported the difference in sales between Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6 last week. The second, Rhys Elliott, head of market analysis at Alinea Analytics, a company that has continuously published sales estimates for a variety of titles in recent months, delving into industry performance on some of the largest releases within that window.</p>

<p>So first, why has Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 seemingly sold below expectations?</p>
<p><strong>Dring</strong>: "Well, below expectations: I don't know what they were expecting. That's the first thing I'll say. It seems lower for us because we're used to certain numbers. Call of Duty has had a hard year. It had a spectacular launch with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> 12 months ago - that did very big numbers out of the gate, did very well on Game Pass and sold very well, too.</p><p>"But actually I track daily active users, and all year Call of Duty's numbers have been quite low - lower than usual. There have been some exceptions though, January was great coming off Black Ops 6, there was a boost in April / May, but generally speaking fewer people are playing Call of Duty this year than they have been before. That's despite Black Ops 6 as the previous gaming being brilliant in people's eyes.</p>
<p>"In fact, in September, it was the lowest point I've seen Call of Duty since the launch of their Call of Duty HQ. So it's just been slightly lower. It's been a tougher year for Call of Duty, but it's not the only game to have a tougher year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, too, has dipped a bit."</p>
<p><strong>Elliot</strong>: "Call of Duty is underperforming this year due to a combination of community burnout, questionable creative and business decisions by Activision/Microsoft, and strong competition. Xbox dropped the ball on the wrong year, as this year saw some of the most exciting shooter releases in years.</p>
<p>"One reason for the decline is the intense competition from rival shooters, mostly Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders. The new Battlefield title had a massive launch, securing the biggest opening in its franchise's history. Arc has sold almost 8 million copies so far, and the latest Fortnite Simpsons crossover was a hit. Attention is scarce.</p><p>"Players have expressed growing dissatisfaction with CoD's lack of innovation, feeling that the franchise is ailing. The introduction of Fortnite-like cosmetic items like non-military character skins (Beavis and Butthead, Nicki Minaj) has alienated a significant portion of the fanbase who prefer a more grounded military aesthetic. The co-op campaign was a major point of criticism. It was uneven and tedious when played solo, while also requiring an always-online connection. It also drew controversy and ire for its use of AI slop in game.</p>
<p>"Player reception was [also] largely negative, with a mostly negative Steam user score and review bombing galore. Long-standing player frustrations, like the perceived impact of skill-based matchmaking -and the focus on heavy microtransactions (skins and bundles) over core gameplay quality, continue to drive players away from the franchise.</p>
<p>"Microsoft's decision to put Black Ops 7 on Game Pass on day one has cannibalised traditional full-price game sales on Xbox and PC, with last year's game losing a reported $300 million in potential sales due to the service. Our estimates have signalled time and time again that Game Pass cannibalises game revenues - and Call of Duty is no different.</p>
<p>"The marketing for Black Ops 7 was pretty abysmal and underwhelming, generating little positive buzz. The marketing cycle tried to appeal to everyone, but ended up appealing to nobody. The reveal event, CoD Next, was messy and did little to excite the community. This is again in stark contrast to the community-driven, focused marketing of Battlefield and ARC, whose development and marketing has been incredibly community-driven."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>So we know the numbers, and we've got a good idea as to why Call of Duty itself may be struggling. Another important question is, how big a part have other games had in this year's surprising Black Ops 7 performance? Are current woes largely self-made, or has Call of Duty been kicked while it was down?</p><p><strong>Dring</strong>: "It's been more competitive during Black Ops 7's launch than before. Battlefield 6 is a direct competitor. The data from Ampere that I reported on a few weeks ago showed that around a quarter of people who played Battlefield on Xbox had played Call of Duty the month before. So they are active Call of Duty players that came to Battlefield. I know Battlefield is a different game to Call of Duty, it's a war shooter but it has a different vibe to it, but it's worth noting that Call of Duty players are known to try different things. Helldivers 2, around six million players in their first year were Call of Duty players according to Arrowhead. That's one of the things that messed up Helldivers 2 in the early days, they didn't know how to cater to this surge of players.</p>
<p>"Arc Raiders had a lesser impact than Battlefield 6 did, but if you're just launching a brand-new shooter on the market and it's getting a mixed reception. You've got Arc Raiders as well as Battlefield 6 out, so it didn't really come out in the best environment.</p>
<p>"Now look, even if the franchise has fallen a little bit this year, it's still mega numbers. We're still mostly over 20m active monthly players - most games would kill for that. But it's dipping below what it was before due to a mix of the competitive environment it released in and it perhaps didn't connect with people in the same way it may have done in the past."</p>
<p><strong>Elliot</strong>: "While the issues with Black Ops 7 certainly aren't helping things, the attention economy is oversaturated in general - especially in the live-service genre, which is highly zero sum.</p>
<p>"Many major publishers, inspired by the runaway successes of games like Fortnite and Roblox, piled into the live-service market seeking quick profits. But the gold rush has largely concluded. So, the big live-service players - the incumbents if you're addled with consultant brain (like me) - are continuing to dominate the segment, owing to inertia and improvements to their content.</p>
<p>"This fierce competition, coupled with the difficulty of convincing gamers to abandon their established habits, cosmetic investments, and friendship groups - a powerful sunk-cost fallacy - is the primary reason for the high failure rate among new live-service shooters.</p>
<p>"The dominance of the incumbents is partly due to their optimised content treadmills, which demand constant attention from their player base. This constant stream of updates, 'live-ops,' necessitates ever-swelling development and operating budgets. These high costs are increasingly scaring away new competitors, especially given the lengthy list of expensive live-service failures in recent years. Many new entries, despite generating strong initial hype and high download numbers at launch, have struggled to sustain player retention and have quickly seen their player counts drop off.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>When all your time and stuff is on one game, it's hard to move on. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Epic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"The current market is seeing successful new entrants break through by carefully exploiting gaps in the established landscape, though. Marvel Rivals, for instance, successfully capitalised on a perceived weakness or dissatisfaction with the established hero-shooter market, particularly Overwatch 2. Similarly, Embark's Arc Raiders made the highly competitive extraction shooter genre more broadly appealing and palatable to a wider audience, demonstrating a strategic way to carve out a new niche rather than directly challenging the behemoths. Embark also applied learnings from The Finals to build scalable server tech, robust net code, and a content pipeline that supports rapid iteration.</p><p>"A particularly effective strategy is to pivot away from the hyper-competitive player-versus-player (PvP) segment entirely. Helldivers 2 and, to a large extent, the success of ARC this year, show that significant gains are still possible. Helldivers 2's breakout success was largely due to its focus on cooperative player-versus-environment (PvE) gameplay and strong community interaction, a segment that currently holds far more potential for a new title to break through and build a loyal audience compared to the intensely competitive PvP space.</p>
<p>"So yes, Black Ops 7's specific issues contribute to its underperformance, but in general there's a systemic challenge: the live-service shooter market is now ruthlessly consolidated. Finding consistent success in this segment is difficult, even for a massive, established franchise. The path to success is no longer a guaranteed annual release, but rather requires exceptional product quality, genuine innovation, or finding a neglected sub-genre or new niche, where the inertia of the 'incumbents' does not yet hold absolute sway."</p>

<p>Horii was also joined by former editor of Shonen Jump Kazuhiko Torishima, who noted a number of Chrono Trigger-related projects that were previously announced, including a concert series planned for next year. Torishima asked Horii if there would be any developments in the franchise.</p><p>"I can't talk about that," said Horii, becoming flustered. He added: "Wait, if I say that, you'll figure it out!", "Don't ask!", "Asking is off-limits!", and "I'll get in trouble!", to which the panel collectively laughed. Torishima cheekily replied: "There's something".</p>
<p>It would seem, then, there's at least something in the works, even if Horii remains tight-lipped on any details.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> acknowledged the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger earlier this year, stating it would launch "various projects that go beyond the world of the game over the next year to express our gratitude to everyone who has played Chrono Trigger so far."</p>
<p>Of course, fans speculated a remake or re-release could be in the works, though there's been nothing official on this. Horii's latest comments are certainly fueling the fire, however.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of other projects inspired by Chrono Trigger you can check out: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-clockwork-dlc-will-release-later-this-month">Sea of Stars received DLC</a> earlier this year, while future games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-a-french-made-rpg-that-takes-inspiration-from-japanese-rpgs-and-was-actually-made-by-a-team-of-30-edge-of-memories-should-scratch-that-itch">Edge of Memories</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-chrono-trigger-celebrates-30th-anniversary-spiritual-successor-threads-of-time-gets-fresh-gameplay-trailer">Threads of Time</a> are heavily inspired by Square Enix's classic.</p>

            <p>
Well-received horror game No Players Online has returned to Steam after nearly three weeks of unavailability, which its developer Beeswax Games has blamed on an "unfounded" DMCA takedown notice filed by a "former friend".
</p>
<p>
No Players Online is a narrative adventure in which players explore the files of a '90s desktop PC in order to uncover the secrets of a long-abandoned shooter. It started life as a short Game Jam title in 2019, garnering positive critical attention and something of a cult following - and an expanded reimagining was launched for Steam at the start of November. Not long after, keen-eyed horror fans began noticing it had disappeared, with Beeswax Games initially appearing unsure why, and promising to "figure out what's going on".

<p>
Three weeks on, Beeswax Games has announced No Players Online's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/">return to Steam</a>, shedding some light on the reason for its initial disappearance. "[The game] was removed from steam for nearly three weeks right after launch, following a DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) claim made by a former friend," the studio explained in a <a href="https://noplayersonline.net/statement">message shared on its website</a>. "They claimed to be a co-author of the game despite not having done anything for it. No Players Online was made completely from scratch by our team."
</p><p>
Beeswax, which counts the 2019 game's trio of creators - Adam Pype, Tibau Van den Broeck, and Viktor Kraussays - among its number, say the unnamed individual "recklessly filed the DMCA to Steam without any notice", resulting in the game's removal a little over a week after launch. "We immediately filed a counter-notice," it continued, "and today the game has been reinstated after the time for them to respond has passed."
</p>
<p>
"It's crazy to me that someone can just take down our game by filling out a simple form," it added. "It's been tough trying to reconcile with this betrayal from someone I considered a dear friend." Beeswax doesn't detail the specifics of the disagreement, only saying it attempted to offer clarity to the claimant prior to the filing that "their allegations were completely unfounded".
</p>
<p>
"This situation has had a significant impact on us," it continued, "especially given how crucial the first months after release are for small indies like us." The studio says it spent a "ton of money" over the two and a half years it took to complete No Players Online, and that its temporary removal from Steam means it "lost out on much needed momentum and revenue". As a result, Beeswax is "unsure if [it] will be able to recover financially" given its "already thin margins", and says the future of the studio is uncertain. However, it remains "committed to doing all that we have planned still for No Players Online".
</p>
<p>
DMCA copyright claims have proven highly controversial over the years, given the ease with which they can be abused. In 2023, for instance, Soviet city-builder game Workers &amp; Resources was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soviet-city-builder-game-taken-off-steam-due-to-nonsense-dmca-strike-from-rogue-fan">temporarily pulled from Steam</a> following a "nonsense" DMCA notice from an angry fan, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> studio Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-files-lawsuit-against-individuals-behind-false-destiny-copyright-takedowns">launched legal action against a disgruntled YouTuber in 2022</a>, accusing them of maliciously filing fraudulent takedown notices against other content creators in retaliation for a DMCA filing by Bungie's own team.

            <p>A senior developer who worked on Larian's much loved and critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has moved studios, and is now working with Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk studio CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>Senior developer Felix Pedulla worked at Larian for six years on the cinematic side of the team, before announcing his departure this week. He called his time at the Baldur's Gate 3 studio an "incredible" and "frankly wild" ride.</p>

<p>"I'm so grateful for every chaotic, creative, and unforgettable moment we shared.

"A huge thank you to all my incredible colleagues and friends I made."</p>
<p>The developer has now moved to CD Projekt Red, where he will "trade in [his] <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> dice for some Polish steel" as the company's new senior cinematic designer. It's time to "get to work crafting some epic cutscenes," Pedulla closed.</p><p>While the cinematic designer did not say which of CDPR's games he would be working on, it is fair to assume that he will be lending his talents to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Just last month, it was confirmed some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">key Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 development talent had also made the jump to CD Projekt and Ciri's new adventure</a>.</p>

<p>As for The Witcher 4, its<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star"> first trailer was revealed at last year's The Game Awards</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-not-at-the-game-awards-this-year">don't expect it to show up again this year</a>.</p>
<p>We got another look at the next Witcher game in-action back in June. The team did caveat though, that though that particular demo may have looked like gameplay, it was actually a representation of what the tech could do, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">wasn't actually representative of the final game</a>. The performance seen during said tech demo is what the game is aiming for, however. At this time, the studio also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4s-northern-setting-revealed-in-new-unreal-livestream">showed off the northern setting for The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has released a new update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and it's another big one.</p>
<p>Version 1.4.0, to give it its proper name, has made swathes of changes to Nintendo's latest Mario Kart installment, ranging from the way music tracks are displayed all the way to UFO entries.</p>
<p>There are tweaks to the smart steering, some course changes for those taking part in "VS Race", "Race" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play", and adjustments to the speed at which Dash food reappears. You will also now dash when riding on Manta Ramp's back, and there also <em>so much</em> more on the list. Nintendo has really gone to town with this one.</p>
<p>Alas, there's still no mention of racing on individual tracks in multiplayer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-fine-tunes-race-selection-in-vs-race-pool-responding-to-player-criticism">but we all know that's something everyone wants</a>. Maybe next time...</p>

            <p>Obsidian Entertainment, one of gaming's busiest developers, has announced a delay for this year's remaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> update. This was to include a Photo mode and New Game Plus mode, among other things, and it will now be held back - as well as enlarged - for the game's anniversary on 18th February 2026.</p>
<p>"If you've been following our Update Roadmap, you'll know we planned to release an update this fall. To break the bad news first: Avowed will not be receiving a fall update," <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1995917924708876634">Obsidian announced on X</a>. "The good news is that we're shifting our efforts toward a larger update coming next February, timed with the anniversary of the game's release.</p>
<p>"This update will include everything originally planned for fall, plus additional features that will make it our biggest update yet. Stay tuned as we head into the new year for more details on what's planned for the Living Lands."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=equGBZBUjVg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>The features listed for the Anniversary update include the New Game Plus mode, the Photo mode, a new weapon type, "changing appearance in the world" (which I think means the ability to change your character's appearance in the world), new character presets, more Godlike feature presets, "and many more". The other two updates this year - one in the spring, one in the summer - brought new abilities, items, NPC behaviours, an arachnophobia-safe mode, and other improvements.</p><p>Avowed was a very pleasant surprise when it arrived at the beginning of the year. A carefree action-adventure which delighted in exaggerated fantasy, it used smaller open-world areas to provide a sandbox exploration experience, and matched them with a tactile and experimental combat system to strong, and very enjoyable, effect. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">I was very complimentary of Avowed in my review</a>.</p>
<p>Avowed wasn't Obsidian's only big RPG released this year, however. The studio also released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-2-review">sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds 2 in October, which Alex reviewed and liked</a>, and the studio released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, which was a collaboration with Eidos Montreal. That's an early access release so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-wobbles-while-walking-a-line-between-frustration-and-brilliance">Grounded 2 is still finding its little insect legs</a>, but it's a powerful new foundation for the game and franchise to build on for, potentially, years to come.</p>

            <p>According to new filings, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is set to own the vast majority of EA if the proposed record-breaking acquisition goes through.</p>
<p>These filings, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/saudi-fund-to-own-almost-all-of-electronic-arts-after-buyout-661e92be?mod=hp_lead_pos4">discovered by the Wall Street Journal</a>, have been made to Brazilian antitrust regulators. These filings suggest that Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would own 93.4 percent of the video game publisher.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund is making this attempt to acquire EA alongside private equity funds Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter founded and owned by Jarred Kushner - son-in-law to President Donald Trump.  Silver Lake would own 5.5 percent, while Affinity Partners would own 1.1 percent.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">First announcing their intent in September</a>, these plans<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-union-workers-rally-against-55bn-saudi-backed-private-acquisition-with-formal-petition-to-regulators"> have been protested by both video game unions</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">human rights groups</a>. The acquisition itself is record breaking due to the absurd $55bn cost attached to taking the video game giant private. Of that $55bn, $20bn is in debt.</p><p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">they are expected to proceed smoothly according to reports</a>. That being said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-investment-fund-reportedly-low-on-cash-and-limiting-investment-following-ea-acquisition">the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund may be a little strapped for cash at the moment</a>. The Public Investment Fund will still need to put up billions of dollars to actually take ownership of EA once it is approved over the next year or so.</p>
<p>CEO of EA Andrew Wilson spoke on the deal, stating: "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club Games is at a "make-or-break" moment in the studio's history, and needs Mina the Hollower to do well.</p>
<p>Mina the Hollower is a game I have had my eye on since I started at Eurogamer. In fact, I think its announcement was one of the very first articles I wrote for the site. In a first for the company, Mina the Hollower has nothing to do with Shovel Knight. Rather, this time players will have the chance to take on the mantle of adorable but feisty mouse Mina as she sets out to save a cursed island from the perils that have befallen it.</p>
<p>The game features a top-down adventure style reminiscent of Game Boy Zelda game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a> in a gothic, Castlevania-esque world. And, a lot rides on its success when it comes out next year.</p>

<p>As detailed in a new report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/creator-of-hit-game-shovel-knight-is-at-make-or-break-moment">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled), in the time since Shovel Knight, Yacht Club divided its team in two (with one team set to work on an unannounced 3D version of Shovel Knight which it had "been fantasizing about for years", and one to work on the "less ambitious" Mina the Hollower). Yacht Club also moved into a new office in Los Angeles. However, then the pandemic hit in 2020, and Yacht Club like the rest of us had to adjust to a different way of doing things.</p><p>Work on Mina the Hollower didn't progress as quickly as the studio had hoped, and in 2024, Yacht Club acknowledged that the two-team structure wasn't working, and after laying off some staff and cutting back on other expenses, merged back into one team. The studio's focus was now solely on Mina the Hollower, and work on the Shovel Knight sequel was paused. The project also had a change in leadership, with studio founder Sean Velasco taking over as director from Mina the Hollower's Alec Faulkner, who is said to have clashed with some of his team.</p>
<p>And now, it is "make-or-break for sure," Velasco has admitted. "If we sold 500,000 copies, then we would be golden," he said of Mina the Hollower. "If we sold even 200,000, that would be really, really great."</p>
<p>However, if the studio only sells around  100,000 copies of Mina the Hollower, "that's not so good". The studio founder did say that if Mina the Hollower were to "flop", then Yacht Club Games would still exist, but it would require some kind of cash injection fast. The studio is already taking steps to keep the studio afloat, and will be moving to fully remote at the end of the year. It will also be shifting its attention to only working on one project at a time.</p>
<p>"What we're doing in the future is try to figure out ways to have a game come out every couple of years, instead of every five or six," said Nick Wozniak, another Yacht Club founder.</p>
<p>"We haven't released a game in so long."</p>

<p>Mina the Hollower was intended to debut on 31st October, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-developers-zelda-like-game-mina-the-hollower-delayed">was pushed back without a new release date earlier this year</a>. At this time, Yacht Club stated it wasn't "a major delay" but just "a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine".</p><p>I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-the-fabled-hollow-knight-the-much-anticipated-bloodlines-2-and-more">played the demo for Mina the Hollower on Switch 2 earlier this year</a>, and loved it. "I collected Bonestone, I popped off various goblins and bats, I burrowed my way underneath enemies to spring up excitingly from behind and I negotiated perilous pits, all while bopping along to a gloriously retro-infused soundtrack… Oh yes, I am certainly looking forward to Mina the Hollower's full release," I wrote back in August. This feeling hasn't changed.</p>

            <p>The team working on Amazon's live-action God of War series is growing.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/">Deadline</a>, Emmy winning director Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series.</p>

<p>Toye has worked on a number of acclaimed shows during his expansive career, including Westworld, The Boys and The Walking Dead. He is also no stranger to video game adaptations, having additionally helmed episodes of Amazon's Fallout series.</p>
<p>Last year, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for historical drama Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.</p>
<p>The director joins showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on Amazon's God of War series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>
<p>Pre-production for the show is now underway in Vancouver, and casting for the God of War series has begun. Do you have any thoughts on who may play who? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, while we still don't have a release window for the first season, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon</a>. To quote Kratos, "Boy!"</p>

            <section><p>Santa Ragione delivers a subversive, sometimes shocking, often funny first-person narrative horror that, while perhaps a little insubstantial, remains an engagingly unconventional exploration of some timely themes.</p></section>
<p>One thing that's probably got a bit lost in all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">controversy</a> preceding Horses' release is the fact it's surprisingly funny. Its humour is pitch black, yes, and its comedic moments often dance on a knife's edge between laughter and revulsion, but writer and director Andrea Lucco Borlera's first-person narrative horror - his debut game, created in close collaboration with Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione - is a fascinatingly singular vision. It's singular enough, in fact, that it's not an easy thing to effectively describe, but if you can imagine a sort of thematic reinterpretation of Animal Farm by way of Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salo on one side, and a meme-able Garry's Mod video on the other, then Horses gleefully oscillates between them, landing somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>There are moments in Horses that will almost certainly shock - although it's far from the transgressive, decency shattering work some have supposed it to be - and there are moments so outlandishly, intentionally stupid, the only response is to laugh. And sometimes it's hard to distinguish between the two, Horses' idiosyncratic approach creating a wilfully disorientating mood. Former film student Borlera's subversive tale borrows heavily from the language of cinema, his claustrophobic 1.33:1 aspect ratio, stark monochrome colour palette, and dialogue intertitles immediately evoking the silent movie era - with echoes, perhaps, of old newsreel propaganda. Mix in smash cuts, live-action interstitials, split-screen, and picture-in-picture, and the result is a restless, experimental amalgam of unconventional stylistic choices - realistic textures clashing with amateurish, awkwardly animated character models; unnervingly extreme close-ups; an almost complete absence of diegetic sound, replaced instead by the incessant whir of an unseen film projector - whose oppressive, destabilising ambience can't help but unmoor.</p>

<p>Enter Anselmo, Horses' blanky naive protagonist and player surrogate, who, on the cusp of his 20th year, is dispatched for 14 days of work on a remote farm. Perhaps, a blunt birthday missive from his father suggests, it'll be character-building; perhaps it'll help him "finally start acting like a man". The world of Horses, we soon learn, is one of moral extremities, exhibiting its own exaggerated framework of societal expectations and norms. And so begins a two week apprenticeship, deep in the Italian countryside, that rapidly takes a troubling turn.</p><p>If the avuncular farmer's firm instructions never to enter his room weren't enough of a red flag, we soon meet his prized "horses" - naked, filthy humans with rubber masks clamped to their heads, whose atypical nature takes an alarmingly long time to be acknowledged by anyone. It's an absurd, outlandish image, but also a sympathetic one, their (pixellated) nudity emphasising their dehumanising existence rather than intended for titillation. It's also an image likely to provoke an immediate emotional response in players. But Anselmo, blank slate that he is, merely pushes on, bound to the inescapable rhythm of the farmer's strict regime.</p>



<p>Daybreak means breakfast - three cheerfully decorated biscuits cheekily foreshadowing the events to come - then it's out into the world as the working day begins. Initially, the chores are mundane; you'll traipse from tool shed to vegetable patch to horse pen and back again, watering crops, feeding the animals, gathering up poop, and whatever else the farmer demands. Occasionally, visitors will come, expounding on the philosophy of Horses' exterior world before vanishing again, and the day ends with an evening meal, a smattering of conversation, and perhaps a restless night of unsettling visions. But as rebellious forces begin to exert their influence on the farm's philosophical microcosm, predictable routine succumbs to chaos, and your days - and the farmer's requirements - grow increasingly extreme.</p><p>Vegetable picking and wood chopping give way to burials and beatings, the days only growing weirder and bleaker across Horses' three-or-so hour runtime. But while Horses' content warning is expansive - touching on everything from suicide to sexual assault - it's perhaps also a little misleading, implying an all-out, atrocity filled horror show that never comes. Horses, for all its strange, startling imagery, isn't that kind of game. It remains darkly whimsical throughout, frequently tempering its horror with humour, and even its most indelible moments stop short of gratuitousness. Yes, it delights in pushing buttons - you'll gasp, you'll wince, you'll almost certainly be lost for words - but it never feels flippant and never tips over into exploitation.</p>



<p>Even so, comfort is clearly not the goal, and Borlera's approach seems specifically tailored to shake its audience out of a malaise. Horses is far from a subtle game, choosing to paint its themes in broad, bold brushstrokes rather than more deeply interrogating them - as happy to provoke a visceral response as it is an intellectual one. In that regard, it's a success, albeit perhaps also a fleeting, insubstantial one. And the decision to include simple choices - implying meaningful narrative malleability where there is none - is questionable, occasionally creating awkward moral inconsistencies and distracting contradictions that threaten to muddy the message a little. But still, Horses remains a thoughtful, deliberate work, exploring its themes of oppression and subjugation, and the cycles and systems that perpetuate them, in engagingly unconventional ways.</p>

<p>Sometimes with these kinds of tightly regimented narrative experiences you find yourself asking, what does this story gain from being a game? And if there's an answer here, it's perhaps the sense of reluctant complicity and powerlessness that Horses engenders, of ineffectual resistance gradually giving way to something more hopeful. It's a rallying cry against hypocrisy, institutional or otherwise, and one that feels particularly potent right now, as puritanism and anti-intellectualism continue to exert themselves - and those deemed 'different' are increasingly painted as a threat to society. Horses' approach, its delight in the grotesque, won't be palatable for everyone - but if it takes a clandestine toolshed blowjob, complete with plastic horsehead wobble, to seed its battle cry for revolution, to make its audience sit up and pay attention, then so be it.</p>

Back in October, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-explains-why-its-so-big-to-install-on-pc-and-why-that-wont-be-changing-anytime-soon">studio explained it was looking into methods of reducing the size by eliminating duplicated assets</a>, but warned loading times for mechanical HDDs could be 10 times slower.</p>
<p>However, the studio's "worst case projections did not come to pass" and now it has successfully reduced the PC installation size down to around 23GB, a reduction of approximately 131GB.</p>

<p>Essentially, Arrowhead had previously duplicated a load of assets to maintain fast loading times for players using older, mechanical HDDs - this method makes it quicker for relevant data to be found. But as modern SSDs don't work in the same way, duplication is unnecessary and instead simply takes up more space.</p>
<p>By eliminating duplicated assets, the size has reduced with minimal impact on loading - "seconds at most," says Arrowhead, in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/491583942944621371">new blog post on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>"We now know that, contrary to most games, the majority of the loading time in Helldivers 2 is due to level-generation rather than asset loading," the post reads. "This level generation happens in parallel with loading assets from the disk and so is the main determining factor of the loading time. We now know that this is true even for users with mechanical HDDs."</p><p>This reduced size is available now for players if they opt in to test the "slim version". "You can also opt-out at any time if you experience issues," the post reads. "It's a low-risk way to save ~131GB of space on your drive and help us extend our testing to real-life conditions."</p>
<p>Once this technical beta confirms there are no issues, it will become the default for all players. "Given the very minor differences in loading times between the two versions, there is no justification for us to keep supporting the legacy version long term," the studio said. "Maintaining the legacy version alongside the slim version would only add extra burden to our developers, build machines, QA teams and release processes. Assuming all goes smoothly, the legacy version will be discontinued some time next year."</p>
<p>Instructions can be found in the Steam post.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">Helldivers film has found its director</a> - Justin Lin, who's directed multiple films in the Fast and Furious franchise.</p>

            <p>The Forsaken Hollows, the forthcoming DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>, is "definitely a little bit harder" than the main game, its director has admitted.</p>
<p>That's par for the course at this point. FromSoftware is notorious for releasing DLC that expands on its games with an even higher level of challenge.</p>
<p>Still, director Junya Ishizaki has discussed the difficulties of balancing the game for both casual players and experts, based on player feedback.</p>

<p>"The main takeaway we had post-release was just there was a lot of trouble trying to get the balancing right," Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-has-reignited-my-interest/1100-6536543/">Gamespot</a>.</p>
<p>"I think balancing is just so subjective, so a lot of our thoughts post-release working up to the DLC were how can we get the balancing in mind with what we were initially envisioning, and also with that balancing set, how can we take a different approach and devise new enemies, new characters, and stuff like that to play into that and utilise the new balancing that we are working with."</p><p>The studio didn't want the game to be "so hard that new players can't get into it" but even veterans required time to figure out the intricacies of Nightreign. "So whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they'll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played Nightreign, where there's still a bit that they're trying to figure out," said Ishizaki.</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows is "definitely a little bit harder," he admitted, "but it's not ridiculous or anything like that, but that's still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most infamous DLC for its difficulty was Elden Ring's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, with the final boss in particular imposing a massive challenge.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also discussed the influence of that DLC on The Forsaken Hollows, even if it's not directly intentional. For instance, the new Shifting Earth event has more verticality than previous events, just as Shadow of the Erdtree was more vertical than Elden Ring.</p><p>"[The] idea behind that was that the original map was definitely very horizontally-focused, and when looking at that through the lens of working on DLC, we were thinking where else [was there] to go but up, right?" said Ishizaki. "We can add verticality to this and do it in a way that doesn't detract from the horizontal aspect of the map. So that was where that came from; trying to figure out how we can add to it in such a way that it expands upon the verticality.</p>
<p>"It's one of those things [where] a lot of our staff have also been playing Shadow of the Erdtree as the development for Nightreign has been going on. So there's probably a little bit of influence there, but I don't think [Erdtree's influence is] necessarily intentional. It might even be almost like subconscious, but there's definitely, I think, a bit of that for sure."</p>

<p>The Forsaken Hollows also adds new poison swamp areas, which are surprisingly missing from the base game.</p>
<p>"We're definitely aware of the [swamp] meme," said Ishizaki. "It's not like there's a rule or any sort of policy here where it's like we have to have a swamp in there, but it always seems to be [that before you realise] someone's come up with the idea, it's already sort of in there, and it's just sort of taken a life of its own."</p>
<p>The Forsaken Hollows launches this week on 4th December, adding two new Nightfarers to play as - the Scholar and the Undertaker - along with other additions, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-will-see-an-iconic-dark-souls-boss-return">return of an iconic Dark Souls boss</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is certainly a busy guy. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> might be out the way, but the famed game designer still has his plate full with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror OD</a>, and beyond that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">Metal Gear spiritual successor Physint</a>. Then there's his spirited social media presence, his regular phone calls with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, and now it, turns out, a swerve into Disney voice acting as he takes on the role of a mole.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Kojima has been cast as Paul Moldebrandt in the Japanese dub of Disney's Zootropolis 2, taking over from Josh Gad (Frozen's Olaf), who plays the character in the west. And if you're wondering how Kojima got involved, Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/59427">reports</a> he was directly asked to play Zootopia Police Department's mole role by the movie's director, Jared Bush.

</p>
<figcaption>Here's the latest teaser for Kojima's OD.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHCqxLtwy5g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Speaking to Famitsu (via Google Translate), Kojima said he accepted the role "without hesitation" after being approached, noting that while he's had "experience with cameos in live-action films and games" Zootopia 2 marks his first time dubbing an animated feature film, "and it's from Disney, of all places!"
</p><p>
Describing the original Zootopia as his "favourite film", he explained he "only took part in a small scene [for the sequel], but even at the time of recording, the level of detail was impressive." And while the recording process "went smoothly", Kojima noted he "learned a lot from the experience of actually acting. It made me realise how much attention voice actors pay to basic things like turning the pages of the script and noise".
</p>
<p>
Kojima, of course, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">pondering his advancing years in recent times</a>, noting back in January that he "can't help but think" about how much longer he'll be able to stay creative. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life," he added, "but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock." But those concerns don't appear to be slowing him down; currently in the works is Xbox-exclusive horror OD, which he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">previously described</a> as "something totally different" and people are going to either "love it or hate it".

            <p>Another Mega Evolution has been revealed ahead of the Mega Dimension DLC for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, this time for a fan-favourite 'mon.</p>
<p>What's more, a classic Legendary will also be making an appearance.</p>
<p>To recap, the DLC will be released on 10th December and expands the story due to spatial distortions across Lumiose City, which appear to be resulting in more Mega Evolutions - superpowered versions of Pokémon.</p>

<p>Mega Lucario Z has now been announced as part of the DLC, with the fighting/steel type sporting a new fringe and colour scheme.</p>
<p>Now, Lucario already has a Mega Evolution in Z-A, but the DLC will include this new Mega Lucario Z variant. Z Mega Evolutions require less time to initiate moves but use much more power, so are better suited to quick battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the iconic Mewtwo will also be making an appearance in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. The game now has an extra side mission available, where players will receive a Mewtwonite X stone and Mewtwonite Y stone as mystery gifts.</p>

            <p>Styx: Blades of Greed - the next entry in Cyanide Studio's infiltration series, which plops players into the shoes of a caustic goblin - will now release next year.</p>
<p>"Over the past months, the team has been pushing hard to bring this game to the level it deserves," the studio wrote, with a new release date trailer you can see further below in this article. "We've been polishing systems, tightening the stealth and combat loops, and making sure every area feels as sharp and atmospheric as it should.</p>
<p>"With this extra time, we can deliver the best possible version of the experience we've been building."</p>

<p>Cyanide Studio said it was "incredibly proud" of the work it has achieved so far, and it is now "even more motivated for the final stretch" of Styx: Blades of Greed's development. "Thank you for sticking with us," it closed. "Your support genuinely fuels the team."</p>
<p>Styx: Blades of Greed was initially set to release this year, but that date has now moved to 19th February, 2026. When it does arrive, it will be available across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>

<p>Blades of Greed all kicks off after the events of Styx: Shards of Darkness, though the developer has said you won't need to have played any of the previous entries to still enjoy the upcoming release.</p>

            <p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> hits storefronts, I'm pretty sure you're going to see a whole lot of fevered debate online about the game's curious choice to place Samus, famously quiet Bounty Hunter, as the de facto head of a squad of Galactic Federation soldiers. Does it still feel like Metroid, famed for its sense of creepy, atmospherically rich isolation, if Samus has a buddy in her ear or - worse - alongside her physically? Or does the presence of friendlies ruin that Metroid magic?</p>
<p>It's an interesting question, the sort of debate that deserves a weigh-in set apart from our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>. So here we are.</p>
<p>For a start, I think Samus as a character can be more than one thing - lord knows 2010's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-other-m">Metroid: Other M</a> showed us this, for good and for ill. I've been under the impression for a while now that Nintendo has been slightly uncomfortable with the designation 'Bounty Hunter'. Several games in succession have subtly told us that the company is more inherently comfortable with the idea of her as the space cops' favourite freelancer. The Galactic Federation is the government of Metroid's galaxy - or near enough - and while Samus isn't formally on their books, she's a hero to the organisation. Casting her that way means, naturally, she's going to come into contact with Federation forces.</p>
<p>If this is in and of itself fully wise is another question, obviously. But Nintendo and Retro Studios have chosen to go down that path (again) with Prime 4. The question is - does it work?</p>
<p>I fully expect Prime 4's cast of Federation Marines to come in for a bit of a hiding from critics and in the court of public opinion. But can I be honest? I think they're <em>absolutely fine</em>. They are inoffensive. Which isn't to say their <em>inclusion </em>ends up inoffensive, mind (more on that in a moment). If you imagine what a gang of five space marines might look like in a game like this, the caricatures you picture are probably exactly what has been written and cast.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There's the nerdy, bespectacled engineer - this is Myles, the one who got everybody's backs up, including mine, at preview. Over the course of the full game he still grates a bit, but he's alright. Myles ends up as the Navi to Samus' Link. He creates a 'home base' on the alien world you're stranded on after you first meet him, and stays there - but he'll crop up on the radio to give you hints or instruction if the game feels like you've been meandering for too long without making progress, and he helps Samus to upgrade her gear by using his engineering chops on items she brings back to base. By the end, the main thing that grated on me about Myles is my incredibly picky annoyance that he wears glasses inside a space marine helmet which he keeps down for 90 percent of his screentime. Surely the helmet visor has his prescription built-in? My <em>VR headset</em> has my prescription built-in. God. Sorry. I digress.</p><p>Then there's a scarred, older, more experienced soldier - a Sniper. Then there's a duo - a gruff and tough commander type (who, of course, is black), and then a young and over-excitable recruit (who, of course, is the group's token girl). Finally, there's a robot. These are broad sketches, caricatures. They work in that context. You know who these characters are the moment that you meet them.</p>
<p>I think caricatures can work fine - great, even - in a story like this. The truth is that while there's a lot by Metroid standards by the measure of any other game, there isn't much dialogue in Prime 4 at all, so you need to get to know these guys quickly. I think they will annoy some, but I think others will love them. I expect the young lass, who is depicted as a total Samus fangirl, will probably become a favourite of some fans and launch a lot of fanfiction and fan art depicting what her relationship with Samus could be. People <em>will</em> ship them. Fine.</p>
<p>But there is a problem in all of this, as I have intimated throughout this article. That problem is Samus herself.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This issue was also present back in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> 3, to be fair - another game which prominently featured the Galactic Federation. But it's <em>especially</em> weird in this game, which ultimately ends up being about Samus rescuing and reuniting a group of soldiers that have all been stranded on a faraway world with her. Over the course of Prime 4's dungeon-like levels she quite literally builds a team and becomes its de facto leader, then leads that team on a few group missions towards the end of the game. But Samus doesn't talk.</p>
<p>This is, I think, the problem. It doesn't work any way that you slice it. It ultimately did my head in for the whole game, and completely undercut Prime 4's narrative.</p>
<p>Let's deal with the elephant in the room first: the idea that Samus is a silent protagonist. She is not. Samus talks. The obvious example is Other M, though let's perhaps set that aside for a moment because that game's narrative is a stinker with absolutely terrible dialogue. But even if we look to the other games: in Zero Mission and Super Metroid, arguably the high bars, we have text presented that is Samus narrating her ship's log in first-person, like she's Picard or Kirk. That makes sense as something she'd do. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> we get a number of internal monologues, plus a single line of spoken-out-loud dialogue towards the end of the game. Then, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a>, Samus speaks out in what ends up being <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?si=cTvIZDPKsdagDR1u&amp;t=257&amp;v=bdTdUoSCfS4&amp;feature=youtu.be">one of the most exciting moments in the entire series</a>. There's also examples of Samus nattering more in officially-sanctioned manga and the like.</p><p>The point is, Samus is no mute. She's a woman of few words, but she can talk. We've seen her talk so little in part because<em> primarily these games are about a woman on her own.</em> We know enough game protagonists who can't shut up talking to themselves, to our eternal pain. Samus is mercifully not one of them, and that's great. But from where I stand, that isn't to say that Samus can't speak at all, especially when in the presence of others. That feels weird.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And so it goes in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, a game in which Samus doesn't say a word. To be clear, I have only finished the game on Normal Mode, and not with 100 percent scans, so if there is a hidden one-liner on a hard mode 100 percent completion run, I wouldn't know. But that wouldn't make a material difference anyway, because the problem is with how Samus appears with these marines. These guys love her. They implicitly trust her. But they also talk to her like it's a two-way conversation. Samus just comes across as weird.</p>
<p>In one instance, when she first meets one of the soldiers, Samus sneaks up on him. He spins, aiming his gun at her. He demands she identifies herself. At this point in the game Samus has a new suit, so while the silhouette is still there she looks different to the Samus he would know of. Samus… simply takes another step forward towards him, in silence. He judges her not a threat, but he would've been well within his rights to try to blow her damn head off.</p><p>In another scene, the excitable younger soldier asks Samus exactly what the mission is. Samus stands like an action figure, then does a very basic gesture to bring up a hologram of the planet and her objectives. It seems incredibly obtuse and she explains nothing, but she implicitly understands. Maybe there's headset-to-headset data shared, I don't know. But again: girl, be normal. <em>Say something</em>.</p>
<p>This isn't like Link, where he has no dialogue but in a gesture or via a dialogue choice window it is implied that Link is indeed speaking, just without the player seeing or hearing it. It's presentationally clear here that Samus just <em>isn't talking</em>. The feeling of awkward weirdness only grows as the game winds on. These guys begin throwing their lives on the line for this woman who offers nothing back in return. This might even work if they acknowledged their leader's silence - but they don't. Everyone just acts like this is all normal. Maybe it is, with this being Samus' in-universe reputation. Either way, it <em>sucks</em>.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My take from this is that the wrong lessons were learned from Other M. That game was criticised for its Samus, but it was because she was a whiny, weird version of the character whose existence seemed to disproportionately revolve around one annoying man. But the lesson from those criticisms appears to have been that Samus should just never speak at all, and that solution is incompatible with the narrative concept of surrounding Samus with buddies. At least, without her coming off as cold, weird, and unlikeable.</p><p>There is a way to do this. In Halo we have another helmet-clad hero-of-few-words surrounded by chattier characters (Cortana, Johnson, the Pilot, et al) and he works. The difference is though he's sparse with his words, Chief interacts with those he finds and rescues. Most of those interactions are him rasping back things like, "Change of plan" and "I need a weapon", but they even manage to give him <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY_SkljYkzI">vaguely emotional moments</a> of supporting his allies. Because in the end, there's a human being in that suit. He's just all-business. The dialogue he has is carefully written to not undercut his stoic, quiet nature.</p>
<p>I suppose that's my problem, in the end. Samus is going to be a bit emotionally stunted and strange. She was raised by giant space birds! But there's a human inside that suit, and in Prime 4 it doesn't feel like it. Even the silent animation of her in cutscenes isn't as characterful as it was in Metroid Dread, in fact. The trick of a glimpse of her eyes reflected in her visor is still there, sure, but by surrounding her with human characters, albeit broad sketches, her robotic nature begins to feel like a problem. She's on this planet with a group of people but she acts, consistently, like they aren't there. Like she's still on SR388, all alone.</p>
<p>We're left with the folly of a game that both wants to have a silent protagonist while also placing said protagonist as a valiant leader of a cast of heroes. As the final stretch of the game offers heroic shots of the group gathered, as the group act like they've got a real relationship with her, it all feels contrived. And like I say, it undercuts anything this story attempts to do.</p>
<p>The truth is, Metroid Prime 4's marines are fine - they just don't work with Samus as she is presented, and so it's also true that the game's narrative would probably be better if they'd been absent. Or, it's true that the game's narrative would be better if Samus acted like an actual person. For this story to have truly worked, its writers needed to pick a lane.</p>

            <section><p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more.</p></section>
<p>Taken as a whole, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> feels like something of a composite. On one hand, it is clearly a follow-up to 2007's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-3-corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>, drawing close many of that game's greatest triumphs and fumbles with a fascinating reverence. On the other, it is something new for the series, structurally most comparable not to other Metroid games but rather to a different Nintendo adventure franchise (more on that shortly). Then there is how the game is built, feeling almost modular, with different modes and moods of play stitched together with visible seams. With all that said, it certainly - at least broadly - works rather well.</p>

<p>At the onset of Metroid Prime 4, bounty hunter Samus Aran finds herself called to the aid of the Galactic Federation once again. The federation has in its possession some all-powerful ancient relic, and one of its bases is under attack from Space Pirates who also want the MacGuffin. In the course of the ensuing battle the Relic ends up getting 'activated', if that's the right word - the long and the short of it is that it sort of explodes, sending out a wave of energy that transports Samus and others 'Beyond', to an unknown, far-flung planet.</p>
<p>This is the setup you need to understand, in short, to grasp Metroid Prime 4's structure. Once stranded, Samus' iconic ship is gone, for instance. There's no planet-hopping to be done here. Instead she finds herself on a single world which is in a strange way most reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda's Hyrule - specifically, that of an older entry, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: Prime 4's rolling desert is functionally Hyrule Field; that is to say a relatively sparsely-populated map that serves to connect more explicitly-themed biomes at the extremes of the world. There are essentially five locales joined by the desert: a lush forest, a mechanical factory beset by endless thunderstorms, an iced-over mountaintop research facility, a forge in the heart of a volcano, and a deep underground mine.</p>

<figcaption>Here's our Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review in video form.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6GTb-cC6Sw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Think of these locations as dungeons in the finest Zelda tradition, but in a Metroid style. Think of Vi-O-La, Samus' new bike, as Epona, used to quickly ferry yourself from one side of the desert to the other. And think of the giant tower in the middle of the desert as Ganon's Castle - curious, always looming, but blocked by a forcefield and inaccessible until the endgame.</p><p>In the dungeons - and I will keep calling them that, for that's what they feel like - the classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> action reigns. You'll enter a zone, explore, take on enemies, solve small puzzles, and eventually pick up some sort of new ability. Said ability is then inevitably used to open up progression-critical areas of the dungeon you couldn't previously access, and then is used to defeat the dungeon's boss. At this point, you're free to leave and move on to the next area. There's a bit of classic Metroidian backtracking, mind - so after finishing dungeon three, you can go back to dungeons one and two with its item to get into extra rooms to find new puzzles and bonus items. Some of this is entirely optional, while other parts are required by the narrative.</p>
<p>This sort of backtracking has been present in Metroid since traversing the depths of Zebes in 1986, but a funny thing about how it's presented here is that it also reminds me a bit of another Zelda game, and so the comparison continues. Specifically, the way you go back and forth between slightly larger spaces and gradually push slightly deeper into them to progress the story is reminiscent of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-skyward-sword">Skyward Sword</a>. So too is one of Prime 4's two new gimmicks. Its big new weapon greatly resembles that game's 'Beetle', where you can fire a projectile and manually steer it through the air. This is used to great effect in numerous puzzles, and by a couple of bosses.</p>



<p>The other big new gimmick is Samus' psychic powers. These don't amount to much revelatory in gameplay terms - manifesting platforms or grapple points out of thin-air here, a bit of telekinesis there - but it's a nice bit of colour ability-wise. Most of the other skills unlocked are variations on familiar Metroid offerings, be that known quantities with the word 'Psychic' grafted on front for some reason (for instance, the Psychic Boost Ball is functionally identical to the Boost Ball you know and love) or more missile-based variations on elemental beam weaponry.</p><p>When you're spelunking in these dungeons, the hours just melt away. Much as with the selection of abilities, there's nothing planet-shakingly new here, but what is here is a very confident expression of what made the previous Metroid Prime games great. To dip into cliche, I had a good time with the core dungeons, but I also found them nothing really to write home about. They're just a good but fairly forgettable time.</p>

<p>The stand-out is probably how each level subtly changes. A theme of Prime 4 is that each area is somewhere of importance to an ancient, long-extinct race - and you're cobbling together keys and items from their time in order to find a way off-planet again. In multiple instances your main task in each dungeon is to find and restart its power generator in order to gather the stuff you need. But when you do that, each dungeon shifts: the factory whizzes to life, suddenly full of movement and electrical hazards. The icy research facility's doors creak open, revealing what was being researched, while the surge of power begins to melt the ice, leaving water dripping everywhere throughout.</p><p>I liked this stuff - it's good atmospheric work. It also demonstrates well that Prime 4 is probably the best-ever looking Nintendo game, at least as far as games with semi-realistic art styles go. On Switch 2 at 4K and 60fps, it's a pretty remarkable looker. It's less so on the 120fps mode, and Metroid is not a game built with twitchiness in mind - so while the option is appreciated, I'd recommend 60fps, maximizing the visual splendor on offer.</p>
<p>We can't speak of the atmosphere, though, without addressing the chatty elephant in the room: Samus is not on this mysterious planet alone. Five Federation space marines got zapped to the planet at the same time as Samus, and each dungeon will have you link up with at least one, helping and rescuing them. This is a Metroid game where you have allies, and those allies actually build a home base you'll return to regularly as the story progresses. Some items found Samus can equip on her own right away, but in other cases you'll need to return to base to have your resident engineer parse and install it.</p>

<p>There's going to be a lot of debate about these marines, and I expect they'll come in for a lot of criticism. It's such a heavy topic that I've crafted a separate article solely to talk about them, in fact - so I'm not going to spend ages on it here. What I will say, in brief, is that I think the marines themselves are fine as broadly-sketched archetypal characters for this sort of universe and story.</p><p>Some will find them annoying, I know, but what I found more jarring is how the narrative introduces a range of verbose allies for Samus to recruit and lead while insisting that the hero remains deathly silent. They chatter to her - or rather <em>at</em> her - and she regards them with stony-faced silence. Even her body language is less characterful than in 2021's excellent Metroid Dread. It feels weird, and didn't work for me. I'm absolutely not saying Samus needs to be spewing her emotions at every turn, as in the much-derided story of Metroid: Other M, but there is a middle ground here; a leaf could be taken out of Master Chief's book. Even the Doom Slayer gets a few lines, when he really needs to.</p>
<p>What's more interesting for the purposes of this review is to examine how they're used to drive the game's action. Engineer Myles Mackenzie - the one from the previews - becomes a Navi-style figure, staying home at base but ever-present over the radio. It's in Myles you can sense a curious push-and-pull, a hearty debate among the development team. How much help does the player really need?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After some initial, more heavy-handed hours, Myles mercifully fades into the background whenever you're out of the home base. But if you're driving around the desert for too long, he'll buzz and unsubtly remind you that if you're not sure where to go you can give him a call for a tip. On a few occasions - usually after finishing one dungeon but before you have the necessary skills to enter another - the game casts you fully loose to figure out how to get the keys you need on your own. But this only goes so far - take too long, or enter an area that is irrelevant at that point, and Myles will pop up on the radio eagerly. 'Hey, Samus - wasn't there a door you couldn't open in the volcano?' You can sense the design strain of wanting players to experience the 'search' part of the 'search-action' genre moniker without any handholding butting up against an equally large desire to ensure people don't lose patience. In this, we can perhaps sense the most difficult part of making a game like this, for Nintendo no less, in 2025.</p><p>The central desert, which you'll be crossing often as you go back and forth between the main areas, is fun enough. Vi-O-La, the bike, is a blast to drive, with a few fun and simple mechanics to experiment with. The desert does give the impression, though, that it was designed separately from the rest of the game. I genuinely wonder if it was outsourced to a different team. Even the loading zones seem to suggest this, as it doesn't even directly connect to the dungeons. In each case, there's a loading zone, then a tiny 'staging' area you can cross in about a minute, <em>then</em> the dungeon.</p>
<p>There's a handful of things to do out in the desert, but the list of things is very short indeed, being honest. There's a few little underground shrines you can unlock (See! Zelda again!) that each bequeath an upgrade to one of your primary weapons. There's some stranded Federation gear which you'll need to collect later in the game. And then there's green crystals, which you can drive through to satisfyingly smash, which in turn is required for a few upgrades - you feed the crystals gathered to a magic tree (of sorts) back at your home base. The desert-crossing is the sort of thing that could easily be supremely crap - but mercifully it works because the bike is fun to use. In fact, I wished for <em>more</em> of the bike throughout, as it's only used twice in dungeons, really - it would've been nice to see it become more of a staple.</p>

<p>All of this descriptor helps you to sense, I hope, the curious thing at the centre of Metroid Prime 4. To some degree it is Metroid Prime by-the-numbers, a familiar follow-up to the previous games. In other ways it has quite a bit new to say, though largely with concepts and structures borrowed from elsewhere. This is the most difficult sort of game to review, by the way: the sort of thing you enjoy a great deal in the moment that nevertheless feels rather bland in the retelling. It's revealing, I think, that I finished the game and felt a great surge of Metroid fandom - but had no desire to replay it and go for the hard mode 100 percent run to see what extra unlocks that holds. I reinstalled Metroid: Dread instead. That might be the most telltale thing of all, in fact.</p><p>Part of me leaving the game less enthusiastic no doubt has a lot to do with its final stages. Once you've finished all five 'main' dungeons, there's a fair amount of busywork. I'm used to late-game mop-up, but to continue the Zelda analogies this is Triforce Piece Hunt nonsense. Those green crystals you smash in the desert? You seemingly <em>must</em> have shattered a certain amount of them to trigger the endgame, so if you've done everything else you will be forced to drive loops of the desert smashing crystals before you can trigger the end. I'd been quite diligent about smashing the crystals all game - I wanted the upgrades - and I still had to spend too long doing mind-numbing crystal mop-up in the endgame. "It's like if GTA asked you to knock down a certain number of lampposts to unlock the next mission," I scribbled in my notepad.</p>
<p>When the time finally came to trigger the end, I found it underwhelming. I was expecting a big finale with pay-offs for what the game had built up so far - a thrilling final series of challenges to make use of all the skills you've acquired. Instead, without mentioning any embargoed specifics, that enticing tower that's been teasing you all game ends up being a totally mechanically-straightforward anticlimax.</p>



<p>One thing I can't speak to, being honest, is the 'complete' ending, because we all know Metroid games like to hide bonus tidbits behind hard mode, fast completion times, and full completion percentage. On Normal Mode with 100 percent of items and 80-something percent of scans, however, I was rather baffled by where it's all left. While I understand the villain's core motivation, I don't think I could explain what their actual <em>endgame </em>is, other than to just be a pain. I also don't think the relationships the game is at pains to try to build with those marines pays off, even as it tries to tug at the heartstrings. There's a core plot thread about the ancient alien thread that does set up, escalate, and resolve, but anything past that felt half-baked and incomplete - even after poring over scan text.</p>

<p>No matter how much you enjoy the gameplay part, I don't think there's much more disappointing than finishing a game that's relatively narratively-driven and thinking, "that's it?" at the credits. Don't give me this rubbish about Metroid not being narratively-focused, either: I felt a sense of narrative satisfaction ushering that baby Metroid to safety in black and white, without any dialogue, back in 1993. I also understood the emotion behind why Samus decided to rescue a manifestation of the very thing she'd spent all game killing.</p>
<p>I watched this game's finale and then text messaged another critic: "I'm baffled by it," followed by a bunch of questions to check if I'd missed something they hadn't. A naff ending isn't the end of the world, obviously. But in Metroid Prime 4, it forms part of an overall pattern of mild disappointments in the face of some otherwise excellent, easily-lovable stuff.</p><p>It is one of those games that is - excuse another cliche - less than the sum of its parts. I enjoyed my time with it; when you're deep in those dungeons, the design is snappy and confident and the atmosphere impeccable even in the company of chatty NPCs. Puzzley boss encounters, where you die once but use that death to 'download' a strategy before wrecking the boss on your second attempt, are each a delight. These things are glimpses of vintage Metroid. But the way it all stitches together just isn't. In fact, those heady highs serve to really emphasise how this game could have - and perhaps should have - been so much more.</p>

            <p>The original Sonic the Hedgehog game was "terribly controversial" at Sega, according to PlayStation's Mark Cerny, who's detailed more on its development in a new interview.</p>
<p>Cerny was lead system architect for Sony's PS4 and PS5 consoles, but began his career at Atari before moving to Sega and founding its Sega Technical Institute in America. It's this team that developed the sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, after the original game was made in Japan.</p>
<p>The first time he saw Sonic the Hedgehog, it was "obvious that game was going to do great," Cerny told journalist Simon Parkin on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/mark-cerny-lead-system-architect-playstation-4-5">My Perfect Console podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Was there pressure to find a mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario? "The pressure was to make a game that could sell a million copies," Cerny replied, before describing the game as "terribly controversial" due to the increase in resources focused on the game, which ultimately led to Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka's departure from Sega.</p><p>"Part of the idea there was…Let's put much more resource on this project than we usually do," said Cerny. "As I said, what's usual? Three people, three months. So they were going to do, if I remember properly, three people, ten months. But they ended up needing four and a half people for 14 months. I'm a little hazy on the numbers these days. And though it was a success, they blew their budget so badly by putting in a couple of engineers on this that Yuji Naka was just getting yelled at and quit the company."</p>
<p>Cerny admitted "it pays off fantastically well for Sega" due to the success of the game. "But Yuji Naka was pretty tired of the situation by that point." Cerny described Naka as a "top level creator making $60,000 [after a bonus] in their best year and getting yelled at a lot. And he'd had it."</p>
<p>Famously, development on the Sonic series after the success of the first game was split. Development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 moved to the Sega Technical Institute in America founded by Cerny and included original developers Naka and designer Hirokazu Yasuhara. Meanwhile in Japan, another Sonic game was developed by original co-creator Naoto Ohshima intended to be a sequel, but ultimately became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-cd">Sonic CD</a>.</p>
<p>Cerny noted "nobody realised how big Sonic was going to be" in either Sega Japan or America. "Sonic ships and almost immediately I've got the team ready to work on a sequel and do you want a sequel? And I've got Sega of America saying no, it's much too soon. Do a different game first," he said.</p>
<p>That soon changed following sales of Sonic the Hedgehog over its first Christmas period, quickly leading to the sequel's development by STI.</p>
<p>Cerny described his time at Sega overall as "brutal". "Atari was great, Sega was difficult," he said. "It was a difficult environment with a hard-driving president who was going to force us to success. That isn't to say that there wasn't an incredible amount of cameraderie with the people that I worked with but it was just brutal. Nakayama [president of Sega Japan] would come in and he would just give it to us if he didn't see happening what he wanted to see."</p>
<p>"Getting out of Sega was a very healthy thing," he said, before adding "Nakayama is amazing. He understood games like nobody's business...It's just that working for Nakayama - that was difficult and seven years of that was enough."</p>
<p>Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka has since had something of a fall from grace. After eventually leaving Sega in 2006, he later developed Balan Wonderworld with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> which was considered a critical and commercial flop on its release in 2021. He soon left the company and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-was-removed-as-director-of-balan-wonderworld-before-disastrous-launch">accused Square Enix of removing him as director six months before its launch</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2022, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-reportedly-arrested-for-insider-trading">arrested for insider trading at Square Enix</a>, which led to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-receives-suspended-prison-sentence-for-insider-trading">suspended prison sentence</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> may have its sights currently set on the upcoming James Bond origin story 007 First Light, but that doesn't mean we have seen the last of the studio's Hitman series.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>,  IO Interactive's head Hakan Abrak assured fellow Agent 47 fans that "of course" there will be more Hitman in the future. Exactly how far in the future, though, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>"Right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination," Abrak told the publication.</p>
<p>"But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman - because, of course, there's going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>And, thank goodness for that! It's always a hoot prowling around the many opulent settings Agent 47 gets sent off to, before (if you are anything like me) running away in a hail of bullets as any attempts at stealth get put back on the shelf.</p><p>As for that aforementioned co-op mode, this will feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode. On the co-op mode's eventual release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side</a>. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. </p>

<p>In addition to Hitman and 007 First Light, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">IO Interactive also has a multiplayer fantasy project in the works</a>, aptly codenamed Project Fantasy. This upcoming release, which hasn't officially been revealed yet, is "extremely ambitious and really cool and is something [other] than a gun in a suit", Abrak said. "So that's also good to have something new within the creative outlook here."</p>
<p>But, before that arrives, 007 First Light will be shooting onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and PC on 27th March next year. The studio has promised a deeper look at the gameplay we can all expect to see as part of a dedicated stream it is hosting tomorrow, 3rd December, at 4pm UK time.</p>

<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

            <p>More people have downloaded mods for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> than Larian ever expected. "Way more than we ever expected," studio founder and Baldur's Gate 3 director <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1995565346892513574?s=20">Swen Vincke shared on X</a>. The total downloaded-mods number now stands at more than 350m, the studio revealed, and more than 10,000 mods have been uploaded for other people to play.</p>
<p>"This is insane," Vincke added in a video accompanying <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-36-a-very-moddy-christmas_146">a Baldur's Gate 3 community update</a>. From giant bunnies to giant... Not going to do that! It's absolutely amazing. So you should give yourselves a pat on the back, have a shot of whiskey, and have a party. Have a great holiday everybody."</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, Larian shared some of its favourite Baldur's Gate 3 mods, including the mod Vincke stopped himself from mentioning in the video: Wither's big naturals. Yes, tits. Yes, an undead, mostly mummified character with big boobs, because why not?</p>

<p>The tongue-in-cheek mod recommendations do not stop there. Why not add a selection of inflatable pool floaties to your fantasy adventure, for instance? You could wear an inflatable duck on your head. For some reason. Why not also paint yourself in clown make-up? Few things are as likely to strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.</p><p>You might also be interested in a car wildshape because perhaps you think yourself a Transformer. Would you like to make Astarian even more handsome? Would you like to redress Raphael? Lightsabers? A grenade launcher? Vintage firearms? Bald heads? It's all here, and there's a good chance you'll recognise the person in Larian's videos demonstrating them. Hello Aoife!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">Larian is currently hard at work on two new projects</a>, and both of them will be based on the studio's own original properties, or IP. We don't know what they are or whether they'll have anything to do with the studio's existing Divinity franchise, but we certainly can expect them to follow the role-playing tradition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> and Baldur's Gate 3, for that is Larian's thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-dd-owner-wizards-says-of-course-we-want-to-do-a-successor-to-baldurs-gate-3-we-wonder-who-will-make-it-and-what-kind-of-game-it-will-be">Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast seems keen on making a follow-up to Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which may or may not be called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, and is probably in development at Wizards' internal studio Invoke, which has already confirmed it is working on "a triple-A game set in the world's most iconic role-playing universe - Dungeons &amp; Dragons". I wonder if The Game Awards will provide a time and place for that reveal.</p>

            <p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions has found its director.</p>
<p>Fast &amp; Furious director Justin Lin will be at the helm of the upcoming adaptation, which is based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' space-based shooter. After directing The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast &amp; Furious, Lin went on to also direct Fast Five, Fast &amp; Furious 6 and F9: The Fast Saga.</p>

<p>Along with his directing duties, Lin will also produce the Helldivers film via his Perfect Storm Entertainment banner, along with Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan.</p>
<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter's sources, while Lin himself is not a gamer, he used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film.</p>
<p>"He aims to find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story, while building out a world and mythology," <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/">the publication stated</a>. "There are plenty of details waiting to be drawn in, something that is compelling to the filmmaker."</p>
<p> Joining Lin is writer Gary Dauberman, who is known for penning horror movies It and Annabelle.</p>

<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after it was announced, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p><p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has promised players of World of Warcraft that player housing, which launches in a limited form today (tomorrow across Europe), is going to be expanded in every patch and in future expansions released for the online game.</p>
<p>"I will reassure you as much as possible that that is the case," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-asked-world-of-warcrafts-housing-team-about-couples-housing-more-neighborhoods-hidden-secrets-decorating-contests-and-more">World of Warcraft housing lead Jesse Kurlancheek told IGN</a>. "We have a short-term, medium-term, long-term list of features and content that we want to add. We talk about what are we doing in 12.0 and 12.1 and 12.2 and beyond pretty regularly [...] We're thinking about things as not just a single feature release, [but as ] a very long-running thing."</p>
<p>Senior UX designer Joanna Giannullis added: "I think we've already always started wanting to make sure that we were kind of in it for the long haul. This is a feature that we know is going to live in the game for some time to come, and we're going to be adding more to it with every, not just every patch, but in future expansions, and we want to keep growing it."</p>

<p>The full player-housing release happens alongside new expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft: Midnight, which launches 2nd March</a>, but people who've pre-ordered it can dabble in a slimmer version of housing starting today. Incidentally, if you're planning to try housing out, there's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24244464">a Getting Started explainer on the WoW website</a> you might find handy.</p><p>Housing is arguably the largest systemic addition to World of Warcraft ever, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-in-the-making-world-of-warcrafts-player-housing-the-most-ambitious-expansion-feature-ever-says-blizzard">housing has been in development for several years</a>. It's a system that allows players to not only own and customise houses, but also to organise themselves into neighbourhoods - an aspect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has talked about before as being a kind of "sociological experiment"</a>.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember about housing's soft-launch today, according to Kurlancheek and Giannullis, is that it's a start. There are many more things to come to it, both in the weeks and months to come, leading up to Midnight's launch, and beyond.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features, the housing duo revealed, is co-ownership of a house - or the ability to temporarily give someone edit access to it. "Yeah, one [that] comes up a lot is, 'I'm not especially creative or I'm not great with a toolset - can my friend come over and sort of deck out my apartment or deck out my house?' Yeah, it's certainly on our radar," Kurlancheek said. This could even give rise to a whole cottage industry of players who specialise in this work.</p>

<blockquote><em>"The idea of us building together is super compelling"</em></blockquote>
<p>This co-operative building could be developed even further into communal building. "The idea of us building together is super compelling, I think," Kurlancheek added. "As soon as players can build something themselves, we want to build things together. And so, what that ends up being depends on what people are trying to do or what is interesting for them. If it is just us coming together in the town square and hanging up balloons or whatever, because we're having a birthday party, what does that look like? Versus we want to build a racetrack for our mounts around the outside of a town and what does that look like? Versus we want to do prop hunts and duelling things and all of these different potential pieces of stuff."</p>
<p>But though there are many ideas, both from inside Blizzard and from the community, there is "a fairly hard line" drawn regarding things that can potentially increase a character's power. "You should never feel that, 'I have to go engage in a housing loop because if I don't, I can't attune to a raid, or I won't have a three percent DPS boost or whatever,'" said Kurlancheek. "So that sort of practical stuff is really not on the table."</p><p>Reactions to player housing from the alpha already seem very favourable, although there is some concern about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">the new Hearthsteel currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a> to buy cosmetics related to it. This is the first real-money currency added to the game in 20 years, and while Blizzard assures us it'll only be used for housing specifically, and that the majority of house items you won't be able to buy that way, there's worry that these standards will gradually erode over time.</p>

            <p>Remember that demonic statue The Game Awards host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> plopped in the middle of the Californian desert over the weekend? Well, it continues to raise more questions than answers.</p>
<p>When the statue first appeared, many began to guess what exactly it was teasing. Two of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-geoff-keighley-teases-announcement-by-placing-a-whopping-demon-covered-statue-in-the-desert">most popular suggestions were a Diablo 4 expansion or similar from Blizzard</a>, or a new God of War entry from Sony Santa Monica. However, it now appears to be neither.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> expansion theory was <a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1995542966279299507?s=20">ruled out by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who said it was not that, but that it is "a good one".</p>
<p>Ok, well God of War could certainly be considered a 'good one' by many. The last mainline instalment released back in 2022 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, which narratively wrapped up the series' Norse saga. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-free-valhalla-dlc">Ragnarök got a free roguelite Valhalla expansion</a>, but what is next for the series now that's all out there?</p><p>Well, if Sony Santa Monica's Cory Barlog is to be believed, whatever is coming next with God of War has nothing to do with Geoff's statue. "Cory Barlog was just in chat on my stream and confirmed this is NOT God of War related," streamer Luke Stephens <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens">shared on social media last night</a>. An accompanying screenshot of the chat in question was also shared alongside the post.</p>
<p>Now, not that I am one to stir the pot, looking at Barlog's comment on the stream, he only says it is not 'GOW' related. Could he be throwing us all a red herring, and is cheekily suggesting that the statue has nothing to do with <em>Gears </em>of War? Hmm… the plot thickens (she says while stirring her pot, fully aware Barlog has nothing to do with Gears of War).</p>

<p>Other theories yesterday suggested a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, <a href="https://x.com/RohanKarMooN/status/1995579982064885889?s=20">something to do with Housemarque's Saros</a>, or perhaps a new Doom installment. Meanwhile, some have just mused that Geoff has put up a statue to his demonic deity, or something similar. What do you think it could all mean?</p><p>Whatever it does all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>

            <p>Paramount has another Sonic the Hedgehog film planned, seemingly a spin-off from the main series.</p>
<p>Currently untitled, a Sonic Universe Event Film is planned for release on 22nd December 2028 (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-spinoff-movie-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-live-action-film-2028-release-dates-1236596459/">Variety</a>). That's over a year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">already-announced Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a>, which is planned for 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>Nothing else is known about the project at this time, including which character(s) it will star. Is a Shadow the Hedgehog solo film with Keanu Reeves too much to ask?</p>

<p>The first three films in the series have collectively surpassed $1bn at the worldwide box office, with each entry becoming steadily more popular than the last.</p>
<p>It's no wonder, then, that a fourth film has already been greenlit, as well as this newly announced spin-off to expand the franchise further.</p>
<p>It will also follow the Knuckles TV show spin-off, also from Paramount. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knuckles-tv-show-has-record-breaking-opening-weekend-on-paramount">set a streaming record for Paramount+</a> on its opening weekend, with over 4m hours streamed. Yet it's hardly the most popular streaming platform and the series itself proved forgettable.</p><p>Last year, Sonic franchise producer Toby Ascher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-films-aiming-to-be-avengers-level-events-says-franchise-producer">described the main films as "Avengers-level events"</a>. He continued: "They're going to be these big, exciting stories that have a lot of different characters. And so what television did for us is it gave us time to go into some of the more supporting characters in depth and really build them out in cool ways."</p>
<p>It's unclear if future TV shows have been scrapped in favour of a feature-length film instead, considering no further shows have been announced following Knuckles.</p>
<p>And if the Sonic Universe Event Film comes after Sonic the Hedgehog 4, will it continue that story or focus on a newly-introduced character?</p>
<p>We don't yet know who will be featured in the next mainline film, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-next-for-the-sonic-films-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-post-credits-scene">we've already speculated based on the third film's post-credit scene</a>. Who are you hoping will appear?</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's Splinter Cell remake has landed itself a new game director, and it's a name you may recognise.</p>
<p>David Grivel - who left the studio and therefore the Splinter Cell remake back in 2022, to set off for a "new adventure" - has rejoined the project once again.</p>

<p>Sharing the news on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidgrivel/">LinkedIn</a>, Grivel wrote: "I am very, VERY happy to announce that I'm rejoining Ubisoft Toronto as Game Director on the Splinter Cell Remake!"</p>
<p>The developer added this was a "very special team and project" to him, with an accompanying pink love heart emoji.</p>
<p>During his initial stint at Ubisoft, Grivel worked on the likes of Far Cry and the Assassin's Creed series. Following his departure from the company three years ago, Grivel then moved to EA's Ridgeline Games to work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-studio-closure-a-gut-punch-marcus-lehto-says">Ridgeline was subsequently shut down in 2024</a>.</p>

<p>As for the Splinter Cell remake, well we still haven't seen a huge amount of the upcoming game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft announced its plans to remake Splinter Cell in December 2021</a>. At this time, the company said this game is being built "from the ground up" with updated visuals and improved design elements to "match player comfort and expectations". In addition to this, Ubisoft confirmed the game will be linear, and won't feature any open world gameplay, much like the originals.</p><p>In the time since, a job listing revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-splinter-cell-remake-will-update-story-for-a-modern-day-audience">Ubisoft is updating its story for a "modern-day audience"</a>, and that it hopes to bring in new fans to the franchise with this remake. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-remake-shares-concept-art-but-still-very-early-in-development">the studio then revealed some concept art</a> for its upcoming - but still "very early" in development - Splinter Cell remake.</p>
<p>Perhaps now Grivel is back on the job once more, we will get a fresh Splinter Cell remake update soon? Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>British actor Martin Bobb-Semple has been cast in Amazon's live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Bobb-Semple - who portrays Orlando 'Lando' Johnson on The CW's All American: Homecoming - will star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">alongside Sophie Turner's Lara Croft</a> on the series' debut.</p>

<p>Little is currently known about Bobb-Semple's part in Tomb Raider, though according to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/global/tomb-raider-series-martin-bobb-semple-recurring-role-1236592701/">Variety</a>, he will be a series regular. This will be a "major role" for the actor to sink his teeth into, the publication added.</p>
<p>While nothing has been confirmed, there has been speculation online that Bob-Semple will play Lara's friend and tech-expert Zip, a character that features prominantly in the games' Legend timeline.</p>

Jonathan Van Tulleken, meanwhile, will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer. Filming is expected to kick off early next year, on 19th January. The show does not yet have a release date.</p>
<p>Along with the TV series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">Amazon is also working with Crystal Dynamics on the next Tomb Raider game</a>.</p>

<p>As well as Amazon's live-action Tomb Raider series, Netflix also has its own animated series known as The Legend of Lara Croft. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/second-season-of-netflixs-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-also-be-its-last">second and final season of Netflix's anime is due to air on 11th December</a>. "When adventurer Lara Croft discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam to retrieve the precious artifacts," reads the season two description.</p>

            <p>Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert has called time on his previously teased but largely under the radar RPG.</p>
<p>Back in May of last year, I first caught wind of the developer's 2D pixel art RPG, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monkey-island-creator-ron-gilbert-has-a-2d-pixel-art-game-in-the-works">which he described as "classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park"</a>. Screenshots shared at this time showed a town, which was said to have both a bakery and a weapon shop. As Gilbert noted, these two establishments would really set players up with "all [they'll] need before setting out on a day of questing".</p>
<p>However, it seems that we will be unable to set out for a day of pixelated questing, as in a new interview, Gilbert has revealed he is no longer working on his Zelda-like RPG due to a lack of funding support from publishers.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," Gilbert explained to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/">ArsTechnica</a>. "You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."</p><p>Gilbert added securing that "bunch of money" to help realise his vision was no easy task, as "the deals that publishers were offering were just horrible". He also believed the genre he was working with did not play into his favour.</p>
<p>"Doing a pixelated old-school Zelda thing isn't the big, hot item, so publishers look at us, and they didn't look at it as 'we're gonna make $100m and it's worth investing in'," the Monkey Island creator said. "The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this."</p>
<p>Gilbert previously turned to crowdfunding for his previous release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thimbleweed-park">Thimbleweed Park</a>, but even this route isn't as straightforward as it may have been in the past, with the game creator suggesting: "Kickstarter is basically dead these days as a way of funding games."</p>
<p>Today's big-name publishers "are very analytics-driven," Gilbert furthered. "The big companies, it's like they just have formulas that they apply to games to try to figure out how much money they could make, and I think that just in the end you end up giving a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year's games, because that makes some money."</p><p>This is different from the start of his career, Gilbert continued. "When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money, so it was, yeah, it was a lot more experimenting," he said. "I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness."</p>
<p>Some of the artwork from Gilbert's now cancelled RPG has found a new lease of life, however, and features in the creator's newest game, Death by Scrolling.</p>
<p>Death by Scrolling is described as a "rogue-like vertically scrolling RPG", with the ultimate goal being to race upward through endless levels in order to amass enough money to pay the Ferryman and escape Purgatory. To do this, players will need to battle enemies, swipe gems and power ups, complete quests and more while outsmarting the ever-pursuing Grim Reaper. You can check out a trailer for Death by Scrolling below.</p>

<p>Closing the interview, Gilbert looked back at his career as a game creator, noting it is a very different world now than it was 40 years ago.</p>
<p>"Back then, there were a handful of print magazines, and there were a bunch of reporters, and you had sent out press releases... That's just not the way it works today," he said, adding the rise in content from not just streamers but developers on the likes of YouTube requires a person to be good on camera.</p><p>"The [developers] that are successful are not necessarily the good ones, but the good ones that also present well on YouTube," he said. "And you know, I think that's kind of a problem, that's a gate now... In some ways, I think it's too bad because as a developer, you have to be a performer. And I'm not a performer, right?</p>
<p>"If I was making movies, I would be a director, not an actor."</p>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/return-to-monkey-island">Gilbert along with co-writer Dave Grossman released Return to Monkey Island</a>. It was a project many thought would never happen, but which had actually been in secret development for two years before its April Fool's Day announcement that same year.</p>

            <p>Sega and Creative Assembly have announced a 25th anniversary celebratory livestream will take place later this week for Total War, in which new projects will be revealed to the masses for the first time.</p>
<p>According to the official release announcing the event, fans on Thursday 4th December, will be able to see exciting new stuff across "historical and fantasy Total War, offering a first look at what's been in development behind the scenes." So this is something absolutely worth tuning into.</p>
<p>The event will be going live on the official Total War YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> channels. In terms of timing, you'll want to be present at <strong>8am PST / 11am EST / 4pm GMT / 5pm CET</strong>. There's no word on how long it'll be running for, but we do know it'll be co-streamed, so maybe one of your favourite streamers will be checking it out live.</p>

<p>Now, what could these new projects be? Well, there are some games rumoured to be cooking away over at Creative Assembly. For one, reports last year stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-star-wars-reportedly-in-development-at-creative-assembly">a Star Wars game was in development</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">there is some evidence pointing towards a Warhammer 40k title</a> too. We just don't know for sure, all the more reason to check into the livestream on Thursday.</p><p>One thing is for certain: Creative Assembly is sorely in need of a win. Its last big Total War release was not well received, with the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-apologises-for-missteps-with-total-war-series-offers-pharaoh-refunds">offering refunds to those who bought Total War: Pharaohs</a>. It had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-developer-creative-assembly-refocusing-on-strategy-games-after-hyenas-failure">Hyenas cancelled, causing the studio to refocus back to strategy games</a>. Not only that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-layoffs-hit-240-staff-including-at-total-war-studio-creative-assembly">the company also suffered layoffs last year</a>.</p>
<p>That being said, Creative Assembly has a history of releasing fantastic strategy games, so here's hoping the devs there can show the world why they remain, frankly, one of the genre greats.</p>

            <p>Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has once again discussed the proliferation of AI, comparing the tech to "mad cow disease" and describing the execs pushing it as "not the most human or creative people".</p>
<p>Houser, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">left GTA developer Rockstar back in 2020</a>, is currently on a media tour for his forthcoming novel that not only explores AI as part of its narrative, but is set in the same world as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meet-absurdaverse-gta-5-writer-dan-housers-next-big-project">the game his new studio is working on</a>.</p>
<p>Interviewed on Virgin Radio UK by host Chris Evans, the discussion turned to the topic of AI. "Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI, are not the most humane or creative people," said Houser. "So they're sort of saying, 'We're better at being human than you are.' It's obviously not true."</p>

<p>He added: "Humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people, who maybe aren't fully-rounded humans."</p>
<p>More specifically on the technology, Houser was damning on its future promise.</p>
<p>"I think that AI is gonna eventually eat itself, because as far as I understand it - which is really superficial - the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models," he said. "So it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease."</p>
<p>He admitted it will "do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-games-co-founder-is-dabbling-with-ai-for-his-next-game-but-admits-its-not-as-useful-as-some-of-the-companies-would-have-you-believe-yet">Houser's comments echo his appearance last week</a> on UK TV, interviewed on Channel 4's Sunday Brunch programme.</p>
<p>"We have a whole field of areas we need technology for and AI's great at some of the tasks and can't do the other tasks yet," he said in that interview. "So [AI companies] will claim it can solve every single problem and it really can't yet. As far as I understand it, it's a sort of hold-all term for all future computing and it's not really doing a lot of the stuff yet. But if we all give it all of our money, it might do in the future."</p><p>In game development, AI is becoming more prevalent, but not all studios are using it. "I don't feel that games created with only AI will have soul," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">The Witcher 3 and The Blood of Dawnwalker director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz told Eurogamer</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/maybe-ai-is-a-creative-solution-if-you-arent-a-creative-person-dispatch-devs-take-a-firm-refreshing-stance-against-ai">developers of Dispatch stated: "Maybe AI is a creative solution if you aren't a creative person"</a>.</p>

            <p>Where Winds Meet players are tricking the game's AI-powered NPCs into giving them rewards, simply by claiming they already have the answers to various side quests or riddles even when they don't.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/medieval-china-set-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-announced">being announced back in 2022</a>, the ambitious, open-world RPG from Everstone Studio finally debuted last month. Where Winds Meet pops you in the shoes of a  young swordsmaster during ancient China's turbulent 10th century, where you will explore a vast world full of NPCs who you can chat with and on occasion get side quests from.</p>

<p>Now, some players have realised that due to the game's chat functionalities - which uses AI for text-to-speech, meaning in theory players can speak to NPCs as if they are real people - they can actually trick these NPCs into believing that they have completed a riddle or similar, simply by claiming that they have.</p>
<p>As shared on the Where Winds Meet reddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1pauq27/how_to_solve_any_riddle/">Kamijoan</a>, players can simply try their luck by writing "(tells him the correct answer)" into the chat, and the NPC will believe that the player has indeed told them the correct answer. Now, this isn't a guaranteed way to bypass actually solving a riddle, but according to another user on the reddit feed, it has worked 70 percent of the time for them.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Looking back through the game's various reddit posts also flags up another Where Winds Meet workaround for skipping side quests and such when it comes to chatting with these AI NPCs. That is, repeating the last few words of anything said by an NPC back to them, but framing it as a question. Yes, <a href="https://trending.knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-is-the-solid-snake-method-of-conversation-the-viral-memes-about-talking-like-metal-gear-solids-protagonist-explained">the often-memed Solid Snake Method</a> works in Where Winds Meet.</p><p>As you can see in the reddit post below by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wherewindsmeet_/comments/1p5aqyk/the_metal_gear_method_unironically_works/">Hakkix-</a>, by repeating back the last bit of conversation to the AI NPC, they eventually wore them down enough to get what was needed (as one reply in this particular thread notes: "Somehow, I can feel the rage in that NPC building up").</p>
<p>Others in this same thread have said that putting their words into asterixes - so, typing "*shows you my sincerity*" or something like that - also works to win around an NPC.</p>
<p>While this is all fairly amusing, clearly the AI in Where Winds Meet is not working in the way the developer had perhaps expected. Could you really convince a real person you had the answer to a riddle simply by saying you had, and not offering up any other proof. I don't think so. While the developer has used AI to create a sense of depth and realism in its game, the way players have exploited it in Where Winds Meet shows how easy it can be to undermine that intended sense of immersion. </p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Hakkix-/reddit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The use of AI in games is, of course, a hotly debated topic in the industry at the moment. Last month,  Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>
<p>As for Where Winds Meet, it has proven popular since its release. Following the first 24 hours of its global launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chinese-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-reaches-two-million-players-in-just-24-hours-of-global-release">Where Winds Meet welcomed two million players</a>.</p>

            <p>FromSoftware has released a sweet spread of new statistics for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-will-see-an-iconic-dark-souls-boss-return">the Forsaken Hollows DLC later this week</a>. It's revealed many an interesting tidbit, including a reminder Souls fans still love a certain Dark Souls 1 character.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/more-numbers-the-night-the-latest-stats-elden-ring-nightreign">The full blog post</a> starts by breaking down the player split between each Deep of Night depth, a selection of five tiers increasing the difficulty of the game significantly as you progress through them. It turns out the largest chunk have reached depth one, with 37 percent of Nightreign players still lurking around in the shallow side of the pool.</p>
<p>33 percent of players have reached depth two, depth three is the bar for a respectable 20 percent, depth four is the limit of seven percent, and finally depth five has been achieved by three percent of players. An intriguing spread of skill in a generally tough game!</p>

</figure>
<p>Then you've got the favourite skins across each Nightfarer. Surprising no one, the Artorias skin is the most popular for Wylder. However, what might shock you is Solaire isn't the most popular skin for Guardian! Kids aren't praising the sun like they used to, it seems. Alternatively, it could just be due to the slight goofiness to the Solaire skin, whereas Wylder's Artorias skin looks exceptionally cool. Wylder's Artorias skin is also the most popular skin overall, used roughly 18m times in total.</p><p>FromSoftware also provided the top ten most used emotes, which reveals Golden Order Totality reigns supreme. As a T-Pose, its popularity is little surprise. Next up comes Spread Out, a handy way of expressing your exhaustion after a tough battle, and third place goes to Bravo as the go-to congratulatory round of applause.</p>
<p>Which of the field bosses are the most deadly? You may not believe this, but it isn't the Bell Bearing Hunter! He came in fourth, while Royal Carrion Knight took the first place podium. Just dodge the magic gang, c'mon. Second place goes to Draconic Tree Sentinel, where as Erdtree Avatar takes third. Now <em>that</em> is shocking. As a caveat, it should be noted that players do also opt to avoid some bosses they find out in the field. Who knows, maybe Bell Bearing Hunter is so scary people don't even try.</p>
<p>To conclude, a nice fact: There have been over 1.2 billion players rescued so far in Elden Ring: Nightreign. People sure do love helping each other out it seems!</p>
<p>If you've not checked out Elden Ring: Nightreign yet and think now's a good time to do so, give <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Eurogamer's Elden Ring: Nightreign review a read</a>! In it, reviewer Ed Nightingale wrote: "FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour."</p>

            <p>A recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> update has added an inventive new solution to the problem of players breaking into locked rooms. If you manage to break into one of these locations full of valuable loot, but without using the required keycard, you're cooked alive.</p>
<p>This was first teased cheekily <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">in last week's patch notes</a>, describing it as "a very hot fix" to locked room exploits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/">Videos of this measure</a> quickly spread across the internet like wildfire, with the Arc Raiders community celebrating the apparent death of one of the game's more frustrating quirks.</p>
<p>If you don't know, locked rooms are few and far between on each map, and generally require a keycard to open. By using the keycard, you unlock the room for everyone, allowing you to get in there and loot through a space saturated with high-rarity gear.</p>

</figure>
<p>This can be dangerous though, not only because keycards are themselves rare, but other players can wander in and kill you while you scavenge, or while you make your way to the extraction. It's a core part of the risk and reward loop present in Arc Raiders and extraction shooters in general.</p><p>However, exploiters were finding inventive ways into these rooms without the keycard. This could be clipping through the locked door, hopping through open windows, dropping through the ceiling, etc. Not only does this keep the door locked while you loot, it also means if another player goes to the locked room with the keycard as intended, they could find it barren, wasting their keycard for nothing. This, as you can imagine, sucked.</p>
<p>This new anti-exploit measures detects whether or not players are inside the locked room <em>while</em> the door is keycard locked. If they are, it kills them without a hope of escaping in slow, scorching fashion. Then, if a player does turn up with a keycard and opens the door, they'll find a bonus body alongside their locked room loot. Nice.</p>
<p>This is far from the only major fix made to Arc Raiders in recent days. In the same patch as this locked room exploit measure, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-removes-weapon-swap-exploit">Embark Studios killed double pumping</a>, a technique terrorising innocents across Stella Montis. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-cameo-in-south-park">The game also recently made an appearance in South Park</a>, of all things.</p>

            <p>Over the weekend, a very small amount of animated footage widely believed to be from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> was featured in a demo reel by a Rockstar employee, which highlighted their work for the company.</p>
<p>The Rockstar footage itself appeared to come from animator Benjamin Chue and was pretty minimal in the grand scheme of GTA 6 things. However, along with clips from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, there was also a short montage of incomplete work showing a character taking a bike out from a rental kiosk, and then riding it.</p>
<p>The background from this footage was entirely grey, and the bike itself, which was yellow, also looked to be in the early stages of animation. On its frame, the word LomBike could be seen, likely a play on the real-world micromobility company Lime, <a href="https://www.electricvehicleshq.com/post/micromobility-fleet-expansion-lime-launches-limebike-and-limeglider-to-grow-electric-fleet">and its own LimeBike rental</a>. This trend would, of course, follow earlier GTA 6 leaks. Back in September, a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-leak-reveals-potential-in-game-sites-that-parody-uber-and-more">leaked in-game websites and apps appeared to parody the likes of Uber and WhatsApp</a>.</p>

<p>Another two incomplete clips featured within the demo reel showed a female character – which was likely one of GTA6's dual protagonists Lucia– with a pickup truck. In the first snippet, the character could be seen sitting on the back of the truck before swinging her legs around to jump out. In the second clip, the same character started off on the roof of the truck, before she jumped into the boot, and then onto the road beside the vehicle.</p><p>And, that's it. So, what's the big deal? Really, the footage doesn't show us anything <em>that </em>major. However, the fact that the footage was once available online and has since been removed has garnered attention from the GTA 6 community. You see, in removing the footage from the internet, developer Rockstar has essentially confirmed it was a legitimate leak from its upcoming game, rather unlike the AI efforts that have been making the rounds recently.</p>
<p>One of these supposed 'leaks', for example, showed a character meant to be GTA 6's Lucia making her way around Vice City. Another AI 'leak' showed Lucia getting up and out of a pool, before cutting to scenes in a bar. All of this sloppy AI footage is still available online, and is clearly no threat to Rockstar.</p>
<p>Chue's footage, meanwhile, has been removed from Vimeo where it was initially hosted. If you try and find it on that platform now, <a href="https://vimeo.com/1115554961/purgatory">you will be met with the message: "Sorry, we couldn't find that page"</a>.</p>

<p>Along with leaks and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">GTA 6 game delays</a>, developer Rockstar is currently making additional headlines following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">firing of staff members in a move seen by many as 'union busting'</a>. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">over 200 employees from Rockstar North signed a letter to management</a>, in which they condemned its actions. Rockstar's controversial dismissal of its employees has since been brought up in UK Parliament, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine urging "Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again"</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, a report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">former Rockstar Games staff were fired due to internal company messages being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>CD Projekt Red has reaffirmed plans to release an entire new trilogy of The Witcher games within six years.</p>
<p>Joint studio <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">CEO Michał Nowakowski told investors as much during a recent financial call</a>.</p>
<p>"In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time," Nowakowski said. "As we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>] and [The Witcher 5], between TW5 and TW6 and so on."</p>
<p>That means, assuming The Witcher 4 launches in 2027 (I'll come back to this point), that this entire new trilogy of Witcher games could be released by 2033 - perhaps one in 2027, one in 2030, and one in 2033. Note, we do not know when The Witcher 4 will launch. The only concrete date-related information we have is that the game will <em>not </em>be released in 2026.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHuw6gZxqcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>As Nowakoswki said during the investor call: "As we have already stated, The Witcher 4 is in the full-scale production phase. We're not disclosing any details regarding the target release date, so there's not a point in time I could refer to when answering such a question. The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026..."</p><p>The Witcher 4 <em>could </em>launch in 2027, then - that's the earliest it could appear. But it could be released in 2028 as well, or later. Perhaps CD Projekt Red will take longer to release the first game of the trilogy to ensure the foundations are laid for smoother and speedier development of games two and three.</p>
<p>Remember, one of the biggest challenges with this new trilogy is transitioning the studio to Unreal Engine 5. The Witcher 4 is the first game in decades that CD Projekt Red has used an engine other than its own to make; the last time was using BioWare's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a> Aurora engine to make The Witcher 1. Since then, the studio has used iterations of its own internally made Red engine.</p>
<p>"We've been using UE5 for The Witcher 4 for almost four years now and we're very happy with what we've achieved," Nowakowski said during the investor call. "I think you could have seen some of that with your own eyes with our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">tech demo reveal at Unreal Fest a couple of months ago</a>, and we're very happy with the results of that as well – we've already said that, but I'm always happy to say it again – and we're happy with how the engine is evolving through the Epic team's efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as TW4 is meant to be."</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red is also using Unreal Engine 5 to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-1-remake-will-be-open-world-modern-reimagining">remake its first Witcher game</a> - a project inextricably linked to The Witcher 4, given the shared engine, and the up-front work that needs to be done tailoring it for the studio's needs. Because of that, most of the Fool's Theory team - the studio handling The Witcher 1 remake; a studio made up of former CDPR developers (which made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-thaumaturge-review-a-refreshingly-different-polish-rpg">The Thaumaturge, a pretty decent original RPG</a>) - has been shuffled to help with The Witcher 4, which presumably takes precedent over The Witcher 1 remake.</p><p>"I think we stated in the past that the majority of the team is currently involved in the other project, and also support for The Witcher 4," Nowakowski said, "so there is some limited team working on TW1, but since it's very much tied with TW4 development, this is also why we made this move, and we have explained that in the past. So, for TW1 per se, it's a smaller group of people."</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure which other project he's referring to, by the way. It's an unannounced project, but whether it has anything to do with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">Hadar, the codenamed new IP</a> that a small team is working on, I don't know.</p>
<p>To return to the question in the headline: can CD Projekt Red release three Witcher games in six years? We haven't seen another RPG studio do a similar thing since BioWare released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> trilogy in five years. Typically, most projects of this size these days suffer delays. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-delayed-again-now-due-may-2015">The Witcher 3 was delayed three times</a> until it eventually came out in May 2015, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-delay-necessary-for-last-minute-work-on-current-consoles-dev-says">Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed four times</a> until it arrived in December 2020. Even assuming CD Projekt Red doesn't delay The Witcher 4, 5, or 6, those previous games highlight lengthening development times - five years between Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and seven years between Cyberpunk and The Witcher 4, assuming it releases in 2027. To believe CD Projekt Red can suddenly narrow that gap to three years between games is a leap of faith to make.</p>

            <p>The developers of Metal Gear Solid Delta are yet to decide what their next project will be, be it another remake or something entirely new. A remake of Metal Gear Solid 4, though, would be "pretty hard".</p>
<p>Following Delta, released back in August, series fans are keen to hear what's next for the developers. After all, it was developed as a way of re-introducing the series to new fans, as well as bringing the game up to modern standards.</p>
<p>"Right now, I'm thinking about what to make next. With Metal Gear, I've been able to create an opportunity for new people to experience my work, so I want to continue doing this," said series producer Noriaki Okamura in a new interview with <a href="https://realsound.jp/tech/2025/11/post-2232566.html">Real Sound</a> (machine translated).</p>

</figure>
<p>"However, we haven't yet decided what we'll be creating," he continued. "There may be remakes, but we may also try new works.</p>
<p>"The Metal Gear series is like the history of video games, and it ranges from pixel art to cinematic expressions, so the remake method and expression method for each work is different. We don't intend to apply the methodology we created for MGS Delta to all of our works, but rather we will consider the best method for each work."</p><p>Prior to Delta, many of the original developers left Konami, but Okamura is pleased to have gathered a team to produce the remake. "As a team, we are confident that we have achieved a quality that will be enjoyable for modern players without compromising the appeal of previous titles," he said. "We are currently exploring specific plans for our next steps."</p>
<p>It would seem <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-patriots">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a> would be a struggle to remake, however.</p>
<p>"The hardware at the time required some pretty special construction to deliver 3D performance with the technology available at the time, and MGS4 also had some pretty special code... It would be pretty hard to bring it up now," said Okamura.</p>
<p>While Metal Gear Solid 4 does numerically come after 3, chronologically it wouldn't really make sense as the next remake for Konami to tackle. More pertinent is the existence of Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2, which is where we're likely to see MGS4 make an appearance.</p>
<p>While the first Master Collection included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid 1</a> - 3 along with some other classics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-includes-references-to-peace-walker-mgs4-and-5">dataminers did find reference to 4, 5, and Peace Walker in its code</a> shortly after its release in 2023.</p>
<p>Then, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stay-tuned-for-metal-gear-solid-4-in-master-collection-vol-2-says-konami">Konami told fans to "stay tuned" for news on MGS4 in Master Collection 2</a>, teasing its likely inclusion. As the game was exclusive to the PS3 and hasn't been released again since, fans are certainly keen to experience it again in some form.</p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have announced that an extraordinarily low number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> games were ruined by cheaters in a recent blog post.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1994436727516107251">shared on the Battlefield Comms Twitter account</a>, broke down the performance of EA's Javelin kernel-level anti-cheat. Roughly 98 percent of online matches in the first week post-launch were cheater free in Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Part of the anti-cheat's success has been attributed to the "invaluable" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">Battlefield 6 open beta</a>. EA states that over 1.2m cheat attempts were blocked. In addition, users' adoption of Secure Boot leaped from 62.5 percent to 92.5 percent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bios-shock-getting-past-battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-error-was-the-faffiest-thing-a-pc-game-has-ever-required-of-me">a feature that proved frustrating for many</a> but nonetheless is core to Battlefield 6's anti-cheat system.</p>

</figure>
<p>EA stated the anti-cheat efforts continue, with the total block figure now up to 2.39m (each block meaning an individual attempt to use cheating software). Sadly, there are still 1.5 percent of impacted players unable to activate Secure Boot on their PCs, meaning they can't actually launch and play Battlefield 6 even after troubleshooting efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, EA is aware of 190 cheat-related programs, hardware, vendors, and resellers. The post states: "183 of them (96.3 percent) have announced feature failures, detection notices, downtime, and/or taken their cheats offline entirely."</p>
<p>The post concluded by laying out a variety of steps the EA team will take to improve the anti-cheat moving forward, the war between cheaters and anti-cheat software being an endless struggle. Still, as it stands today, these are impressive statistics that show Battlefield 6 should be a largely fair and enjoyable game to play online. Here's hoping EA can keep this momentum through to the foreseeable future.</p><p>

Battlefield 6 remains very popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dominates-steam-charts-ahead-of-worldwide-release-as-analyst-estimates-over-100m-in-pre-launch-sales">even as the staggering launch drifts into the past</a>. If you've not tried it out yet, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6</a> review to get an idea of what EA's latest AAA shooter is like.

            <p>Over the weekend, The Game Awards organiser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> set social media tongues wagging with three words: regal.inspiring.thickness.</p>
<p>No, despite what I first thought, these are not the three words he used to describe himself on his Tinder profile. Rather, they link to a location via a What3Words address. And, that location leads to a spot near Joshua Tree, California.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As you can see in the image I took this morning from the What3Words app, regal.inspiring.thickness is a rather barren looking area in California.</p>
<p>Well, at least, it may have once been, but others have since ventured forth to the spot, and discovered a large and rather imposing statue now standing proudly in a field in the Mojave Desert, on the corner of 29 Palms Highway and Yucca Mesa Road.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The statue itself shows a group of demonic creatures all surrounding a hellish-looking portal type design. This portal area lights up at night, as you can see via the second image below, with a fiery and quite ominous glow.</p>
<p>Many have surmised that this is all part of a tease for The Game Awards 2025, which is set to kick off later this month, on 11th December. But, what is it teasing exactly? The current most popular theory out there is an expansion or something similar for Blizzard's Diablo series. The statue's hellish iconography certainly would fit the bill.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Via X</cite></span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Others have speculated the statue could be related to God of War, with earlier rumours suggesting the series would be heading to Egypt. Housemarque's next game Saros has also been mentioned in various replies and social media posts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many wishful thinkers have suggested it could be a statue leading up to a big Elder Scrolls 6 reveal, or perhaps a new Doom installment. I have also seen others mention Half Life 3.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Via X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Whatever it may all end up being, there is not too much longer to find out. The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Leading the nominations at this year's event is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">which is up for 12 awards</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-control-trademark-sparks-speculation-remedy-will-be-making-a-the-game-awards-announcement">trademark for something known as Control: Resonant was registered in Europe</a>, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans are saying "no to AI slop" after some believe they've discovered AI-generated images in Epic's tentpole battle royale game.</p>

<p>Sweeney made the remarks responding to a social media post by a former Unreal Engine developer who <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1993757796723306612">uses generative AI in his motion capture work</a> and suggested "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more".</p><p>"Agreed," agreed Sweeney. "The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Industry leaders have attended a memorial service for Tomonobu Itagaki, the creator of Dead or Alive and the 3D Ninja Gaiden series, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-died-age-58">died last month aged 58</a>.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90s, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Yosuke Hayashi's eulogy about Itagaki</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Royta15/">u/Royta15</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/">ninjagaiden</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Amongst the attendees, which included Tekken director <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1993986075782717449">Katsuhiro Harada</a>, executive VP of Koei Tecmo, Yosuke Hayashi, talked of meeting the developer, working for him, and getting back in touch shortly before his death.</p>
<p>"I never thought we'd meet like this," the executive said, as translated on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-were-so-cool-koei-tecmo-exec-makes-heartfelt-speech-at-tomonobu-itagaki-memorial/">VGC</a>). "My encounter with Itagaki-san dates back to 2001, when I joined the company as a new graduate. I was assigned to your department as a game planner. You told me you had no work for me. That's what you told me. Two weeks after I was assigned, I really had no work, haha. At the time, I lamented my bad luck, thinking it was the worst possible encounter.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>"My most memorable memory with Itagaki-san was the development of Xbox Ninja Gaiden from 2003 to 2004. The development team was in complete chaos, and it seemed like the game would never be completed, haha. But you were the only one who didn't give up. The two of us spent 12 hours every night checking every adjustment to the game. Those six months are a treasured part of my game-development career."</p>
<p>Itagaki left the company in 2008 shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker sued him for sexual harassment</a>. Although he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007, he ultimately lost his executive officer role. Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.</p>
<p>Before he left the company, Itagaki reportedly told Hayashi "don't change the [Koei Tecmo] logo".</p>
<p>"No other unnecessary words were exchanged. You were so pure and cool," the executive said.</p>
<p>Hayashi also shared his last message from Itagaki in which the developer wrote: "Thank you for remembering our promise [not to change the logo]. Times have changed lately, and selling a million copies doesn't earn you much recognition from the world anymore. That's the era we've entered. Please keep making great products from now on."</p>

            <p>Surprise! Chris Redfield, Excella Gionne, and an adult version of Sherry Birkin are all on their way to Resident Evil: Survival Unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced">Resident Evil Survival Unit was unveiled over the summer</a>. Co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, with Capcom working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality", the free-to-play mobile strategy game is now available. Which is why fans have already poked around in the back end of the Android version and discovered references to as-yet unreleased characters.</p>

<p>The mobile game released with 19 characters, comprising a mix of new and fresh faces. As is usually the case, some are free and some are not, but as yet, we hadn't heard anything about series stalwart Chris Redfield at all, or been officially told of the pending arrival of Sherry and Excella.</p><p>However, as reported by Portuguese site <a href="https://residentevil.com.br/noticias/chris-redfield-sherry-birkin-e-excella-gionne-estao-nos-arquivos-de-resident-evil-survival-unit/">REvil</a>, skins of a young RE1-era Redfield, Sherry, and Excella have all been discovered in the character database of the Android version, along with images of an all-new monster created especially for this game, thought to be called Mortem.</p>

<p>According to Epic, Chapter Seven: Pacific Break "kicks off a new era" for Fortnite Battle Royale, "where some of the greatest stories are told – the Golden Coast". Expect New POIs such as Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, Classified Canyon, and more, and while the Battle Bus is out of commission, players will "Storm Surf their way to the Island instead".</p>
<p>Players can also expect new gameplay, too.</p>
<p>"In the <em>very rare occasion </em>players are downed, they can use a Self-Revive Device to revive themselves while they’re DBNO (Down But Not Out)," Epic explained of the new Stay in the Game mechanic. "Additionally, new DBNO movement options include Roll &amp; Tumble, DBNO Sprint, and Stay on the Move. Lastly, Drivable Reboot Vans have rolled onto the Island."</p><div>

<p>You'll also be able to claim loot, powers, and transformative skills when you defeat a boss, with full Health and Shield, bonus max Health and Shield, infinite Energy, and a "powerful ability". Doing so, however, will ensure you're visible to nearby opponents, so be careful.</p>
<p>There's also Simple Build, an option in Settings (Game &gt; Building) that "makes learning how to build simpler".</p>
<p>"Turn it on, look in the direction you want to build, and just… build!" Epic said.</p>
<p>Of course, with each new chapter comes a new battle pass, and this one boasts The Bride, Marty McFly, and Fortnite Originals like Miles Cross and Cat Holloway. As Epic explained: "In addition to their other unlockable Styles, the Battle Pass includes special Styles for three of the Outfits: Cat Holloway, Carter Wu, and Dark Voyager (Reality Redacted). Unlock these additional Styles by completing Quests in Blitz Royale, Reload, and Battle Royale respectively."</p><p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-narrative-sequel-to-kill-bill-is-premiering-in-fortnite">The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge will premiere in Fortnite later today</a> (30th November) at 2pm, ET / 11am PT / 7pm GMT / 8pm CET.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s success is due, in part, to the "hype" and community discussions surrounding the horror game's release.</p>
<p>That's according to Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto and writer Ryukishi07, who said in an interview with <a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202511/57863">Dengeki Online</a> (as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-fs-success-was-helped-greatly-by-memes-fanart-and-theories-it-inspired-devs-say-a-new-approach-to-writing-characters-unlocked-potential-for-virality/">Automaton</a>), that it was memes, fan-made content, and livestreams that made the game trend online, and especially in Japan.</p>

<p>"Recently, discourse about games is being consumed at a rapid pace," Okamoto said. "But games that do get talked about even months after release are the ones that are fun to theorise about and analyse, and they usually get a lot of character fan art. From my experience, titles which are able to show us that kind of hype tend to live on for longer."</p>
<p>Writer Ryukishi07 added that horror games "ultimately boil down to how much the player resonates with them. That's why protagonists of such games tend to be on the less-talkative side, so players can immerse themselves in the game.</p>
<p>"It's not something that makes you feel 'I want them to be my friend', it's more of a dark kind of appeal," he added.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean we can expect all future Silent Hill instalments to be action-heavy or set in Japan, though. Ryukishi07 suggested that while the latest game shouldn't necessarily set a blueprint for "the way the series should follow [...] if the direction we took with [Silent Hill] f is well-received, hopefully it could become one of the examples of the Silent Hill series' expressive range."</p><p>I had a good time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f, awarding it four out of five stars</a>, writing that Silent Hill f's frustrating first-half is outweighed by a brilliant, delirious second that's well worth the initial slog. Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-gets-a-fresh-update-that-addresses-combat-concerns-by-introducing-a-much-easier-casual-option">Neobards has since implemented an update</a> to make replays a little more enjoyable, and the combat sequences a little less frustrating.</p>

            <p>Remakes, you either love 'em or hate 'em! Or, more probably, you like some of 'em, aren't too keen on others, and are largely ambivalent to the rest. Whatever your perspective, it's obvious remakes - beloved of risk-averse publishers across the industry - aren't going anywhere. They offer the perfect maelstrom of nostalgia bait and brand recognition, meaning they're an easier sell compared to entirely new games, and if players love them, why stop now? But not all remakes are created equally; for every <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>, there's an XIII - a remake so bad its publisher was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-is-some-new-footage-from-the-remake-of-the-xiii-remake">forced to remake it</a>. Which raises the question - you might call it the Big Question - what makes a remake great?</p>
<p>I've had remakes on the brain this week, thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-brilliant-remake-is-now-on-xbox-worldwide-with-50-off-and-its-upcoming-movie-adaptation-has-a-new-trailer-too">recent Xbox Series X/S release</a> of last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">very excellent Silent Hill 2 do-over</a>. I won't repeat myself too much seeing I've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-years-brilliant-silent-hill-2-is-finally-on-xbox-series-xs-and-its-exactly-what-a-remake-should-be">wittered away on the subject extensively elsewhere</a>, but as far as remakes go I'm a bit of a (well, a lot of a) purist. My general attitude is a remake should, fundamentally, play within the boundaries of the original's creative vision - stray too far and nobody is being adequately served. And at that point, you might as well make something else entirely. But chatter on the subject has brought out a range of opinions across the Eurogamer team. So in the grand Big Question tradition, we thought we'd toss around some thoughts before throwing the floor open to you.</p>

<figcaption>Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a bold reimagining of a much-loved classic.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERgrFVhL-n4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale, whose opinion on this pretty much runs counter to mine. Ed believes a remake can essentially do whatever the hell it wants, seeing as the original version still exists to be played. "The original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> is widely available on multiple current platforms, thanks to various re-releases from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>," he explains. "So if you want to enjoy an unspoiled version of the original you absolutely can. But a remake offers a developer the opportunity to bring something new and different; to create a game that feels like what you <em>think</em> the original is, while playing with your expectations."</p><p>And for Ed, Final Fantasy 7 remake gets it right. "It's a retelling of the same story that acts like a complete reinterpretation," he says. "It's practically a sequel! The battle system is almost entirely reworked, the visuals and sound are brought up to modern standards, and the narrative feels exciting to play through because you don't necessarily know what will happen next, even if you think you do. A good remake turns nostalgia into a surprising, fresh experience, while leaving the original work available for purists to appreciate in its original context."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There's a more conservative side to remakes too, of course; an approach Chris Tapsell compares to a "preservation-via-restoration effort". These remakes, he says, "treat a game like an antique with some cosmetic, maybe even a little functional damage" - and it's just as valid a direction. "Great restorers know exactly how to recreate the effect of a certain lacquer, or paint a certain mould to give it the effect of a specific wood, or touch up a painting with sensitivity to light and viewing distance and the original artist's technique," he explains. "The purpose here is to restore something as close as possible to the original as it was at the time, and so in a lot of ways it's basically just a remaster, rather than a remake. It's about making it run properly today, on monitors with different proportions or with new servers going live again, and otherwise preserving something that would've been lost."</p>
<p>For Connor Makar, a great remake is one that perhaps sits somewhere between these two extremes, "striking the balance between doing too little and doing too much". And if you're looking for an example, he reckons EA Motive's 2023 Dead Space remake fulfils this criteria brilliantly well. "It changes only what it has to," Connor explains. "It doesn't overstep, but it twists things up in a way both old and new fans can enjoy."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"The new mission structure enabling you to go back to old areas is a fun shift in a cool direction," he elaborates, "as is the computer controlled enemy encounter system which throws enemies at you in new and exciting locations. It's one of the only remakes I've played where, while so much was familiar, so much was different. It was like I had misremembered the original game and was thrust into something fresh and scary… Finally, a lovely little bow on top with a new alternate ending, a letter of passion to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a> and the series diehards. To me it's a great example of how to strike that perilous balance when it comes to remakes."</p><p>Eurogamer's Victoria Kennedy, meanwhile, has good things to say about Tomb Raider: Anniversary - a remake of the very first Tomb Raider that still manages to feel authentically connected to the original, despite being a fairly radical ground-up reimagining. "I have a lot of love for this remake," she explains. "While it was by no means perfect, I think it did exactly what a remake should do. That is, revitalise a game without taking anything away from what made the original great. Yes, I knew where things were ultimately leading in Anniversary, but I did not care. I loved being able to replay a game that I already loved, but with updated controls and graphics. Rather than souring anything that came before, Anniversary enhanced my Tomb Raider experience. And that's all I needed it to do."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Tomb Raider: Anniversary is probably old enough to get its own remake. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Crystal Dynamics</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So if all these are examples of good remakes, what makes a <em>bad</em> one? That happens, Chris reckons, when a game fails to properly engage with the original text, "changing it without understanding it, or patching it up clumsily in a way that overrides some of the original magic (think: hidden messages in game code, bugs that became part of the fabric of the game). What's important, ultimately, is that you can experience two things at any given time: either the original or the closest possible experience to it; or something wholly new."</p>
<p>So, the Big Question then - what makes a great remake? And continuing that train of thought, where do remakes go wrong? What <em>are</em> the great remakes? And what about the near misses and the regrettable failures? We've had our say, and now it's over to you in the comments.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> developer Team Cherry has revealed it won't be making the trip to The Game Awards next month, as the team believes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> will sweep the Game of the Year award.</p>
<p>Asked by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet">Bloomberg</a> if the studio was prepping for a visit to LA, co-founder William Pellen diplomatically said: "Maybe not. We’re pretty busy."</p>

<p>"This year I think we're safe. I think Expedition 33 [will win]," Pellen explained. "It's exceptional and broadly palatable. Whereas we're on that knife's edge, where it appeals to some and infuriates others."</p>
<p>In the same interview, Team Cherry also commented on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-hollow-knight-silksong-is-totally-fine-say-team-cherry-but-studio-is-largely-happy-with-difficulty-balance">the use of mods following heated debates over the game's imposing challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Silksong's difficulty level has been an ongoing discussion since the game finally released back in September. Developer Ari Gibson previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled</a>", though this wasn't enough for some. Soon after Silksong came out, several mods were released for the game, which added certain adjustable variables like damage and health.</p>
<p>On its release, we awarded Silksong five stars. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Eurogamer's Silksong review</a>.</p>

<p>That's according to a new report by <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome">Nexus Point News</a>, which claims sources say the TV show will explore a time period hitherto untouched by the game series, and feature figures such as Emperor Nero and Seneca the Younger. If true, that would see the series set between 54-68 AD.</p>
<p>According to the official blurb for Netflix's take on Assassin's Creed, the series will be "centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions - one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Toby Wallace is entering the world of Assassin's Creed. </p><p>He's the first series regular cast for the live-action series adaptation of Ubisoft's best-selling video game franchise. <a href="https://t.co/BNwFV84QQL">pic.twitter.com/BNwFV84QQL</a></p></div>— xᴉlɟʇǝu (@netflix) <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1993386705487827274?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

Filming is currently reported to be starting next year, in Italy.</p><p>As we reported earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">Toby Wallace will play a co-lead in the Assassin's Creed series</a>, which is based on Ubisoft's games of the same name.

            <p>Build A Rocket Boy has quietly released a "free starter pack" to resuscitate its flailing action-adventure game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>The free pack, which was released yesterday (28th November), hopes to snag new players by offering a taster of the "ever-expanding gameplay experience of MindsEye".</p>
<p>"Dive into an action-packed mission in the campaign and preview a selection of new playable content that is delivered regularly through ARCADIA," the description teases.</p>

<p>The demo sees you play as Jacob Diaz, a former soldier with a neural implant and fractured memories, "drawn into an explosion that erupts into a high-speed chase and fierce firefight through the city".</p>
<p>It features the story mission Robin Hood and access to a "variety" of ARCADIA missions and challenges, which are "updated regularly". Here's what's currently on offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Garden Party – Drone Race</li>
<li>Chase The Sun – Drone Race</li>
<li>Honor Among Thieves</li>
<li>Downtown - Goin' Haywire</li>
<li>Crosstown Traffic – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Rude Interruption</li>
<li>Turbulence - Race</li>
<li>Free Bird – Sky Race</li>
<li>Winging It – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Craz-Eye Taxi – Checkpoint Race</li>
<li>Friendly Fire</li>
<li>Cruise Control – Sky Race</li>
<li>Fractured Echo – Survival Horde</li>
<li>Road To Hell - Race</li>
</ul>
<p>The free starter pack is available on Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series consoles.</p>
<p>Last month, MindsEye boss and Build A Rocket Boy studio founder Leslie Benzies alleged in an internal meeting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-alleges-saboteurs-within-the-company-were-behind-its-poor-reception-according-to-new-report">"saboteurs" within the company were behind the game's poor reception</a>. Shortly after confirming redundancies, he said negativity towards the game was "uncalled for" and alleged "internal and external" forces scuppered the game's launch.</p>
<p>Benzies' comments come just weeks after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developers-sign-damning-open-letter-against-studio-execs-over-longstanding-disrespect-and-mistreatment-following-games-disastrous-launch">MindsEye developers signed an open letter against studio execs</a> over "longstanding disrespect and mistreatment".</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">wasn't the first time the game's negative reaction has been blamed on others</a>. Even before the game was released, studio co-CEO Mark Gerhard claimed in an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server that "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone". He later added there was a "concerted effort" against the studio, and it "doesn't take much to guess who".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launch-what-we-didnt-hope-for-says-io-interactive-ceo-as-publishing-future-in-question">Publisher IO Interactive has since distanced itself from the project</a>.</p>

            <p>A new Dead Rising game is reportedly in development.</p>
<p>While there's been no formal word of a follow-up game, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood">mp1st</a> claims Capcom has another "major" Dead Rising project in the works, reportedly set in Hollywood.</p>

<p>According to the site's sources, the game has been in development since 2023. Codenamed 'Rec', it reportedly sees the return of Frank West and <em>may</em> be a direct sequel to the 2006 zombie game (the source seemingly wouldn't confirm either way). Isabela Keyes and the game's signature Psychopaths will also be returning.</p>
<p>For those who can't remember that far back, 2010's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-rising-2">Dead Rising 2</a> boasted similar gameplay to the original game, but featured a completely different character. West only returned in Dead Rising 2's Case West DLC.</p>
<p>That's not all, either. The same source claims the main villain will be "an extravagant and deranged film director who forces Frank and other survivors into various trials, all in the pursuit of filming his 'perfect movie'."</p>
<p>We'll also see the return of his "time limit mechanic" and his infamous camera. Sadly, there's no firm commitment to a release date at this stage, though.</p>
<p>We gave last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review">Dead Rising's Deluxe Remaster a middling three out of five stars</a>, writing "the over-the-top zombie shenanigans still hold up in 2024, but next to the remaster from 2016, this is definitely geared more toward first-time players than returning fans."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-sim-racing-wheels-and-pedals">Direct drive wheels</a>, which transmit the forces experienced by your car in sim racing games to your hands without the use of intermediaries like cogs or belts, are experiencing something of a golden age. Pretty much every major manufacturer has now made the jump to producing these high-end wheel bases, offering a significant step up in dynamism and realism at increasingly mainstream prices. That includes well-known names like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-logitech-pro-racing-wheel-pro-racing-pedals-and-playseat-trophy-logitech-edition-review">Logitech</a>, Corsair (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-how-sim-racing-brought-me-closer-to-my-childhood">Fanatec</a>), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-thrustmaster-t598-hypercar-wheel-review-a-solid-mid-range-sim-racing-setup-built-on-novel-tech">Thrustmaster</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-turtle-beach-velocityone-race-review-direct-drive-racing-wheels-go-mainstream">Turtle Beach</a>, but also includes specialist firms like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-sim-racing-wheels-and-pedals#entry1">Moza</a> which have disrupted the market with their huge ranges, well-developed software ecosystems and great value offerings. </p>
<p>Now, Shenzhen-based PXN is attempting to pull the same trick, launching a salvo of PC-only wheel bases, wheels, pedals and bundles at aggressive price points. I've been testing their top-end <a href="https://uk.e-pxn.com/collections/wheel-bases/products/pxn-vd10-wheel-base">£349</a> VD10 10nm wheel base and their <a href="https://uk.e-pxn.com/collections/steering-wheels/products/pxn-w-cs-r2-steering-wheel">249</a> W CS R2 and <a href="https://uk.e-pxn.com/collections/steering-wheels/products/pxn-w-ds-r2-steering-wheel">£159</a> W DS R2 wheels to work out whether this relative newcomer has carved out an advantage over the giants of the space, and whether they have the potential to join or even challenge Moza as disruptors.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">PXN VD10, W CS R2 and W DS R2 review: hardware overview</h2>
<p>The PXN VD10 is a relatively low-profile wheelbase versus others with a similar 10Nm rating, which counts as comfortably mid-range in the direct drive market. (Entry-level models tend to be around 4-6Nm, while high-end models top out around 25Nm from what I've experienced thus far.) The modest 258x125x125mm dimensions make the VD10 easy to hard-mount into your sim rig with two or four bolts, or clamp to a desk, with both mounting options available in the box. </p>

<p>In terms of design, there's relatively little of note - the VD10 features a familiar aluminium alloy shell, with grooves cut in to aid heat dissipation. Wheel rims mate easily via the quick release mechanism on the front, while the back contains a laptop-style external power input, three USB-C ports for connections to accessories like pedals or shifters, if used, and a USB-C output that connects to your PC. (No consoles are supported, though using an external adapter ought to make this possible.) An on/off button sits on the back, but there's no easily accessible emergency stop button, which is a disappointment. The whole unit weighs around 7.4kg, a touch above the similarly powerful Moza R9. </p><p>The 330mm W CS R2 and 300mm W DS R2 wheels are a bit more interesting to look at, with nice and clunky magnetic paddle shifters on the back, a pair of analogue paddles below them, and a good selection of face buttons, sticks, dials and other inputs up front. The CS is the more authentic-looking of the two, with wider and squatter backlit buttons, while the DS wheel's smaller buttons are rendered in white plastic sans backlighting. The CS is also noticeably wider on the whole and uses a full circle design better for rally and drifting, versus the DS with its more middle-of-the-road D shape. </p>

<p>Here's how the two wheel rims compare, with the larger, rounder CS on the left and the DS on the right.</p>

</figure>
<p>These differences aside, the overall build quality and construction is similar, with structural metal, stitched faux leather rims and plastic used most other places. There's a definite step up in quality between these rims and something like the Fanatec GT DD Pro's more plasticky construction, and for the money I don't have any substantive complaints. </p>
<h2 id="section-2">PXN VD10, W CS R2 and W DS R2 review: software overview</h2>
<p>The PXN software package is relatively well-developed, with an overall layout and vibe that reminds me of Moza's Pit House. Like that software, a main page displays all connected peripherals, with settings for the wheel base, rim, pedals and other accessories showing up in dedicated sections. There are tooltips to explain what each setting does, but I'd still like to see more detailed explanations to get a better idea of what I should change on a per-game basis. </p>

<p>There are also areas to update the firmware of connected devices and see which games are supported. Firmware updates to the base and wheels added support for SimHub, a third-party program that can take over from the PXN software to unlock some extra functionality and better compatibility with games. I used this to get the wheel's LED shift metre to work in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assetto-corsa">Assetto Corsa</a> Evo, for example, and this worked well with minimum fuss.  </p><p>You also get the rare ability to get a digital driver's display on your phone, with the software producing a QR code for you to scan, which leads to a webpage with your live data. If you can mount your phone somewhere within eyeshot, this is a nice alternative to having to spend for a dedicated sim racing display. </p>
<p>The only real complaint I have here is the game support. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-2023">F1 23</a> is listed on the games page as a supported game, but I still had to set all of my buttons manually when first loading into the game, which for a button-heavy game like F1 is a bit of a process to go through. I'm not sure if having a preset requires game developer involvement, but just be aware that this is a downside to going with PXN over longer-established players like Logitech, Thrustmaster or Fanatec. </p>
<h2 id="section-3">PXN VD10, W CS R2 and W DS R2 review: gaming performance</h2>
<p>Following a straightforward hard-mount onto my usual Next Level Racing GTTrack cockpit, I had plenty of fun testing out the wheel base and the two rims, with the bulk of my time spent in Assetto Corsa Evo and F1 23. As the wheel and rims are PC-only, I didn't spend any time on consoles. </p>
<p>The level of force feedback is immediately evident in Evo, where the ridges of a kerb, a bump in the road or the loss of traction under high-speed cornering or heavy braking is immediately obvious. I'm still a novice to manual shifting, but the paddles here felt well-tuned and provided plenty of tactile feedback. I found the buttons on the DS a little tricky to reach, especially when wearing gloves, but the CS was a bit better with its wider buttons and more sensible arrangement for the four face buttons in the top right. The inclusion of a four-way stick made navigating menus easy, and the brake bias and traction control dials were nice and accessible for per-corner changes if desired.  </p><p>F1 23 is a little less developed in terms of the force feedback it provides, but with a few menu tweaks I was hitting within several tenths of my best lap times with the (significantly more expensive) Moza R9 or Logitech G Pro Racing setups that I've spent the most time with. Again, I found the DS a little more awkward when accessing controls like the Multi Function Display, which allows you to set your next tyre compound or change brake bias. However, you can also accomplish these using one of your two dials (eg brake bias) or by holding a button to give a voice command to your AI engineer (eg change next tyre), so this wasn't a deal-breaker - and the smaller diameter of the DS made it feel a little easier to turn. </p>
<p>Shifting is something that you'll be doing a whole lot in an F1 game, and this felt pretty good on both rims - maybe not quite as nice as on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-best-sim-racing-wheels-and-pedals#entry1">Moza GS V2P GT wheel</a>, but totally fine for my purposes. Having analogue paddles below is also key for F1 games, where you'll want to use at least one for shifting on standing starts. </p>
<p>Overall, the level of force feedback fidelity and the quality of the wheels was on par with Moza wheels at a similar price, and a tad better than the likes of Turtle Beach. I found the best results at middling levels of torque - say 6Nm. Moza still holds an advantage in terms of tweakables, with better-explained and more granular software controls, but PXN came closer overall than I expected. </p>
<h2 id="section-4">PXN VD10, W CS R2 and W DS R2 review: wrapping up</h2>
<p>The PXN VD10 and the CS and DS wheels are genuinely decent options at their (currently reduced for Black Friday) price points, offering a good experience right out of the box, easy-to-use (if slightly limited) software and good build quality. The direct drive motors deliver detailed force feedback and provide a clear advantage over cheaper cog and gear-driven alternatives like the popular G29/G920, though you don't get quite the same level of granular tuning or wide game support as on Moza, Fanatec or Logitech products. The ecosystem is also relatively small at present, with only a handful of rims and wheel bases, but with a shifter, handbrake and button box available, there are at least the most essential accessories. </p><p>Overall, I'm impressed with this opening outing from PXN, and it'll be fascinating to see how their offering develops over time. Moza has proved that it is possible to improve force feedback fidelity, game support and software tuning over time, and if PXN follows a similar trajectory they could become a good value alternative. </p>

            <p>I realise I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't love Bluepoint's approach to remakes. Sure,  they're pretty, they're technically accomplished, and mechanically faithful to the originals, but the studio's artistic liberties too often rankle. I admit I'm a purist and grumpy old man in the making who hates change, but I still think remakes should, fundamentally, play within the boundaries of the original's creative vision. A colour palette shift - swapping the bleached-out ethereal hues of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> on PS2 for a more natural lighting, say - might add a bit of beautification, but it can radically alter the intended tone. More egregiously, Bluepoint's decision to redesign chunks of Demon's Souls using a completely different architectural style isn't just an artistic choice, it has significant ramifications for world-building.</p>

<p>Not that I'm trying to specifically single out Bluepoint; we've seen plenty of different studios take plenty of different approaches as remakes have become increasingly popular, and I'm equally unconvinced by those that settle for a fresh lick of paint, exposing an ageing, unwieldy core to modern audiences that only mega-fans could love. As for why remakes are on my mind, that's easy: survival horror classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>'s exemplary do-over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-brilliant-remake-is-now-on-xbox-worldwide-with-50-off-and-its-upcoming-movie-adaptation-has-a-new-trailer-too">finally hit Xbox Series X/S last week</a>, calling me back in for another go. The original has remained one of my favourite games - if not my <em>actual </em>favourite game - since I first played it all the way back in 2001. And I can still vividly recall where I was when sad James Sunderland's search for his apparently no-longer-dead wife suddenly clicked into place for me (if you're curious: sat on a sofa cushion dragged onto the floor of my Hackney flat, being harassed by insistent feet dangling from the ceiling of Brookhaven Hospital.)</p>

<figcaption>And here's what the Silent Hill 2 remake looks like.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDO39mY2gq4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>So when it was announced Silent Hill 2 was getting the remake treatment, I was nervous. Not that I was particularly worried about its developer - I've long enjoyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s horror games, the creative ambition shining through despite some inarguable flaws - but rather because Silent Hill 2 is such a finely hewed creation, the potential for calamity was immense. To repeat something I've written before: every step, every rhythm, of James Sunderland's oppressive journey through the infamously foggy town is so imbued with underlying meaning, so key to understanding the larger picture, meddling with it too much is liable to bring the whole thing crashing down. But somehow Bloober navigates those pitfalls magnificently.</p><p>Yes, I can already see the old-school Silent Hill 2 fans lining up behind the Bluepoint fans with their tomatoes primed and ready, but for me Bloober's Silent Hill 2 is exactly what a remake should be - evolving and expanding on the original's essence without turning it into something else. It modernises the beloved survival horror with intelligent mechanical finessing and a beautiful but faithful makeover, managing to expand and enrich the original in genuinely additive ways - and without, from my perspective at least, compromising that original vision. Yes, the switch from cinematic camera angles to an over-the-shoulder perspective is radical, but I'd argue the change, like most of the remake's big shake-ups, is a positive, enabling the whole town to envelop you without losing the claustrophobic ambience at its core.</p>



<p>There's a lot of this stuff. It's a remake of incredible balance, fiercely reverent to the original but unafraid to be bold - slavishly hitting every story beat, every iconic moment, except where there's room to surprise. While dialogue is barely changed, for instance, stellar performances by a brilliant cast find new emotional depths. Sure, I get the argument the original's strange, stilted performances from a less polished cast lent proceedings an ethereal, otherworldly air absent in the remake's more grounded approach, but with a few exceptions I'll gladly take the new over the old. Angela's reorchestrated staircase scene, for instance, is <em>devastating</em>. Elsewhere, some of the original's more undercooked moments are reworked into unforgettable crescendoes (I could write about Bloober's expanded, and genuinely chilling, Abstract Daddy sequence for ages) and the remake brings clarity without ever losing its sense of mystery. The way the hotel section is framed from boat ride onward, for instance, makes it far more apparent Silent Hill's Otherworld isn't just a malevolent hellscape but a malleable reflection of emotion.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>What's more, Bloober manages to do all this with a gentle sense of fun. I adore those quietly hilarious jumpscare mannequins, for instance, turning each tentative venture through new territory into a game of 'ohmygodmustlookforthelegs'. And I love how the remake casually updates the Lakeview Hotel's grand staircase, switching the original - inspired by the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining - to one based on the Stanley Hotel in Colorado, used in the TV adaptation of Stephen King's book. Then there's the fact it cheekily canonises an age-old fan theory - heavily implying that, in the 25 years or so since the original, James has, well, I don't think I'll spoil it - allowing this new version of Silent Hill 2 to harmoniously coexist alongside the 2001 game in the same timeline. It's fantastic stuff, skilfully exploring new spaces within the original's immovable structure, all while masterfully maintaining its spirit and tone.</p><p>That's not to say I think the remake is perfect. By expanding strictly within the existing narrative boundaries, there are times you can feel the structure ready to break at the seams. The long Otherworld stretch from Brookhaven to the Silent Hill Historical Society, for instance, might exist through narrative necessity, but it's oppressive to the point of exhaustion - and pacing is something Bloober never <em>quite</em> manages to resolve throughout its expansion of familiar sequences. But then comes a bit of reimagining as brilliantly, horrifyingly conceived as the prison - perhaps the scariest area I've ever endured in a game - and the remake rights itself again. All of which is to say, it's fantastic; a magnificent example of getting a remake right. And if you've been holding off for its arrival on Xbox Series X/S, you should run to your nearest video games emporium immediately - you're in for a treat. You may now unleash the tomatoes.</p>

            <p>The price of RAM, the quick access source of memory in a computer, is currently soaring. <a href="https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/memory/">Prices have more than doubled in two months</a> and show no sign of slowing down. They've risen so sharply, in fact, that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2984629/ram-is-so-expensive-that-stores-are-selling-it-at-market-prices.html">some shops have stopped printing price labels</a> so they can alter the prices daily, as though they were market traders selling freshly caught fish.</p>
<p>This problem is likely to affect us all in gaming - it isn't only a PC gaming issue. Yes, obviously it will be more expensive to build and upgrade a PC, but the rise in prices also causes problems for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-machine-everything-we-know-about-valves-new-console">Valve's upcoming Steam Machine</a> as it enters full production. Consoles aren't safe either; there's already talk of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">Microsoft raising Xbox prices in response</a>, and even companies with large RAM stockpiles won't be safe forever.</p>
<p>What's more, <a href="https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal">the component crunch isn't an isolated issue</a>. RAM is the acute problem right now but SSD storage prices are on the rise, and graphics card prices, though more stable than they have been in previous years, remain high. These are all connected things. And if the prices continue to rise, they may push gaming beyond the reach of many people's expendable incomes.</p>
<h2>Why is this happening?</h2>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvUxBl3pujs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>There are a few reasons, but the biggest current driver of change is everyone's favourite technological development, AI. Tech companies need RAM to power their AI platforms, so as these platforms continue to grow, so does the demand for RAM.</p><p>The price of RAM has been increasing since the spring, but it was turbocharged at the start of October when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/samsung-sk-hynix-supply-memory-chips-openais-stargate-project-2025-10-01/">colossal AI company OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT, announced a deal with two of the world's largest producers of memory chips - Samsung and SK hynix</a>. This deal will see Samsung and SK hynix provide memory to OpenAI for its huge Stargate data center initiative, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month">which will effectively result in OpenAI commandeering 40 percent of the world's RAM output</a>. The response? Panic buying, as companies rushed to fill their RAM reserves, which only drove prices higher.</p>
<p>It didn't help that RAM manufacturers generally had smaller reserves to begin with because they'd produced a surplus during Covid when demand was higher, as people transitioned to working at home. Recent tariff ridiculousness - mostly between the US and China - also made matters worse, disrupting supply lines and undermining confidence as companies waited to see what would happen next. <a href="https://youtu.be/BORRBce5TGw?si=UfYVlcaDD5NEShqe">As respected tech reporter Moore's Law is Dead said in a video</a>: "It's a perfect storm of unpreparedness, panic, and greed."</p>
<h2>What does this mean for gaming?</h2>
<p>On a surface level it means buying RAM for a PC will be more expensive. The newer generation DDR5 RAM is particularly expensive. Our tech reporter Will Judd tells me <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Crucial-2x16GB-6000MHz-Overclocking-Computer/dp/B0CTHXMYL8">the 32GB DDR5 RAM he uses to test most of his builds</a> increased from £88 to £222. At the higher end of speedy 64GB DDR5 RAM, you can find <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/CORSAIR-VENGEANCE-6000MHz-Compatible-Computer/dp/B0C5M6SJYW/ref=sr_1_10?crid=174B8WGWHQ8JF&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SOW7MlpmyNtPOPCUixVJGZvV-FK5M_b7yTZ0Q4G6fVkD1Zf8cHomWyeIhXqKevVFqT6crTEc2MiynX7VYIgUTMLLbuB7U6kG3sQBQrqt6DTz0tmC1RCi-xTVjxzgE6qS_jvaJCccyhru2t3mPQJqdhiJiogw9sbUZonoJ6Fd5o_K1C5wAlII7E-0OsRzQc_uKP46YNc25-6u7I4M--4-wZqmM_W5fOnddunj_MFFpWE._gG_Yav_eRB-VdTtsMhW-xV-RdcdTRawpFZd3EZNmvU&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=64gb%2Bddr5&amp;qid=1764344484&amp;sprefix=64gb%2Bddr5%2Caps%2C87&amp;sr=8-10&amp;ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.0fa28f01-6fca-4422-af4e-d52d5ad71bfe&amp;th=1">prices as high as £735</a> (up from £228!) making it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tech-missed-amazons-ps5-pro-deal-this-argos-discount-goes-one-better-with-bundled-ea-fc-26">more expensive than a PS5 Pro, especially at its current discounted rate</a>. The knock-on effect is companies that make gaming devices that use RAM, which is pretty much all of them, have to put their prices up to compensate. Case in point: <a href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993126805658911041/photo/1">PC-builder CyberPowerPC did exactly this yesterday</a>, warning of a price increase in December because of "market conditions".</p>
<p>How much a company will be affected depends on how large their RAM reserves are - their stockpile, which presumably they bought at a cheaper price. <a href="https://www.mooreslawisdead.com/post/sam-altman-s-dirty-dram-deal">As Moore's Law is Dead said</a>, Sony seems to be well stocked, hence the company's ability to drop the price of PlayStation 5 for Black Friday and to introduce a cheaper PlayStation 5 model exclusively for Japan, which has <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/ps5-sales-in-japan-quadruple-as-new-model-launches">apparently quadrupled sales in the region</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Moore's Law is Dead offers a great and thorough overview of the situation.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BORRBce5TGw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Nintendo is also suspected to be well stocked, having presumably bulked RAM reserves ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> launch this year. But Microsoft is rumoured to have low levels of stockpiled RAM, so may feel the sting of rising prices soonest as it goes out to buy more. Will that then be absorbed by Microsoft as it tries to keep Xbox prices down, or will it be born out in the end-user price?</p><p>There's a question mark over Valve and its approaching Steam Machine. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-machines-price-will-be-more-in-line-with-current-pc-market-valve-says">Valve will not subsidise the cost of the machine as console manufacturers typically do</a> in an effort to establish an installed base to sell games to, meaning the Steam Machine will much more closely reflect the price of the individual components. Valve presumably has a big enough stockpile for an initial production run, but how soon will it need more RAM that it will pay exorbitant prices for? Is this enough of a problem that it may delay the release of the Steam Machine?</p>
<h2>How long will this last?</h2>
<p>Given that AI demand is the driving force behind these inflated RAM prices, those prices will presumably remain high as long as tech companies invest heavily in AI, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20251127-12805.html">which they are currently doing</a>. That's where the big money is so that's why everyone wants a piece of it. But <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/27/tech/ai-bubble-analysts-bull-case">there is talk of AI being a bubble that might burst</a>, although whether or not that will bear-out, or when, is of course unknown.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that exacerbating factors such as tariffs and the general cost of living continue to burden the market. They are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">the reasons we've seen unprecedented price rises across this generation of consoles</a>, after all - this is the first generation in memory where the price of consoles has actually gone up since launch. We're much more used to seeing prices and sizes of consoles shrink alongside the components in them, though <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-xbox-series-s-big-interview">this is harder to achieve now than it used to be</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Gamers Nexus is also a great source of knowledge on this front.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hLiwNViMak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Just as it took many things to drive the prices up, it will take many things to bring them back down again. That's also assuming, of course, memory manufacturers will <em>want </em>to aid that. As it stands, they're making a lot of money from this, because large tech companies have a lot of money to throw around. AI and crypto mining have driven huge profits for companies which make components you need for them. Take Nvidia as an example: its share price has erupted like a volcano in the past five years, making it the most valuable company in the world today. Why would a company that's benefiting enormously from scarcity, coupled with high demand, seek to change that?</p>
<h2>Could this affect next-gen consoles?</h2>
<p>That's the bigger question, because why try and launch a new console and establish an installed base for it if you're looking at prices most people will struggle to be able to afford? The only way to achieve lower prices would be to subsidise the machines heavily and take a financial hit, but why do that if you are Sony or Nintendo, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-playstation-5-celebrates-its-fifth-birthday-with-a-nice-surprise-sales-are-up-and-ps5-shipments-have-topped-842m">whose consoles are</a> both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">selling at record rates</a>? Microsoft arguably has the biggest incentive because it has ground to gain, but we've already seen the company step back from the either-or approach to consoles and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">start publishing Xbox games on PlayStation</a> instead; hardware dominance doesn't seem as important to Xbox any more.</p><p>It would make more sense for a company like Sony, which is in a dominant position with PlayStation 5, to simply wait. To extend this generation of gaming even further, and continue selling and developing for PlayStation 5, all while waiting for the component market to settle down, assuming it ever does. That wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing. Late-generation development has historically resulted in some wonderful games, because dev tools and engines and processes are well established at that point, and because there is a larger installed base to sell to. Less dev upheaval plus greater potential rewards is a convincing argument.</p>
<p>The rising price of RAM is about much more than the rising price of RAM, then. It's about strangleholds and monopolies and individuals being overlooked as hungry tech companies stampede towards AI dominance. It's also yet another disruption in a generation of gaming that is undergoing seismic, fundamental changes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them">"The role of the console is shifting,"</a> I heard from experts recently, and this is perhaps one more shove on its way.</p>

            <h2>29th November</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome back to our regular feature where we write a little bit about some of the games we've been playing. This week, Kelsey remembers why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> isn't an all-timer; Connor self-inflicts a strange challenge on himself in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>; Marie finds herself digging out her Game Boy Advance again; Ed makes a good point about horror games; Victoria accidentally completes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> again; Dom sees lemons; Chris doesn't impress his wife with Sean Bean; and Bertie makes a confession.</p>
<h2>Resident Evil 5, PC</h2>

<p>Resident Evil 5 is certainly not a game of all time. Upon revisiting it, however, I don't completely hate it. Sure, it's not a very good Resident Evil game nor is it a good co-op game in my opinion, and let's be real, most of its best moments are ripped straight from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, I've had pretty good fun mowing down the undead with my friend either way, and Wesker - in all of his camp and over-dramatic glory - is the star of the show (aside from Chris Redfield's boulder-punching capabilities, of course). The ultimate showdown against Wesker is largely a frustrating mess and I can’t wait to see the back of him at this point, but he certainly makes sure that it's entertaining.</p>
<p><em>-Kelsey</em></p>
<h2>Guild Wars 2, PC</h2>
<p>My journey through Guild Wars 2 continues without interruption, as the game has taken over my life in a very real and borderline worrying way. I've assigned a self-enforced challenge upon myself: I'm not allowed to move forward into the many exciting expansions I own before totally finishing each story chapter's mastery achievement. As of writing I am still stuck in season one.</p><p>There are multiple reasons why, but the most pressing right now is the Nightmare Tower, a bit of old content that no one really runs any more. Back in the day you and other players in the open-world would have to run a gauntlet through the tower, battling the toxic alliance and opening a tri-colour chest at the top.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you can just skip to the top to finish up the single-player story component of the chapter - a nice quality of life addition by Arenanet. However, there are achievements in there, and thus I have been trying to convince folks to run it over a decade since the content was relevant.</p>
<p>A guild comes in handy here, and I've actually managed to beat the tower once in what was apparently a real trip through memory lane for some of the older players roped along. The loot was actually pretty good too! There's a special item called a Pristine Toxic Spore Sample that is quite rare out in the open-world but drops regularly inside the tower. They sell for almost 10 silver a pop, and you leave the tower with quite the haul of 'em. Safe to say, I'll be stuck in this tower for some time.</p>
<p>Hopefully by next week I'll be on the Heart of Thorns expansion, but no promises. Other games I've played on the side I cannot talk about - sorry!</p>
<p><em>-Connor</em></p>
<h2>Spyro: Season of Flame, Game Boy Advance SP</h2>
<p>I'm back on my Game Boy again. The first thought that hit me was the size difference between it and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. My second thought was how great it would be to have all the Spyro games available on Switch 2 - which then somehow translated into me playing them all again.</p><p>I'm currently at Winter Mesa in Spyro: Season of Flame, an aptly festive-themed level. I find most levels in this game enjoyable, but Winter Mesa is one that's firmly planted in my mind and has been for years. The glittering trees dotted and the snow dusted around the level give a cosy feeling to it, and even torching the bad guys with Spyro's flame breath doesn't disrupt the calm I feel whenever I'm there. However, at the moment, I'm preparing myself to take on the ice hockey activity, and if you've played the game, you know that it can make even the most patient of people snap.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>

<p>I usually play horror games on easy mode. Really, it comes down to what you want from the experience - for me, I want to relish in the atmosphere, the slow dread, and the intricate puzzle-solving without stumbling nurses breathing down my neck. And dying in horror games is always a reminder you're playing a game, which takes you out of the experience.</p><p>This is my first time playing a Silent Hill game and I really appreciate the split in difficulty level between combat and puzzles. It means I'm fully immersed, sitting on the edge of my seat, the tension creeping into my bones. And if there's one thing this game thrives on, it's revelling in the weirdness of it all.</p>

<h2>Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Xbox Series X</h2>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Last weekend, I decided to try out some new Game Pass games. "I may as well restart Shadow of the Tomb Raider to kill some time while I wait for these others to download," I said to myself. Fast forward 12 hours later and I am approaching the final boss. Turns out, I killed a lot more than just time that day, and completed Shadow of the Tomb Raider once again.</p>
<p>On the plus side, those new games have now <em>definitely </em>finished downloading.</p>
<p><em>-Victoria</em></p>
<h2>CloverPit</h2>
<p><em>Let's go gambling.</em></p>
<p>Ah, roguelikes. My kryptonite. My catnip. My downfall. After it hit Games Pass last week, I've been chewing on CloverPit in my downtime. Imagine Balatro with one-armed bandits and you're some of the way there, though I'd say the game lacks the killer X-factor that makes Balatro an all-timer.</p><p>Actually, the game reminds me more of Inscryption, thanks to its grotty, slightly violent undertones and sleazy atmosphere. But as someone that once made a pilgrimage of sorts to a Japanese pachinko arcade to see what all the fuss is about, I will say that fits the brief quite well for this world.</p>
<p>I've 'finished' the game at this point, insofar as you can finish a roguelike, but I still seem drawn back for more, my field of vision full of clovers, lemons, cherries, and sevens. As the machine likes to say <em>Let's go gambling</em>. Let's go again.</p>

<p>I've gone back to The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered this week, which predictably has been brilliant. I told my wife "hey guess who that is... it's Sean Bean!" and she did not care at all, which is fine. Then I Googled some extremely niche questions about levelling and spent many hours on Reddit threads confirming what I already suspected (namely that I did not, in fact, have to spend many hours on Reddit threads any more). Then I closed an Oblivion gate, persuaded some Dark Elves to stop being so miserable with a conversation minigame, and picked flowers. So more or less a standard Oblivion experience. It genuinely never gets old.</p>

<h2>Dispatch, PC</h2>
<p>I haven't finished it, alright? Are you happy now I've confessed? I played seven episodes and then, in true Bertie fashion, stopped there. I got distracted. But this morning, before work, I hurried to my desk to carry on. And there's something about returning to a game, to have been out of it and then to go back, and feel that warm wave of familiarity again, and perhaps admiration. And I do like this game - I like it very much. Absence has only made the heart fonder. Returning to it has reminded me how well put together it really is.</p>
<p>Play it? Play it.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> developer Team Cherry has commented on the use of mods following heated debates over the game's imposing challenge.</p>
<p>Silksong's difficulty level has been an ongoing discussion since the game finally released back in September. Developer Ari Gibson previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled</a>," though this wasn't enough for some. Soon after Silksong came out, several mods were released for the game, which added certain adjustable variables like damage and health.</p>
<p>"The fact that people are modding it is totally fine," Team Cherry's William Pellen has now said in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng">new interview with Bloomberg</a>, discussing Silksong's difficulty level. "Maybe our thinking is that part of presenting the game is creating the fiction that it's a real world that exists independent of you. Most of the decisions ultimately hinge on that. And one of those decisions is not making it so that you can necessarily reach in and play around with how difficult certain parts are."</p>

<p>Pellen said that "encourages" Team Cherry to "give you ways around things, different ways of approaching battles or coming back to challenges once you've geared yourself up, or just avoiding certain things and creeping around them instead".</p>
<p>"I feel like limiting it in that way - as in, not giving the player an out to fiddle with things when they hit a wall - it means when we're making it, we don't have an out either. We have to be quite considerate about that stuff, and we're playing it constantly as well," the Silksong developer continued, before Ari Gibson added:</p><p>"Years of the game's development is us in there creating new options for ourselves and then for the players. Hitting those walls and going, 'Well this is difficult,' and we potentially would be roadblocked, so let's find other ways around. Let's find a second route. Let's find a little crack that you can worm through. Let's find something that rewards the explorer more than the combatant."</p>
<p>The duo said while they could probably still come up with this sort of experience even if there were difficulty sliders included at the start, this way of approaching things "help you focus in a way, which is quite nice".</p>
<p>Said Pellen: "When you're thinking about what the player's options are, and how they might react to the world, you're not thinking about them backing out to the options and changing the world. It's nice. All of your thinking is in the world itself rather than on a meta level."</p>
<p>Gibson said the "ideal" Silksong experience is to come back to a once punishing boss with a new level of knowledge and different equipment and be victorious.</p>

<p>When further asked if Team Cherry felt it had found the right balance in Silksong's difficultly even with those out there who found it too punishing, Pellen said he was "largely" happy with it.</p>
<p>"We did some tweaks of various things, a light touch making some things a little less punishing. For how much there was in the game and how few people had played it at release, I was happy with the fact that we only needed a month or so. It may change a bit in the future, but I think it's at a pretty good point now," he replied. Gibson also added that, now that we are a few months away from the initial release, there are those within the Silksong community who are helping others who are struggling.</p><p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-last-judge-boss-guide">The Last Judge being a very good example</a>," Gibson explained. "That is a huge wall, and admittedly that's exactly how the character presents, but there is another circuitous route that will allow them to completely skip that challenge and then come back potentially much, much later in the game, where they're far more prepared for it."</p>

            <p>Team Cherry has confirmed it's still working on new content for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but won't say when it's coming out.</p>
<p>The long-awaited adventure was finally released in September to huge fanfare. And it would seem the developers aren't done with it yet.</p>
<p>"We didn't plan seven years for Silksong," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "Not that we expect to take an excessive amount of time, but we still are pursuing the same development philosophy, which sometimes can expand our timeframe."</p>

<p>Silksong, infamously, began life as DLC for the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> game before ballooning into a full standalone game.</p>
<p>It's unclear exactly what the studio is working on, and if that too has the potential to balloon in size.</p>
<p>Bloomberg has speculated a DLC focused on Steel Assassin Sharpe may be in the works. This character was teased in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/happy-hollowmas">studio blog post years ago</a>, but wasn't included in the final game.</p>
<p>"Just waiting in the wings," said Gibson of the character. "Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them."</p><p>Gibson added: "We will make sure to deliver on all of our obligations. One, because they're going to be very fun to do. But even alongside those tasks we had our own ideas for extra things that could be added to the world. We're trying to juggle when that could potentially be."</p>
<p>Bloomberg also asked Team Cherry if they wish to shorten the time for their next game.</p>
<p>"At the start of Silksong, and at the start of Hollow Knight, we had no conception it would take as long as it did for either game," said co-founder William Pellen. "We started to work on the basic idea of it, and allowed it to grow as much as we wanted it to. We could've stopped that from growing if we'd wanted to. I imagine we'll go on to the next game, again with that core idea and begin exploring it and start to suss out what the boundaries will end up being."</p>
<p>Gibson added: "We're clearly not concerned if it ends up taking a long period of time."</p>
<p>For now, the pair are "certainly happy with where [Silksong] is sitting right now, and we're not planning anything dramatic at this point," said Gibson, following multiple balance tweaks and updates.</p>
<p>He continued: "We're also quite happy where technically it's sitting, noting that we will continue to do small fixes of course. And we are looking at what else can we do, what else can be brought to the experience and how that world can expand. I don't know how much we can really speak about it. We're playing a little coy again. But that's also because this stuff is in flux."</p>
<p>The pair are considering different sizes of updates too, similar to the smaller Lifeblood or larger Godmaster and Grimm Troupe from Hollow Knight.</p>
<p>Said Pellen: "We were talking about the next project in general. We're not thinking about the size. We just started making new stuff and working on bits and pieces. We're still in this world, thinking about stuff to present to people."</p>
<p>Information will come "soon", but the pair wouldn't be drawn to a timeframe and said they'll have a more frequent cadence of communication as there's more to discuss.</p>
<p>Gibson surmised: "Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us."</p>
<p>This will certainly be exciting news for Silksong fans, too. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads our five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, the pair also discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-hollow-knight-silksong-is-totally-fine-say-team-cherry-but-studio-is-largely-happy-with-difficulty-balance">Silksong's imposing challenge and the use of mods to alter the difficulty</a>.</p>

            <p>Hytale, the seemingly doomed sandbox RPG has a release date at last, after the project was reacquired by one of its original co-founders. It will be launching into Early Access on the 13th January, 2026.</p>
<p>This news <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1994421030991904777?s=20">was posted on social media via the official Hytale account</a> earlier today, alongside a disclaimer for those eager to hop in and try it out next year. Prepurchasing opens up on the 13th December, though the team has actually urged fans to pre-order the game with caution.</p>
<p>The reason? Rather than an Early Access release where all is polished and feature complete, Hytale instead seems to be launching with a ways to go.</p>

<p>The Hytale social media account states: "If you don't feel comfortable pre-ordering, please don't. This is true early access, meaning it's still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have the team's commitment to make Hytale the game we've always wanted it to be. More details are coming soon. Thank you, everyone, for your support. Hytale has been through a long journey, and soon, we will be home."</p><p>Such transparency is both laudable and understandable, especially given the surge of community support for Hytale in recent months. The game hit rocky waters earlier this year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">its former publisher</a> Riot Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">pulled the plug on what was proving to be troubled development</a> for the game.</p>
<p>Following this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">the game was saved by the aforementioned co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme</a> after negotiations with Riot Games. The result: a game that has been in development since 2015 is finally going to be playable, which is wonderful news.</p>

<p>Following Valve's controversial decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-responds-with-additional-context-following-horses-steam-ban-controversy">ban developer Santa Ragione's narrative horror game Horses from Steam</a>, rival storefront GOG - which <em>will</em> be selling the game when it launches next week - has weighed in, saying it wants "to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and [give creators] the space to bring their artistic work to them."</p>
<p>Italian studio Santa Ragione - whose award-winning output includes Saturnalia and Meditteranea Inferno - announced Horses back in 2023. It's a three-hour horror adventure - blending monochrome visuals, live-action intermissions, and interactive sequences - that unfolds across 14 days on a farm where naked human "horses" are kept as livestock. It makes for some striking imagery as the game explores "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility".</p>

<p>However, Horses made headlines this week when its release date announcement was accompanied by the news it would be available on all PC platforms with the exception of Steam. It's a long story that Santa Ragione co-founder Pietro Righi Riva <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">discussed with Eurogamer in more detail</a> when the news broke, but the short version is Valve made the decision to ban Horses from its platform in 2023, saying it would not "distribute content that appears, in [its] judgement, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."</p><p>Santa Ragione had a number of things to say about that. Firstly that it was a mischaracterisation of a brief mid-game scene - "not sexual in any way" - where a visitor to the farm lets his young daughter ride one of the horses, and secondly that the scene was altered, ageing the daughter into a 20-something woman, while the game was still in creative flux. Its belief is Horses would have passed Steam's approval process without issue if Valve - which has refused to re-examine the final build - had not requested an early version, and the fact no other storefront has taken umbrage with the game supports that.</p>
<p>And now, Steam rival GOG has weighed in on <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1994406374273318952?s=20">social media</a>, saying it's "proud to give Horses a home", and adding it "[believes] players should be able to choose the experiences that speak to them." In a seperate comment provided to Eurogamer, the storefront elaborated further, saying GOG will be distributing Horses because its platform "is the place on which we want to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and creators can have the space to bring their artistic work to them."</p>
<p>"At GOG, we aim to provide developers with a welcoming space for their projects and to make it simple for players to access the games they care about," it continued. "We're happy to give Horses a home... giving players another way to experience the game – and to support the Santa Ragione studio in this difficult time, we've decided to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">launch pre-orders on Horses today</a>."</p>
<p>Horses launches via <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>, the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Epic Games Store</a>, the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch.io</a> on 2nd December. It costs €4.99/$4.99.</p>

            <p>If Santa Ragione is to go out of business soon - as it seems likely to, barring a sales miracle for its upcoming, banned-on-Steam horror game, Horses - it will be a tragedy for video games. It's never had a true breakout hit, but by pure output alone the studio is a game development marvel.</p>
<p>We've been fans of the games themselves here at Eurogamer for some time: Christian Donlan gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mirrormoon-ep-review">MirrorMoon EP</a>, an exploration game from the height of the indie boom in 2013, and one that brings forth alarming wonder from its ostensibly simple visuals, a 9 out of 10, way back when we actually scored things out of 10. We called 2015's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheels-of-aurelia-a-game-about-driving">Wheels of Aurelia</a> "a strangely perfect modelling of the real world." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/milky-way-prince-the-vampire-star-review-an-artfully-told-oppressively-bleak-story">Milky Way Prince - The Vampire Star utterly floored me</a> in 2022, a bolt of expression and raw lustfulness that felt, in a way, like the video game equivalent to the darkest edges of Neon Genesis Evangelion. No list of great horror games will be worth reading if it excludes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-review-a-horrible-nightmare-in-all-the-right-ways">Saturnalia</a>, of the same year. The "artistically dazzling" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mediterranea-inferno-review-a-bruising-intensely-stylish-post-covid-nightmare">Mediterranea Inferno</a> was our first five star review for the studio, and very nearly our game of the year as well.</p>
<p>More than all that though, Santa Ragione has an extraordinary method for actually making games - extraordinary because of how effective it's seemingly been at turning around exceptional arthouse games, one, but also because of how incredibly obvious a solution it is, to a certain kind of problem. For years now we've been discussing the games industry's perpetual state of crisis, and many years before that lamenting its baked-in cycle of layoffs. What Santa Ragione has been doing to avoid all this is simply not work like the games industry. Instead, it's effectively a film studio and production company, bringing on jobbing artists and creatives - from all kinds of mediums - to make each game in isolation, assisted by a small core of in-house devs. Only Milky Way Prince and Mediterranea Inferno, for instance, were made by the same creative lead. Horses' maker, Andrea Lucco Borlera, is a former film student.</p>
<p>This probably isn't a panacea, of course - the film industry is hardly known for its vocational stability, and many of Santa Ragione's games are effectively made by one or two key creatives and some support staff - but it is something different. Something which has, for Santa Ragione and seemingly for its small stable of occasional developers, largely worked. If there's a failure here, in the studio failing to achieve its big breakout in sales, it's surely in the wider ecosystem of discovery - us in the press, the storefronts, the 'content creator' community, whisper it, maybe even the audience - than it is in how its games have been made.</p><p>There's also a more important point here, which really takes me to the actual point at hand. The thing that matters is the novelty. Santa Ragione, of all studios in video games right now, is at the forefront of experimenting with the form. It's experimenting with how games are made, and experimenting with the games it makes. And in video games, time and again, it's been proven to us that experimentation, risk-taking, invention, whatever you call it, is <em>everything</em>. And when entities of outsized power, whatever the form, begin to impede that process, it is every single layer of this industry that suffers.</p>
<p>Dwell on it for a moment and you realise this has in fact been the main thing we've all been talking about for these past few years. Why is Xbox's brand image in the gutter? Why have so many ludicrously expensive service games been dead on arrival? Why is the triple-A status quo, really even the concept itself at this point, in a seemingly perpetual crisis? We've gone over the business reasons, the structural reasons, the pandemic-interest-rates-bloated-timelines-engagement-economy-capitalism reasons, to absolute death now of course. But amongst every conversation there was a golden thread of truth, a constant, that persisted: when you stifle invention, however you do it in each case, from abandoning your own studios to forcing them into following a trend, you will destroy creativity. And in this fundamentally creative business, ultimately destroy yourself.</p>
<p>And so we get to Valve. Valve is not going anywhere. It is not going to bring about its demise with this one, ham-fisted attempt at applying its ill-defined and opaque system of moderation. (It's also worth explicitly highlighting Valve's reasoning here: that the game seemed likely to violate its <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">content guidelines</a>, and that after "extensively" discussing a request to reconsider and review an amended version, that request was rejected. You can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-responds-with-additional-context-following-horses-steam-ban-controversy">view Valve's full response here</a>.) If anything - if Santa Ragione benefits from a bit of extraordinary, ironic fortune - it might even help, inadvertently Streisand-effecting Horses, a game that looked brilliant again but also challenging and odd and, honestly, probably not a big seller again either, into gaming's wider consciousness. Few phrases can activate the sleeper agent gamer masses like the proclamation: "censorship".</p>
<p>But the single instance of Horses, and its ultimate success or failure, is itself again besides the point. Santa Ragione could, and some might argue perhaps should, have foreseen Valve's objection to the scene in question - and in hindsight would, surely, have made the changes to that very early build even earlier to avoid this whole problem (they certainly said as much <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">in our interview with them about it</a>). The point is the chilling effect, the monopoly, and the wider oligarchy-shaped problem the rest of the industry is settling into, too. Notice, amongst the outcry, how few actual developers have said anything public about the situation here. This isn't a barb aimed at them, but just a statement of the reality: with a dominant share of the PC market (despite some reports, reliable figures of market share are hard to come by, partially as a result of Valve's opacity), Valve is the gatekeeper to not only success, but mere survival for most studios. The point is that a more responsible gatekeeper would understand the nuances here, explain their reasoning without the requirement of a public scandal and, at the very least, allow a resubmission for review. It's that developers shouldn't fear it. And it's that one decision, such as this, shouldn't decide the fate of a studio.</p><p>Valve's problem - which has always been its problem - is its intention to remain a deliberate 'black box', a purposefully inscrutable Royal Family of video games abiding by "never complain, never explain", and one deliberately positioned as a kind of neutral bystander to the business of making and selling them. Valve's goal is to be an invisible facilitator, in the vein of banks, payment processors, or those blandly-named arms dealers to both sides. It's always been like this, it's been criticised for this across various mini-scandals through the years, and it has never changed and never will.</p>
<p>But that shouldn't stop us from making the point again. Neutrality is a myth. It's a facade, a false wall, a Potemkin Village. Steam's neutrality is fake in the way that "free speech absolutism" is fake, or "true libertarianism" is fake. There are always limits to freedom, and therefore always rules, and therefore always a rule-maker and rule-enforcer somewhere, putting their finger on the supposedly untouchable scales. And so what we have with Valve is the irony of a proudly libertarian organisation that practices, if anything, more like a dictatorship. Or maybe a managed economy (which often goes hand-and-hand with dictators). It's an organisation that controls the market (and takes a heavy 30 percent cut from it), makes the rules, and neither explains itself nor answers to anyone. For a company famed for its bossless working structure, the corporate answer to a bearded recluse living in the woods, in many ways it's its own worst nightmare.</p>
<p>It's also just one part of what is, at this point, a much bigger problem for games, and indeed for so many forms of media now. It might sound hyperbolic, but freedom of expression is under siege, and at the moment, in the mainstream, it's quite decisively losing. Steam's main competition today for instance, at least within the world of PC gaming, is the Epic Games Store. The 35 percent controlling share that Chinese conglomerate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has in Epic is of course an infamous topic for gamers (Tencent has close ties to the Chinese government, and is broadly considered to be a facilitator of censorship within China).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft's relationship with Tencent</a> is also in the process of getting much closer, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA is being bought</a> by a consortium of Saudi Arabia's public investment fund and Donald Trump's son-in-law's firm. Then there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">the astonishing censorship imposed by payment providers</a> Visa and Mastercard earlier this year, after an apparent push from campaign group Collective Shout, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/queer-developers-speak-out-as-adult-games-remain-in-limbo-following-payment-processor-showdown-at-steam-and-itchio">which disproportionately impacted LGBTQ+ games and developers</a>. And the recent news that Valve has, somewhat unsurprisingly, given it continues to operate there, just as it does in other censorship-heavy countries, complied with Russian censors' demands to remove indie game Flick Solitaire for "promoting non-traditional sexualities" (read: queer ones).</p><p>At this point, it feels like it's time to state the obvious: Valve is not your friend. Nor is any other business or corporation of any kind. Their incentives are not in line with their moral duties (in this case: making money from selling games, and treating the makers of those games with transparency, clarity, and and the courtesy of nuance). And they do have moral duties, despite claims to the opposite. Just because a business doesn't need to act ethically to succeed, that doesn't mean it <em>ought not to</em> act ethically at all. Businesses are run by people, and people are, even today, still bound by morality.</p>
<p>And this, finally, is the real point at hand. I am stating the obvious by saying this is wrong, that Valve ought to have not only a set of clear guidelines that it offers to all developers, but that it explains to them clearly when required. Payment providers should not decide what art does or does not get access to a paying audience - and therefore what gets made at all. Vast chunks of creative culture should not be owned by governments - any governments, let alone those that are autocratic, and that actively practice censorship and oppression. People who make video games, or any form of entertainment, should not have to self-censor in advance, which given its invisibility is perhaps the most dangerous consequence of all. There is so much to be lost here, and so much that we may never know we lost at all. All of this, again, is obvious. But at a time where the obvious things feel somehow less obvious than they did before, it feels more important than ever to just say it out loud.</p>

            <p>N64 shoot-em-up Viewpoint 2064 was never released, but 25 years later a final version of the game is now playable thanks to game preservation efforts.</p>
<p>Originally published by Sammy (now part of Sega), the shooter is a follow up to the Neo Geo space shooter Viewpoint, switching its isometric perspective for something more akin to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>, or even Panzer Dragoon.</p>
<p>However, after being shown at Nintendo's Spaceworld event in 1999, the game mysteriously disappeared without a proper cancellation and was never released. It remains unclear why.</p>

<p>Still, back in 2020 game preservation YouTube channel Hard4Games received a beta version of the game. And now, a few years later, an apparently final "master" cart has been discovered and sent to the channel thanks to an anonymous individual.</p><p>As such, Hard4Games has released a new video comparing the two versions to show what the game would have been like had it been released. It's something of a hybrid of old school shmups and the 3D approach of Star Fox, with a viewpoint behind a spacecraft that travels into the screen but is unable to move up or down. It's got planet and space environments, big bosses, and branching progression.</p>
<p>Viewpoint 2064 has now been made <a href="https://archive.org/details/viewpoint-2064-master">available to download</a> and play, should anyone wish to check it out all these years later.</p>
<p>The original developer of the game was Racjin, formerly known as Racdym, which also made N64 series Snowboard Kids published by Atlus. It's now a support studio, having worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-might-be-the-star-of-the-switch-2-launch-providing-both-the-animal-crossing-and-rpg-experience-it-needs">Fantasy Life i</a> most recently.</p>
<p>If you're still pining for the days of Star Fox on the N64, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-fox-mans-new-game-wild-blue-looks-delightfully-deliriously-like-star-fox">Giles Goddard's forthcoming Wild Blue</a> will certainly tick the box - it's a brand new shooter heavily reminiscent of the Nintendo barrel roll simulator.</p>

            <p>Resident Evil Survival Unit - the mobile strategy game based on Capcom's Resi series - has passed 2m downloads in just 10 days.</p>
<p>In a press release, co-developers Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation stated the game had "achieved outstanding global results" since its debut on 18th November.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>To mark this milestone, the studios are now offering Resident Evil Survival Unit players a "special in-game reward". To claim, players will need to enter the code '2m Survivors' into the promo code redemption site.</p>
<p>The Resi spin-off has been created in close collaboration with the main series' developer Capcom. As for what it is all about, Resident Evil Survival Unit kicks off with the protagonist in a "mysterious" hospital, having been used as an Umbrella test subject. "As you uncover the truth and attempt to escape, the story unfolds into a parallel world where original characters from the original series return," the official blurb teases, promising a "chilling new narrative".</p>
<p>Series regulars such as Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong and Claire Redfield all pop up for the mobile release.</p>
<p>To compare this figure with other mainline Resident Evil mobile releases, back in 2024, it was said that sales of Resident Evil 7 on iOS had flopped, having been bought by under 2000 people. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">the free-to-start game had been downloaded 83,000 times in 10 days</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Capcom assured its Resi fans the team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-pc-woes-like-monster-hunter-wilds-says-capcom">working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC</a>, after a multitude of technical issues this year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has certainly stolen the hearts of minds of gamers this season, remaining incredibly popular weeks after its explosive launch. In fact, Arc Raiders is proving to have such a steadfast place in the zeitgeist that it made an appearance in this week's South Park episode.</p>
<p>The story of how it happened comes from LinkedIn no less, <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/aakstg/">as marketing lead Ashley St. Germain took to the social media platform</a> to share the tale. According to Germain the creators of South Park contacted Embark Studios on Monday, asking for permission to use the game in an upcoming episode. Embark agreed.</p>
<p>Sending over footage of the game for South Park to use the following day, Arc Raiders appeared this Wednesday in the episode titled 'Turkey Trot'. In it Tolkien is seen glued to the extraction shooter, while South Park's annual Turkey Trot finds itself in dire need of money, having to look to Saudi Arabia for funding. This, funnily enough, is also something the video game industry is no stranger to.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is far from the first time South Park has shown video games some love. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-park-offers-wow-trial">There was the legendary episode 'Make Love, not Warcraft'</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/uvphu3/a_quick_mention_of_mgs_5_in_south_parks_2013/">Metal Gear Solid 5</a>, and Guitar Hero. There are also a selection of pretty good South Park games, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-review">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a>, which reviewer Dan Whitehead wrote was: "A decent RPG wrapped up in a grossly hilarious licence, South Park will be remembered more for its gags than its gameplay."</p><p>Arc Raiders, it seems, will continue its life in the spotlight for a while longer. It only recently released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-removes-weapon-swap-exploit">patch fixing some of the games' biggest problems</a>, including a quick swap exploit that was throwing a wrench into close-ranged fights.</p>

            <p>
These days, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> is perhaps best known for its wonderful work on last year's stupendous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, but the studio's horror oeuvre goes much farther back. And it's bringing its first big hit - and its ship-bound sequel - to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> very soon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>: The Final Masterpiece Edition comes to Nintendo's platform on 19th December.
</p>
<p>
Announced back in October, Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition is a version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layers-of-fear-remake-launching-15th-june-on-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">Bloober's 2023 Layers of Fear remake</a>, with a few added extras thrown in. The remake, if you're unfamiliar, was a bit of an unusual proposition, taking both Layers of Fear games (plus new story bits and old DLC) and weaving them together into a single, interlinking narrative.

<p>
That means you got Layers of Fear 1 and its surreal first-person horror trip through the ever-shifting mansion of a tortured painter; its Inheritance DLC and a brand-new chapter featuring the painter's wife; its 2018 sequel - inspired by the golden age of Hollywood - which followed a brand-new protagonist on an avant-garde journey through the innards of an ocean liner and their troubled past, plus a new framing device focusing on a lighthouse-bound character known as The Writer, tying the whole thing together. All with enhanced visuals and new gameplay elements, including a lantern to ward off shadowy terrors.
</p><p>
Switch 2's The Final Masterpiece Edition includes all the above, plus the remake's Final Prologue chapter which originally released as post-launch DLC. It also promises HDR, ray tracing, and dynamic lighting, alongside support for touchscreen and motion controls. It's a whole lot of Layers of Fear, in other words - which is fine by me. The series might be a little rough around the edges compared to Bloober's more recent stuff, but I'm a sucker for any game that goes all-in on the sheer hallucinatory spectacle - and Layers of Fear's ever-shifting spaces make for a wonderfully disorientating, gleefully surreal time.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a> won't be receiving a second expansion to follow Claws of Awaji, unlike previous games in the series. Instead, Ubisoft is working on "chunkier updates", similar in size to the Attack on Titan crossover released earlier this week.</p>
<p>Since the launch of 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, releasing at least two expansions has become the norm for the series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> was even originally planned as a further expansion to Valhalla, before becoming a standalone game.</p>
<p>Yet that won't be the case with Shadows, released earlier this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-release-date-announced-new-game-plus-coming-next-week">Claws of Awaji was released back in September</a>, but that will be the only expansion for the game.</p>

<p>"As of now, at this moment for Year Two, there is no expansion on the size of [Claws of Awaji] that is planned, currently," said associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois in an interview with YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/5Iijrbz8XBc">JorRaptor</a>. "We're still working on content for post-launch and supporting it, but it's not a full-on DLC the way a season pass would have had in previous years."</p>
<p>Lemay-Comtois did admit the situation could change, but for now Ubisoft's plan is to keep updates "small and reactive and see how the community feels about it".</p>
<p>He continued: "We're trying to re-adjust for Year Two a little bit. There's learning from Year One that we can apply to Year Two. Any content we want to do in Year Two is probably going to be more sparse, so not a drip-feed like you said but chunkier updates that shake things up a little more. I'm not announcing anything at this point but the strategy for Year One was to be quick and reactive, so it means smaller drops often. For Year Two we don't need to put fires out or anything, so it's more about what good, chunky little piece of meat... we can drop and have people come back to it and enjoy it."</p>
<p>Since its release, Shadows has already received a number of updates with fan-requested features, addressing the "fires" Lemay-Comtois mentioned. Now, the team is free to add more sizable updates, just not at the size of a full expansion.</p>
<p>Instead, those updates will be "something like yesterday's update plus, something at minimum this size".</p>
<p>That would be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-lands-unexpected-crossover-with-anime-attack-on-titan-but-its-only-available-for-one-month">Attack on Titan crossover added earlier this week</a>, though it's only available for a limited time. Still, the reaction online to this addition hasn't been overly positive, with <a href="https://x.com/NikTek/status/1994083060103696842?s=20">posts on social media</a> noting poor quest design and animations.</p>
<p>The game will soon arrive on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Ubisoft yesterday detailing its features</a>.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Mirage, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">received a surprise free story DLC recently</a>, reportedly backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.</p>

            <p>The Let it Die sequel - Let it Die: Inferno - which is coming out next week (4th December), seems to have been built using a considerable amount of generative AI.</p>
<p>Let it Die: Inferno is the somewhat surprising sequel to Suda51 studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">Grasshopper's quirky 2016 action game Let it Die</a>, which mixed action and base infiltration and asymmetric multiplayer to novel effect. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battle-royale-deathverse-let-it-die-dev-to-temporarily-suspend-the-game-just-four-months-after-launch">a purely multiplayer follow-up called Deathverse, which flopped</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/">The Let it Die: Inferno Steam page</a> now discloses: "AI-generated content has been used and then edited by our team for certain parts of the in-game voices, music, and graphics." This content apparently includes background signboard textures, records illustrations, infocast videos and voices and music.</p>
<p>To what degree each of those parts of the game uses AI, we don't know, but the areas outlined - art, video, voice and music - are large areas, so the game's AI use could be substantial.</p>

<p>Inferno was only announced to the world a couple of months ago, during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">a September PlayStation State of Play</a>, so it hasn't had much of a marketing campaign. Perhaps that suggests a project sped to release, which is, of course, something AI could help achieve.</p>
<p>Grasshopper isn't involved with the sequel, which is entirely developed by Supertrick Games, co-developer of the original game. And the core of the game has shifted slightly to PvEvP, meaning real-time multiplayer will be a thing here.</p>
<p>Were it not for Steam's AI disclosure policy, we likely wouldn't have known about AI use in Inferno until people bought and played it, and noticed it, and reports spread around. In that regard, it's a helpful tool for shoppers, should they care. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">there are people who think AI disclosures aren't necessary, such as Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney</a>, who believes AI use will be so commonplace there's "no sense" in making every game disclose how it's been used. Does it affect your buying decision?</p>

            <p>Later today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> fan film For Liberty will premiere for the whole of Super Earth to watch. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film will reach almost an hour in length, longer than any other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> fan project made to date.</p>
<p>The fan film is not officially endorsed or made in partnership with Sony or Arrowhead, but it has proven exhilarating to the Helldivers community. As of writing, the latest trailer has accrued almost 300,000 views in just over a month.</p>
<p>The film itself is animated in the Helldivers style, following the experiences of some brave soldiers of Super Earth as they navigate the treacherous galaxy the popular third-person shooter takes place in. It's also fully voice acted, with six actors lending their talents to the project.</p>

<p>One of them - Kevin Lauer - spoke to Eurogamer about For Liberty earlier this week. A previous actor on Plot Coalition's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> series, he is a relatively new fan of the Helldivers series. However, having dived in to better learn about his role and the background for the film, Lauer quickly learned the ins-and-outs of Helldivers quirkiness and its general appeal.</p><p>"I didn't play Helldivers until it launched on Xbox earlier this year, so at first I was guided by the director," Lauer stated. "Then when I played the game I was like: 'oh, that makes sense, I understand that reference now!'</p>
<p>"I would say it is pretty accurate. It's not as humorous as some people think. There are three trailers: one's very liberty, democratic. Another is quite solemn and dark, and the last trailer is in the middle ground. It does have that humour, and there are a lot of things in there I think a lot of fans will recognise. This is made by fans of Helldivers, and I think that will definitely show through."</p>
<p>Lauer plays the Veteran, a stand-in for the community idealised 'John Helldiver' who represents what it means to fight for Super Earth. According to Lauer, the community reception to the project has been exceptionally positive.</p>
<p>Lauer explained: "I've been doing content creation for a while so I'm used to negative comments, but there have been so few. People are excited, or they're asking how long the film is (laughs). But it's been very well received, and as far as I know in terms of fan projects there's been nothing to this scale."</p><p>According to Lauer, even Arrowhead is hosting its own watch party today upon the film's release. He stated: "After the first trailer in February or March, they reached out and they thought it was really cool. I heard there's going to be a watch party for it at Arrowhead, and I think it's really cool that the developers are so engaged with the community."</p>
<p>All of this is fun, but it begs the question: why is Helldivers 2 so ripe for such fan projects. For Liberty may be the largest fan film released, but it's far from the only creative work made in the world of Helldivers. What about the game and its players attracts such passion? For Lauer, the answer is clear.</p>
<p>"One thing I've learned as a new fan is everyone is in on the joke, everyone is 'brainwashed'," Lauer concludes. "If one of my friends in-game is like, that's a dumb thing, I'll shoot him in the head because it's like, don't question democracy. Don't do that, and they'll do it to me! I think it's just a fun simple game, personally I feel there's a need for cooperative games, and it just works. It's nice, it's crazy, and you can just be ridiculous! It's goofy and it plays well."</p><p>

Helldivers 2 continues riding high off its initial popularity, keeping its dedicated fan base engaged with constant updates and an ongoing Galactic War on numerous fronts. One of its biggest strengths is allowing players to tell their own stories, something Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestadt said in a GDC talk on the game's development. You can read more about Helldivers 2, as well as how developers find continous success in the brutal live service market, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">in Eurogamer's longform deep dive on the topic from earlier this month</a>.

            <p>A trademark for something known as Control: Resonant has been registered in Europe, leading many to speculate developer Remedy has something up its sleeve for The Game Awards next month.</p>
<p>The trademark itself was spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1st</a>, with the publication noting it has been classified under tags such as video game services, miscellaneous products and the production of entertainment in the form of TV series and cinematographic films.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>While Control developer Remedy is not mentioned in the trademark's registration, Nordia Attorneys at Law is. This is the same firm Remedy has used for its previous trademarks.</p>
<p>As for what the end product could actually be, Remedy has already announced a Control sequel. There is also a Control-flavoured film or TV <em>something</em> in the pipeline. In 2024, Annapurna announced it had partnered with Remedy to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">develop and produce film, TV and audiovisual projects based on the studio's Alan Wake and Control franchises</a>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Control's sequel was first announced back in 2022, with the developer simply stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">it would be an "unexpected journey"</a>. In the time since, the developer has kept most details under wraps, although in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">August of last year it stated "important" Control 2 features were now in "playable form"</a>. The following November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-remedy-confirms">Remedy then confirmed the sequel will be an action-RPG</a>. A teaser for the sequel was also, perhaps, tucked away in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">its Alan Wake 2 DLC</a>, The Lake House.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">The Game Awards 2025 just a couple of weeks away</a>, it seems that if Remedy has something more to share about Control: Resonant soon, that will be the time to do it. What do you hope Remedy is working on here?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Remedy news, earlier this year the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-change-at-alan-wake-studio-remedy-as-ceo-steps-down-following-failure-of-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak">studio's CEO Tero Virtala stepped down from his position at the company</a>. While Remedy's announcement did not indicate a reason for Virtala's departure after 11 years at the company, it followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">profit warning to investors</a> "due to weak sales" of the studio's multiplayer Control spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p>

            <p>There's a very strong argument for the PlayStation 2 being the greatest games console of all time. I'm not going to get into all that now, as I don't really have the energy to tackle questions like "but what about Mario and Zelda?" or "did Sony pay you to say this? Smells of secret sponsored content". What I am going to reminisce about is that golden PS2 era, when the world felt bigger, the pace of change was startling, and the sense of discovery was closer to finding a message in a bottle than it was to watching the latest TikTok from an influencer. When Sony released the PlayStation 2 25 years ago the way we navigated our way through the console's library of games felt like going on an adventure.</p>
<p>Listen, I am aware that the world in 2000 had some similarities to now. The internet and websites existed, sure, but a lot of people didn't have internet access at home, and if they did it was incredibly slow and tended to be something you used for a small amount of time each day, while the rest of your family complained about not being able to make phone calls. It wasn't something that was just there, always accessible, built into our everyday lives. Websites, including this one, were smaller, hobbyist affairs in the main (in fact we were only about a year old). Print magazines still ruled. And there were a lot that were dedicated to PlayStation.</p>
<p>One of the often cited issues with today's internet, by contrast, is the sense of a relentless feed of information. Not just information you are actively seeking out, but information about everything, whether you really want to be seeing and hearing about it or not. We are full to the brim, bursting (and often struggling) with things we don't really need to know. Of course, awareness isn't strictly a bad thing, but back in 2000 you'd generally have to choose to find out about something, like how I chose to read as many gaming magazines as I could afford. Each issue, generally released every four weeks, I'd get a new wave of info to pore over and digest. I felt satisfied with what I knew, despite not really having the full picture at all.</p>
<p>Some websites were offering video - low quality, small, and usually short, which it had to be in order for our internet connection speeds to be able to cope. YouTube, a service that's hard to imagine not existing, didn't arrive until 2005, and even then it was a long time before it became what you think of it today. Let's Plays, entire walkthroughs, tips videos, streams - these simply didn't exist in a meaningful way. Those of you reading this who are of a certain vintage know this already, of course, but equally some of you might not remember a time before on-demand video. It absolutely impacted the way games were discovered and enjoyed.</p><p>A big part of my love of the PS2 is tied to my age at the time (18, with a part-time job and a reasonable disposable income for the first time) and the simple fact that physical stores and media were still very much how retail operated. Again, yes, online retailers existed, but digital games weren't a thing, and big stores pushed video games like we'd never seen before. It is hard to fathom when looking back today, but I used to go into town to check out what had been released, not knowing exactly what my local Electronics Boutique would have on its shelves - every weekend a new little adventure all of its own.</p>
<p>For all the reasons above, it was entirely possible to buy a PS2 game having never seen it in action, perhaps never having seen a screenshot until you picked up the case, and in many instances from my own memory having never heard of the game at all. This sense of heading into the unknown, exploring a vast world of games, I'm sure others felt during at least some of the generation to follow, but it was a different world then. One full of more information, more ways to sell you things, and fewer risks.</p>

<figcaption>Games like this you could stumble upon in a way that is almost impossible today.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z20pK4tGdGw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Games that spring to mind when I think of those that I bought on whim, based almost entirely on the vibes I got from the box include: Gregory Horror Show (Capcom's bizarre hotel-set survival horror), Ring of Red (alt history turn-based strategy with mechs), Mr Moskeeto (perhaps the oddest stealth game ever made), and Sky Odyssey (an arcade flight sim with a nice adventure twist). No doubt I probably came across some of these in magazines, but I'm 100 percent sure I'd never seen them running before I played them on my own PS2.</p><p>And these are great games, not the kind of pap you'd find today sold in bargain stores, aimed at shoppers who don't know any better. Most importantly, these are all games I might not have bought had I known more, and I certainly wouldn't have had my overall enjoyment elevated by that feeling I'd discovered something no one else had. It's easy today to fire up a list of the PS2's hidden gems, but we were figuring it all out ourselves back then. My fondness of Gregory Horror Show is in part due to the game just being great fun, but also the fact that it was all a new, unspoiled experience.</p>
<p>It's slightly hypocritical to say this as I write an article to be published on a website that exists to tell you about new and interesting video games, but I preferred how things were. Can you remember the last time you bought and played a game not knowing what you were going to get, outside of a back-of-the-box overview? Without seeing any gameplay footage of it at all? Imagine playing some of today's most wonderful games without years of knowledge having been built up, the core gameplay and mechanics largely unknown. This happened all the time during the PS2 era (especially in the early 2000s), and the result was a console blessed with so many games that seemed to pop up from nowhere.</p>
<p>Barring a near apocalyptic event, we're not going back to that. We're in an information age where we're told everything in the belief that we need to know it all, in order to make decisions. Do you honestly think you'll be taken aback, startled by what you're seeing when you play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> for the first time? I'd be amazed if there isn't at least an hour of detailed gameplay walkthroughs out there before the game is released. So thank you PlayStation 2, and that era before being always online. It was the best.</p>

If you've been patiently waiting for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, your time has nearly come: it slinks onto the console next Tuesday, 2nd December. And ahead of its arrival, Ubisoft has shared a bit of a deep-dive detailing some of the technical jiggery pokery it used to make it work on Nintendo's platform, alongside some of its exclusive features.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launched for other platforms back in March following a number of delays, whisking the series to 16th century feudal Japan for an adventure focused on dual protagonists Yasuke and Fujibayashi Naoe. It was well-received too, with Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Tom Phillips calling it "majestic in scope, impressive in detail" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">his four star review</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the Switch 2 version, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3eHpj3aktX4nWY150OEHJL/assassins-creed-shadows-deep-dive-into-the-nintendo-switch-2-system-port">latest blog post</a> confirms it'll include all updates released for Assassin's Creed Shadows so far, with the exception of its Claws of Awaji expansion, which is due in 2026. The company also notes future Switch 2 updates will align with other platforms, and it'll be working on console-specific improvements too, with talk of optimisation patches plus keyboard and mouse compatibility when docked.

<p>
Wondering what else you can expect on Switch 2? Ubisoft is targeting a "stable 30fps" in both docked and handheld modes, saying it's done a "lot of code-level work... to optimise and adapt the game architecture". This, it adds, has enabled it to "streamline certain technical aspects of the quality, without compromising the player's experience or the richness of the game."
</p><p>
Elsewhere it's foregoing Switch 2's ray-traced global illumination support in favour of baked global illumination "mainly for RAM memory reasons", while level of details, draw distances, texture resolution, and element loading have been "carefully adjusted" in an effort to maintain performance. Switch 2 will also feature fewer NPCs in highly populated areas to "ensure smooth gameplay", although Ubisoft reckons environmental richness "remains largely intact". There's also DLSS support for "smoother" performance.
</p>
<p>
As for handheld mode compromises, there've been "adjustments to image quality, draw distance, and LOD settings" to accomodate GPU limitations. However, variable refresh rates make an appearance, as does HDR.
</p>
<p>
If it's Switch 2-specific features you want, there's touch screen navigation when interacting with maps and menus. Additionally, cross-progression is supported via Ubisoft Connect, meaning it's possible to seamlessly hop between platforms if you've been playing - or were planning on playing - Shadows elsewhere. And as a reminder, Assassin's Creed Shadows arrives on Switch 2, next Tuesday, 2nd December.

            <p>The Game Awards are nearly here, your annual fix for celebrating the best this year had to offer and checking out cool reveals. However, while the show is sure to be packed with all sorts of exciting new trailers to gaze upon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> will not be among them.</p>
<p>This harsh truth comes from none other than CD Projekt Red co-CEO Michał Nowakowski, who took to X to express his pleasure at the upcoming RPG's presence on the Most Anticipated Games list, as well as snuff out hopes of a coinciding trailer.</p>
<p>Nowakowski wrote: "I'm very happy to see The Witcher 4 nominated in the Most Anticipated Game category at The Game Awards. Thanks to everyone who has already voted - your support means a lot to us. We won't be bringing any new content to TGA this year, but we're, as always, excited to watch the show and celebrate this amazing industry's great night alongside all of you."</p>

<p>Development on The Witcher 4 is well underway, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-bolsters-the-witcher-4-team-with-key-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-talent">with CD Projekt Red hiring new talent in recent months to maintain the charge to its eventual release</a>. We last saw the game in-action back in June, though while that demo may have <em>looked</em> like gameplay, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">actually a representation of what the tech could do and wasn't representative of the final game</a>, according to CD Projekt Red. That being said, the performance seen during that tech demo is what the game is aiming for, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4s-northern-setting-revealed-in-new-unreal-livestream">and it did show off the northern setting for The Witcher 4</a>.</p><p>Even without The Witcher 4, The Game Awards is set to be a special one. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has already broken records as the most nominated game of 2025</a>, and we've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-megabonk-developer-withdraws-from-the-game-awards-following-incorrect-nomination">had a withdrawal courtesy of Megabonk developer Vedinad</a>. It'll be well worth checking out next month.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> fans have accused <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> of accessibility negligence with its forthcoming Fan Fest event in California. After the "accessibility shitshow" of the previous event in the US, fans fear the production company of next year's event is ill-equipped to deal with accessibility needs and are vowing not to attend.</p>
<p>The Fan Fest events are huge conventions held regularly in the US, Europe, and Japan, where details of the MMORPG's next expansion are typically revealed. The last of these in the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-is-a-theme-park-for-its-passionate-community">held in Las Vegas in 2023</a>, was <a href="https://kaylriene.com/2023/07/31/final-fantasy-xiv-fan-fest-las-vegas-2023-was-kind-of-a-shitshow/">criticised for accessibility issues</a>. I attended myself and, while I'm not disabled, can attest to general poor organisation, lengthy queues for food, and a lack of facilities; the London event, by contrast, ran smoothly.</p>
<p>As such, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-dates-announced-so-when-is-the-next-expansion-due">move to Anaheim California for the 2026 event</a> was initially seen as a positive move, away from the desert heat. However, accessibility is once again proving to be an issue for the event organisers, as concerns have been raised by fans about how the third-party company Square Enix has hired is handling accessibility needs.</p>

<p>Upon purchasing a ticket for the event, fans are able to highlight their need for ADA assistance (relating to the Americans with Disabilities Act). While this initially appeared to be a positive step, these attendees are then emailed and required to have a personal phone call with a third-party organisation to raise their specific needs. Attendees then have 24 hours to agree to any accommodations.</p><p>Eurogamer can verify these emails, which are sent from The Trade Group, a company specialising in trade shows and conventions. Its work includes events for the Pokémon 2023 World Championship Series in Japan, and exhibits for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, Stadia, and Magic the Gathering among others.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is seemingly a single point of contact at The Trade Group dealing with accessibility concerns, who must now personally call all potential attendees with accessibility needs. As such, fans believe their accessibility needs will not be met, that The Trade Group isn't taking concerns seriously, and the convention will not be safe to attend.</p>
<p>"The way that FanFest handled accessibility in 2023 was the worst accessibility experience I have had at a con, and their booth at PAX East 2024 wasn't much better," wrote Final Fantasy 14 player Sara Winters <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/524332-Accessibility-Missteps-Fanfest-2026">on the game's forum</a>, under the username divisionten. "However at PAX West 24 and then East 25, the booth took some wonderful and active strides to make its space accessible and friendly for all players. It was clear that SQUEX took the criticism of prior events to heart and actively improved.</p>
<p>"When there was an ADA marker in the sign-ups for FF 2026, that gave me hope that you all had learned the lessons of FF 23. However, the third-party company Square hired has been fumbling the bag repeatedly. There is one singular point of contact for accessibility at this third-party company, and [they're] under orders to call each person who requests ADA assistance."</p>

<p>Winters, who is a blind player of Final Fantasy 14 and an accessibility consultant, conducted their own survey of 1000 attendees of nerd conventions and found about 14 percent have accessibility needs. They also spoke on this issue with the head of panels at MAGfest and organisers of PAX. In the case of Fan Fest, 15,000 tickets were sold at the previous Las Vegas event - assuming a similar attendance in Anaheim, that's over 2,000 people that just one person is expected to personally call to discuss their needs. What's more, access to outside food and drink or a quiet room are seemingly considered accessibility needs in this instance, rather than general convention norms, meaning many attendees will not have their assumed needs met.</p><p>"It's very clear to me that this is not the fault of this individual employee, who was clearly assigned a task vastly outside [their] scope," wrote Winters in their forum thread. "But if you - SQUEX - actually want to follow through with your commitment to accessibility, then you need to hire actual accessibility consultants and do what they recommend."</p>
<p>Winters also shared their experience on BlueSky, adding: "Means testing doesn't work. You are making it harder for disabled people to access services they need, and the non-disabled who really want to game the system will do so anyway.

</span></p><p>Winters confirmed to Eurogamer the consultant at The Trade Group has experience in special education, which appears to have been conflated with accessibility needs. "Special education is adjacent to accessibility - it's not the same thing," said Winters. What's more, a phone call itself is not accessible as a means of communication, especially for those who are deaf or have auditory impairments among other disabilities.</p>
<p>"They're functionally treating accessibility like an IEP [individual education plan], giving each individual a call with individual accommodations," said Winters. "That's just not enforceable, feasible, or usable."</p>
<p>Other players have shared their concerns on both the Final Fantasy 14 forum and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1p6cchi/na_fanfest_accessibility_issues/">reddit</a> in response to Winters' thread. One player didn't tick the ADA box when booking a ticket as the phone call "seemed like too involved of a process" for their accommodations. "I'd hoped that provisions would be available without me needing to jump through hoops before the event, but based on FanFest 2023 experiences and the vibe you're getting from jumping through said hoops, I'm now getting a little nervous," they wrote.</p><p>Another player noted at the last event their medical needs changed the day before attending, but the new phone call system wouldn't account for this. They added the system isn't the fault of the single consultant, but it "will inevitably fail disabled attendees and overwhelm the staff member responsible for them unless this is properly addressed and adjusted".</p>

<p>The Anaheim Convention Center itself does have a guide to accessibility on its <a href="https://visitanaheim.mediavalet.com/portals/ACC-Rates-Policies-Guidelines">website</a>. This includes such basic provisions as wheelchair access, elevators, and accessible seating, but notes individual events are responsible for contracting with ASL interpreters, for example. The convention centre has not responded to Eurogamer's request for comment.</p>
<p>This would suggest that basic accessibility needs will be provided at the convention, as is required by law. Yet beyond that, attendees are concerned their individual needs won't be met. As one forum poster wrote, "accessibility improvements are a boon for all".</p>
<p>"I cannot in any sort of good conscience waste my time and money to attend this con," surmised Winters on Bluesky. "'23 was an accessibility shitshow, and I won't spend a grand to be subjected to that again."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted both Square Enix and The Trade Group for comment, but received no response.</p>
<p>The last expansion for Final Fantasy 14, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Dawntrail, was less well-received by players than previous expansions</a> and, anecdotally, player numbers have dropped since its release. As such, the next round of Fan Fest events are particularly important for Square Enix to ensure a strong future for its award-winning MMORPG, especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">main rival World of Warcraft will receive a new expansion next year</a>.</p>

            <p>Making developers disclose whether or not generative AI has been used during the making of a game, and how, "makes no sense", according to Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney.</p>
<p>Sweeney made the remarks while responding to a post on X by former Unreal Engine developer Matt Workman (who, incidentally, <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1993757796723306612">uses generative AI in his motion capture work</a>) who said: "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more."</p>
<p>"Agreed," agreed Sweeney. "The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."</p>

<p>Sweeney then followed his comment a few hours' later with another post that read, "Why stop at AI use? We could have mandatory disclosures for what shampoo brand the developer uses. Customers deserve to know lol."</p>
<p>The 'made with AI' labels Sweeney and Workman are referring to are mandatory disclosures developers must make on Steam if their game contains traces of AI use. Take <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Arc Raiders' Steam page</a>, for example: its "AI Generated Content Disclosure" explains that, "During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team." <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders' Epic Games Store page</a> does not carry such a disclosure.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sweeney's comments have understandably provoked reaction across the gaming industry, with decorated indie developer Mike Bithell, of Bithell Games, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3m6lzdewov22r">posting on Bluesky</a>: "I just find this really sad. Imagine being so certain that you need slop machines to do your work, that you convince yourself that EVERYBODY must need them," he wrote.</p><p>Sweeney's declaration that "AI will be involved in nearly all future production" suggests Epic might be looking at using it across its colossal business - a business that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, the ubiquitous Unreal Engine, and the Steam-like Epic Games Store. And if it does, that decision will likely reverberate across the industry.</p>
<p>Generative AI use in game development remains a contentious issue, as studios figure out how to potentially embrace this powerful technology without risking people's jobs - assuming that is even possible. South Korean company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation">Krafton, which makes PUBG and Inzoi, has taken considerable flak for announcing it is now an "AI-first" company</a> and offering voluntary redundancy to staff who don't want to be a part of that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-been-really-heartened-to-see-the-community-revolt-against-ai-stuff-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-distances-himself-from-investor-kraftons-controversial-ai-first-mandate">PUBG creator Brendan Greene has distanced himself</a> and his Krafton-backed studio PlayerUnknown Productions from that approach, saying "I've been really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff". Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-feel-that-games-created-with-only-ai-will-have-soul-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-director-doesnt-think-ai-can-replace-human-creativity-but-the-studio-is-using-it-in-reasonable-ways">Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the game director of The Witcher 3 and co-director of Cyberpunk 2077, believes games made with AI will have no soul</a>, but also that there can be good uses of AI during development.</p>

            <p>Paradox has blamed poor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> sales on the game sitting outside of its core area of gaming expertise, which apparently made it difficult for the company to gauge commercially what the game would do.</p>
<p>Paradox boss Frederik Wester made the remarks in a statement alongside the company announcing a SEK 355m (approximately £28m) write-down for development costs of the game - a loss of sorts.</p>
<p>"Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is a strong vampire fantasy and we are pleased with the developers' work on the game," Wester said in <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-ab-writes-down-msek-355-of-capitalised-development-costs-for-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">a Paradox press release</a>. "We've had high expectations for a long time, since we saw that it was a good game with a strong IP in a genre with a broad appeal.</p>

<p>"A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales.</p>
<p>"Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we'll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness' strong brand catalogue in the future."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We'll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness' strong brand catalogue in the future"</em></blockquote>
<p>Sales figures for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 haven't been announced, but GameDiscover.co estimates (seen by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/paradox-takes-37-million-write-down-after-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-misses-targets">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) suggest as few as 121,500 copies have been sold, amounting to something like £3m in revenue. That's nowhere near enough to recoup development costs; remember, Bloodlines 2 was in development for a long time, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-a-darkly-fascinating-immersive-sim">initially been announced in 2019</a> before being scrapped and repurposed by a different developer, which lead to the Bloodlines 2 version we have now.</p>
<p>Wester followed his remarks by promising to deliver <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lasombra-and-toreador-clans-added-to-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-base-game-following-fan-backlash-to-original-premium-dlc-plans">the two post-release Bloodlines 2 story expansions</a>, access to which was sold in deluxe editions of the game - replacing the previously planned access to two of the game's six vampire clans. One of these story add-ons will focus on aggressive vampire sheriff Benny Muldoon, and the other will focus on worshipped Nightclub-owning vampire Ysabella Moore.</p>
<p>"Our post-release plan remains firm," said Wester. "We will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year."</p>

<p>Paradox's apology-of-sorts coincides with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-cant-make-bloodlines-2-theres-not-enough-time-theres-not-enough-money-the-chinese-room-reflects-on-inheriting-a-troubled-vampire-the-masquerade-project">the former boss of Bloodlines 2 developer The Chinese Room, Dan Pinchbeck, revealing that the project had a fundamental naming problem</a>. Calling the game Bloodlines 2 set unrealistic expectations of what the game would be, he said. "We used to sit there and have these planning sessions of how do we get them [publisher Paradox] to not call it Bloodlines 2," Pinchbeck said. Evidently, those discussions never went any further, and I wonder whether if they had, the situation Paradox finds itself in might have been avoided.</p><p>It's not the first time Paradox has talked about risks associated with straying from its core field of strategy game expertise. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">Ed spoke to Paradox execs Mattias Lilja and Henrik Fåhraeus about exactly this matter late last year - and about refocusing to rebuild trust and to survive</a>."We do want to take risks," Lilja said. "We want to try new things. But we need to be much more disciplined about it than we've been. The further from the core, the lower the investment should be."</p>

<p>Fåhraeus even referenced Bloodlines 2 during that conversation, saying, "Bloodlines is probably the last to come from that [old] strategy. It's quite far from our core area, it's an outlier... but again, we want to release the best game we can. It's a tall order to measure up to a cult classic."</p>
<p>But name-based expectations weren't the only reason Bloodlines 2 struggled. Even judged as a linear action game, which is what it is, it falls down in several areas, and ends up feeling hollow and forgettable as an overall experience.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has received a patch this morning, fixing an exploit that allowed players to shoot quicker than intended with the help of quick-use items, which was allowing some to dominate fights with other players.</p>
<p>This was best used with the El Toro shotgun, a close-ranged powerhouse balanced with its low rate of fire. With this exploit, players were unloading multiple shells in quick succession, causing havoc on live servers. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AdOeQ96Ecg">Here's an excellent video by Gravez that shows it in action</a>. This was dubbed "double pumping" by some members of the community, as you could often knock out a light-shield user with two well placed shots with the El Toro. Stop laughing.</p>
<p>The way it worked was simple: you would shoot, which initiates the re-chambering animation, and then quickly press the quick use button during this animation, followed by the button for the weapon slot of your weapon mid-animation. This would cancel the animation early with a new round ready to go, slicing down the reload time significantly.</p>

</figure>
<p>There are other fixes included in the patch that deserve their flowers. All locked rooms across the game have exploit mitigation mechanics added, following weeks of players finding inventive ways to break in without keycards. Players can also no longer push other people around by jumping on each other's backs, so no more funny business.</p>
<p>There are also some more minor fixes, such as main menu texture problems going the way of the dodo, lighting artifacts upon entering a map being removed, and the correct voice options actually being reflected on restarting the game.</p>
<p>It's not the most bombastic patch, but it is one with a massive impact on the experience for high-end players. PvP is now fairer, and you'll actually need keycards to get the best loot. Stellar Montis should now be a safer place for raiders, minus all the Arc still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-nerfs-one-of-its-most-devastating-weapons-floods-your-room-with-ducks">hunting for your rubber ducks</a> of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-its-pc-record-yet-again-as-it-inches-towards-half-a-million-concurrent-players">A nice location for the still-absurd number of players to dive into</a>, relatively worry free.</p>

            <p>Not to toot my own trumpet or anything, but I've got a 2x2m square in my house that might be the most impossible 2x2m square anyone has ever seen. Granted, I'm not familiar with <em>all</em> 2x2m squares in the world, and I'm sure there are some corkers out there, but I've spent the last few days in mine and - goodness - have I experienced some things. I should probably explain.</p>

<p>Hotel Infinity is the latest game from Studio Chyr, the developer behind Manifold Garden, one of 2019's best, most thoroughly confounding puzzlers. That game was an ode to impossible spaces, its vast recursive planes folding endlessly back and forth in a furious bamboozlement of your puzzling prowess. Hotel Infinity (out now on PSVR2 and Meta Quest) is equally enamoured with discombobulating geometry, setting players loose in an eerily deserted, richly atmospheric five-star hotel - all warm wood tones and soothing gramophone jazz - that flatly refuses to abide by the fundamental laws of physics. Corridors twist in on themselves, ever-descending elevators somehow end up back where they started, cavernous rooms casually invert, and you might just catch a glimpse of yourself if you round a corner fast enough. It's wild - even more so as it's all in VR.</p>

<p>Disregarding the spatial theatrics for a moment though, Hotel Infinity is a puzzle game, and you'll primarily interact with its world via your floating digital hands, using them to yank levers, slide bolts, spin cranks, and manipulate items in familiar 1:1 fashion. Probably wisely, Studio Chyr reins in the surrealism where its puzzles are concerned, opting for an approachable difficulty that keeps the pace swift and the giddying environmental set-pieces coming. But that doesn't mean puzzles aren't engaging; there's a pleasing physicality as you mix drinks in the hotel's lounge bar, plonk at a piano to solve strange equations, or peer through an imaginary magnifying glass to reveal invisible clues - but, more importantly, they're all given a presentational twist befitting their impossible surroundings. In itself, rifling through drawers to find a key might not be the most thrilling of tasks, but when one of those drawers contains another drawer which slides upward to reveal a full-sized bookshelf on which sits a tiny cupboard containing another drawer holding the key - well, it elevates the whole affair.</p>



<p>But as handsomely staged as its conundrums may be, they're probably the least interesting thing about Hotel Infinity. And it's here we get back to that 2x2m square. Studio Chyr has built Hotel Infinity around roomscale movement, which essentially means you use your feet rather than a control stick to navigate its environments - so, if you want to, say, reach a distant table, you need to shift your legs and physically walk there. And it's brilliantly transporting. Roomscale movement isn't new, by any means, but Hotel Infinity's implementation feels especially ingenious and absolutely fundamental to its success - to the point where I'm comfortable saying if you're considering getting it to play using the alternative stationary control scheme, don't even bother. Sure, that means the most challenging puzzle you're likely to face - if your home is as cramped as mine - is clearing enough space to play, but it's worth it.</p><p>Hotel Infinity's disdain for spatial coherence means Studio Chyr can do some clever stuff within that 2x2m square. You begin, for instance, by entering the hotel through its revolving door, its opulent (albeit low-poly) lobby stretching out before you - grand balcony circling an enormous chandelier above, abandoned suitcases stacked high to be spirited away to unseen corners, a reception desk far beyond. It's a massive virtual environment, far bigger than 2x2m, but that's okay; a rope cordon guides you gently to the left,  and suddenly, impossibly, a passageway opens out where a wall should be. You swing on in and continue forward, emerging - unexpectedly - midway across the lobby.  And Chyr builds its entire game out of these spatial contrivances, creating a world which allows you to keep on walk-walk-walking - along corridors, around corners, through guest rooms and palatial dining halls - without ever leaving that 2x2m square. It's a fiendishly clever bit of sleight-of-hand and the sense of scale, as you explore the hotel seemingly unbounded, is immense.</p>



<p>Nor can I get enough of its inventive, geometry confounding set-pieces. You'll take an elevator ride through strange liminal spaces, the endless hallways glimpsed through its shutter door giving way to sudden exteriors plunging down to dizzying depths; you'll twist through labyrinthine hallways; pass windows revealing increasingly disorientating unrealities beyond - the kind of architectural anomalies that might give Escher an uneasy thrill. Elsewhere, hallways bifurcate impassably, requiring you to manipulate contraptions and bring their vast halves back into alignment around you, or you'll cross a dizzying expanse by shifting the far wall up close so you can hitch a ride as it snaps back into its original position.</p><p>I absolutely bloody love it. And honestly, I've got a lot of time for VR gaming as a whole, but - perhaps because I'm more of an occasional VR tourist than perma-helmeted fan - it feels increasingly rare to come across a virtual reality game that manages to use the tech in a way that can properly, creatively wow. Hotel Infinity, though, is a treat; a delightful bit of alchemy squeezed into a two by two square. And in the same year I fell in love with Fireproof Studios' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-impressing-on-quest-the-room-studios-spooky-80s-set-vr-adventure-ghost-town-hits-pc-very-soon">brilliant narrative adventure Ghost Town</a>, it feels great to be excited about VR again.</p>

            <p>The next World of Warcraft expansion, Midnight, will be released 2nd March 2026, Blizzard has announced.</p>
<p>This is the second expansion in the Worldsoul Saga trilogy, which began last year with the launch of The War Within, and will conclude, at some point, with The Last Titan.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-cool-world-of-warcraft-stuff-not-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live">The Midnight expansion brings several exciting additions to World of Warcraft</a>, the most notable of which is the long-awaited new player housing system, which not only gives you a customisable place to stay, but lets groups of people arrange the locations of their homes into neighbourhoods. "It's kind of a sociological experiment," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-kind-of-a-sociological-experiment-for-blizzard-world-of-warcraft-neighbourhoods-azeroth-nimbys-and-curtain-twitching-drama-is-all-part-of-the-plan">Blizzard has said about housing before</a>.</p>
<p>But there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-microtransaction-crap-can-go-jump-in-a-lake-world-of-warcrafts-new-real-money-housing-currency-is-predictably-causing-a-stink">some controversy also swirling around the housing system which is related to the new real-money currency Blizzard is introducing to World of Warcraft</a>, with which you will be able to buy furniture and furnishings and other cosmetic items. Hearthsteel, it's called. We'll get a better sense of how this currency and housing works when housing early access opens on 2nd December for people who've pre-ordered Midnight.</p><p>Other expansion features include a new subterranean-themed Alliance race called the Haranir, and a new darkness-themed and damage-dealing Demon Hunter specialisation called the Devourer. Midnight will also take us back to Blood Elf land, to Quel'Thalas and Silvermoon City, which were destroyed before but will be repaired now.</p>
<p>There's also a new open-world PvE-focused Prey system coming to the game, whereby you can mark yourself as 'prey' to enable a hunt-and-be-hunted system that introduces roaming bosses to the world, and in three tiers of difficulty.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s next big event will act as a narrative sequel to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies, bringing back Uma Thurman as Beatrice Kiddo as well as Yuki Yibari, the sister of one of Kill Bill Volume 1's antagonists.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge, which will premiere in Fortnite on the 30th November at 2pm, ET / 11am PT / 7pm GMT / 8pm CET. It's an animated movie made in the Fortnite engine, directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. You can access the premiere 30 minutes before its starting time, so be sure to get there early.</p>
<p>In addition, you can watch it in real life on an actual cinema screen on the 5th December,  where select theatres across the USA, Canada, and the UK will be showing the animated film as well as Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair (a combination of both original movies). Those who purchase a ticket to see this real-world premiere will get a code that can be redeemed for the Gogo Yubari outfit. This appears to be the only way to get the skin as of writing.</p>

<p>If you don't want to sit down and watch the film yourself, you can log in to Fortnite at any point between now and the 1st December to earn a Yuki Yubari in-game skin. She, as you may have guessed, is a main presence in Yuki's revenge.</p><p>This isn't the first time Tarantino has used animation to expand upon Kill Bill. Chapter three of the film, the Origins of O-Ren, used 2D animation to show the backstory of one of its main characters. However, this was included in the movie itself. This is the first time anything Kill Bill has been portrayed away from the silver screen.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after Fortnite gave the world <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">a hugely popular Simpsons crossover</a>, which brought back a record number of returning players. We'll have to wait and see whether some beloved gory action cinema can replicate similar results.</p>

            <p>UK studio Splash Damage has entered a studio-wide consultation process ahead of extensive redundancies.</p>
<p>The studio has suffered difficulties this year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancellation of its Transformers: Reactivate project</a> back in January, which left roles "at risk of redundancy". Then, in September, it was acquired by unnamed private equity investors (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-breaks-away-from-tencent">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). Previously it was owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, which acquired the studio back in 2020.</p>
<p>Staff were notified of redundancies yesterday, and a public statement was shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">LinkedIn</a>. "This was a difficult step for us to take, but we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market," it reads.</p>

<p>"We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We're committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout."</p>
<p>The last game shipped by the studio was Outcasters, a shooter exclusive to Google's now-defunct Stadia.</p>
<p>Before that it worked on Gears of War and Halo games for Microsoft in a support capacity.</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brink-dev-splash-damage-teases-aaa-open-world-survival-game-project-astrid">Splash Damage announced its "AAA open-world survival game" Project Astrid</a>, but no further details were ever shared.</p>
<p>News of these layoffs follows a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-announces-mass-layoffs-as-restructuring-plan-pulls-development-from-overseas">"restructuring plan" at Square Enix</a> and the allegedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">unfair dismissal of staff from GTA developer Rockstar Games</a>, both hugely impacting the UK games industry.</p>

            <p>CD Projekt Red has just announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> has passed 35m copies sold, and that it reached the milestone faster than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> - the game that preceded it.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1993715326782251511">CDPR announced the sales milestone on X</a> and in <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf">a quarterly financial report</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0ENiOGmcic&amp;feature=youtu.be">accompanying video</a>. It was in that video that chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said, "This is a better result than The Witcher 3 was able to achieve in the same post-release timeframe. Cyberpunk is currently our main source of revenue," he said, "and we continue to expand its availability."</p>
<p>It's been a busy year for Cyberpunk 2077, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playing-cyberpunk-2077-for-the-first-time-on-switch-2-reminds-me-of-one-of-gta-onlines-greatest-quirks">an impressive adaptation released for the Switch 2 launch</a> earlier this year, a tailored version released for Mac computers, and a release for Sony's subscription service PlayStation Plus. All of these things helped push CD Projekt's earnings higher than when the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> launched - alongside a major game overhaul - in 2023.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red is currently bulking out the Cyberpunk 2 team as the project enters full production - there are now 135 developers working on the game, <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2025/11/prezentacja-wynikowa-q3-2025-en.pdf">according to the updated financial report</a>. But the studio's biggest project by far is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, which has 447 people working on it.</p>

<p>That project - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">The Witcher 4 - was shown in an Nvidia-related tech demo in the summer</a>, and CDPR was insistent that it was running on PS5, at 60 frames-per-second - an impressive claim given the visual quality on show. Will we see anything more of The Witcher 4 this year at The Game Awards, I wonder? It's one of the titles vying for the Most Anticipated Game award - something Piotr Nielubowicz referenced in this investor video.</p><p>"Finally I would like to mention that we're flattered by The Witcher 4's nomination in the Most Anticipated game category at this year's The Game Awards," he said. "This nomination, which comes despite the fact that we haven't yet kicked off the game's proper marketing campaign, shows the extent to which the fourth instalment in The Witcher series is already hotly anticipated."</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 stars Geralt's daughter-like figure and protégé Ciri, who was semi-playable throughout The Witcher 3. The question is, will Geralt be semi-playable in her adventure - or playable at all at some point? That we'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <p>Oh, the weather outside is frightful, but the gunfire on my PS5 is delightful (or something to that effect). Yes, Sony has lifted the lid on its PS Plus monthly game offerings for December. And, in the spirit of the season, it is giving us five games rather than the usual three. </p>
<p>As we march confidently towards the new year, those with a PlayStation Plus membership - be it Essential, Extra or Premium - will be able to enjoy the following games this coming month:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lego Horizon Adventures (PS5)</li>
<li>Killing Floor 3 (PS5)</li>
<li>The Outlast Trials (PS4/5)</li>
<li>Synduality Echo of Ada (PS5)</li>
<li>Neon White (PS4/5)</li>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> is the brickified and much more family friendly reimagining of Aloy's first outing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. "It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>.</p><p>Then we have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, the stylish Annapurna-published anime speedrunner. "With airtight controls, smooth speedrunning and a big helping of anime-inspired flair, few games can keep up with Neon White's pace," Oisin Kuhnke wrote, recommending the game in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neon-white-review-speedrunning-has-never-been-so-stylish">Eurogamer's Neon White review</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps not a very festive offering, but one that a few of my friends still play on occasion, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a>. "The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">Vikki Blake said when she reviewed The Outlast Trails</a> on its release in early access, awarding it three out of five stars.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killing-floor">Killing Floor</a> 3, The Outlast Trials, Synduality Echo of Ada and Neon White will be available to PlayStation Plus members from next Tuesday, 2nd December. They will be on the service until Monday, 5th January.</p>

<p>As a reminder PlayStation Plus members have only until Monday, 1st December to add <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-november">Stray, EA Sports WRC 24 and Totally Accurate Battle Simulator to their game library</a>.</p>

            <p>
Following Valve's decision to ban developer Santa Ragione's first-person horror adventure Horses from distribution on Steam - a move the studio says seriously jeopardises its future - the PC storefront owner has responded with a statement providing "additional context", saying it "extensively" discussed a request to reconsider its decision before refusing to do so.
</p>
<p>
Italian studio Santa Ragione, whose award-winning output includes Saturnalia, Meditteranea Inferno, and Mirror Moon EP, is developing Horses in collaboration with director Andrea Lucco Borlera. It's described as a three-hour adventure about "the burden of familial trauma and puritan values, the dynamics of totalitarian power, and the ethics of personal responsibility", and sees players taking on the role of a rural farmhand across 14 days one summer. Its mix of monochrome visuals, live-action intermissions, and interactive sequences is striking, as is its premise, which imagines a world in which naked human "horses" are kept as livestock - but despite the nudity, the studio is clear the game is "not pornographic" nor "[intended] to arouse".

<p>
That's important in the context of the controversy that's emerged this week. Horses' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">recent release date announcement</a> was accompanied by the news Steam had refused - after making the apparently unusual request to review an early, incomplete build - to sell the game on its platform in 2023, with an automated message informing Santa Ragione it would not "distribute content that appears, in [its] judgement, to depict sexual conduct involving a minor."
</p><p>
Santa Ragione says Valve refused to elaborate, leaving it to speculate the decision was triggered by a scene - which it stresses was "not sexual in any way" - in which a visitor's young daughter rode on the shoulders of a female "horse". As the studio's creative vision evolved, the daughter was aged into a 20-something adult (all characters in the game are explicitly 20+), but it remains frustrated at Valve's apparent refusal to re-assess the finished game for review, despite the fact it's now been reviewed and approved for distribution on the Epic Games Store, GoG, the Humble Store, and Itch.io.
</p>
<p>
That's a lot of background, and the full story is even more involved; further details can be found in <a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/">Santa Ragione's Steam ban FAQ</a> and in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">interview with studio founder Pietro Righi Riva</a>. Notably, though, Valve did not provide comment ahead of Santa Ragione's announcement.

In the week prior to the news of Horses' Steam ban going public, Eurogamer invited Valve to respond to specific points raised in our interview with Santa Ragione, but no reply was recieved ahead of the story's stated publication time. However, following yesterday's Horses release announcement, and the subsequent press coverage of its Steam ban and Santa Ragione's likely closure, Valve has provided outlets with some "additional context" for its decision, offering some insight into why it requested a review of an incomplete build and claiming it "extensively" discussed Santa Ragione's request to reconsider its ban before conveying its final refusal. Valve doesn't detail <em>why</em> it opted not to permit a re-review of the final build, nor does it clarify if Santa Ragione was given a reason for the refusal - the studio claims Valve has not been transparent in its communication. Here's Valve's statement in full:
</p>
<p>
"We reviewed the game back in 2023. At that time, the developer indicated with their release date in Steamworks that they planned to release a few months later. Based on content in the store page, we told the developer we would need to review the build itself. This happens sometimes if content on the store page causes concern that the game itself might not fall within our guidelines. After our team played through the build and reviewed the content, we gave the developer feedback about why we couldn't ship the game on Steam, consistent with <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">our onboarding rules and guidelines</a>. A short while later the developer asked us to reconsider the review, and our internal content review team discussed that extensively and communicated to the developer our final decision that we were not going to ship the game on Steam."
</p>
<p>
Despite Horses' Steam rejection, it'll still be available for purchase via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/horses-004d87">Epic</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses">GOG</a>, the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/horses">Humble Store</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses">Itch.io</a> on 2nd December. It costs €4.99/$4.99.

            <p>Sega has admitted sales of its games may be lower-than-expected due to players awaiting "definitive editions" before buying.</p>
<p>The company has published (in Japanese) a shareholders <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/ja/ir/20251114_q2_major_QA_j.pdf">Q&amp;A session</a> following its most recent earnings report (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-is-aware-its-past-definitive-version-releases-could-be-deterring-players-from-buying-games-at-launch/">Automaton</a>). During the session, the company was questioned on a drop in sales of catalogue games, and revenue fluctuations impacted by new releases. Specifically, Sega has released a number of critically acclaimed games, but sales have fallen short of expectations.</p>
<p>In its response, Sega made a number of suggestions, including successful rival games of the same genre and initial pricing of games.</p>

</figure>
<p>It also admitted players expecting a "definitive edition" of its games may be hesitant to purchase at launch.</p>
<p>"While we haven't been able to pinpoint a precise cause of [the lower-than-expected sales performance], we believe the problem also lies in our marketing, which wasn't able to sufficiently convey the appeal of our games to users," the company said, reassuring investors the issue is being investigated.</p><p>No specific games were mentioned in the exchange, but it certainly points towards the games of Atlus. Traditionally, the RPG maker has released revised versions of its games following initial release: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-4">Persona 4</a> was followed by a Golden version, while Persona 5 was followed by Royal, both of which had extra characters and content. For a more recent example, 2021's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shin-megami-tensei-5">Shin Megami Tensei 5</a> was followed last year by Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance.</p>
<p>Last year also saw the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. It was critically acclaimed, award-winning, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-surpasses-1m-sales-on-launch-day-to-become-fastest-selling-atlus-game">surpassed 1m sales on launch day to become the fastest-selling Atlus game</a>. Then, in July this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-has-sold-2m-units-worldwide-atlus-officially-reveals">Atlus announced it had sold 2m units worldwide</a>. It suggests a drop-off in sales after that initial surge.</p>
<p>Atlus has not specified if Metaphor: ReFantazio will receive a revised version, but the precedent set by its previous games may have had fans questioning.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer reported yesterday, Katsura Hashino - director of Metaphor: ReFantazio and the Persona games - wants to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-and-metaphor-refantazio-creator-wants-to-create-jrpg-30-so-what-does-that-mean-for-persona-6">create "JRPG 3.0" as a next evolutionary step</a>. The comment has raised eyebrows ahead of the presumed-reveal of Persona 6.</p>

            <p>Tomb Raider's globe-trotting Lara Croft has earned herself two world records to pop up alongside her various artifacts and dinosaur skeletons at the family manor.</p>
<p>As shared by the Guinness World Records, Lara now holds the title of the best-selling video game heroine, along with the record for a video game character gracing the most magazine covers. These magazines include the likes of Newsweek, Time and The Face.</p>

<p>Lara has been a magazine cover girl 2300 times, as of April this year. Meanwhile, the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-of-the-worst-reviewed-tomb-raider-games-is-getting-the-remastered-treatment-and-i-am-here-for-it"> Tomb Raider series has sold over 100m copies since the first entry was released</a> back in 1996. According to Guinness World Records, this puts Lara "way out ahead" of her competition.</p>
<p>Scott Amos, head of studio at Crystal Dynamics said: "As tremendous fans of Lara Croft, we've been so fortunate to join the Tomb Raider community on this journey throughout the years. She's been aspirational and inspirational for nearly three decades, and it's an honour to have her legacy recognised by Guinness World Records.</p>
<p>"These achievements remind us of her enduring cultural impact and the passionate global fanbase. We're thrilled to be building a bright future for Lara Croft driven by her spirit of curiosity, courage, and adventure."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guinness World Records editor Alice Bell called Lara a "true gaming icon", and her ongoing record breaking legacy "shows what an inspirational character" she is.</p>
<p>"Long may Lara's adventurous spirit reign! We'll see what new standards she can set into the future!"</p>

<p>The latest mainline entry in the series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, which came out in 2018. Crystal Dynamics is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">currently working on the next game alongside Amazon</a>.</p>
<p>If you can't wait until then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/second-season-of-netflixs-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-also-be-its-last">Netflix has a Tomb Raider anime</a> on the service. Its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-trailer-for-netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-season-two">second season is set to air this December</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is now free to play up until the 2nd December via a free trial promotion for EA's latest AAA release. This means that anyone on relevant platforms can try out 2025's leading military FPS if they've not hopped in yet.</p>
<p>To go alongside this limited-time trial, Battlefield general manager Byron Beede stated: "We are extremely proud of what our amazing teams at Battlefield Studios have accomplished and tremendously excited about the community's passion as we continue to build Battlefield for and with our fans. Today's launch of a free trial for Battlefield 6 is the perfect opportunity for new players to have the All Out Warfare experience that millions of players around the world are raving about."</p><p>This trial comes ahead of the upcoming Winter Offensive update, which is set to launch on the 9th December. This will bring a frozen variant of the Empire State map, an ice pick weapon, and a unique weather effect where players take damage if separated from a heat source for too long.</p>

<p>This free trial comes as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dominates-steam-charts-ahead-of-worldwide-release-as-analyst-estimates-over-100m-in-pre-launch-sales">Battlefield 6 settles from its ridiculous launch player count</a>, down to a steady ongoing base above the 200,000 daily peak player mark (on Steam). Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has yet to breach the 100,000 mark on the PC platform</a>. Now, Steam is just one piece of the pie, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> is available on Game Pass which will surely attract people to the shooter. Nonetheless, Steam <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european-sales-are-63-down-on-battlefield-6-and-50-down-on-black-ops-6">plus sales data</a> paints the dynamic between the two rivals with a clear leader.</p><p>However it's not a two horse race! It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-its-pc-record-yet-again-as-it-inches-towards-half-a-million-concurrent-players">an underdog release that stole the spotlight this month,</a> is sitting pretty with a recent peak around the 330,000 player mark on Steam. This game, which remains in the zeitgeist, seems to be leading the pack between the three on Steam.</p>
<p>It's an interesting time for all three games. Whether the dynamic between these big hitters stays consistent as we enter the winter holidays, or things shift up as people have more time off work and school, remains a tantalising mystery.</p>

            <p>Embracer is selling off yet another two studios from its expansive portfolio, following years of acquisitions and layoffs as part of a lengthy restructuring programme.</p>
<p>Today, the Swedish company announced it will divest Arc Games and Cryptic Studios for $30m to Project Golden Arc. Arc Games (formerly known as Perfect World Entertainment and Gearbox Publishing San Francisco) was responsible for publishing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-trek-online">Star Trek Online</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a>, Remnant: From The Ashes, and more. Cryptic Studios was the developer of Star Trek Online and Neverwinter, among others.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Embracer will retain the publishing rights for the Remnant franchise, and the rights for MMO Fellowship will be moved internally to Coffee Stain Group.</p>

<p>"This transaction supports our key priorities by strengthening our focus on strategic assets and core IPs in Embracer while improving profitability and free cash flow," said Embracer CEO Phil Rogers in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-divests-arc-games-and-cryptic-studios-while-several-key-rights-are-retained-within-the-group/">statement</a>.</p>
<p>"The deal also allows online multiplayer game Fellowship, developed by a talented external team in Stockholm, to find a great home within Coffee Stain Group. I would like to thank the teams at Arc and Cryptic for their hard work over the past four years and wish them all the best as we are confident they will thrive and develop in the years ahead."</p>
<p>Embracer acquired the two companies back in 2021 as part of a notoriously grand acquisition spree. However, when $2bn of investment into Embracer collapsed (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">reportedly with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games</a>), Embracer was forced to drastically restructure.</p>
<p>The "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">comprehensive restructuring program</a>" began back in 2023. Last year, both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">Saber</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-sale-of-borderlands-studio-gearbox-reportedly-in-late-stages-of-finalisation">Gearbox</a> were sold off.</p>
<p>By May 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">Embracer's staff headcount had plummeted by 4532 employees in a year</a>, while 44 studios had been closed and 80 in-development projects were dropped.</p>
<p>In June this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-overseeing-thousands-of-layoffs-and-numerous-studio-closures-embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-is-stepping-down">former Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors announced he was stepping down</a> from his role (but remains executive chair of the board), with Rogers taking over as CEO. It would seem, however, the company is still struggling with the fallout of its multiple acquisitions.</p>
