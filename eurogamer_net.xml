            <p>Hasbro's recent Magic the Gathering Final Fantasy crossover card set made $200m sales in one day.</p>
<p>This comes courtesy of Hasbro CEO Christian Cocks, who yesterday revealed the figure <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/events/event-details/hasbro-second-quarter-2025-earnings-conference-call">during a Hasbro earnings call</a>. This staggering figure eclipses that milestone set by prior sets, including an earlier Lord of the Rings set, which according to Cocks passed the $200m mark a while after its initial release.</p>

<p>Cocks stated: "Lord of the Rings took six months to deliver $200 million of revenue, Final Fantasy took one day, and we left demand on the table [...] So we couldn't produce enough.</p>
<p>"I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre-release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we've ever done, and we left the market wanting more."</p>
<p>While this figure is obviously great for Hasbro, fans of Magic the Gathering are torn on these sorts of crossover sets. On one hand, it's cool to see your favourite IPs get some representation inside lovely little packs. I recall being especially excited about the Warhammer crossover, for example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Magic the Gathering has a rich history of its own lore and characters, and with these crossover sets continuing to bring in the big bucks, there's a reasonable concern that years-long story lines will take a back seat to new partnerships between Hasbro and various media companies across the world.</p>
<p>If you think of it from the perspective of a Hasbro shareholder, would you rather a return to Bloomburrow, or for Captain America to get a mythic rare red, white, and blue legendary creature? Which would make more money?</p>
<p>That being said, Hasbro is pushing its own Magic the Gathering IP into other mediums, which could offer a new avenue to promote and revel in decades' worth of worldbuilding. For one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-announces-magic-the-gathering-film-and-tv-series-wants-it-to-be-the-next-cinematic-universe">the company has expressed a desire to push into TV and movies</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">is keen on making Baldur's Gate 4 (though isn't in a hurry)</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-crossover-set-made-200-million-in-a-single-day]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s next patch - 7.3, called The Promise of Tomorrow - finally has a release date.</p>
<p>As revealed in the latest Letter from the Producer livestream, along with a new trailer you can watch below, the patch will arrive on 5th August - just under two weeks away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> previously stated this patch will round off the Dawntrail storyline, before the team slowly edges towards whatever storyline is next for the MMORPG. Judging by the trailer, we can expect plenty of drama in the kingdom of Alexandria.</p>

<p>As with every patch, the story continues along with a number of promised extras. This time, the second installment of the Echoes of Vana'diel alliance raid will be added, offering a nostalgic trip to Final Fantasy 11's San d'Oria.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 11 has seen a resurgence in players recently, in part due to this crossover with Final Fantasy 14. Yesterday, Square Enix announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/23-years-after-its-release-final-fantasy-11s-biggest-server-is-closed-to-new-players-due-to-popularity">closing the game's most popular server to new players due to overpopulation</a>.</p>
<p>Patch 7.3 will add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main Scenario - The Promise of Tomorrow</li>
<li>New Alliance Raid - Echoes of Vana'diel - San d'Oria: The Second Walk</li>
<li>New Dungeon - The Meso Terminal</li>
<li>New Trial - ???</li>
<li>New Unreal Trial</li>
<li>New Treasure Dungeon</li>
<li>Crystalline Conflict Update</li>
<li>Weapon Enhancement Quests - Phantom Weapons</li>
<li>New Deep Dungeon - Pilgrim's Traverse</li>
<li>Allied Society Quests - Yok Huy</li>
<li>Inconceivably Further Hildibrand Adventures</li>
<li>Cosmic Exploration and Tool Enhancement Quests - Cosmic Tools</li>
<li>Chat Bubble Feature</li>
<li>New PvP Gear</li>
<li>New Mounts, Minions, and Emotes</li>
<li>Additional Duty Support</li>
<li>Additional Doman Mahjong Voices - Wuk Lamat, Koana, and Bakool Ja Ja</li>
</ul>
<p>It's an interesting time for Square Enix's flagship MMORPG. Dawntrail received a mixed reaction from the community and although patch additions like the Occult Crescent have been praised, the game anecdotally appears in decline.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://luckybancho.ldblog.jp/archives/59200105.html">unofficial fan census</a> shows player numbers are dwindling, while reddit threads are rife with Dawntrail criticism, both valid and excessive.</p>
<p>Typically, player numbers peak when a new expansion is released, so with patch 7.3 bringing Dawntrail to a conclusion, future patches should begin to set the scene for whatever is on the way next. We'll just have to wait for the next round of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-is-a-theme-park-for-its-passionate-community">Fan Fest events</a> to see where the next expansion will take us.</p>
<p>As such, The Promise of Tomorrow really does feel like a fitting name for this forthcoming patch.</p>
<p>Last week, Square Enix announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-ending-support-for-windows-10-os-alongside-microsoft">ending support for the Windows 10 OS alongside Microsoft</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-73-finally-gets-release-date-as-dawntrail-story-concludes]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developer of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers has acknowledged issues with the game's performance and promised a patch is on the way.</p>
<p>The soulslike, from Chinese studio Leenzee and publisher 505 Games, released yesterday and has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-follows-in-black-myth-wukongs-footsteps-with-strong-steam-launch">racked up a significant concurrent player count on Steam</a> that exceeds other games in the genre. However, player reviews are Mostly Negative, citing issues with the game's performance owing to its use of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"We have received reports regarding issues such as the game's optimisation not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing," said the team in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">statement on Steam</a>. "These problems should never have occurred, and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing."</p>

<p>It continued: "We are confident in the game's performance within our recommended spec but we're working on optimisation. We are looking to issue a patch as soon as we can."</p>
<p>The team has linked to an <a href="https://support.505games.com/support/solutions/150000215541">FAQ</a> to assist with any issues. Eurogamer previously detailed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ahead-of-its-release-later-this-month-wuchang-fallen-feathers-pc-specs-revealed-and-theyre-surprisingly-modest">PC specs for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>.</p>
<p>Leenzee is also aware of pricing anomalies in some regions and is working with Steam to restore the correct pricing.</p>
<p>Lastly, the studio found a bug in the reward distribution preventing players from receiving the correct items after pre-ordering the standard and deluxe editions. This will also be fixed in the future patch. Those impacted will receive a free digital soundtrack as a token of goodwill, while deluxe edition purchasers will receive an additional exclusive bonus costume.</p>
<p>"We are fully committed to investigating and resolving these issues as quickly as possible," said the studio. "Our team is prioritising these problems at the highest level, striving to fix and handle everything promptly to ensure you have the best possible gaming experience.</p>
<p>"We are also continuously gathering and organising bug reports and suggestions shared within the community. We sincerely ask for your patience, understanding, and support during this process. Once again, we hugely appreciate all of you."</p>
