            <p>You wouldn't know it to hear it, but decorated video game actor Jennifer Hale - famously the voice of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Commander Shepard - is the person providing the meows of new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> hero Jetpack Cat.</p>
<p>Blizzard confirmed this at its headquarters last week while detailing Jetpack Cat and the four other heroes coming to Overwatch (formerly known as "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>") next week. "The voice actor is Jennifer Hale," audio and technical director Scott Lawson told a group of press that I was in, "and she did an incredible job, and working with it was so much fun."</p>
<p>Note that Hale already voices another Overwatch hero, gunslinger Ashe, who was added to the game in November 2018.</p>
<p>Jetpack Cat has been a rumoured hero for Overwatch for a long time, and she finally arrives alongside four other new heroes on 10th February with the game-changing ability to tow other characters through the air. She can do this to both allies and enemies, though doing it to enemies requires using her Ultimate.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>I've played her; she's great fun. Very manoeuvrable, very fast, and with some useful healing abilities for supporting diving or flanking characters, not to mention the ability to pick up slower heroes from base or airlift Bastion in chaingunning form over groups of enemies. She also has lots of voice lines, although they're all variations of "meow", amusingly.</p><p>Jetpack Cat has been around as a concept nearly as long as Overwatch itself. "Jetpack Cat in particular, as a concept, is something the team has wanted to do since, man, we launched Overwatch 1," lead hero producer Kenny Hudson told me. "We've had early concept art for Jetpack Cat on the wall in our hallway for like eight years now." But the idea never got any further. "You'd walk by it like every day, like, 'Maybe we should...'," added associate game director Alec Dawson.</p>
<p>The reason why Blizzard can do Jetpack Cat now is because it's releasing so many new heroes at once - five on 10th February and a further five over the course of the year. "Going all out on making five Heroes at a time gave us some cover to explore new things, try new things," Hudson said. "When we said okay who are the five going to be...? It's funny because Jetpack Cat was always in the conversation from day one."</p>

<p>"It just felt like it's time for the cat," art director Dion Rogers said in a separate interview.</p>
<p>Jetpack Cat may seem silly but she's not the first animal character in the game. Winston, a gorilla, has been at the heart of Overwatch since it launched, and a hamster was added in the shape of Wrecking Ball in 2018. And, as Rogers told me, there are ideas for more.</p><p>"We actually have a random idea we joke about," Rogers said, "this character called the Oranga-tank. It's an orangutan that's a tank and he's a villain. Because most of our animal characters are good guys, we were like how do we make villain animals? And Oranga-tank is an idea that's been floating around for a while. I don't know if he'll show up in the game. It's a funny drawing; there's a bunch of funny drawings everywhere."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">Overwatch is currently experiencing an exciting moment</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Blizzard announced an ambitious new yearly expansion plan</a> for the game and it will release the first of these, The Reign of Talon, next week. It also announced it would be removing the tainted "2" from the game's name to make it, simply, "Overwatch" again. </p>

    <div id="main-content">
        

        <p>We're getting 10 new heroes, total, in 2026.</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> will henceforth be known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, Blizzard has announced, as it outlines a major new plan that will revolve around free, annual, expansion-like releases for the game. The first of these - The Reign of Talon - arrives next week, on Tuesday, 10th February.</p>
<p>The undeniable headline feature is adding <em>five</em> new heroes at once, which is the largest new-hero-drop Overwatch has ever had - two more than Overwatch 2 launched with. Then, a further five heroes will be added throughout 2026, one in each Reign of Talon season (from season 2-6), taking the total new-hero count this year to 10. For Overwatch, that release-pace is unprecedented.</p>
<p>The new five new heroes are spread across all character roles. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domina, a tank who's a little like Zarya,</li>
<li>Emre, a damage dealer who's a lot like Soldier 76,</li>
<li>Mizuki, a support who has a magical healing hat he throws,</li>
<li>Anran, a damage dealer who sets people on fire and then literally fans the flames to deal damage to them, and</li>
<li>Jetpack Cat, a long-rumoured support who permanently flies and can tow team-mates and enemies through the air.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">I have played all of these heroes and shared my thoughts on them in a longer Overwatch revamp article</a>.</p>
<p>The switch to a yearly focus has had a major knock-on effect for story, allowing Blizzard to move from a smaller piecemeal storytelling formula to one shaped over the course of a year, affording a much more ambitious and dramatic scope. Six 'season' releases are planned for Reign of Talon, and the game's season-count will be reset to one (from 20) to coincide with it.</p><p>The story will be told in familiar ways to Overwatch, through a mix of cinematic videos and animated comics, but you'll now be able to see and track this inside of the game, and to feel the effects of it as you play. Characters will refer to story events in voice lines, and some maps will be altered to reflect what's been going on. Watchpoint: Gibraltar will be the first of these, and it will change structurally following an invasion by Talon's evil forces when The Reign of Talon begins.</p>

<p>Showcasing all of this will be a five-week story event called Conquest, which will allow players to side with either Overwatch or Talon in a faction war. You pick a side and carry out objectives for them, earning points for the faction and rewards for yourself.</p>
<p>There's still more: Overwatch is getting a full-on user interface overhaul for Reign of Talon to better organise the information the game presents to you, and to enable a 3D hero lobby, which will expand to a full party lobby in Season 4.</p><p>There are sub-roles being added to the hero roster as well, which not only help break-up the rapidly expanding roster visually, but give gameplay perks depending on the sub-role you choose. A Flanker like Tracer gets more health from health packs, for example, whereas a Medic like Moira heals themselves while healing others.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Stadium - the recently added MOBA-like 'develop your character as you play' mode - is getting an icon overhaul, and a build helper for newer players.</p>
<p>Blizzard has also said we should also expect two new core maps during the Reign of Talon year, as well as the reintroduction of post-match accolades and reworks for existing heroes (Blizzard wouldn't tell me which ones). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-proper-switch-2-version-coming">There's a dedicated Switch 2 release that will launch with Season 2</a>, which hasn't been dated, but I expect will arrive sometime in April.</p>
<p>It's a bold and headline-grabbing change for Overwatch 2, which struggled to convince players a few years ago when it launched. More importantly, it makes Overwatch 2 exciting again.</p>

            <p>It sounds as though Blizzard is open to exploring generative AI during the development of its games.</p>
<p>Answering a question I asked during an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> press conference at Blizzard campus last week, Blizzard president Johanna Faries said: "I like when we are dev-led in our approach. We want our dev teams to be able to utilise or explore whatever new technology is out there, to the extent that they're comfortable doing with it what we believe is responsible, and a lot of those principles that are communicated are really around rooting in responsible choices."</p>
<p>The principles she's referring to were outlined internally to staff at Blizzard, I was later told. I wasn't told what they were.</p>
<p>Faries went on to say: "We do actually, at Blizzard, have a centralised governance team specifically focused on AI and the role it can or should play in our development cycles.</p>
<p>"What's great about that is it's very cross functional, so you're going to have voices from around the horn thinking about not just what's hot-topic now, but where do we want to be five, 10 years from now? What's the implication on our teams? What's the implication on our values? How do we make sure that we don't stymie the opportunity for devs, artists, whomever, to want to play with new tools and play in the sandbox, if it unlocks creativity or gets rid of drudgery or what have you? We want happy devs, right?</p><p>"But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it's a responsible tool and aligned with how we want to show up as a company," she said. "So I feel very good in terms of the process we have in terms of vetting: is it secure, is it safe, is it values led? But I keep coming back to: I want the teams to feel safe, to explore to the extent that it drives joy in the work. And I think we have a good process, all up, in terms of making sure we're doing it in a responsible manner."</p>
<blockquote><em>"But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it's a responsible tool" -Johanna Faries</em></blockquote>
<p>Faries' remarks come a few months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-about-incredibly-talented-people-not-doing-incredibly-boring-stuff-blizzard-devs-say-its-possible-to-use-ai-tools-while-still-feeling-handcrafted">a lead World of Warcraft artist talked about using AI to remove some of the "boring" tasks</a> of game development, such as tweaking helmets to fit the heads of different-sized races in the game. "Things like AI help a lot with that," Gabriel Gonzalez explained. "I would say the philosophy is always how we free up more time for our team to be creative, and take away the menial." Gonzalez balanced his comment by emphasising the strength of Blizzard's handcrafted approach to art and making games. "That is, and always will be, a big part of it," he said.</p>
<p>Overwatch director Aaron Keller echoed that sentiment in the same interview, seemingly ruling out AI-use in the development of his game. "Right now, we don't use AI to create characters or gameplay," he said. "I think Blizzard as a whole is known for handcrafted games and handcrafted worlds. So, we try to pour all of our creative energy and all of our passion into doing that.</p><p>"For us, it is more important to get the details right, and to make sure that the gameplay is as impeccable as it can be and withholds the Blizzard standard, rather than trying to make something as quick as we possibly can."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-hops-on-controversial-ai-train-with-concept-art-tool">Blizzard has been linked with generative AI-use before</a>. In 2023, Blizzard reportedly told staff about a generative-AI concept art tool it had developed, called Stable Diffusion, that had been trained on the company's artwork. "We are on the brink of a major evolution in how we build and manage our games," read an email from Allen Adham, one of the co-founders of Blizzard, who once led the company. He left and rejoined the company a couple of times since those earlier days, leaving again in 2024. The email also mentioned "voice cloning", "game coding", "anti-toxicity", and "autonomous, intelligent in-game NPCs" among other potential uses for the generative AI tool. It's not clear whether this still exists in any form.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, generative AI is, as Aaron Keller noted in the above interview, an increasingly prevalent technology, "So we are going to see more of it." Exactly how much we'll see of it in Blizzard games, however, remains the question.</p>
<p>But Blizzard isn't the only major game development studio exploring the use of generative AI. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian revealed in December that it was exploring some uses of gen-AI</a> during development - a decision it faced heated backlash for, causing it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">to walk back on some uses it had in mind</a>.</p><p>I visited Blizzard campus last week for three separate days devoted to Overwatch, Diablo and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>. The coverage embargoes for these days are staggered, but the Overwatch restriction has now lifted, hence a barrage of Overwatch news hitting the site. And there's a lot to write about. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">Overwatch is getting a big push from Blizzard</a>, as it drops a giant expansion-like release and adopts an expansion-like approach, and drops the "2" from the name to make it "Overwatch" again.</p>
