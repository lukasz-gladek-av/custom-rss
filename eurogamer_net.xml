            <p>If you want to expand your Lego collection with some more Horizon-themed pieces, you are in luck.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-tallneck-lego-revealed">the majestic Tallneck model</a>, Lego and Guerrilla are once again joining forces and releasing a set inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-teases-new-horizon-themed-set-on-the-way">teased last week</a>, this set is known as Aloy and Varl vs. Shell-Walker and Sawtooth, and it comprises much of what you would expect given the name.

<p>Consisting of 768 pieces, this set features Horizon's leading lady Aloy and her trusty pal Varl taking on bricky renditions of a Shell-Walker and a Sawtooth. Aloy has her bow and Varl has his spear, with options to switch bits up to allow for fire, shock or chill 'attacks'.</p><p>As for those hostile machines, both have joints which allow for different poses. The Shell-Walker has posable legs and arms, as well as opening claws. This chap also has a detachable cargo pod and energy shield. The Sawtooth, meanwhile, has jaws which open for a good bite, as well as a swivelling torso along with a posable neck, head and legs.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of scale, Lego said the Sawtooth measures over seven inches high. </p>

<p>"We're delighted to bring one of gaming's most beloved franchises to life in both physical and digital Lego brick form," said Kate Bryant, Product Lead, Branded Games at the Lego Group, reflecting on both this set and Lego Horizon Adventures itself. "We hope this latest set continues to fulfil our commitment to seamless play and empowers our fans to expand on their favourite games in their own, unique way."</p><p>"Lego  Horizon Adventures has brought Aloy and the acclaimed Horizon universe to a new audience and we've been very pleased with the title's launch," added Guerrilla art director Roy Postma. "This new set adds to that momentum by enabling players to build on the excitement of the adventures they experience in the game in true Lego fashion."</p>
<p>Those interested in purchasing the Aloy and Varl vs. Shell-Walker and Sawtooth set are able to pre-order it now <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/aloy-varl-vs-shell-walker-sawtooth-77037">via Lego</a>. It will be available on shelves from 1st March, next year, retailing at £39.99.</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures the video game, we recently awarded it two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Roblox has today announced further tools designed to improve the safety of its young audience, including the ability for parents to remotely manage their child's account, view their child's friends list and limit the amount of time made available to play.
</p>
<p>
In the coming months, further changes will be made to stop children under 13 from directly messaging others outside of games, and limit interactions within games to public messages only. Starting today, Roblox is also simplifying its content labels and limiting the games and experiences children under nine can see on the platform by default.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcements mark yet a third set of changes detailed by Roblox in the past month. Previously-announced policy tweaks were revealed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">now require parental access to be given for children to access some in-game chat features</a>. This was followed by the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banning-social-hangouts-for-kids-under-13-due-to-user-behaviour-that-can-potentially-pose-a-risk">ban on social hangout experiences for kids under 13</a> due to "user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk". 
</p>
<p>
Roblox has long been criticised for not doing enough to ensure the safety of its enormous audience, the majority of which are kids. This summer, a Bloomberg report revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game.</p><p>All of the above announced changes by Roblox follow the publication of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">damning report last month</a> that again highlighted examples of inappropriate - and allegedly, illegal - content being shared on the platform, and that also claimed Roblox had not been transparent around its user activity metrics (a claim Roblox said it "rejected").
</p>
<p>
Despite the recent flurry of changes, Roblox says today's announcements were decided upon and would be implemented following "multiple rounds of internal research, including interviews, usability studies, international surveys with parents and children, and consultation with experts from child safety and media literacy organisations". 
</p>
<p>
A Roblox spokesperson claimed these updates, announced today, had already been "praised by partners, including the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) and the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI)".
</p>
<p>
"We've spent nearly two decades building strong safety systems, but we know there's always more to be done," Roblox chief safety officer Matt Kaufman said in a statement. "Last quarter saw a record average for daily active users on Roblox - over 88 million - and as our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it. Today's launch represents the next stage in that evolution."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-hit-dress-to-impress-removes-hotdog-outfit-after-players-use-it-to-dress-up-like-male-genitalia">Roblox hit Dress To Impress removed a hotdog outfit</a> after players used it to dress up like male genitalia.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>'s next events have been revealed following recent datamines.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gtp27i/new_event_is_coming_venusaur_pok%C3%A9mon_tcg_pocket/">leaked</a> on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1goefhy/bulbasaur_magnemite_event/">reddit</a> (and reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-datamine-reveals-december-events/">The Gamer</a>), the next round of events due in December will include new battle, emblem, and Wonder Pick events.</p>
<p>And it looks like gen one starter Bulbasaur and its evolutions will be the focus.</p>

<p>Currently, players can battle four Lapras ex decks for various rewards, including a special Lapras ex card.</p>
<p>It appears December will have a similar event but with players facing Bulbasaur, Ivysaur and Venusaur.</p>
<p>The rewards are as follows:</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<th></th>
<th>First Clear Rewards</th>
<th>Drop Rewards</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ivysaur Deck</td>
<td>2 Pack Hourglass, 50 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket, 25 XP</td>
<td>Promo Pack A Series 2, 25 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket (39 percent chance)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Venusaur &amp; Scyther Deck</td>
<td>4 Pack Hourglass, 100 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket, 50 XP</td>
<td>Promo Pack A Series 2, 25 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket (39 percent chance)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Venusaur ex Deck</td>
<td>6 Pack Hourglass, 150 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket, 75 XP</td>
<td>Promo Pack A Series 2, 25 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket (39 percent chance)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Venusaur ex &amp; Lilligant Deck</td>
<td>8 Pack Hourglass, 200 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket, 100 XP</td>
<td>Promo Pack A Series 2, 25 Shinedust, 1 Shop Ticket (39 percent chance)</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The Wonder Pick event, meanwhile, will begin on 6th December and focus on both Bulbasaur and Magnemite - much like the current Meowth and Chansey event.</p>
<p>The third event will be another Genetic Apex Emblem Event and while the rewards were not part of the datamine, it seems likely more emblems will be awarded for players to display on their profiles. Considering the other events, my money's on Bulbasaur making another appearance.</p>
<p>More new items - coins, icons, backdrops, and sleeves - will also be added to the shop.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-booster-packs-available-before-end-of-year">The Pokémon Company revealed last week</a> that new booster packs will be added to the mobile game "by the end of the year", though it's unknown who the cover stars will be.</p>
<p>Trading will also begin in January 2025, though only with certain cards.</p>
<p>The card collecting and battling game has already proven incredibly popular, reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">earning $12m in its first four days</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Good grief, what fun," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rollerdrome-review-roll7-delivers-a-game-of-impossible-style">Eurogamer's Rollerdrome review</a> back in 2022, slapping it with a rare Essential badge. "Few games sing for you like this. Few systems compliment and combine so elegantly and relentlessly, with such small and simple moments of care for everything in it, from the little blipping noises for reloading and picking up health (straight out of Grand Theft Auto - Rollerdrome's full of ultimate video game sounds) to the booming pistols of Lara Croft. And no game has ever been so cool."</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, on the other hand, secured a recommended, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/conan-exiles-review-a-handsomely-sculpted-survival-game">Eurogamer's review</a> saying: "If Ark and Rust are the flaccid alpha males of survival gaming, Conan is the cocksure challenger angling for an advantage".</p>

            <p>
BioWare had the look of its excellent RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard nailed a decade ago, when early work first began right after Dragon Age Inquisition's launch. 
</p>
<p>
Artwork shared by BioWare veteran Matt Rhodes reveals a very familiar-looking Minrathous, capital of Tevinter and the location for The Veilguard's opening mission, created 10 years before The Veilguard finally arrived. 
</p>
<p>
It's fascinating to see this, as well as other early production art from Rhodes, and consider how much of what became The Veilguard was nailed down already - even before the launch of Inquisition's final expansion, Trespasser. Simultaneously, it's also a little unbelievable that fans still had so long to wait to finally play it!
</p>
<p>
"The first real piece of concept art I made for this project," Rhodes wrote, sharing artwork of Minrathous on social media. "We knew we were going to Tevinter, so this was the first attempt to flesh that out."
</p> <div>

As described by Rhodes, the image shows: "a powerful magister being carried on a palanquin by her elven slaves, and scrappy adventurers trying to evade mage patrols and survive in an urban labyrinth".
</p>
<p>
Rhodes has been at BioWare for 20 years and served as art director on the Dragon Age franchise for the past six. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Rhodes showcased other Veilguard artwork created in 2014. There's some fascinating similarities to the final game here, including several images of Solas - and even one where he appears to be undertaking his ritual from Veilguard's opening.
