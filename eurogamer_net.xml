Concord is officially no more, and neither is the studio that made it thanks to recent layoffs at Sony. But the ill-fated PlayStation shooter is set to live on in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Amazon's upcoming Secret Level video game series</a>, and the show's creator reckons its Concord episode - commissioned long before the game's fate was sealed - shows the 'potential of its world and characters'.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/">Rolling Stone</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-ill-fated-concord-animation-shows-potential-of-this-world-and-characters-creator-says">IGN</a>), Secret Level creator Tim Miller - who also directed the first Deadpool movie, and oversaw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>’s sci-fi anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots - explained the possibility of removing the Concord episode from Amazon's anthology was never even considered. That's despite Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">pulling the plug on the live-service game just weeks after launch</a> and its recent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">shut down Firewalk Studios</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show," Miller told Rolling Stone, "because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters. If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."

"There was no nicer, more invested group of developers than the team on Concord," he added. "I honestly don't understand why it didn't work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that."
</p><p>
And while Miller acknowledged the irony of airing an episode based on a game that no longer exists, he noted it's not a whole lot different to the Secret Level episodes dedicated to long-dormant franchises such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> and Mega Man.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level makes its Prime Video debut on 10th December and consists of 15 episodes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-trailer-for-amazons-secret-level-reveals-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-keanu-reeves">reportedly starring the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Keanu Reeves</a>. Armored Core, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Warhammer 40,000, and a number of PlayStation Studios games are also set to feature - with the first batch of episodes covering the mature end of the spectrum, while the latter is more family friendly, according to Miller.

As the season of wild consumer abandon and deep Black Friday discounts descends upon us, Sony has announced it's temporarily slashing the price of the PS5 Slim Digital Edition by $70 in the US, although it's made no indication the offer might be reflected elsewhere in the world.
</p>
<p>
The discount, revealed at the end of Sony's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww">Play Has No Limits commercial</a>, brings the price of the PlayStation 5 Slim Digital Edition down from its usual $449.99 to $379.99 - meaning the console is officially cheaper than its chunkier predecessor for the first time, given the $50 price increase Sony slapped on the Slim Digital Edition when it launched last year.
</p>
<p>
Sony says the offer - which doesn't yet appear <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim">on the PlayStation website</a> - will run until 24th December (or "while stocks last"), so consider that your starting point if you were planning on picking one up in the US during this year's Black Friday sales. As to whether Sony is planning a similar price reduction in Europe, it hasn't yet said, but it <em>did</em> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-drops-price-of-the-playstation-5-slim-for-a-limited-time">recently announce a temporary price cut</a> for the standard PS5 Slim across multiple territories.

Sony's PS5 Slim Digital Edition discount for the US follows last week's confirmation the company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">seen a drop in console sales</a>, down to 6.2m from the 8.2m sold in the same quarter last year. On the plus side, software sales are up - the marvellous Astro Bot even managed to shift 1.5m copies in its first month - and Sony will also be hoping the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-playstation-5-pro-weve-removed-it-from-its-box-and-theres-new-information-to-share">recently launched PlayStation 5 Pro</a> helps give its numbers a boost.
</p><p>
And speaking of Sony's £700 console, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-playstation-5-pro-review-across-the-board-improvements-but-is-it-really-worth-the-money">shared its PlayStation 5 Pro verdict</a> last week. "The truth is, the standard PS5 is still the best choice for most people," Richard Leadbetter wrote, "but for the core enthusiast looking for the best possible experience, the Pro option is there for you, albeit with a substantial premium."
