            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a>'s annual Intergalactic Aerospace Expo event is now live, and as part of the celebrations, Star Citizen is free to play from now until 5th December, complete with a new IAE Academy system designed to provide "a tutorial for new and returning players".</p>
<p>Developer Cloud Imperium says the event "presents a perfect opportunity to test out new ships, refresh on the basics of survival in space, and prepare to boldly explore a new frontier".</p>

<p>"Once players have completed the new player experience in their utilitarian Drake Cutter loaner ship they can rent any of the available ships to take on a series of missions including a bounty hunt, cargo hauling, mining, and visiting the IAE show floor themselves, to earn in-game UEC, IAE clothing, and an armour and weapon kit to jump-start their new life in space," the team added.</p><p>New ships include the Terrapin Medic - "a welcome sight to any injured explorer or soldier" - whilst the F7C Mk II line expands with the F7C-R and the F7C-S, known as the "Ghost".

            <p>A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> fan believes they've discovered a hidden message that adds further credence to a long-held fan theory about the seminal horror game.</p>
<p>The player believes that on two television sets found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> – the TV in the hospital cafeteria, and another in the nurses' lounge – a secret message is being played via Morse code.</p>

<p>"A message is playing on the TV in Brookhaven Hospital, transmitted in morse code," YouTuber Shiba explained.</p>
<p>"The sound is mostly drowned out by the static from the TV, making it difficult to hear clearly. However, the Morse code is distinct, with a clicking sound that resembles a telegraph. The loud clicks mark the beginning of a signal, while the softer click signal its end. If we listen closely, we can decipher the following message."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another fun Silent Hill 2 Remake discovery, a TV in Brookhaven Hospital in morse code repeatedly says, "Again and Again and Again and Again" endlessly: <a href="https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb">https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1859864583252607265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The message itself is pretty short, consisting of just two words and played on a loop: "Again and."</p>
<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team">hidden message discovered hiding behind the mysterious photos found in Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, the morse code message adds further validity to the popular fan theory that James Sunderland is trapped in the town of Silent Hill, reliving his search of Mary on a loop "again and again and again and".</p>

<p>The patch comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-fans-want-to-know-when-the-game-will-run-properly-on-ps5-pro">Silent Hill 2 Remake players called on Konami to address the technical issues still plaguing the game on PS5 Pro</a> almost two weeks on from the Pro's release. However, some players report all the patch has done is remove PSSR and fails to address any of the underlying issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Riot Games has pulled a promotional poster after fans pointed out it seemed to have been made using AI.</p>
<p>After thanking an eagle-eyed viewer for pointing out the strangeness of a hand in banner art on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> itself, Riot Games called the image "a mistake [that] has since been removed" and asserted its "strict stance" against AI.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane Season 2 review</a>, which earned a respectable four out of five stars, Chris T. said, "Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen.

            <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is calling for an investigation into Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/22/apple-and-google-could-face-uk-competition-probe-over-app-store-rules.html">CNBC</a>, the CMA may use its powers under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC) to examine possible anti-competitive behaviour from the two companies given their dominance of the UK's mobile markets.</p>
<p>However, it proposes that no further action be taken on cloud gaming given "primary concerns have been addressed".</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-provisional-findings-in-mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming-market-investigation">preliminary investigation</a>, an independent inquiry group has recommended a review into the UK mobile ecosystem and assess if the two megacorps have Strategic Market Status (SMS) which potentially gives them a self-preferential position in the market.</p>

<p>The independent inquiry group alleged Apple's App Store rules "restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers" and makes it difficult for smaller developers to operate without having to use the App Store.</p><p>The investigation also looked at mobile cloud gaming but said that as Apple made changes to allow cloud gaming apps to be sold via the App Store during the course of the investigation, "the group has provisionally concluded there is no need for intervention by the CMA in mobile cloud gaming".</p>
<p>The group also alleged Google and Apple have a revenue-sharing agreement to make Google the default search engine on iPhone which "significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS".</p>
<p>"Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers," said Margot Daly, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group. "Competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK."</p>
<p>Apple dispute the claims and said inteventions made under the DMCC "would undermine user privacy and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart".</p>
<p>"Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish," Apple said in a statement to CNBC. "We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users."</p>
<p>The CMA expects to make a final decision in March 2025. Google, Apple, and other interested parties have until 13th December to respond to the inquiry group's provisional report. The DMCC will come into effect in January 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cma-closes-its-investigation-into-apples-app-payments-on-grounds-of-administrative-priority">The CMA closed its investigation into Apple's in-app payment system</a> back in August "on the grounds of administrative priority".</p>
<p>At the time, the CMA said it no longer considered the investigation a priority but stressed that the case's closure "does not constitute a decision by the CMA".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-working-on-new-game-focused-ios-app-integrating-store-social-features-achievements-and-more">Apple is reportedly set to continue its slow and steady expansion into gaming</a> with the launch of a new game-focused iOS app that'll gather the likes of a store, recommendations, achievements, and social features into one place.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
