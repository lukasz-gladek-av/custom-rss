            <p>The latest UK charts for physical video game sales are here. This week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach has - perhaps unsurprisingly - taken the top spot, according to data for the week ending 28th June. This has seen Kojima Production's cinematic and widely praised release bump <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> down a place, to number two.</p>
<p>While Death Stranding 2 was indeed the top selling game last week physically, according to The Game Business' <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1939386768211509434">Chris Dring</a> these debut sales were 66 percent lower than that of the original Death Stranding game. This is largely due to the current market being more digital-focused.</p>
<p>To compare further, Dring stated Death Stranding 2's physical sales were 33 percent lower than fellow PS5 exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> had on its release. Of course, the two games are clearly targeted at quite different audiences.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The developer behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a> has shelved development on an RPG but is releasing it as a demo, allowing players to enjoy it nonetheless.</p>
<p>Adam "adamgryu" Robinson-Yu started Untitled Paper RPG back in 2016, saying, "I was nostalgic for the old style of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario">Paper Mario</a> and thought - well, I make games, why not try making the game I want to see? I started cooking something up in Unity and… it looked cool! I thought, maybe I really could make this game."</p>
<p>Now, almost 10 years later, Robinson-Yu said they felt "overwhelmed", adding "the scope felt too big, I didn't have a story", doubts crept in about the turn-based combat, and "in general, started to lose the joy that I felt working on it".</p>

<p>"After releasing A Short Hike and working on the subsequent updates and ports… I didn't really want to go back to this game?" Robinson-Yu admitted. "The development for the RPG had become difficult, which was why I took a break from it in the first place. I might return to this project someday, but I've been working on other things and don't see myself making time for this RPG in near future."</p>
<p>Consequently, if you pop on over to the <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/paper-game#download">official website</a>, you can download a demo with one to two hours of content for both PC and Mac.</p>
<p>"Some people still ask about this game! I figured maybe sharing the demo is better than nothing," Robinson-Yu added, explaining why it's been released as a demo. "There is 1-2 hours of gameplay in the current build, after all. There's some stuff in there that I'm proud of, even if there's also some stuff that I find embarrassing! Hope you enjoy taking a peek behind the curtain at a game partway through an aimless development."</p>
<p>"Just finished a few minutes ago," said one player in the comments. "This was a wonderful demo. I had a gut feeling you wouldn't go back to this, but I never expected you'd actually drop a demo of what you have put together. It already has so much of the personality, humour, attention to detail and innate Nintendo-esque playfulness that defined your work on A Short Hike - and this was first!</p>
<p>"Thank you for taking the big leap of putting this out there!"</p>
<p>As for what else Robinson-Yu has planned? That includes an action aventure game, a "micro-RPG with a claymation asethetic", and an online platforming roguelike.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-short-hike-dev-halts-work-on-unfinished-rpg-saying-i-might-never-finish-this-so-im-releasing-the-demo]]></content:encoded>
