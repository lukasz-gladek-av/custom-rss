            <p>A little game by the name of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> just released, and it has thrown platforms into chaos.</p>
<p>As you can see from images captured by the Eurogamer team, the likes of Steam was brought to a grinding halt as many flocked to get their hands on the highly-anticipated sequel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several of us have been unable to add the game to our carts across Xbox, PlayStation and Switch. The PS store, for example, is stuck on Wishlisted at the time of writing.</p>
<p>
In the words of our Connor: "Steam it looks like every step has issues, trying to pay with Paypal is leading to error messages."</p>
<p>Are you having more luck than us?</p>
