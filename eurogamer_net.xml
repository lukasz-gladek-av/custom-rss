<p>In Firefight Classic, you and a team of three others will do your utmost to last as long as you can against endless waves of increasingly difficult enemies. Five waves make up a round, and three rounds (plus a bonus round) make a set.</p>
<p>"You can keep the party going for as long as you want. No, really, you could keep the good times rolling with your squad into next week if you really wanted to! Or - at the end of a set - head to the exfiltration zone and end the match," <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/blue-team-operation-launch">proclaims the Halo Infinite team</a>.</p>
<p>"Try not to die, as lives are limited [there are a pool of seven lives], but you'll be able to earn them back by successfully completing a bonus round."</p>
<p>Many are quite excited by this mode's return, with jubilations such as "YES CLASSIC FIREFIGHT FINALLY" gracing the launch trailer's comments section. </p>
<p>If you are as excited as that there commenter, you can find full details on the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/firefight-classic">dedicated Halo Infinite Firefight Classic blog post</a>.</p>
