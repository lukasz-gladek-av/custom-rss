<p>Up until now, the arcade racer - the first Ridge Racer game to come to a Nintendo-flavoured console - was only playable for those who still have a Nintendo 64 hooked up.</p>

<p>Released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo states this "arcade classic" takes you on "fast-paced races across three different environments for a total of nine courses".</p>
<p>"Dive right in with Quick Play to race three laps around the Revolution Novice course or take on Grand Prix and choose any available track to test your skills," the blurb teases. </p>
<p>"Other modes include Car Attack, which lets you compete for better cars, and Time Attack, where the only thing you're racing against is your own best time! Challenge your friends in Multiplayer and put the pedal to the metal in three modes: Battle Mode, Stage Mode, and Team Mode."</p>
<p>Last week we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-three-more-snes-games-promising-puzzles-brawls-and-ninjas">Nintendo added another three classic games to its SNES Switch Online collection</a>, including one not seen in the west before: Fatal Fury 2, and Super Ninja Boy.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, Nintendo Switch Online is Nintendo's answer to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus</a>. </p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-must-pay-to-play-nintendo-switch-online-from-next-week">launched back in 2018</a>, and marks the first time Nintendo has locked the ability to play multiplayer games online behind a paid service. To sweeten the deal, Nintendo has thrown in a wealth of additional perks like cloud saves, game trials, and exclusive money-saving offers - not to mention a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">whole library of classic Nintendo titles</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by controversial streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm, is shutting its doors, four months after making "significant" layoffs. The news comes as Google announces it's lifting Beahm's YouTube monetisation ban, which was put in place following his admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last year.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society was founded by Beahm and former Call of Duty community manager Robert Bowling in 2021, and the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-footage-of-deadrop-from-the-nft-fuelled-developer-backed-by-dr-disrespect">announced its first title</a> - free-to-play vertical extraction shooter Deaddrop - the following year. Development on Deadrop has continued since then, but 2024 proved challenging for the studio amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">Beahm's admission</a> he exchanged "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".
</p>
<p>
Bowling and Midnight Society were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">quick to distance themselves from Beahm</a> when the allegations around his behaviour first surfaced, but the studio was seemingly unable to weather the resulting storm. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-studio-midnight-society-confirms-significant-layoffs-due-to-multiple-unexpected-challenges">announced "significant" layoffs in September</a>, blaming "multiple unexpected challenges in recent months." And now Midnight Society is shutting down.
</p>
<p>
"Today, we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of 55 developers contributing to our new IP Deadrop," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160">statement shared on social media</a>, adding it is "actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members."
</p>
<p>
"We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members," the developer concluded, "and [are] deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal."
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society's closure coincides with the news Google has lifted its suspension preventing Beahm from monetising his YouTube channel. The channel was initially demonetised following Beahm's admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last June, and Google chose to uphold that suspension following an appeal in October - despite Beahm's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-returns-insisting-conversations-with-minor-were-inappropriate-jokes-taken-out-of-context">attempts to backtrack on his statement</a> a month earlier, when he began referring to the messages as "jokes". Now, however, Google has announced a reversal of its decision.
</p><p>
"DrDisrepsect was previously suspended from the YouTube Partner Program for violations of our Creator Responsibility policies," it wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lgykx4q7zc2k">statement shared by Kotaku's Ethan Gach</a> . "Creators who are suspended from this program can reapply for access, and after careful review of the channel's recent activity, we've reinstated it. If there are further violations, we'll take appropriate action." Google did not specify what had changed since last year's appeal.
</p>
<p>
"What a fucking weird world, huh?", Beahm said in a stream following YouTube's reversal (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">Kotaku</a>). "On the day that Midnight Society closes, we get monetisation. What a fucking trip."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-crys-animated-netflix-series-gets-april-release-date-and-a-limp-bizkit-opener<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been a long time coming - seven years, in fact - but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated adaption of Devil May Cry is almost upon us. The streaming service has announced the series premieres on 3rd April, and there's a trailer of sorts to accompany the news.
</p>
<p>
We first heard a Devil May Cry animated adaptation was in the works back in 2018, with Adi Shankar - executive producer on Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation and 2023's Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix - tasked with teasing it into existence.
</p>
<p>
For a while it seemed like the project might have been quietly shelved, but 2023 proved otherwise, bringing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-look-at-netflixs-long-in-the-works-devil-may-cry-animated-series">first look at the show</a>, alongside confirmation its animation was being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind The Legend of Korra.

<p>
A year later, Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-anime-launches-2025-and-everything-else-from-netflix-geek-week">released its first proper trailer</a> for the series, providing a glimpse of a Dante displaying little enthusiasm for buttoning up his shirts. That reveal also pointed to an April 2025 release, which has now been narrowed right down to April 3rd.
</p><p>
Netflix's release date news is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4V6H0LFEGs">accompanied by a trailer</a> showcasing the Devil May Cry series' intro sequence, complete with strikingly stylised violence and a Limp Bizkit soundtrack. It's a lot different to the actual show, of course, which adopts a more traditional anime-style aesthetic.
</p>
<p>

We still don't have any story details for this animated version of Devil May Cry yet - beyond 'white-haired young man in red jacket loves to show off his abs - but presumably Netflix'll have more to say about the series ahead of its arrival.
