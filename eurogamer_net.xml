            <p>Sony is being sued in a Dutch class action lawsuit over artificially inflated prices on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>The lawsuit has been filed by Dutch non-profit organisation Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument on behalf of 1.7 million Dutch PlayStation users.</p>
<p>The organisation has accused Sony of "abusing its dominant position in the console market for at least a decade", according to a press release shared with Eurogamer. Due to the increased prevalence of digital sales and digital-only consoles, the organisation claims Sony has a monopoly over digital sales - what it has dubbed a "Sony Tax".</p>
<p>The lawsuit is part of the organisation's <a href="https://www.massaschadeconsument.nl/collectieve-acties/playstation/">"Fair PlayStation" campaign</a>, which it launched in February and attracted over 20,000 participants in its first week.</p>
<p>"Many people have noticed they're increasingly being pushed towards 'digital-only' consoles since the arrival of the latest PS5 generation," said Lucia Melcherts, chair of Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument.</p>
<p>"These consoles work exclusively with digital games rather than physical discs. Yet economic research shows that consumers pay on average 47 percent more for a digital version of a game compared to an identical physical copy - even though Sony's distribution costs are significantly lower."</p>
<p>In April this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony raised the price of its PS5 console once again</a> in multiple countries, including the UK and across Europe. Now, the PS5 Digital Edition costs £40 or €50 more, which Sony blamed on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".</p>
<p>"The fact that Sony dares to raise prices by double digits without offering anything meaningful in return speaks volumes," said Melcherts. "Sony is the sole provider of digital content on the world’s most popular gaming console. With more than 80 percent of Dutch console owners using a PlayStation, Sony is free to make decisions with little regard for competitors, developers, or consumers."</p>
<p>In the summons sent to Sony by Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument, there are two core accusations: the exclusion of competition, and the exploitation of consumers and game developers. The organisation claims PlayStation players are entirely dependent on Sony and its prices due to its closed ecosystem, while developers have limited commercial freedom with Sony setting prices.</p>
<p>Due to this "imbalance", Stichting Massaschade &amp; Consument claims consumers are paying a premium - resulting in estimated damages in the Netherlands of up to €435m.</p>
<p>A first hearing will take place later this year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">legal claim made in the UK in 2022</a> by ex-managing director of Which UK Alex Neill, filed with the Competition Appeal Tribunal. It claimed Sony was in breach of competition law due to a 30 percent commission on digital games and in-game purchases.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/5bn-lawsuit-over-unfair-playstation-prices-may-continue-tribunal-rules">lawsuit was then given the go ahead in 2023</a>, and <a href="https://woodsford.com/woodsford-funded-5bn-class-action-against-sony-playstation-gets-go-ahead-in-uk-competition-appeal-tribunal/">earlier this year was given the green light to proceed to trial</a>.</p>
<p>Others in the industry have also received lawsuits over perceived monopolies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite recently returned to iOS devices in the US and Europe</a> following a lengthy battle between Epic and Apple over the latter's restrictions on purchasing methods. Meanwhile, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-settles-lawsuit-from-players-attempting-to-block-activision-blizzard-acquisition">Microsoft settled a lawsuit from players attempting to block its acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> due to a perceived monopoly over the industry.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-in-netherlands-over-sony-tax-and-its-perceived-monopoly-on-digital-sales]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega is now the official gaming partner of McLaren Racing, in a multi-year collaboration with Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>In a press release shared with Eurogamer, the partnership promises to "fuse the worlds of motorsport and gaming and engage audiences of all ages both on the grid and screen". It's unknown exactly what this will entail, but it's all part of Sonic Team's 2025 "<a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/racing-around-the-world">Racing Around The World</a>" campaign.</p>
<p>The partnership will continue into 2026, Sonic's 35th anniversary year, as well as the McLaren Formula 1 team's 1,000th Grand Prix race.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time the two companies have joined forces. Back in 1993, the European Grand Prix was held in Donington Park in the UK and was known as the Sonic Grand Prix. McLaren F1 driver Ayrton Senna won the race and received a Sonic the Hedgehog trophy.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to welcome Sonic the Hedgehog to the McLaren Racing family," said Louise McEwen, chief marketing officer of McLaren Racing. "This partnership brings together two iconic names in speed, and opens up our team to a wider, younger global audience. Sonic is a character with incredible heritage and a passionate fanbase, and we are very excited to celebrate our partnership at McLaren Racing Live: London."</p>
<p>The McLaren Racing Live event will take place in Trafalgar Square from 2nd - 3rd July.</p>
<p>The collaboration underlines Sega's key release for the year, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. The next in the racing series, it features mid-race portals to other worlds to shake up gameplay, as well as including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">Hatsune Miku, Persona's Joker, and Minecraft's Steve in its roster of racers</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a Sega Arcade racer, with the mechanical depth and tightened controls you'd expect from that lineage," wrote Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">hands-on with Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>. "It's also a mad party game to boot."</p>
<p>The partnership also proves the brand power of Sonic and Sega, as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">blue blur's star has risen over the past decade</a> through well-received games and films.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sega has partnered with an F1 team, either. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bizarrely-atlus-will-sponsor-haas-for-this-weeks-f1-singapore-grand-prix-in-honour-of-metaphor-refantazio">Atlus sponsored F1 team Haas last year</a> to celebrate the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. Why? Both the team and the game share a Hulkenberg.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-joins-mclaren-racing-in-historic-partnership-with-sega]]></content:encoded>
