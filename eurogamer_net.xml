            <p>It looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst a number of third-party developers have confirmed ports for Nintendo's highly anticipated upcoming console, up until now, there'd been no word of a Switch 2 Assassin's Creed Shadows edition… well, not until PEGI let it slip, anyway.</p>

<p>Could it be a mistake? Possibly. Either way, we've reached out to Ubisoft and will update just as soon as we know more.</p>
<p>Relatedly, while we already knew that Ubisoft was also bringing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> to Nintendo Switch 2, this weekend's Star Wars Celebration in Japan - which revealed earlier today that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-next-story-update-is-a-pirates-fortune-and-its-coming-next-month">its next story-based DLC is coming on 15th May</a> - revealed the Star Wars adventure will <em>not</em> be a launch title, instead releasing on 4th September, 2025.</p>
<p>We awarded Assassin's Creed Shadows four out of five stars, with our resident Creed expert Tom writing in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>: "Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Nintendo finally detailed how US tariffs will impact the launch of Switch 2</a>, and confirmed price rises for an array of console accessories "due to changes in market conditions".</p>
<p>A new set of Joy-Con 2 controllers, for example, will now cost $95, an increase of $5. The Switch 2 Pro controller and Switch 2 camera have also seen $5 price rises, up to $85 and $55 respectively. But the $450 Switch 2 itself, including its $500 bundle with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, will not increase in price for now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dying Light 1: Stay Human's Patch 22 - the spring update - is now live, improving co-op, offering "creative control" over Villedor's looks, and introducing new rewards in Tower Raid.</p>
<p>The latter is particularly interesting given it should now be easier to claim rewards, such as exclusive skins and 27 new weapons, including 24 Elemental weapons and three Elemental pistols. There's also been some changes to the HUD, too, to make it easier to track your progress.</p>

<p>Techland also <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/update-122-spring-update">revealed</a> there's now "enhanced co-op gameplay with fixed enemy behaviour synchronisation issues" which reduces teleporting and lag, and whilst console players have to wait a little bit longer, PC players can now customise textures for Villedor thanks to new mod tools.</p>
<p>"In the Spring Update, you'll experience a slew of enhancements designed to elevate your co-op experience," the team explained. "We have addressed and resolved various enemy behaviour issues affected by synchronisation between players. This intends to ensure smoother gameplay and reduced discrepancies, including the amount of enemies teleporting and lagging.</p>
<p>"The HUD has also received substantial improvements, providing clearer visual cues and streamlined access to vital information, ultimately enhancing situational awareness with multiple players on screen."</p>
<p>For the full list of fixes, head on over to the <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/update-122-spring-update">official website</a>.</p>
<p>Dying Light 1 released on 26th January, 2015, and proved to be a massive hit for Techland, selling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">over 20m copies as of 2022</a>. A sequel followed in 2022, and an 18-hour standalone adventure, Dying Light: The Beast, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">set to arrive this summer</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Techland teased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">plans for "multiple unannounced projects" set in the Dying Light universe</a> - including new video games, board games, and a webcomic - as the zombie series celebrates its tenth birthday.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Embark on a mysterious adventure with Kay and Nix to explore the Khepi system and learn what it takes to be a true leader," teases the blurb. "Team up with legendary pirate Hondo Ohnaka and face off against Stinger Tash and her Rokana Raiders as you infiltrate the Khepi Tomb to uncover the secrets and hidden treasures it holds.</p>
<p>"Along the way, you’ll discover the Miyuki Trade League, who offer new rewards for the Trailblazer in exchange for smuggling dangerous goods across the galaxy."</p>
<p>As part of the update, all players will be gifted cosmetic items inspired by Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, including an outfit for Nix, a Trophy for the speeder, and a Trinket for both the speeder and the Trailblazer. They'll pop up in your delivery crate on the Trailblazer after downloading and installing the update.</p>
<p>We awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars on its initial release last August.</p>
<p>"It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of Uncharted. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p>

            <p>Void Interactive's tactical FPS Ready or Not is coming to consoles later this year.</p>
<p>Whilst the developer stopped short of confirming a firm release date - "summer" (Q3) is the closest we have right now - it did reveal the shooter would also be coming to Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store, too.</p>
<p>To celebrate, here's a brand new cinematic trailer that debuted at the Galaxies Showcase:</p>

<p>Ready or Not sees you visit Los Sueños, where a surge of crime across the greater Los Sueños metropolitan area has severely depleted resources, threatening to "overwhelm the department's ability to maintain order". In response to the growing threats facing residents, LSPD is mobilising its SWAT teams to respond to high-threat scenarios, including active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and high-risk hostage situations.</p>
<p>Ready or Not features "immersive tactical gameplay, full flexibility of approach, and authentic equipment that SWAT teams utilise in the field". You can expect 20 single-player or online co-op missions to play with up to four pals, as well as two new missions as part of the Stories from Los Sueños free DLC update.</p>
<p>You'll also get two DLCs that introduce six additional levels, and, in Dark Waters DLC, the UH-60 support helicopter. There are also "dozens of options to customise a player’s entire SWAT team" including armour, weapons, and apparel.</p>
<p>PC players will have access to the new missions in a free update day-and-date with console launch.</p>
<p>Pre-orderers will also secure the M32A1 grenade launcher, MK-V pistol, 590M shotgun, with players who already have the game on PC also getting the freebies. The game will cost £45 ($50 / €50) whether you buy the base game or the Day One Edition, which includes the pre-order items. There's also a £60 ($70 / €70) Deluxe Edition that includes the base game with three DLC packs - Home Invasion, Dark Waters, and an unannounced one - plus the pre-order goodies also bundled in.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after comments suggested it would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access on 17th December, but in a statement on Twitter shortly afterwards, Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>. Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna".</p>

            <p>EA has finally given us our first look at its upcoming Star Wars strategy game, Star Wars: Zero Company.</p>
<p>The single-player turn-based tactics game by Bit Reactor and Respawn was confirmed back in 2022. It's described as a "gritty and authentic original story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars".</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<p>You play as Hawks, a customisable former Republic officer, and will command an elite squad of "cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars". As an unconventional outfit of professionals for hire hailing from across the galaxy, Zero Company must set aside their differences to overcome nearly impossible odds and take on an emerging threat that will consume the galaxy if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The campaign includes tactical operations and investigations "across the galaxy", whilst between missions, you will develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of Zero Company’s adversaries. You'll be able to create and customise your squad of recruited operators while "getting to know a cast of newly authored Star Wars characters".</p>
<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," said Greg Foertsch, CEO and creative director at Bit Reactor.</p>
<p>"It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>
