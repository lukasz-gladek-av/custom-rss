            <p>Nintendo has confirmed that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> editions of original first-party Switch games will have the full game on the card rather than requiring a download - though that may not be the case for third-party titles.</p>
<p>Since the Switch 2's reveal last week, there's been some confusion about what exactly will be included on physical game cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">Nintendo previously stated the console will support both regular game cards and game-key cards</a>, with the latter being a "key" to downloading the full game. It's unclear at present which games will use which card type.</p>

<p>However, further confusion specifically arose around Switch 2 Edition games and whether the card would include both the original game and the upgrade package.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said: "Physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (ie. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code)."</p>
<p>They added: "Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card."</p>
<p>This confirms the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> will be complete on the game card. Third-party publishers may still opt for download codes, though.</p>
<p>These Switch 2 Edition games upgrade the originals with new features to make use of the new console's capabilities, be it improved frame rates or camera usage. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-edition-ports-of-og-switch-games-cost-65-in-uk">They will cost £65 here in the UK</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">Kirby and the Forgotten Land will include expanded worlds</a>, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will have mouse control support.</p>
<p>No matter what's on the game card, though, don't lick them - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-games-will-still-taste-so-bad-you-will-want-to-spit-them-out">Nintendo has confirmed the cards still purposefully taste awful</a> to stop players eating them.</p>

            <p>It's hard to imagine, but Mario Kart: Double Dash's two-player driving mechanic <em>almost </em>didn't happen!</p>
<p>As I am sure you know, in Mario Kart: Double Dash, rather than only choosing one character to plop into a kart of your choosing, players instead select two characters to ride in a kart together, with one at the back and one at the front.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo was anxious about introducing this mechanic into the Mario Kart series, so also worked on a "single-driver version" in tandem with the doubled-up driver version we all know today.</p>

<p>That's according to a 2003 interview with Mario Kart: Double Dash's developers, which first featured in Nintendo Dream magazine but has been freshly translated by <a href="https://shmuplations.com/doubledash/">Shmuplations</a>. Within this interview, producer Shinya Takahashi explained that "since Mario Kart has always been more of a party game", the team's "point-of-departure for the development was thinking about what new multiplayer gameplay mechanics we could add, and specifically what new mechanics we could add if the karts had two drivers".</p>
<p>However, the Double Dash team wanted to ensure it was innovating the series, "while not destroying what makes Mario Kart unique". The producer added this was "a monumental challenge" for those working on the game. Fellow producer Tadashi Sugiyama added Mario Kart had already turned into a "flagship title for Nintendo", and "each console has to have its own Mario Kart" title.</p>
<p>"Well, of course it's going to sell big, it's Mario Kart! - that pressure is huge," Sugiyama said, noting creating a game like this comes with "all these expectations" and the team had to "add something new" to the formula.</p>
<p>"The 'two drivers' concept, therefore, was something we came to at the end of a veryyy long process of brainstorming. We were a little worried about it though, so at first we were developing a single-driver version too, in parallel with the two-driver development," Sugiyama revealed, with Takahashi joking this was the Double Dash team's "emergency escape hatch" should all else fail.</p>
<p>"But in the end, owing I think to the majority of our staff who really wanted to do something new, we consolidated the development into just the two-driver concept," Sugiyama said</p>
<p>That isn't to say it wasn't still challenging to implement, and according to chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki, the best part of a year was spent working out that two-driver mechanic.  "We tried all sorts of stuff," Mizuki said.</p>
<p>One idea floated around for a while was to include sidecars, which immediately made me picture a Wallace and Gromit/Two Fat Ladies racer, which is perhaps making me show my age. Anyway, back to the interview in hand!</p>
<p>"Normally when one thinks of two people in a car, you think of a driver and passenger seat side-by-side. But for Mario Kart, that would end up making the karts too wide. Can you imagine eight massive karts lined up like that," Sugiyama quipped.</p>
<p>Takahashi added the developers "messed around with the positioning a lot", and eventually settled on "having them ride behind you" but this led to another issue - not being able to see both drivers. The solution? "To let you swap the drivers at any time," Sugiyama closed, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p>The Mario Kart reign remains strong, and the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> will also hail in the latest series entry: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Unlike Mario Kart games of old, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">World will include the ability to drive basically anywhere and a whopping 24 drivers can compete in a race</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom has already taken the upcoming game for a whirl, calling Mario Kart World "undoubtedly Switch 2's killer app" and one he can't wait to play more of.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off. With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Eurogamer's Mario Kart World preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to a lawsuit over the shutdown of its racing game The Crew, stating players purchased a "limited license to access the game" as opposed to "unfettered ownership".</p>
<p>The game was taken offline in March last year, becoming unplayable due to its online requirements. Despite being 10 years old and essentially replaced by a successor, the decision sparked concern over both consumer rights and game preservation.</p>
<p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sued-over-controversial-the-crew-shutdown">fans filed a lawsuit in California against Ubisoft</a>, stating players were unaware they owned only a licence to the game. Ubisoft responded in February, in a filing seen by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>, to dismiss the case.</p>

<p>The filing, from Ubisoft's lawyers, states the company "allegedly misled purchasers of its video game The Crew into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownership rights in the game, rather than a limited license to access the game".</p>
<p>"But the reality is that consumers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license," it reads.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's lawyers claim plaintiffs have applied a "kitchen sink approach on behalf of a putative class of nationwide customers" and alleged eight causes of action including false advertising and unfair competition. In response, they believe there has been no real "cognisable injury".</p>
<p>Plaintiffs then responded in March with an amended complaint and an additional accusation around gift certificates. Sales of the game's currency, they argued, could be considered a gift certificate and in California, gift certificates can't expire - yet with the game shut down, the in-game currency has expired.</p>
<p>Further, photos of the packaging from the plaintiffs reveal the activation code for the game doesn't expire until 2099, which they claim is how Ubisoft "implied that [The Crew] would remain playable during this time and long thereafter". As such, they believe the statute of limitations has not expired.</p>
<p>Ubisoft now has until 29th April to respond once again.</p>
<p>After shutting down the game's servers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft retroactively added offline modes to other games in the series</a>.</p>
<p>One group of modders, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">recreated the server-side software needed to play The Crew online once again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Behold, your irregular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> funding update is here, with the news Cloud Imperium Games' controversial space sim has now raised over $800m - despite there still being no hint of a version 1.0 release date some 12 years after its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen">original Kickstarter campaign</a>.
</p>
<p>
Star Citizen's previous major milestone arrived last May, when <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals">Cloud Imperium's funding tracker</a> - which aggregates money raised from likes of paid alpha access and those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizens-latest-dlc-pack-costs-over-45000">eye-wateringly expensive ship packs</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">ticked over the $700m mark</a>. That does, of course, mean the game - as far as it can currently be described as such - has raised a further $100m in just 11 months.
</p>
<p>
All this and there's still no sign of a 1.0 release date for Star Citizen, although its paid public alpha continues to evolve with regular updates. The space sim, you might recall, was originally targeting a 2014 launch, but sailed right past that (and just kept going) as Cloud Imperium Games' plans grew ever-more ambitious and the project fell into a vortex of feature creep.

<p>
The closest Cloud Imperium has come to suggesting an end is in sight in recent times came last March when CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">wrote that the "team [was] hard at work, heads down, driving towards the finish line."</a> But while the massively multiplayer, persistent universe portion of Star Citizen is potentially still some significant way off, its story driven, single-player spin-off - known as Squadron 42 - is supposedly much closer on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Cloud Imperium last year said it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-spin-off-squadron-42-will-release-in-2026-heres-an-hour-long-gameplay-teaser">targeting a 2026 launch for Squadron 42</a>, whose <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-hires-hefty-hollywood-cast-for-squadron-42">star-studded cast</a> includes the likes of Gary Oldan, Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, and Andy Serkis. But given the number of times the project has already slipped back (it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/11-years-later-star-citizen-dev-says-squadron-42-is-feature-complete">described as "feature complete" in 2023</a>), it remains to be seen whether that 2026 release window holds true.
