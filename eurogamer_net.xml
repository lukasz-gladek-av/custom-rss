Beloved 8-bit isometric puzzle-platformer Head Over Heels is back and (not for the first time) getting the remake treatment, bringing "colourful modern visuals" and "refined gameplay" when it comes to PC and Switch later this year.
</p>
<p>
The original Head Over Heels was developed by Ocean Software and released for various platforms, including the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, in 1987. It cast players as Head and Heels, two interstellar spies on a mission to liberate planets from an evil Emperor.
</p>
<p>
All this unfolded across 300 isometric rooms, with players needing to utilise Head and Heels' slightly different abilities in order to overcome obstacles - including, famously, a dalek with the head of (then) Prince Charles - and mount their escape from Castle Blacktooth.

<p>
Head Over Heels is beloved enough that it's already had one remake; this initial 2003 update brought substantially overhauled visuals in a version that would later come to PC and Switch. Now though, it's set to get a more faithful remake in the form of Head Over Heels: Deluxe.
</p>
<p>
Head Over Heels: Deluxe's most obvious difference is its art style, which adheres far more closely to the pixel art visuals of the 1987 original. It also features a brand-new soundtrack composed by Space Fractal, "re-engineered controls that feel snappy and precise", multiple save points, three difficulty levels, hints, and selectable play speeds.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, there's a new world to explore - complete with new enemies and objects (including chickens!) - bringing the total number of "majestic" locations up to 500. And for those hoping for something a bit more traditional, it's possible to switch to "classic mode" graphics and sounds closer to the 8-bit original.
</p>
<p>
Head Over Heels: Deluxe is developed by Rusty Pixels and Ogre Games Ltd and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3153640/Head_Over_Heels_Deluxe/">releases on Steam</a> this Thursday, 6th March. A Switch version is due to arrive later this year.
