            <p>A lot has transpired during this first month of 2026, but Ubisoft can't escape the news cycle with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">layoffs, studio closures, project cancellations</a> (including the long-in-development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-actor-reacts-to-cancellation">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">countless hints</a> the still-unannounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake is coming sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>A new week, a new leak or finding on Edward Kenway's return being a real, impending thing. Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-an-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-just-leaked-via-vinted">IGN</a>, we've learned an all-new statue of the iconic pirate-turned-assassin was spotted on 27th January. While the figure itself doesn't say anything about it pertaining to the Resynced remake we've been hearing about for months now, it joins other promotional materials and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/es-es/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/28oWzWFPvQgskv6cgLGBMG/the-division-2-x-assassins-creed-collaboration">big collaborations</a> that are highlighting Kenway in recent times.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>⚠️ LEAK BLACK FLAG REMAKE ?</p><p>Un gars sur Vinted vend une toute nouvelle figurine de Edward Kenway et prétend qu'elle sortirait cette année. </p><p>En sachant que le remake de Black Flag était censé sortir dans moins de 2 mois, serait-ce la figurine officielle du jeu ? <a href="https://t.co/ctVWiavA6c">pic.twitter.com/ctVWiavA6c</a></p></div>— j0nathan (@xj0nathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The statue itself is pretty cool, with Kenway sitting on a treasure chest full of gold coins and leaning back against a ship's wheel, pistol and iconic cutlass in each hand. The titular Black Flag is also present, with both the traditional pirate skull and the Assassin's Creed sigil that so many longtime fans love mixed together.</p>
<p>The figure's origins are unknown, and its appearance is a bit baffling; it popped up via the clothing resale app Vinted. Leakers like <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan">j0nathan</a> are sure this isn't a previously released statue, and the listing states the 35cm-tall statue won't be officially out until later in 2026. IGN's report states "a detailed close-up of the statue's base shows logos for Ubisoft and PureArts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026."</p><p>This would line up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">PureArts' teases last summer</a> that "something" was happening with Black Flag in the near future. At this point, and following so many hints across very different brands and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">even Ubisoft drumming up excitement</a> for the fourth mainline Assassin's Creed, it's mostly safe to theorize a release was maybe planned for early 2026 before the delays and reorganization that were announced last week.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake now out of the picture and Ubisoft going more selective with its output moving forward, more expectations are being placed on this next major Assassin's Creed release, so let's hope it's all smooth sailing once Kenway and his crew go out into the seas again.</p>

            <p>It's no secret <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' optimisation, especially in its PC version, has been a bit cheeks even if updates have slowly tried to bite through its many technical issues. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">has been good fun</a> otherwise, but even at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/monster-hunter-wilds-sells-11-million-in-just-under-a-year-but-may-lack-worlds-momentum">11m copies sold</a>, its momentum slowed quite a bit following a huge launch.</p>
<p>January is now almost over and the game's first anniversary is near. True to its word, the Monster Hunter developer has now deployed a Steam-exclusive patch which marks the second chapter in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-finally-gets-pc-optimisation-roadmap-to-coincide-with-title-update-4-but-players-still-arent-really-happy">performance improvements roadmap</a> set in late 2025 by Capcom.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?l=english">patch notes</a> for Ver.1.040.03.01 were shared on 28th January alongside the big update, which also targets the <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained">unintended FPS drops in the Base Camp and Grand Hub</a> oddly tied to unclaimed content <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">discovered by a Reddit user</a> a couple of weeks ago. "To further improve stability and performance across all platforms, additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.041 update on February 18," the post added.</p>
<p>The major additions and changes target the CPU/GPU load, with shader processes outside the initial one now reduced to lower CPU load during normal play, improved streaming of textures to reduce VRAM usage, and a reworked High Resolution Texture Pack (optional download) which uses less VRAM and takes up less space.</p><p>Players will now also find a chunky CPU tab if they go to the crowded Options menu, with extra non-graphical settings tied to CPU load now available; these include frame skips and limited numbers of smaller creatures, among other things. They might not make much of a difference for beefy builds, but those with slower CPUs could claw some performance back.</p>

<p>Graphic settings have also gained a few new categories and extra quality levels. Moreover, the typically heavy Volumetric Fog setting has received three lower options and renamed its "High" setting to "Highest" in case you don't need top-notch fog rendering.</p>
<p>In my own post-patch experience, performance has seen improvements across the board even if RE Engine's limitations when it comes to open levels (something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> also suffered from) are still there. Two particularly taxing locations, the main camp located at the Windward Plains and the more watery Scarlet Forest area, have seen a welcome bump of up to 20 FPS on average. Mind you, my PC rig isn't a low-tier one, but without using the Frame Generation option (on top of DLSS), those zones usually were sub-60 FPS. Now they're well above that mark and much higher with the FG x2 boost enabled. Overall, the game seems more stable and less stuttery to boot.</p><p>On the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/">Steam forums</a>, the early sentiment is positive so far, with players reporting FPS gains and a less hiccup-y experience overall. A few users are even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/729154531022090103/">pushing for more positive reviews</a> following the update (the game currently sits at Mixed), but it'll take a while before the community's thoughts coalesce. On the other hand, some veterans are remaining unimpressed by the tweaks.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this is just the second phase of Capcom's ongoing efforts to improve the game's health ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">rumoured Switch 2 port</a> and a potential large expansion which adds to the game's free endgame content updates, which appear to be done now. Hunters on consoles needn't download this PC-only patch.</p>
