<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> arrives later this week, and with physical editions now out in the wild, fans are expressing dismay amid reports the PS5 release includes just 85MB of data on the disc, with the Xbox Series X/S release seemingly not much bigger.
</p>
<p>
Rumblings of discontent over Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/some-retailers-have-broken-doom-the-dark-ages-street-date-and-huge-spoilers-are-already-out-there">over the weekend</a>, after one early receiver took to social media to <a href="https://x.com/nilynix/status/1920550232414183648">report the Xbox version contained just 342MB of data on the disc</a>. That was followed by an update on the PS5 version from Does it play?, an account dedicated to "[testing] commercial releases to ensure they work internet free."
</p>
<p>
Does it Play? <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1920754796463636713">shared screenshots from a supporter</a> purportedly showing Doom: The Dark Ages' PS5 physical release contains just an 85.01MB "stub and a blocker to go online and update" on disc. That means purchasers of either console's physical edition are required to download approximately 85GB of data to play the game.

<p>
Images of Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/1920542970668826913">show an "internet required" badge on the cover</a>, but the extent of the required download size seemingly isn't made clear. Eurogamer has contacted Bethesda for confirmation of the reports, and for clarity on its physical release strategy, but the publisher is yet to respond. We'll update the story if we hear more.
</p>
<p>
The news follows similar criticism by players and preservationists earlier this year after Bethesda released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> with just 20GB of the game's full 120GB install size on the disc. Nintendo has also seen pushback after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">announcing physical game-key cards for Switch 2</a> that only include a download key. Early signs have suggested a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">significant majority of third-party publishers will release their Switch 2 titles on game-key cards at launch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Away from Doom: The Dark Ages' physical release controversy, Bethesda's latest has received plenty of praise. Eurogamer contributor Christian Donlan called it "brisk and playful" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">four star review</a>, while Digital Foundry described it as "phenomenal" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-series-x-delivers-the-smoothest-experience-ps5-pro-the-crispest-image">their tech breakdown</a>.

            <p>Magic: the Gathering has detailed more of its Final Fantasy card collection, and a message from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> character designer Tetsuya Nomura may hint towards the third part of the remake series.</p>
<p>The card collection includes two of Final Fantasy 7 villain Sephiroth - "Fabled SOLDIER" and "One-Winged Angel" - which form a singular piece of art when combined. The first is Sephiroth in human form, the second is his evolved form as the final boss of the game.</p>
<p>"This time around, I drew Sephiroth on both the front and back sides of the card," wrote Nomura in a message on social media. "I actually drew them so that they would join up if placed one on top of the other, so if you manage to get two of the same card and line them up, you'll see how the original illustration looked."</p>

<p>He then added: "There is also a reason that the design for Safer Sephiroth is different from the original game, but I unfortunately can't share more about that."</p>
<p>It's this latter comment that's got fans speculating the new artwork on the card may be taken from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> Part Three.</p>

<p>The biggest difference from the original game is that this Safer Sephiroth has both of his arms, where the boss form has one arm and one wing. Still, this is likely our first look at what's to come in the third remake game.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Magic: the Gathering set, each iteration of Cid from across the series will be present.</p>
<p>Cid is a recurring character who debuted in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ii">Final Fantasy 2</a> and has featured, in some form, in every game since, meaning the set will include 15 Cid, Timeless Artificer cards.</p>

<p>The Final Fantasy x Magic: the Gathering collection will launch on 13th June and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-crossover-cards-revealed-with-classic-artwork-and-a-fresh-card-type">cleverly transposes gameplay from the RPG series into card form</a>. There will be four Commander Decks available based on Final Fantasies 6, 7, 10, and 14, though all games in the series will be represented.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
