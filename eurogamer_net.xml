            <p>Nintendo has announced that a Kirby Air Riders Direct will air tomorrow, 19th August. The video presentation will be approximately 45 minutes long and deliver info on the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> exclusive.</p>
<p>The news of the Direct was posted on Nintendo Today, the publisher's mobile app.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tune in tomorrow Tuesday, August 19th at 2pm UK time for a livestreamed Kirby Air Riders Direct featuring about 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game.</p></blockquote>
<p>Very little on the game has been revealed so far, although we got this description on the game's listing on <a href="http://nintendo.com/">Nintendo.com</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kirby Air Riders, a brand new title originated from the Nintendo GameCube classic racing-action game Kirby Air Ride, is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 this year – directed by Masahiro Sakurai.</p></blockquote>
<p>A trailer for Kirby Air Riders was released back in April. The trailer, which you can watch below, doesn't give much away, and we've had to wait four months to get new info on the game.</p>

            <p>Developer Herobeat has announced its next game, Rewilders: The Lost Spring, which has been inspired by the works of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli films.</p>
<p>The developer is known for its debut game Endling - Extinction is Forever, which was released back in 2022 and went on to score itself not only a BAFTA win, but a nomination at the Game Awards as well. Rewilders: The Lost Spring is a follow up to Endling - Extinction is Forever, though not a sequel. That said, the developer has promised "echoes" of its predecessor's storytelling, as well as its aesthetics and score.</p>

<p>Rewilders is described as an open-world action roguelite, which will come with creature collection and metroidvania-like progression. Players will take on the role of Abi, who returns to "the poisoned surface of the world" to both rescue her family and restore the wild. "Discover corrupted biomes and face off against twisted creatures born from a failed society," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for Rewilders: The Lost Spring below.</p>
