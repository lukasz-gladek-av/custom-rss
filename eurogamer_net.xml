            <p>The creator of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s R.E.A.L VR mod, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-removed-by-cd-projekt-after-its-creator-wouldnt-release-it-for-free">which was taken down earlier this week following a DMCA strike by CD Projekt Red</a>, has stated that he's being punished by pirates sharing his mods online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">In a statement to IGN</a>, who reached out to creator Luke Ross asking he would consider making the Cyberpunk 2077 mod free, he responded by saying that it would take a considerable amount of work, and that he believed there was little point in doing so thanks to rampant piracy.</p>
<p>"I do not rule out releasing the mod free for everyone [...] but it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task. Also, the people who have voluntarily given their money to me in order to support my development efforts for the framework might not be happy about seeing the mod being given away all of a sudden to everyone just because I've been bullied into it."</p>

<p>Ross continued, stating: "Anyway, it's kind of become a moot point, because following to the unexpected DMCA strike, after the mod was forcibly removed from my Patreon, people afraid of losing VR support for their favorite games have started pirating and illegally exchanging the mod all over the Internet, brazenly saying that since I was not complying with CDPR's ToS, my work is now fair game and I should be punished by having it stolen. So in a sense CDPR already got what they wanted."</p><p>The mod itself wasn't the reason why Ross received an NDA, rather its availability behind a Patreon paywall behind several other R.E.A.L VR mods Ross has created over the years. This, according to CD Projekt Red, broke its 'fan guidelines' document, which prevents selling content derived from CD Projekt's works for money.</p>
<p>The company also stated, in a document shared by Ross, the following: "We're happy for you to accept reasonable donations in connection with your fan content, but you're not allowed to make people pay for it or have it behind any sort of paywall (e.g. don't make content only available to paid subscribers)"</p>
<p>Ross publicly pushed back against this, writing on his Patreon page: "In the end it amounted to the same iron-clad corpo logic: every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free</p>
<p>"As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualising 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> who spawn into maps late actually tend to profit more economically, according to a recent interview with design lead Virgil Watkins.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/that-really-sucks-arc-raiders-lead-responds-to-complaints-about-late-spawns-says-late-joiners-are-important-and-profit-way-more-but-embark-knows-its-annoying-to-have-no-time-for-objectives/">Published by GamesRadar</a>, the matter on delayed spawns was addressed head on, as well as whether or not it's good for the players who find themselves a bit late to the party. It turns out, based on the data Embark Studios can see, these players actually tend to extract with more cash in their pockets.</p>
<p>"But similar to the perception of free kits versus what they do, the perception around late joining and what it affords you has been quite interesting. Players are like, 'The loot's all gone,' or whatever else. But players who late join economically profit way more than people who aren't," Watkins said. "The session, when they are fresh, does eventually get quieter, and very often they come across the remnants of fights or can maybe take out bigger drones or hit high-ticket areas more readily than other players. So that's been a very interesting thing to look at."</p>

<p>Watkins elaborated, stating that the purpose of late spawns was to make sure that maps weren't largely barren of players after around 10 minutes, keeping games fresh throughout the entirety of the game. The team had hoped that players entering a match late would be happy to pivot to alternative goals if they didn't have time to achieve what they initially wanted.</p><p>However, in limited-time events or locked rooms, Embark does acknowledge that a genuine sense of frustration is present. Watkins would confirm that the matter of late spawns is being looked into, to try and find a balance between keeping maps populated and removing that feeling of missing out on stuff at no fault of your own.</p>
<p>"With things like trials, where that is the only objective, then fine, that's kind of off the table and that really sucks, because that was the time you had set aside for it. I think trying to do more on that side of things is where I want to look next. Coming in with a dedicated purpose and that's been undercut by the late join is where I'd want to remove the pain point first."</p>
