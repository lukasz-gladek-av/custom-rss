            <p>
The UK government has said it won't tighten the law to protect video game fans who feel ripped off when a product they've bought becomes unusable - such as when a live-service game sees its servers switched off.
</p>
<p>
In a lengthy <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">statement</a>, the government said it "had no plans to amend consumer law on digital obsolescence", and that video game companies would simply continue to be bound by existing legislation.
</p>
<p>
The government's comment comes in response to a petition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">backed by the Stop Killing Games campaign</a>, which argues that current laws do not do enough to dissuade video game companies from switching off games, partly or fully, "as a form of planned obsolescence" - leaving owners unable to continue using their purchase.
</p>
<p>
"We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued," the UK government said.
</p>
<p>
"Video games sellers must comply with existing consumer law - this includes the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (CRA) and Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPR).  However, there is no requirement in UK law for software companies to support older versions of their products.
</p><p>
"Decision-making is for those companies, taking account of commercial and regulatory factors and complying with existing consumer law. There may be occasions where companies make decisions based on the high running costs of maintaining older servers for games with declining user bases."
</p>
<p>
So, what are the provisions under existing law?
</p>
<p>
The CRA requires that products are fit for purpose and sold as described to consumers, and the government has acknowleged this extends to digital content, such as games bought via Steam or the Nintendo eShop, as well as physical items such as boxed games that contain a cartridge or disc.
</p>
<p>
But the government's response here also acknowledges that "it may be difficult and expensive for businesses to maintain support" over time. Ultimately, the government simply states that "if software is offered for sale that is not supported by the provider, then this should be made clear" - although in the majority of cases, video games are sold in a working condition, only for services to be switched off later.
</p>
<p>
The CPR, meanwhile, covers the information about a product available to a consumer at the time of purchase, and is designed to ensure buyers can make informed decisions about what they buy. 
</p>
<p>
"If consumers are led to believe that a game will remain playable indefinitely for certain systems, despite the end of physical support, the CPR may require that the game remains technically feasible (for example, available offline) to play under those circumstances," the government wrote.
</p>
<p>It's interesting to see live-service battler <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">MultiVersus take this approach when it shuts down</a> - this time for good. Publisher Warner Bros has said the game will remain playable offline for those who previously bought a copy.</p>
<p>
What can you do if you think the law has been broken? You can report a suspected breach of the CPR to Citizens Advice, which can then refer complaints to Trading Standards and the Competition and Market Authority (CMA). The recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC) links into this, and from April will give the government "the power to add, amend or remove" any commercial description deemed unfair.
</p><p>
If you live outside the UK, the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/countries">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign is pushing governments to respond to the issue elsewhere, including via a similar petition to the EU. The initiative is the work of YouTuber Ross Scott, and was set up after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">Ubisoft announced it was shutting down racing game The Crew</a>.
</p>
<p>
The other side to the loss of games is the disappearance of the creative work itself - something that has been highlighted by a growing awareness of the need for proper video game preservation. Silent-era American films have a better survival rate than classic video games - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-preservation-took-steps-forward-in-2024-but-still-has-a-long-way-to-go">as Will Butler summarised today, despite some improvements there is still a lot of work to be done</a>.

            <p>The legendary, unreleased Nintendo PlayStation was due to get an unnamed 2D space shooter as its first game - and the project was almost finished.</p>
<p>It's well-documented how Sony and Nintendo first partnered on an ill-fated disc drive add-on for the SNES - a project that ultimately resulted in Sony launching the PlayStation as its own console. But in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE&amp;t=1s">MinnMax</a>, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida discussed playing the prototype Nintendo PlayStation system for the first time.</p>
<p>The first game everyone played, said Yoshida, was a 2D (or 2.5D) space shooter with assets streamed from the disc to offer richer graphics than had been seen at the time.</p>

<p>Yoshida compared the graphics to Silpheed developed by Game Arts that was released on Sega's Mega CD and used pre-rendered animation as a full motion video background.</p>
<p>Yoshida said he doesn't remember who developed or directed the game, though he wouldn't be surprised if the game still existed in Sony's archives on a CD.</p>
<p>As the Nintendo PlayStation was never released - and only one prototype seemingly still exists - Yoshida's comments are the only snippet we have of what kind of games players could have expected from the system.</p>
<p>Speaking of Nintendo, Yoshida also thought the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> announcement could have been a "larger reveal". "I am surprised there are not many surprises," he said, adding that the mouse controller was the only real shock.</p>
<p>The mouse functionality is something Yoshida can see being used for FPS games, he said. "But hopefully because it's Nintendo they'll use it in some more weird, bizarre, amazing way," he continued. "Something people wouldn't anticipate."</p>
<p>Yoshida hopes Nintendo Switch 2's full reveal in April will show us something new that's still hidden to us about the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida left PlayStation last month</a> after over 30 years at Sony.</p>
<p>He's since been discussing his time at the company and, in a previous interview, discussed how the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps-vita-almost-had-switch-like-capabilities-says-former-exec-shuhei-yoshida">PS Vita almost had Switch-like capabilities</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has reported a huge drop in sales of its hardware and software, with Switch 1 console sales down 30.6 percent year-on-year for the nine months ending 31st December.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 software sales also fell significantly - down 24.4 percent. In a statement, Nintendo blamed the scale of the drop on tough comparisons with 2023, and the launches of both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros Wonder</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sales of the aging Switch 1 have been falling for years, meanwhile, but Nintendo's latest results are worse than the company previously forecast. Alongside the impact of a poorer US dollar exchange rate, Switch 1's performance has now forced Nintendo to lower its expectations again for the remainder of the financial year.

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The company is now forecasting its net sales for the financial year ending on 31st March as 1.19tn yen (£6.16bn), down seven percent from its previous expectations, and its net profit as 270m yen (£1.39m), down 10 percent. 
</p>
<p>
It wasn't all doom and gloom. New releases included <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, which sold 3.91m copies - a good number, though predictably nowhere near the sales of either <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> or Tears of the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo also launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, which sold an impressive 6.17m copies.
</p>
<p>
And, of course, the unstoppable Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continued to sell well. It shifted another 5.38m copies over the last nine months of 2024, and now stands at a whopping 67.35m copies sold.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 now stands at 150.86m consoles sold to date, just shy of the Nintendo DS's lifetime total of 154m.  While Nintendo should squeak past that, its less certain the console can reach the record 160m sales of PlayStation 2.
</p><p>
How many more units can Switch 1 sell? Nintendo's software line-up currently looks slim, with Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition due in March, before Metroid Prime 4, which feels likely to be a Switch 2 cross-gen game, later this year.
</p>
<p>
Switch 1 still has one final Pokémon game up its sleeve, Pokémon Legends Z-A, expected to arrive this summer. But it's now clear that Switch 2 can't come soon enough. We're next due an update from Nintendo - when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">presumably we'll hear about Switch 2's release date and price</a> - in April.

            <p>Ready your wingsuits, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan scribe is set to write the Just Cause movie adaptation.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/aaron-rabin-just-cause-video-game-adaptation-universal/">The Wrap</a>, Aaron Rabin has been brought on to write the upcoming film adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a>' action series. In addition to Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan, which starred John Krasinski in the lead role, Rabin is also known for Silent River and the upcoming action-thriller film sequel, Nobody 2.</p>
<p>The writer joins <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-movie-is-on-the-way">Blue Beetle director Ángel Manuel Soto on the Just Cause adaptation</a>, which is being produced by Kelly McCormick and David Leitch through 87North's first-look deal with Universal. If that name sounds familiar, it's because the company has also produced films such as 2024's Ryan Gosling-fronted stunt comedy The Fall Guy, and Bullet Train.</p>

<p>Word of a Just Cause movie adaptation of some kind has been around for a while now. Back in 2017, Aquaman star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aquaman-jason-momoa-set-to-star-in-just-cause-movie">Jason Momoa was said to be in talks to play Rico Rodriguez</a> in a movie based on the open world action game. While his casting was not mentioned in today's report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Momoa will still get to flex his video game related acting muscles in this year's Minecraft adaptation</a>, which is set to be released in April.</p><p>But, back to Just Cause. While the plot for the upcoming film is being kept under wraps for now, the Just Cause video game series follows protagonist Rico Rodriguez, as he attempts to overthrow corrupt governments and regimes across the globe.</p>
<p>The most recent series entry was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/just-cause-4">Just Cause 4</a>. "Likeably scrappy open-world carnage," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-4-review-likeably-scrappy-open-world-carnage">Eurogamer's Just Cause 4 review</a>. "Weather effects and party balloons see a knockabout charmer return in decent form."</p>
<p>There was also a Just Cause mobile game in the works, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enixs-long-delayed-just-cause-mobile-officially-cancelled">this was cancelled in 2023</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
