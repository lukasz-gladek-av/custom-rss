            <p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has snuffed out reports that a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> movie is the "next" video game to get a silver screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Sweeney was responding to a tweet from movie industry insider Daniel "DanielRPK" Richtman, who'd suggested in a since-deleted post that whilst some studios had already "passed" on a Fortnite movie, the recent success of game-to-film adaptations like A Minecraft Movie and Super Mario Bros. Movie meant a Fortnite movie was likely to be "next".</p>

<p>"You just know Fortnite is next," Richtman wrote in the deleted tweet. "There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now."</p>
<p>Sweeney shot down the speculation with a succinct "False".</p> <div>

<p>Despite trying to clarify which specific part of the statement was incorrect, at the time of writing, Sweeney has yet to respond to Richtman's follow-up tweet (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/epic-games-ceo-fortnite-movie-response-video-game-adaptations/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Sweeney wouldn't be blamed for considering it, though; earlier today, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie has generated $301m worldwide</a> - that's £233m - on its opening weekend. That's the biggest US domestic debut of any video game movie adaptation ever, with an opening weekend of $157m (£121.5m).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adding-the-walking-dead-assets-including-negans-baseball-bat-so-you-can-make-your-own-skull-cracking-mini-games">Fortnite recently returned to the world of The Walking Dead</a> by offering up a cache of assets for players and developers to go build themed mini-games with.</p>
<p>Whilst characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl have previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins, this latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan, as well as his infamous baseball bat, Lucille. A selection of comic book-inspired walkers (zombies) will also be included.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new expansion for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>: The Board Game is on the way.</p>
<p>The Lightbringer Expansion - slated to release sometime in Q3/autumn this year - introduces three new Killers and four new Survivors, as well as new perks and "horrifying abilities".</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Level99Games/status/1908162705619390872">Lightbringer also introduces Offerings</a>, which "add a new setup to adjust the difficulty of the game to frightening proportions!", although the developer 99 Level Games stopped short of giving us the details.</p><figure>

<p>The Gatekeeper expansion is also now available. This one includes five new Survivors with unique perks and five new Killers with 10 "hauntingly-detailed miniature figurines" to customise your experience.</p>
<p>As for the video game itself? Most recently, developer Behaviour Interactive confirmed Pinhead - and his Hellraiser Chapter DLC - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-hellraiser-dlc-is-getting-yanked-from-sale-soon">would be yanked from sale on 4th April</a>.</p>
<p>As explained in Behaviour's announcement earlier this month, he's only retreating from digital storefronts - existing owners can continue playing with him after 4th April, but no new purchases of the Hellraiser Chapter DLC would be possible. Behaviour didn't explain why the DLC was being removed from sale, but as Matt posited at the time, the answer is almost certainly licensing-related.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I left feeling that The Minecraft Movie, something weirder and trickier and perhaps less formally careful, is out there somewhere, its bright potential untouched," our Chris Donlan wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Minecraft movie review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars.</p>
<p>"Minecraft hardly needs a film in the first place - it's already a phenomenon, a Pandora's Box, an essential formative aspect of the childhoods of millions of people around the world. Even so, perhaps the film this game truly deserves is, like so much else in Minecraft, still waiting to be made."</p>
<p>Lead actor Jack Black believes A Minecraft Movie is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-is-just-what-the-world-needs-right-now-says-jack-black">just the tonic the world is in need of right now</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking at the film's premiere, Black said: "What the world needs now is love, sweet love."</p>
<p>Black was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jack-black-was-initially-going-to-play-a-talking-pig">originally going to portray a talking pig</a> in the upcoming film.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
