            <p>Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> is currently sitting on a "mixed" Steam user score as players on PC report performance issues and crashes.</p>
<p>Threads on the game's Steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/">discussion</a> pages and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/top/">subreddit</a> show players are trying all kinds of things to ameliorate the issue, from uninstalling other applications, removing auto-start apps, and disabling the anti-cheats of other games.</p>
<p>"Even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885458077/">deleting all folders</a> off [the] pc and re-downloading everything" hasn't worked.</p>

<p>"Every time I click start campaign my game crashes to desktop. No problem's playing multiplayer though," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885457921/">commented</a> one player.</p>
<p>"My campaign starts. I can play for a few minutes and THAN [sic] crash to desktop without any error messages, driver all new!" said one respondent.</p>
<p>"I bought it yesterday and haven't been able to play one single game," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1938090/discussions/0/4693406471885476188/">added</a> another unhappy player. "It always closes when I try to start the game. I reinstalled it and still, I cant even load into the menu. What in the actual ****."</p>
<p>Responses include "same, hecking stupid", "still the same for me", and "it's gotta be a[n] Activision issue I hope they fix it fast it’s unfair".</p>
<p>"Same here - rubbish. Why do nobody test their games anymore before releasing them," opined one particularly unhappy commenter.</p>
<p>Another simply <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shulby/recommended/2933620/">wrote</a>: "Call of Crashes 6".</p>
<p>As yet, there's been no formal word on Call of Duty's social media channels acknowledging the issues, but of 2200+ Steam reviews posted so far, almost half have been negative, and most negative reviews seem to reference performance issues. Others are chiefly unhappy with the Call of Duty launcher.</p>
<p>Did you see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's new arachnophobia mode</a>? Activision's solution somehow makes everything even more horrifying, by robbing its zombie spiders of legs and turning them into something arguably worse.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Xbox remains committed to "bringing great games to more people on more devices", and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-annual-letter-relevance-reinvention-satya-nadella-v91xc/">LinkedIn</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said it was "a consequential time for our company, our industry, and the world", and that "ultimately, [Microsoft's] mission requires that [it] translate technology into empowerment for everyone".</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but it's not Switch 2 - so what's the point of Alarmo?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdNKD3U-4AY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem," Nadella said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the CEO also confirmed the company held publishing rights to 20 game franchises that "have generated over $1bn in lifetime revenue", and listed six of them. Whilst the recently acquired Call of Duty series is clearly one of them, it was curiously absent from Nadella's list.</p><p>"We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue - from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, Diablo, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love - where, when, and how they want.</p>
<p>"Finally, we brought four of our fan-favourite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms."</p>
<p>Yesterday we reported that Microsoft boss Nadella will earn a wallet-busting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs">$79.1m (£60.9m) this financial year, up 63 percent on his compensation for 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The huge boost to Nadella's pay in both cash and stock, announced by Microsoft earlier this week, comes after a positive year overall for the company's financial revenues - but a turbulent 12 months for its employees. 2024 has seen two mass layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 staff laid off in January</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">a further 650 Xbox employees were shown the door</a> in September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
