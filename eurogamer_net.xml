            <p>
We might not have seen a whole lot of EA's next Battlefield game beyond the few seconds of pre-alpha footage shared this week, but it turns out it's probably not all that far away. The publisher has confirmed it expect the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year.
</p>
<p>
EA shared the news as part of its third-quarter financial earnings report, saying its new Battlefield is "expected fiscal year 2026 release". That means the game should - all being well - arrive sometime between 1st April this year and 31st of March 2026.
</p>
<p>
Specifics remain limited, but EA last year confirmed the long-running multiplayer shooter series would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">returning to the modern era</a> for its next outing, and that it'd feature traditional classes and more focused maps - a clear indication it would be revisiting a tried-and-tested formula after shaking things up in 2021's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">poorly received Battlefield 2042</a>.

<p>
That announcement also brought word EA planned to launch playtests for Battlefield's next instalmnt in order to "get the community back on our side" - and that initiative, now known as Battlefield Labs, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">officially unveiled this week</a> alongside some brief early gameplay.
</p><p>
The next Battlefield game is being developed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">huge group spread across four major EA teams</a>, now working under the umbrella name of Battlefield Studios. That includes series creator DICE, splinter studio Ripple Effect, Dead Space Remake developer Motive, and Criterion - the veteran UK studio, which, as Eurogamer reported earlier this week, has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">paused work on its next Need for Speed game</a> in order to pitch in with the new Battlefield.
</p>
<p>
EA will be wanting to hit the ground running with the next Battlefield entry after it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">forced to admit 2042 "did not meet expectations"</a>. The publisher also had a difficult 2024, and last month said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard "underperformed"</a> as it lowered its financial forecast for the year.

It's been a bit of a busy one for Capcom, what with the publisher airing not one but two showcases to demo its latest wares. One half of that dealt with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> ahead of its release this month, but Capcom also had a few things to share about its other titles. So if you missed its latest Spotlight, you'll find everything announced and featured below.
</p>
<h3>Mai Shiranui's fighting pass for Street Fighter 6</h3>

We already knew Fatal Fury's Mai Shiranui was making the jump to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> this week, and we got a further look at her "agile movements, tricky projectiles, and quick attacks" in Capcom's latest showcase. Mai comes to Street Fighter 6 on 5th February PST, arriving alongside the Say Hello to Mai fighting pass - which includes customisation items relating to Mai and Fatal Fury. And as for what's next, Elena is set to complete the character roster for Year 2.

<p>
After pausing to highlight this year's Capcom Cup 11 - which will be determining the Street Fighter 6 world champion between 5-9 March - it was time to move onto Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. This seven game compilation has been out on PlayStation, Switch, and PC since last year, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-now-coming-to-xbox-following-technical-discussions-with-microsoft">technical issues held back its Xbox release</a>.
</p><p>
Those have now been resolved, however, and it's finally available digitally on Microsoft's console - gathering together X-Men Children of the Atom. Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 New Age of Heroes, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/punisher">The Punisher</a>.

Capcom's other fighting collection, the economically titled Capcom Fighting Collection 2, also has a release date. As well as a whole bunch of artwork and previously unseen development documents, this compilation features eight titles: Capcom vs SNK, Capcom vs SNK 2, Project Justice, Capcom Fighting Evolution, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-alpha-3-upper">Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper</a>, Plasma Sword, Power Stone, and Power Stone 2. It comes to PlayStation, Switch, PC, and, yes, Xbox on 16th May - and pre-orders unlock two additional songs for gallery mode.

<p>
It doesn't have a name, and it's still probably years off, but that didn't stop Capcom from re-airing the same announcement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Okami sequel trailer it aired during December's The Game Awards</a>. The publisher paired this segment with a spotlight on its demo for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review">excellent Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, plus the news that Path of the Goddess and the original Okami are both now available in a two-game bundle.

<h3>More details of Onimusha: Way of the Sword emerge</h3>

<p>

This all-new entry in Capcom's fondly remembered Onimusha series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">another Game Awards debutante</a>. For its latest airing, though, Capcom highlighted some of the key areas it's focusing on to make Way of the Sword "as captivating as possible". These include its new protagonist (plus enemies that are interesting "more than just visually"), its setting, and its combat.
</p><p>
Set in a "beautifully eerie depiction" of Edo-period Kyoto, Onimusha: Way of the Sword tells the heroic tale of a samurai who wields an Oni gauntlet, feeding it the souls of monsters roaming the land of the living. Doing so involves swordplay with a particular emphasis on the satisfaction of slicing through enemies, and players can use the souls they collect to restore health and trigger special moves. Capcom says combat will be intense when Way of the Sword arrives in 2026, but stresses it's not trying to make an "impossibly difficult" game.
</p>
<h3>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is being remastered</h3>

<p>
If 2026 is just too long to wait for your Onimusha fix, Capcom has you covered. The publisher also used its latest Spotlight to announce a remaster of 
Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, which  originally launched back in 2002. There's not a whole lot to report on this just yet, but it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC sometime this year.
</p>
<p>
And with that, we're pretty much done with the first part of Capcom's showcase. The publisher's having a digital sale across various platforms right now if you're in the mood to sample its wares at a discount, and if you missed it, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-next-open-betas-will-let-players-fight-flagship-monster-arkveld-for-the-first-time">round-up of Capcom's latest Monster Hunter Wilds' showcase elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.

            <p>
We already knew <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">two more Monster Hunter Wilds open betas were on the way</a> ahead of this month's launch, but Capcom has now shared a few more details - confirming they'll give players a chance to go up against flagship monster Arkveld for the first time.
</p>
<p>
That news came courtesy of Capcom's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFcgWM-D-oo">latest Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase</a>, which kicked things off with a fresh trailer. Notably, this offered a first look at the Iceshard Cliffs biome, which join Wilds' previously revealed Windward Plains, Scarlet Forest, and Oilwell Basin. It also unveiled new monster Hirabami - an ice-dwelling leviathan with the ability to float and a pincer-style tail - alongside confirmation of two more returning monsters: the spider-like Nerscylla and the Gore Magala, first seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> 4.
</p>
<p>
Capcom also took a few moments to hightlight some of Wilds' customisation features. It will, for instance, be possible to customise your pop-up camp, adjusting its layout, adding furniture, changing tent patterns and colours, selecting background music, and more. That's alongside the ability to alter your Seikret's colours and decorations as the story progresses. 
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, it sounds like layered armour is now automatically registered whenever players craft its original High Rank counterpart, rather than having to unlock it through other means - a boon for fashion fans. Additionally, Capcom revealed Guild Cards have been replaced with Hunter Profile, promising "more features than ever", and there's a photo mode - with settings including camera view and depth of field - that'll pause the game when used in online single-player mode.
</p><p>
That single-player online mode - designed for people who want to play without joining a lobby, and which can temporarily be turned to multiplayer by firing off an SOS flare - is one of the features that'll debut in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/obt/">two upcoming open betas</a>, alongside private lobbies and a new base camp training area for solo play.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, open beta players can confront Monster Hunter Wilds' new flagship monster Arkveld, AKA the White Wraith. This fearsome beast features "chain-like appendages extending from its wings", and will be available as part of a "special advanced quest" that's described as being "rather dangerous". February's open beta also include a new Gypceros hunt, and that's alongside the character creation, story trial, and Doshaguma hunt seen in last year's beta.
</p>
<p>
February's first open beta test runs for four days begining on 6th February at 7pm PT (that's 3am on 7th February in the UK) and its second runs from 13th-16th February, with timings remaining the same. Cross-platform multiplayer is enabled for both sessions, and players can transfer their characters (but not their progress) to the full game. Participants also get a bonus pendant and an item pass that'll unlock in the full release. Additionally, Monster Hunter World and Iceborne will receive Palico equipment and a name plate for their hunter profile if they pick up Wilds.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 28th February, and capcom has confirmed it'll start introducing limited-time event quests - featuring "special looks" as rewards - one week after its release. More updates will follow.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s Light and Darkness Saga is poised to wrap up yet again this week, as part of a "final epilogue" developer Bungie is calling Heresy.  Notably, though, the studio has warned it won't be an all-singing, all-dancing finale - or an all-talking one, at least - given the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike means it's releasing with some of its voice lines missing.

Video game performers within the US actors union SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">voted to go on strike last July</a>, after negotiations with major game companies over the use of AI failed to result in a deal. And with the strike still ongoing, Bungie has confirmed "certain voice lines" in its Heresy update won't be voiced.

"With this being our final epilogue entry for the Light and Darkness Saga, our teams have been taking great care to deliver delightful narrative beats and story content for players to enjoy," it <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25">wrote in a blog post</a> shared on its website. "Due to the on-going SAG-AFTRA strike, you may notice certain voice lines being silent in-game."

To ensure narrative content can still be followed by players, Bungie says it's enabled subtitles in the Heresy update by default. All activities with missing voice lines will feature a warning beforehand, and the studio points players toward Destiny 2's subtitle customisation and accessibility options so they can "prepare for introductory sequences impacted by this change."

It's unclear if Bungie intends to patch in Heresy's missing voice lines at a later date if an agreement is reached with SAG-AFTRA.

Back in January, SAG-AFTRA confirmed over 130 games had signed to its Interim Interactive Media Agreement, giving companies "access to [its] members under fair and equitable conditions." However, as voice actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer at the time</a>, there were still hold-outs. "There are a couple of entities who want to protect their potential profits in the future and leave lots of doors open," she explained, "and those doors could potentially hurt us a lot."
