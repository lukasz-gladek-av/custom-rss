            <p>Playdate Season 2 is set to drop in 2025.</p>
<p>Whilst no firm release date has been revealed as yet, developer Panic said it would have "a new collection of surprise games developed specifically" for its dinky handheld system next year.</p>

<p>Details on "price, the exact number of games, and the developers begins [them]" will be confirmed next year, with Panic stating that whilst the pandemic and unprecedented chip shortage up-ended plans to simultaneously release games at the exact same time the first time round, "Playdate 2 hopes to deliver on that original idea" next year.</p>
<p>Interested? Playdate owners will be able to purchase the fresh batch of games via Playdate's Catalog when it releases. All new Playdates sold will continue to have Playdate Season 1 bundled in with the price of the system itself.</p>
<p>"Since the beginning, the number one question from Playdate owners has been: 'When will there be another Season?'" says Greg Maletic, Playdate project lead.</p>
<p>"Season One was a hit - players loved games like Crankin's Time Travel Adventure and Zipper. They also loved the excitement of receiving two surprise games a week: that time-release aspect encouraged players to dive deeply into each title before the next arrived. But one thing we couldn't do with Season One was synchronize play for everyone. With Season Two, we finally can!"</p>
<p>Donlan reviewed the Playdate console back in 2022, calling it "a fascinating puzzle in itself".</p>
<p>"Attached to my memories of Mad magazine are inevitably a bunch of memories of early home computers - the C64 and Amstrad in my case - and there's a lot of that DNA here too," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">Eurogamer's Playdate review</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, there was an even bigger Playdate puzzle - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400k-worth-of-playdate-game-consoles-have-gone-missing-in-vegas">$400k worth of Playdate game consoles disappeared in Las Vegas</a>, with company co-founder Cabel Sasser calling it "a bit of a true crime drama".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After a year on sale, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is finally close to recouping the money Remedy spent on developing and marketing the game.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's latest <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf">financial results</a>, published today, note the critically-acclaimed Alan Wake 2 is still to "generate royalties", but had now "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses". 
</p>
<p>
The long-awaited sequel has struggled to sell in big numbers since its launch this time last year. The past month has seen Remedy move on from its development, following the launch of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-review">second and final expansion The Lake House</a>, and the release of the game's physical deluxe edition.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
More generally, Remedy said its development costs for the past quarter had increased due to higher development fees for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1&amp;2. Royalties decreased, meanwhile, as sales largely consisted of the aging Control and original Alan Wake.
</p>
<p>
In the long-term, Remedy said it was still committed to growing both Control and Alan Wake brands as "a key part of our future", with Control in particular set to be expanded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">recently-unveiled spin-off FBC: Firebreak</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Remedy's first full multiplayer project is set to launch as a "mid-priced game" in 2025, though will also be offered as part of both Xbox and PC Game Pass, as well as PlayStation Plus. 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what's next for Alan Wake, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Alan Wake 2's Lake House expansion provided what looks to be an intriguing tease for where Control 2's story is headed</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-drops-steam-deck-support-in-bid-to-tackle-impactful-exploits-and-cheats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Electronic Arts has blocked Steam Deck players from its cooperative shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Stating that "the openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers", EA has determined that making its game available on the Linux system - such as Apex Legends - is "a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats."</p>
<p>Developer Respawn said it was left with no choice given there is "no reliable way" to differentiate between legitimate Steam Deck players and "a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck".</p>

<p>"We're sharing today that Linux (and Steam Deck using Linux) will no longer be able to access Apex Legends," <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">said</a> community manager, Mako.</p>
<p>"Our dev team wanted to provide a bit more context into this and share some of the decision-making process that happened along the way. As mentioned in our prior <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/anti-cheat-update-082124">anti-cheat dev blog</a>, competitive integrity is a top priority for our team and there are many ways in which we're battling cheaters - this is one to add to the list.</p><p>"In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game."</p>
<p>"We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Steam storefront for Repawn's free-to-play battle royale, which used to be deemed "playable", now states in no uncertain terms that Steam Deck compatibility is "unsupported". Respawn insists this decision will not impact Apex players on Steam PC.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if any further competitive game makers follow suit.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors earlier this week during the company's quarterly earnings call. Asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends, Wilson said the battle royale is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community", suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-2-not-on-the-cards-right-now-ea-ceo-says">it may be a while yet until we see Apex Legends 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-an-early-mass-effect-easter-egg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Early on in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, BioWare offers a knowing nod to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, its other beloved role-playing game series, via a cheeky line of dialogue.
</p>
<p>
If you're yet to start playing, there's nothing particularly spoilery below - but fair warning if you'd rather encounter the Easter egg for yourself. 
</p>
<p>
You always need someone good at tinkering with tech on your team, it seems - and in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, that's elven engineer Bellara. So, when it comes to sorting out a misfiring Eluvian mirror, she's your girl.

</figure>
<p>
I spotted that chatting to Belara while she's attempting to repair the Eluvian continued to provide several lines of extra dialogue, and ultimately resulted in her offering up a catchphrase made famous by Mass Effect's immortal sidekick Garrus Vakarian. 
</p>
<p>
"Sorry Rook," Belara can be heard to say, "I'm just in the middle of some calibrations."
</p>
<p>
Garrus' insistence he be left alone to focus on his gun calibrations in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a> became something of a meme, as players continually checked in with the character in the hopes of hearing new banter, only to have the same dialogue about needing to do more calibrations pop up over and over. 
</p>
<p>
Other Dragon Age: The Veilguard players have spotted the Easter egg too - here's a quick recording:

</span></p><p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">new Mass Effect game</a> is still very much on the agenda from BioWare, though is likely still several years away. Early work has been ongoing for some time, and this week we heard from project director Michael Gamble on some of the difference between the two franchises - including how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">Mass Effect 5 will deal with the series' established visuals and tone</a>.</p>
