            <p>Blizzard is reportedly considering dropping the "2" from its squad-based first-person shooter sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>A leak purporting to share details of the shooter's 16th season not only gives us an early peek at what's coming in the new season - as well as a Gundam collaboration - but also claims Overwatch 2 skins will be renamed "Valorous", and Overwatch 1 skins as "Classic", leading some players to believe Blizzard may be about to retire the sequel's name.</p>

<p>Twitter user SkaVorah, who shared the leaked images, said: "Skin names changed. Overwatch 1 -&gt; Classic. Overwatch 2 -&gt; Valorous.</p>
<p>"Say goodbye to 'Overwatch 2', I guess. Looks like they are dropping the '2'. This suggests that the overwatch 2 name may be retired."</p>
<p>The leak is accompanied by a handful of images that purportedly depict Overwatch 2's S16 main screen, Juno Mythic, new Mythic aspects, and reveal an upcoming collab with Gundam.</p>
<p>As with most leaks, for now, all we can do is chalk this up to a rumour until Activision Blizzard confirms one way or the other. Either way, though, it's once again got players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jmbcuq/comment/mkc5qpl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">talking</a> about whether or not live-service games like Overwatch or Destiny should simply keep evolving rather than develop stand-alone "sequels".</p>
<p>We've reached out to Activision for comment and will update as/when we hear back.</p>
<p>Last month we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-is-bringing-loot-boxes-back-two-years-after-they-were-removed-from-the-series">Blizzard is reimplementing loot boxes into Overwatch 2</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-loot-boxes-will-be-withdrawn-from-sale-at-the-end-of-the-month">a little over two years after the team removed them from Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>Blizzard detailed its plans for what the studio calls "one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>'s most significant years so far", including a brief look at Overwatch 2 season 15, which is set to debut later this month, on 18th February. It is this season that will see those aforementioned loot boxes make their return to the hero shooter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetEase's surreal co-op horror, Once Human, is offering a range of goodies to tempt back lapsed players.</p>
<p>With the cross-platform mobile port set to launch next month, NetEase has emailed abandoned Once Human accounts to suggest it's "time to return", and offering "10+ cosmetics and 40,000 Starchrom" as a login bonus.</p>

<p>The email also stressed that one of the game's key launch features - server resets - can now be circumvented now, with "non-shutdown server" options available. Introduced earlier this month, these servers allow players to stay on if they'd prefer not to move on and start over when their scenario has finished.</p>
<p>"When the scenario ends afters it settlement phase, Metas can choose to remain on the server, return to Eternaland, or sign up for a new scenario," NetEase explained.</p>
<p>"Following the addition of Non-Shutdown Servers, anyone who hasn't logged in to Once Human in 30 days will be moved to Eternaland during the transition and can return when the next scenario goes live."</p>
<p>That's not all, either. Cross-character sharing has also been introduced to permit players to share resources across characters on the same account, including Blueprints, mods, weapon accessories, and cosmetics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-humans-cross-platform-test-is-now-underway-heres-how-to-play">After cross-platform tests for PC and mobile last month</a>, Once Human's mobile port - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">back in September</a> - launches on 23rd April 2025.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter held it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates, and I was one of those players that fell off after the server reset.</p>
<p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, recently said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/feedback-on-once-humans-season-2-has-been-quite-demoralising">feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
If you've been itching for an excuse to get back out on the road again - by which I mean to sit in front of the computer playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> again - there's some good news. Developer SCS Software has announced its latest state expansion - this one providing access to the highways and byways of Missouri - launches next Thursday, 3rd April.
</p>
<p>
Missouri, if you haven't been keeping tabs, brings American Truck Simulator's current US state tally up to 17, following on from Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and Arkansas. It's not the only expansion waiting in the wings, either; SCS has also previously confirmed it's working in Illinois, Iowa, and Lousiana - although these are further out.
</p>
<p>
Back to Missouri, though, American Truck Simulator's digital rendition of the Show Me State promises "vibrant cities" - including Saint Louis and its iconic Gateway Arch - as well as "diverse and beautiful" vistas, "from the rolling Ozark hills to charming small towns and vast farmlands."

<p>
"Experience the beauty of Missouri's sunrise and sunset as you drive through this picturesque landscape," SCS writes over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730870/American_Truck_Simulator__Missouri/">the expansion's Steam page</a>. "New depots and underground warehouses typical for this state add depth and realism to your trucking adventures. Engage in the heartbeat of Missouri's agriculture, transporting farm produce amidst fresh crops and rural vibes. Whether you're navigating urban streets in Saint Louis or cruising through serene countryside, Missouri offers a diverse and exciting trucking experience."
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Missouri's 3rd April arrival on Steam, SCS Software has released American Truck Simulator's 1.54 update. This introduces an overhauled cargo system - which the developer says "improves efficiency [and] saves disk space and memory by eliminating the need to store countless pre-made combinations" - and there's a more intuitive truck adjustment system, making it easier to tweak your in-cabin experience.
</p>
<p>
That's on top of NVIDIA PhysX physics implementation, which promises "more precise collision detection results and more robust behaviour during scenarios involving collisions", plus Driving Academy awards, and more - as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/537723186574262495?l=english">detailed in SCS' patch notes</a>.
