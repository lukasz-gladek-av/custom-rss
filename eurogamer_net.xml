            <p>
Streaming giant Netflix has laid off staff at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">Game Developer</a>, an unspecified number of workers were told their services were no longer required last month, which came as a shock to the indie games company.
</p>
<p>
Netflix declined to comment on the report.
</p>
<p>
Best known for its Oxenfree games, Night School Studio was bought by Netflix in 2021 as part of the streaming giant's ongoing plans to expand into interactive entertainment. 
</p>
<p>
Night School Studio's first game Oxenfree was acclaimed upon its initial launch in 2016. The side-scrolling narrative adventure story featured a group of teens caught up in some creepy sci-fi shenanigans, and received praise for its dialogue and atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The studio's 2019 follow-up Afterparty, about a character who tried to best Satan in a drinking game, did not seem to hit the same level of recognition. In 2023, Night School Studio returned to Oxenfree with a direct sequel - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-one-restless-night-of-mysteries">Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals, which was well received</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's currently unclear what Night School Studio is working on next, though today's report states that the company's layoffs will not change its product pipeline.
</p>
<p>
In October 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">Netflix closed a major internal game studio led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten</a>, and seemingly scrapped its big budget game before it was ever announced.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-celebrates-its-biggest-quarter-yet-by-putting-uk-prices-up-again">Netflix celebrated its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history by increasing UK prices yet again</a>.
