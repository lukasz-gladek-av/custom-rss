            <p>
It's probably not a huge surprise to hear at this point, but Sony has confirmed The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will - like numerous other single-player PlayStation games before it - require a PSN account in order to play when it launches for PC this April.
</p>
<p>
Sony, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">faced a major backlash last May</a> when it announced it would be making PSN accounts mandatory for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC - a move that meant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">players in the 177 countries where PSN is unavailable</a> would no longer be able to play the game they'd purchase. Ultimately, the outcry was significant enough that Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">relented</a>, but that hasn't stopped it from implementing PSN requirements for an increasing number of PC ports since then.
</p>
<p>
It's a decision that's continued to draw criticism given the requirement - which was originally justified as being necessary for the "safety and security" of online play - is now being implemented across both multiplayer and single-player games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, for instance, <em>does</em> have a multiplayer component, despite being a predominantly single-player title, while other PC releases requiring PSN - such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, and Until Dawn - are purely single-player experiences.

<p>
And now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered (as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">spotted by VGC</a>) has joined the steadily expanding list of predominantly single-player PlayStation titles - online leaderboards <em>are</em> supported in its roguelike No Return mode - requiring a PSN log-in on PC.
</p><p>
For most, that requirement is probably little more than a somewhat irritating inconvenience. But for others - namely, those based in one of the aforementioned 117 regions where PSN is unavailable - it means The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered simply won't be purchasable on PC. And given Sony previously confirmed this month's PC port of the single-player <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> also requires a PSN account, it appears this is a path it's now determine to follow.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">Epic Games Store</a> on 3rd April, the same month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">season two of HBO's acclaimed The Last of Us television series begins airing</a>. Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">called the remaster</a> - which includes the likes of increased texture resolution, increased level-of-detail distances, and improved shadow quality - the "best way to play a genuine classic" when it arrived on PlayStation 5 last year.

            <p>
Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - the swashbuckling new instalment in Sega's long-running crime saga - is getting a New Game Plus as part of a free post-launch update.
</p>
<p>
Sega shared the news during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viAEO_cMqfU">15-minute Like a Dragon Direct showcase</a> focusing on the imminent Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii. It marks a notable shift in strategy for the publisher, after last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> caused controversy among fans by making New Game Plus exclusive to its pricier Deluxe and Ultimate Editions.
</p>
<p>
Sega hasn't said much else about Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's newly announced New Game Plus mode just yet, only that it'll arrives as part of a "post release patch" at some unspecified point following the game's launch on 21st February.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's Like a Dragon stream, developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio dove a little deeper into some of Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii's systems, offering a closer look at the likes of land and sea combat, ship customisation, crew building, side activities, and more.
</p><p>
Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii  - which charts the swashbuckling adventures of fan-favourite series regular Goro Majima after he wakes up with amnesia on the remote Rich Island - will be available for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Alongside the £54.99 standard edition, Sega's releasing a £64.99 Deluxe Edition featuring the Legendary Pirate Crew Pack, Legendary Outfit Pack, Ship Customisation Pack, and Extra Karaoke &amp; CD Pack. There's also a physical Collector's Edition containing a selection of real-world gubbins, and all pre-orders receive the Ichiban Pirate Crew Set and Ichiban Special Outfit Set.
