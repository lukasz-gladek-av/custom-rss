            <p>
Well, here's another mystery to cross off the 'unresolved' list; 20 years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>'s release, Konami has finally confirmed fan suspicions that Russian spy Eva was voiced by the same actor who player Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid.
</p>
<p>
The identity of Eva's voice performer has long puzzled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3 fans, given the person listed in the game's credit - one Suzetta Mi単et - didn't appear to be a real person at all. And while vocal similarities had led some community members to believe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/5ee3b2/jodi_benson_voice_of_ariel_from_disneys_the/">Mi単et was actually a pseudonym for Ariel voice actor Jodi Benson</a> (although she was far from the only suspect), it's never been officially confirmed... until now.
</p>
<p>
In the newly released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDIWFh7nYa4">third instalment of Konami's Metal Gear Solid Legacy Series documentary</a>, charting the history of the franchise, Benson finally confirmed her Snake Eater involvement and shared a little more about how Suzetta Mi単et came to be. "When we recorded... in 2003," she explained, "just the various projects that I am affiliated with in my career are sort of family based, children-based, things like that. So it was actually [our director] Kris Zimmerman Salter; she kind of sat down with me and she's like, maybe we need to change your name."

<p>
"So she asked me, 'What was your dog's name growing up?'," Benson continued, "and I said, 'Suzette Monet'. So she's like, 'You know what, let's build on that. How about Suzetta? How about instead of Monet, the artist, we'll do Mi単et?', and I was like, 'Sounds like a deal!"
</p><p>
However, Benson - whose other roles include Barbie in the Toy Story series and Thumbelina - admits some fans still managed to suss her out, even with the pseudonym. "Seven years ago, at various conventions when we meet and greet with wonderful fans," she went on, "somebody slipped one of these wonderful games to my table, and I said, 'Why are you bringing that?', and he said, 'Because you're in it.' And I said, 'Do you <em>know</em>? Do you know my deep dark secret?'. And he said, 'Yes! I do know', and I said, 'Shh, keep it quiet!'"
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of Benson's role in Snake Eater comes as Konami continues its efforts to revitalise the Metal Gear Solid series following creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-left-konami-earlier-this-month-report">acrimonious departure</a> from the publisher back in 2015. Last year saw the launch of Konami's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-mgs-master-collection-is-anything-but-masterful">less-then-stellar Metal Gear Solid Master Collection: Volume 1</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-will-include-mgs4">Volume 2 still to come</a>. First, however, it'll be releasing  its Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-despite-its-2024-window">still doesn't have a release date</a> despite its 2024 launch window.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-spin-off-arcane-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-report-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Both seasons of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off Arcane cost a total of approximately $250m USD to create and promote, making it the most expensive animated series of all time.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/">Variety</a>, with sources telling the publication the $250m figure covered production and promotion costs for Arcane's two seasons, comprised of 18 episodes in total. The show's first nine episodes are said to have seen a production cost "north of $80m", while the second set of nine episodes - which will make up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">the show's final season</a> - reportedly had a production cost "approaching" the $100m mark.</p>
<p>Variety claims development costs were pushed up due to "a labour-intensive approach and frequent cost overruns triggered by delayed script deliveries after the second season was put into production with only a fraction of the season written".</p>

<p>In addition, League of Legends developer Riot reportedly spent $60m promoting the first season of the animated spin-off, which released on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> in 2021. Variety says this figure is more than other studios would ordinarily spend to promote a show they weren't distributing.</p><p>When the publication asked Riot about Arcane's price tag, Riot co-founder and chief product officer Marc Merrill said, "We're more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players' time." Merrill refrained from confirming or denying whether the reported $250m figure was accurate.</p>
<p>The Riot exec added the company's "ambitions in entertainment haven't changed" since Arcane's release. "We were never intending to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines," Merrill said. "What <em>did</em> change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realised that getting it right takes a lot more time than we'd originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals and teams with that in mind."</p>
<p>Arcane's second season is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-arcane-season-two-will-launch-in-november-2024">set to air on Netflix, starting 9th November</a>. As for season one, our Chris called it "a thrill, full of welcome colour and life" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-act-1-review-riots-glossy-animated-netflix-series-opens-with-a-striking-if-familiar-bang">Eurogamer's review</a> (which was based on the first four episodes), although he still had a few reservations. Following its debut, Arcane subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-league-of-legends-animated-show-arcane-wins-an-emmy-for-outstanding-animated-program">won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
