            <p>Parents have filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games for allegedly creating "the illusion of scarcity" and "FOMO" with its store items.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">Polygon</a>, two parents have filed <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">a claim with a San Francisco court</a> on behalf of their children, citing "deceptive practices employed on a massive scale in one of the world’s most popular video games [Fortnite]".</p>

<p>"Some items, such as the ultra-rare Renegade Raider outfit, were offered briefly and have not been offered in more than six years," lawyers wrote. "Others disappear only to reappear weeks later. These offerings and their schedules are subjects of intense interest to Fortnite players."</p>
<p>Taking issue with how the Fortnite Store rotates items on its digital storefront, the complaint reads:</p>
<p>"But, when their countdown timers expired, Fortnite’s Item Shop products did not disappear or return to full price. They remained available for purchase, often at the same purportedly discounted rate, for many days or even weeks at a time. This was an unlawful scheme.</p>
<p>"Fake sales with made-up expiration times are deceptive and illegal under state statutes proscribing unfair and deceptive trade practices, which prohibit misleading advertisements concerning the reasons for or existence of price reductions and representing that items have characteristics or qualities they do not have. Numerous courts have found that fake countdown timers like Epic’s run afoul of these and similar prohibitions."</p>
<p>This is likely referring to a similar lawsuit in the Netherlands. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-to-appeal-11m-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-at-children">Epic Games is currently appealing a €1.1m (£968k) fine levied by the Dutch consumer regulator</a>, which similarly accused the company of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children". At the time of writing, that decision is still pending.</p>
<p>In a statement to press, Epic Games said: "This complaint contains factual errors and does not reflect how Fortnite operates. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-and-upcoming-fortnite-shop-and-locker-changes">Last year we removed the countdown timer in the Item Shop</a> and we offer protections against unwanted purchases. This includes a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/updates-to-fortnite-purchase-cancellation-and-social-settings">hold-to-purchase mechanic</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">instant purchase cancellations</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">self service returns for shop purchases</a> and an explicit yes/no choice to save payment information.</p>
<p>"When a player creates an Epic account and indicates they are under 13, they are unable to make real money purchases until a parent provides consent. Once they do, we offer industry leading parental controls including PIN protecting purchases. We will fight these claims."</p>
<p>Earlier this week we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-suing-prolific-thief-who-stole-and-sold-player-accounts-on-an-industrial-scale">Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts</a>, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The battle to reboot Capcom's Resident Evil franchise for the big screen is over, and Sony has been crowned the victor. But while the ink may still be fresh on the deal, Sony's wasting no time: it's already confirmed its new Resident Evil movie hits cinemas on 18th September 2026.
</p>
<p>
Word of a Resident Evil movie reboot first surfaced back in January, with Zach Cregger - writer and director of 2022's wonderfully unpredictable Barbarian - attached to the project. At the time, four studios - including Warners Bros. and Netflix - were reportedly vying for the rights to the lucrative franchise, but Sony (as <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-zach-cregger-sony-release-date-1236313985/">relayed by Deadline</a>) has now won out.
</p>
<p>
The kerfuffle for Resident Evil is perhaps not especially surprising given previous live-action movie adaptations collectively generated a staggering $1.2bn at the box office. And Sony's interest is <em>particularly</em> not surprising, seeing as it was a major beneficiary of all that money under its previous deal to inflict Paul W. S. Anderson's Resident Evil films upon the masses.
</p>
<p>
And this isn't Sony's first attempt at a reboot either. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-resident-evil-movie-reboot-is-called-resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city">also released 2021's underwhelming Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</a> - but while the studio's track record with the franchise isn't exactly encouraging, there's at least some reason to be optimistic. The fact Cregger is onboard to write and direct is an intriguing proposition, especially given his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-writer-zach-cregger-will-keep-adaptation-faithful-to-the-games">apparent keenness to keep his Resident Evil adaptation faithful to the games</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"I've been a rabid fan of these games for decades, and to be able to bring this amazing title to life is a true honor,” Cregger told Deadline following Sony's win. Constantin Film is producing and co-financing the movie, with PlayStation Productions also on board.
</p>
<p>
Will Sony's latest attempt at a reboot do justice to Capcom's esteemed - and let's be honest, utterly preposterous - survival horror series? With the next Resident Evil movie now pencilled in for a September 2026 release, we'll know soon enough.
