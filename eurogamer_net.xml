            <p>A release window for Fable has just been announced at the Xbox Developer Direct.</p>
<p>Following a new gameplay deep dive, it was revealed Fable will be releasing in Autumn 2026 on the Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>
<p>In addition, Playground Games presented a bunch of info about its first open world RPG. Apparently being packed with not only British humour, but also chickens and more, you start off in Fable as a child and the first hero in Albion in a generation.</p>
<p>Tragedy strikes as the village is turned to stone (including your nan), thus kicking off your adventure. Multiple regions in Fable were briefly shown off, including Bowerstone! This classic Fable city is returning in ample size, which is very exciting.</p>

<p>Strength, Skill, and Will returns at the core of the combat system, including a variety of weapon types that'll let you engage in fights the way you desire. Ranged and magic attacks are back too, filling distinct purposes in clashes with a range of new and returning enemy types.</p><p>Yes, you can marry people and have kids too, just like in the older games. You can buy houses and businesses too and horde your wealth. This is powered by what Playground is dubbing the Living Population system. There are more than 1,000 of them, they can all be spoken and interacted with, and their lives are impacted by your actions.</p>
<p>This ties into a reputation system, as well as a morality system too. Instead of a black-and-white morality system, this new Fable appears to be taking a more complicated approach to the actions you take. So if you're rich and buy lots of stuff, some folks will dig that and others certainly won't.</p>
<p>You can also kill Dave, played by Richard Ayoade, after he turns into a giant. His corpse will stick around in the world permanently, and will bring down house prices in the area. His sister also won't like you!</p>

            <p>It's a big day for Xbox fans, with Microsoft finally offering a closer look at some of its most anticipated titles, courtesy of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-2026-everything-announced">first Developer Direct of the year.</a> And that began with a fresh peek at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, bringing word of a 19th May release date on PC and Xbox, with a PS5 launch coming later this year.</p>
<p>For this latest entry in the world-hopping racing series, developer Playground Games is shifting the action to Japan, with the studio calling Forza Horizon 6's open-world map  the "largest" it's created for the series so far. It's said to reflect the country's diversity with areas both rural and urban, modern and traditional. It's also described as being "full of verticality", featuring roads inspired by the likes of C1 Loop, Gingko Avenue, and mountain passes including Mount Haruna and Bandai-Azuma.</p>

<p>It also features <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>'s "biggest urban area yet", with Tokyo City said to be five times larger than anything seen in the series so far. It also includes multiple districts, each with their own identity. And as players explore the world, they'll be able to collect cars, houses, landmarks, and mascots, all tracked in their Adventure Journal.</p><p>In terms of progression, players start Forza Horizon 6 as tourists who, after passing qualifiers, will slowly rise through the ranks by completing races in faster cars and unlocking new wristbands. In order to move up, they'll need to participate in "spectacular" events, including classic showcase events and "thrilling" new Rush obstacles courses. And once they've finally unlocked their gold wristband, they'll gain access to Legend Island, featuring exclusive events, tracks, and areas to explore.</p>
<p>Playground says Forza Horizon 6 will feature over 550 cars at launch - ranging from classic cars to the series' latest cover vehicle, the GR GT - bringing new body kits, new Forza Aero, and the ability to paint liveries on windows. The studio also says it's better balanced its roster across all performance classes, from D to the new R Class, which is designed for track-focused cars. There's also talk of better vehicle audio and improvements to how cars are affected by the world - including new cosmetic tire wear.</p>
<p>Cars, once acquired, can be stored in Forza Horizon 6's new customisable garages (available at every player house), which can be freely decorated and have space for multiple cars. This latest game also marks the debut of The Estate, a huge mountain valley expanse where players can freely build and decorate their own abode - which is permanent and visitable by friends.</p>
<p>Speaking of pals, players can now attend open-world car meets, where they're able to show off cars and characters, download tunes and liveries, or buy copies of any car they see. And from here, they can set out to explore the world with others, playing street races or new nighttime Touge battles, which see players racing down mountain passes. Other new social events include Horizon Time Attack Circuits - accessed seamlessly as part of the world, with no loading or matchmaking.</p><p>And that's almost everything announced so far, with Playground wrapping things with a few words on accessibility features, all of which will be carried over from previous games. That's on top of a few new additions, including a customisable high-contrast mode, a proximity radar, and auto-drive for those wanting to sit back and soak up the sights without touching the wheel.</p>
<p>So to recap: Forza Horizon 6 launches 19th May on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass, with a Playstation 5 release due later this year.</p>

            <p>Beast of Reincarnation got a new gameplay presentation at the Xbox Developer Direct, as well as a Summer 2026 release window</p>
<p>The game focuses on Emma and Koo, in a post-apocalyptic 4026 Japan in which a mysterious Blight has taken over much of the world. Emma, being able to absorb this Blight inside herself, plays an important role in defeating the Beast of Reincarnation. Very exciting!</p>
<p>The game shows dynamic movement, powered through the main character Emma's vine hair that can be used to propel her upwards and build makeshift bridges. This is a core part of the plant theme of Beast of Reincarnation, with flora making up much of not only the setting, but being a gameplay focus too. There are also Malefacts, creatures fused from plants and animals.</p>

<p>There is not only Blighted plant life standing in your way, but Golems! These are mechanical bodies which humans transferred their souls into.</p>
<p>The game also features a spin on the typical real-time action RPG with Blooming Arts, which slows down the gameplay and allows you to perform a selection of special attacks. This, as shown in the presentation, allows for a large variety of gameplay styles.</p>
<p>The game can be wishlisted now, and will be available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.
