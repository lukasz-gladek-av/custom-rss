Thursday is upon us, meaning the Epic Games Store's latest freebie is now live - and to coincide with its arrival, Epic has revealed the next two games it'll be making free in seven days time.
</p>
<p>
First up for those wanting immediate amusement is developer Blowfish's Brotato, which is free to download right now until next Thursday, 5th December. It's a top-down arena shooter roguelite in which players, in the role of the titular potato, fend off alien hordes using up to six weapons at a time. Regrettably, I can't give you Eurogamer's verdict on it seeing as we haven't revewied it, but I <em>can</em> tell you it's currently rated Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam.
</p>
<p>
As for next week's Epic freebies - which take over from Brotato in seven days time - you'll be getting public transportation shenanigans in Stillalive Studios' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bus-simulator-21">Bus Simulator 21</a>, plus some family friendly sci-fi action-adventure in TT Games' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>.

The latter, if you're unfamiliar, is a Lego-ised retelling of all three Star Wars movie trilogies, combined with some exploration and collectible gathering across a large selection of open-world planets. Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips called The Skywalker Saga "humourous if simple fun" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-a-complete-but-cluttered-collection">2022 review</a>, noting, however, that its open-world elements "held less pull."
</p>
<p>
Still, if it's freebies you want, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/brotato-ed4097">Brotato is your current Epic Games Store treat</a>, with Bus Simulator 21 and The Skywalker Saga taking its place starting next Thursday, 5th December.
