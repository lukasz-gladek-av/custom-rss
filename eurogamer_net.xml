            <p>Another day, another Nintendo <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leak - this time pertaining to images that purport to be of a Joy-Con for Nintendo's Switch successor.</p>
<p>As Tom reported a little while back, we've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.</p>

<p>Now we have brand-new images of what's reported to be the new generation of Joy-Con controllers with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Reportedly originating from China, the Joy-Con shows off its new magnetic attachment as well as revised colour palette which differs from existing Joy-Cons.</p> <div>

<p>If the images are authentic - and right now, there is no proof - it looks like we can also expect enlarged SL and SR buttons, too, and maybe even a mouse-like optical sensor. You can check the photos out yourself in the X post above or in the subreddit thread embedded below:</p>

</span></p><p>If the images are not fake and do indeed originate from a Chinese factory that's manufacturing the new machines (apparently, the Joy-Con has a system serial number that is allegedly validated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hua4lu/the_leaked_photo_of_the_switch_2_joycon_has_a/">Nintendo's Check Warranty page</a>), it seems increasingly unlikely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo will exceed its self-imposed deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor.</p>
<p>When it does arrive, fans expect next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-awaited blockbuster Metroid Prime 4</a> to launch on Nintendo's new hardware.

            <p>As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs.</p>
<p>Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about "why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat" and discussed "whether or not games treat [violence] as the default".</p>

<p>Acknowledging he's had "pushback on similar answers in the past", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: "The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it".</p>
<p>"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games.</p>
<p>"This is <em>obvious</em>. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take <em>just</em> as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars," he added.</p>
<p>And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a "drop in the bucket", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, "those drops become a storm and companies will listen".</p>
<p>"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent," he added. "It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.</p><p>"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?" Cain said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-co-creator-tim-cain-says-violence-will-be-the-default-in-aaa-rpgs-as-long-as-we-keep-buying-it-companies-dont-make-them-because-they-feel-like-it-they-make-them-because-they-sell/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!"</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Amazon Fallout show? Last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins slipped back into his Ghoulish guise</a> to start filming the second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Balatro may have swept the awards this year - including securing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">a place on our 50 best games of 2024</a> list and that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-readers-top-50-games-of-2024">Eurogamer readers</a> - but developer LocalThunk has taken time to recommend other indie games that caught his eye in 2024.</p>
<p>Taking to X, LocalThunk listed his "very prestigious Golden Thunk Awards", awarding top prize to the "engrossing experience" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>.</p>

<p>Runners up were Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers - described as a "beautifully synergistic and strategic deckbuilder", LocalThunk said "people mistakenly wrote this off as a Balatro clone, but this was announced before my game ever was" - Arco, Nova Drift, Ballionaire, and Wrong Organ's exceptional Mouthwashing.</p><p>"I didn't even know this was a horror game when I started playing it at 11pm one fateful night," the developer <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1875284685150142820">said</a>. "I was hooked instantly, and both the world it created and the poignant message woven into the game stick with me vividly months later."</p>
<p>LocalThunk's stellar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">Balatro secured several accolades at last month's The Game Awards</a>, including best mobile game, best debut indie game, and best independent game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-creator-sometimes-regrets-its-success-and-wants-to-stay-anonymous">The anonymous solo developer recently said there's a part of him that regrets the game's success</a>, as he misses when creating games was just a hobby.</p>
<p>Asked in an interview if he regrets Balatro's success, he replied: "Honestly, yeah. Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways. I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
