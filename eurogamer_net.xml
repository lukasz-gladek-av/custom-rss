            <p>
Moon Studios - the developer behind the acclaimed Ori series - has announced it's now 'fully independent', having secured the publishing rights to its latest game, No Rest for the Wicked, from Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>.
</p>
<p>
No Rest for the Wicked, which released into early access last year, was originally set to be published by Private Division - the indie-focused label established by Take-Two in 2017. However, those plans changed following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">Take-Two's decision to sell Private Division to an unnamed party</a> last year, as it shifted its focus away from smaller titles.
</p>
<p>
The sale, Take-Two revealed at the time, would include the rights to "substantially all" of Private Division's live and unreleased titles, including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> - but the publisher confirmed it would continue to support No Rest for the Wicked, despite the sale.
</p>
<p>
Now, however - some four months after Private Division's divestment - Moon Studios has announced it's secured the publishing rights to No Rest for the Wicked from Take-Two Interactive, insisting the move will allow it to "execute our vision without restrictions." The developer's announcement coincides with a major update for the action-RPG, which will have been in PC early access for a year next month.
</p>
<p>
As for Private Division, a report in January claimed it had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">purchased by Texas-based private equity firm Haveli Investments</a>. More notably, however, the firm was said to have struck a deal with ex-Annapurna employees - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">departed the acclaimed indie publisher en masse last year</a> following a dispute with owner Megan Ellison - to fund a new company that would distribute former Private Division titles. These include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series (despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">closure of its development team</a>), upcoming Lord of the Rings farming game Tales of the Shire, and Pok√©mon developer Game Freak's new action-adventure IP.
