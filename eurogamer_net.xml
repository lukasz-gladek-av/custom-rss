<ul>
<li>8K resolution support</li>

            <p>
The Japanese version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been hit by censorship restrictions from the country's ratings board. 
</p>
<p>
In Japan, Ubisoft will now release a version of the game without the ability to behead your enemies or slice off their limbs.
</p>
<p>
These changes - and others listed below - will now mean the game will be granted a Z rating, which is the equivalent of an 18, by  Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organisation (CERO).

"Regarding differences in content between the overseas (North America, Europe) and Japanese versions of Assassin's Creed: Shadows, the version sold in Japan of Assassin's Creed: Shadows (CERO: Z) will have some differences in in-game content in order to comply with the regulations of the certification organisation," Ubisoft revealed in a statement posted to its Japanese <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1882611785775174070">social media account</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The option to switch amputation on/off from the game settings has been removed, and amputating the neck and limbs of enemies during gameplay is now always impossible."
</p>
<p>In other words, all versions of the game have the ability to turn off more graphic violence. But, in Japan, these options will be locked down, and limbs will always remain attached.</p>
<p>
There are other changes, too. Ubisoft has altered the "amputated surface of the body", presumably to make it less graphic. 
</p>
<p>
"The representation of some Japanese voices played in the overseas version (North America and Europe) has been changed," Ubisoft added, without further explanation.
</p>
<p>
Japan's rating board has long been squeamish around the issue of violence in video games, with limb removal an issue in other games previously such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cod-black-ops-censored-in-japan">which was censored</a>) and the recent Dead Space Remake (which was denied a release altogether).
</p>
<p>
The issue sparked a notable response last year from a Japanese EA executive, after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-will-be-uncensored-in-all-regions">Japanese version of Stellar Blade was allowed a rating despite showing severed limbs</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"What's going on CERO?" EA's Japanese boss Shaun Noguchi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-uncensored-release-in-japan-prompts-criticism-of-rating-system/">wrote at the time</a>. "You denied our Dead Space a rating because it included cross-sections of severed body parts and internal organs, but here we have both cross-sections and insides on display passed off with a CERO D [17+] rating. I find this hard to accept..."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">hands-on with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which our Katharine described as the series' "biggest shake-up of the series in years".

            <p>An unannounced, under-wraps Warhammer RPG - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unannounced-warhammer-rpg-cancelled-towards-end-of-last-year-report">that last week was revealed to have recently been cancelled</a> - was based on Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Eurogamer can confirm. </p>
<p>Last week, former developers working at new studio Thought Pennies were spotted as having departed the studio after work on a Warhammer game was ceased. Now, speaking with Eurogamer, the company has confirmed it was developing a Warhammer: Age of Sigmar RPG, in collaboration with Games Workshop and Nexon.</p>
<p>"While the partnership worked well and we got a lot of good input from Nexon, Nexon made a strategic change," a Thought Pennies spokesperson told Eurogamer. "Late last year we agreed to end the project and Nexon is helping as a board member."</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211208005672/en/Nexon-and-Games-Workshop-Group-Announce-Licensing-Agreement-on-Warhammer-Age-of-Sigmar">press release from 2021</a>, which first revealed Nexon and Games Workshop was teaming up to work on a Warhammer game, the two companies stated they would create a "new PvE social multiplayer" game that would "feature a socially interactive player-versus-environment world supported by Nexonâ€™s world-class Live Operations for sustaining the fun with new content and service".</p>
<p>The project was being made for PC, consoles and mobile platforms. Developer Thought Pennies was not mentioned in this release.</p>
<p>"It is an era of war. The Mortal Realms have been despoiled. Ravaged by the followers of the Chaos Gods, they stand on the brink of destruction," the 2021 description reads. "Players will command the war hosts of the God-king Sigmar and his allies as they fight to reignite hope and bring order back to the realms. Each season, players will collect characters and enter new realms. Each character comes with unique options, stories and gameplay. Players will be able to customise their characters and work cooperatively to guide how sections of the Realms are retaken."</p>

<p>Earlier in the month, Games Workshop said it is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year</a> (pictured above).</p>
<p>In addition, in December, Games Workshop and Amazon Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-officially-coming-to-film-and-tv-screens-with-amazon-studios">officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
