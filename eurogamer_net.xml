            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia's enormous new update, Second Act, is here.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">We already knew it would function as something of a full relaunch</a> but today Ubisoft made it official, calling it The Rogue Prince of Persia's "biggest update since launching in early access on Steam and GeForce back in May 2024".</p>
<p>Along with upgraded art work and a changed colour palette, players can expect the wartime city of Ctesiphon to come to life, along with a "significant transformation regarding the Prince, whose colour has been changed from purple to a tone that not only better fits the new direction, but also its genre, setting, and the Prince of Persia series in general".</p>

<p>That said, the "Purple Prince" will still be playable when a set of playable skins arrive in an upcoming update.</p>
<p>"With the Second Act update, players will be able to explore brand-new biomes, the Mines and the Craftsmenâ€™s District, face off against new bosses, and experience a fresh narrative act, while Act 1 received extensive polish," Ubisoft explains. "Additionally, there are new enemies to encounter and many quality-of-life additions, such as difficulty re-balancing, multiple save slots, spirit cinder &amp; gold automatic pick-up and more."</p>
<p>This update also adds of German, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish localisation.</p>
<p>"I think it works because the game has a charismatic star," Chris Donlan wrote of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-definitely-still-room-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia upon its early access launch</a>. "Not charismatic in what he says, perhaps, but in what he does and how he moves. I just love to watch him run."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rollercoaster-tycoon">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a> Classic is heading to Switch at the start of next month.</p>
<p>As announced by Atari, the theme park sim will arrive on 5th December, with the Switch version joining its availability on mobile and PC.</p>
<p>The re-release pairs the original RollerCoaster Tycoon with its sequel, bringing updated UI and controls.</p>

<p>These two games are generally considered the best in the series, and even if they're showing their age, their simplicity is charming compared to more recent sim games.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's great timing from Atari just after the release of Frontier's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, a game with far more modern enhancements.</p>
<p>Atari is the sole publisher of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, after<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-bought-rollercoaster-tycoon-3-for-7m"> acquiring the rights to the third game from Frontier</a> earlier this year. Atari boss Wade Rosen said at the time this would bring "new opportunities for Atari" and "benefits to the fans of games across the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise".</p>
<p>This Switch release of RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic (not the third game) is the only follow-up news so far, so it's unclear what's in store for the rest of the series.</p>
<p>For an alternative, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-theme-park-management-sim-parkitect-hits-playstation-and-xbox-this-week">Parkitect was released on PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> earlier this year, following its previous PC release. It's a classic take on the theme park sim genre, akin to RollerCoaster Tycoon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
