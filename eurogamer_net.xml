            <p>Hyper-realistic food was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a>'s strengths, and many RPGs since then have really committed to perfecting the art of beautifully rendered cooking and dishes. Up next, it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> studio Game Science is upping its food tech for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">Zhong Kui</a>, the sequel of sorts that was revealed last year.</p>
<p>Today, 10th February, the developer surprise-dropped a "Chinese New Year Special" video that contains over six minutes of in-game footage from Black Myth: Zhong Kui... unless it's not really about the game we'll get at some point in the future. Watch it here:</p> <figure>

<p>Yes, that seems like an odd way to market a heavily hyped game, but since the action-RPG is still years away, there's no proper vertical slice ready to be shown. I guess it's neat to have a major studio putting something together for the fans, even if it's just a fancy tech showcase of food and demons casually hanging with chill humans... and sharing body parts with them to make the dishes special. I'll admit the blend of cozy and unsettling vibes works.</p>
<p>The very last scene teases someone who's about to be fed by their captors, but how are we supposed to be excited or theorize? We know nothing about the actual game yet. Even the final message underlines the video is a "Year of the Horse Special" that's unrelated to the main storyline and non-canon, so what do those seconds even mean?</p><p>In any case, there's plenty of symbolism and tradition to chew on here, especially if you're familiar with Chinese culture. Those in love with cutting-edge graphics will have plenty to admire too, and I personally always enjoy when developers go extra hard on food and assets most people don't pay much attention to.</p>

            <p>Remedy Entertainment, best known for narrative-rich single player games like Control and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, has got itself a new CEO. His name is Jean-Charles Gaudechon, a former EA executive and senior vice president of fantasy sports betting platform Sleeper.</p>
<p>While at EA, Gaudechon spent 2012-2013 as studio head and executive producer at EA's free-to-play studio, helping to direct live service development at the industry giant. He'd later return to the company after a stint away, concluding his EA career as vice president and group GM of EA Asia Studios.</p>
<p>Fast forward to March 2024, and he'd help found the "sports super app" Sleeper, on which users can draft fantasy sports teams and make "sleeper picks" (bets) on athletes performances, team performances, etc. He is now the CEO of Remedy, quite the stark shift indeed.</p>

<p>This news, <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/?publicationId=c86bbf74-7d56-4b1e-bc4d-56f406fc8258">announced on the Remedy investors website</a>, came alongside a statement by Remedy Chairman of the Board of Directors Henri Österlund. He wrote: "I am delighted to announce the appointment of Jean-Charles (JC) Gaudechon to lead Remedy into a phase of profitable growth. His proven history in growing gaming franchises and successfully leading international studios is an excellent fit to the current stage of Remedy's business. Under JC's leadership, we are well-positioned to significantly accelerate growth, guide Remedy towards greater independence through self-publishing, and deliver sustained value to our players, partners, and shareholders"</p><p>Gaudechon also added his own statement to investors, the wider company, and world as the new CEO: "I'm excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time," Gaudechon wrote. "The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value. Remedy has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry's future. We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way. I will be moving to Finland with my family and I'm incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio."</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps Gaudechon will be some sort of fiscal Ted Lasso, coming in and keeping what's beloved about Remedy intact while bringing in that ever-elusive growth. It is no secret that Remedy Entertainment is indeed in need of more money. Alan Wake 2, while adored and critically acclaimed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">didn't make a profit until well after its release</a>. Recently, its cooperative shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">FBC Firebreak missed the mark to such a degree</a> that Remedy had to issue a profit warning to investors. It is perhaps little mystery that investors would welcome a growth-focused CEO into their arms.</p>

            <p>The next 2D fighter from Arc System Works is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. Published by Sony, it's also set to launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3787240/MARVEL_Tkon_Fighting_Souls/">Steam</a>, so we're not counting it as a true PS5 exclusive. That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-preview">it no doubt could become one of PlayStation's surprise hits</a> when it finally drops, and the final details are promising an adequate offering of modes and characters.</p>
<p>Though Steam has since scrubbed the description which likely went up early, social media accounts like <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a> screen-capped it all when someone, somewhere, hit the button early:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The 4v4 tag team fighter will seemingly have 20 characters at launch, which is below what many hoped for, but well above <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">2XKO</a>'s disappointing initial roster, for example. For a more traditional fighter, I'd say 20 heroes and villains are more than fine - but since Marvel Tokon's whole thing is its 4v4 battles, team builds might get repetitive soon (at least until more Marvel icons start arriving).</p>
<p>On a more positive note, 64-player lobbies sound great and follow the recent trend of amping up the social element of these games outside of old-school matchmaking. Ask around and it's evident this is the type of feature which can elevate a fighter from niche to enduring mainstream heavyweight. It remains to be seen how many player-versus-players will be there at launch, but we might be off to a great start there.</p><p>As for the single-player portion, an Episode Mode will elaborate on the game's "lore" and team dynamics so it's not just a meet-up of Marvel characters duking it out. Personally, I'm not expecting a meaty story mode from it, but if it can rise above the utterly forgettable solo modes found in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-king-of-fighters-xv-review">The King of Fighters XV</a>, that will be more than enough. In any case, let's hope the offline options go beyond a thin campaign and local versus. Not every fighter can be as offline-friendly as the Mortal Kombat series, but it'd be nice if developers pushed harder on that front.</p>
<p>These leaked details on Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls' launch offerings arrives right after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">PlayStation setting a 12th February State of Play stream</a>, so there's almost no doubt the game will have a slot there, probably locking a release date, too. We'll find out on Thursday.</p>
