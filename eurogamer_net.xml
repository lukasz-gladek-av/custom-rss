Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has talked a little more about the publisher's recent decision to delay the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> into May next year, saying the game was pushed back to ensure developer Rockstar could 'achieve its creative vision with no limitations'.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6's release was narrowed down to "fall" 2025 last May, and Take-Two was still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">publicly sticking to that target as recently as February</a> this year, despite persistent rumblings of a delay. However, all things changed earlier this month when Rockstar announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">shifting GTA 6's release to 26th May next year</a>, saying it needed "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."
</p>
<p>
A few weeks on and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has now shared his own perspective on the delay decision. "As we get closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">told IGN</a>, "the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear. In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach."

"And while of course, delays pain me â€” how could they not?," Zelnick added, "the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection." As to the possibility of a further delay for Grand Theft Auto 6, Zelnick implied that was unlikely to happen when asked. "I think historically when we set a specific date," he noted, "generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it."
</p>
<p>
While GTA 6's delay is perhaps not the absolute ideal for Take-Two, the company still has a busy release slate heading into the new financial year, with the likes of Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, and new NBA 2K and WWE 2K instalments on the way. Fans, meanwhile, have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">new trailer to pore over</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-trailer-2-analysed">there's a lot packed in there</a>.
