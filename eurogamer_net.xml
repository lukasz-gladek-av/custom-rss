            <p>Nintendo has denied reports that it has been lobbying Japanese lawmakers against generative AI, insisting it "has not had any contact with the Japanese government" about the highly controversial emerging tech.</p>
<p>The denial comes after Japanese politician Satoshi Asano <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974758362157035573">posted an apology on social media</a> after claiming Nintendo was lobbying the Japanese government. This was followed by <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974758362157035573">a further apology</a> earlier today, after which Satoshi deleted the original post.</p>

<p>While the megacorp typically declines to comment on speculation, on this occasion Nintendo was keen to shoot the rumour down and stressed that while it was not lobbying, "whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights".</p>
<p>"Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI," the company wrote.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-discusses-ai-use-says-games-will-always-have-a-human-touch">Nintendo recently shared its thoughts on generative AI, and assured fans that its games will always have "a human touch"</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> president Doug Bowser saying: "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers, their artistic capabilities, their insight into how people play. So, there's always, <em>always</em> going to be a human touch, and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p><p>Nintendo's position is at odds with many of its contemporaries. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>, with developers admitting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI</a> for the ill-fated shooter Foamstars, Professor Layton studio <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20231213-24326/">Level-5</a> has used AI tool Stable Diffusion, and even <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/">Capcom</a> has admitted experimenting with generative AI too. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999104/20250808042/">Sega</a> also has an in-house AI team.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), the organiser of Tokyo Game Show, showed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in their development</a>.</p>

            <p>A third-party customer service system used by Discord's support teams has been hacked, compromising some user personal data, including government IDs.</p>
<p>Discord has written to some users confirming that on 20th September, personal data was obtained by "an unauthorised party" which gained limited access, including "a small number of government‑ID images such as driver's license and passports from users who had appealed an age determination".</p>
<p>Discord – which is used by millions of gamers across the world – says information shared by users with its Customer Support or Trust and Safety teams was "exposed", including real names, Discord name, email, contact address, limited payment information – including payment type, last four digits of credit cards, and purchase history – IP addresses, and messages and attachments sent to customer support. Limited corporate data, including training materials and internal presentations, was also exposed.</p>
<p>Full credit card numbers or CCV codes, Discord activity or messages, and passwords or authentication data were reportedly not compromised, but Discord has not revealed how many of its millions of users may have been impacted.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">blog</a> post, Discord insisted that just "a limited number of users who had communicated with customer support" were impacted, and the authorised party did not gain access to Discord directly. It also claimed to have taken "all appropriate steps" by notifying data protection authorities, law enforcement, and "reviewed our threat detection systems and security controls for third-party support providers".</p><p>"Looking ahead, we recommend impacted users stay alert when receiving messages or other communication that may seem suspicious. We have service agents on hand to answer questions and provide additional support," Discord said. "We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the inconvenience and concern this may cause."</p>
<p><em>An earlier edition of this story referred to the breach as "authorised", not "unauthorised". This has been amended. Apologies for any confusion.</em></p>
