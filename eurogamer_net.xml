            <p>There are nearly as many people playing Valve's unreleased and invite-only game Deadlock on Steam as there  are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">people playing the resurgent Overwatch</a>. Deadlock was actually the sixth most played game on Steam in January in the US, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcdhiexi62r">according to stat-tracking company Circana</a>. It's an indication, if such an indication was needed, that Valve's next multiplayer game is shaping up to be something big.</p>
<p>Deadlock is a team-based hero shooter, hence the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> comparison, but it's also a MOBA. It's a mash of Valve's other games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, really. You pick a kind of 1930s gangster-inspired fantasy hero, then you set about earning cash while killing computer-controlled characters in 'lanes' so you can buy upgrades and power yourself up, and overwhelm the opposing team of players.</p>
<p>Deadlock was softly launched a while ago, in the autumn of 2024, and being Valve's next game, naturally had a lot of interest. But player numbers dropped off until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-major-update-new-characters-patrons">in January this year, a large Old Gods, New Blood update was released</a>. This brought six new characters to the game along with a new faster game mode, and overhauled a large part of the overall experience.</p>
<p>The effect of the update was dramatic, propelling concurrent player numbers from a highpoint of around 30,000 at the start of the year, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a>, to a peak of 125,000 concurrents 24 hours ago. Overwatch, by comparison, has a current peak Steam playerbase of 134,000.</p>

<p>Deadlock's numbers are all the more remarkable because you can't freely access the game. You need someone currently playing to invite you which, granted, is fairly easily done - plenty of streamers and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NyPdE6mL9s">Deadlock-specialising creators are handing codes out</a> - but it isn't open access. It's also not being advertised or pushed by Valve in any way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">The Deadlock Steam page</a> doesn't have much information on it at all. Yet, people are flocking to it.</p><p>In many ways, it's not surprising. Valve's pedigree is unquestionable, with Team Fortress 2 arguably creating the hero shooter - a formula Blizzard borrowed and honed for Overwatch - and Dota 2 being one of the most popular MOBAs (and games full stop) in the world today. Dota 2's current peak concurrent player base is 830,000, which is staggering. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">the second most played game on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Deadlock currently has no release date, nor is there any word when it will be available openly to test and play.</p>
