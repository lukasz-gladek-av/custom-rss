            <p>
Microsoft has reportedly made another round of layoffs, this time affecting a "small" number of employees spanning its security, experiences and devices, sales, and gaming divisions.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-hit-security-devices-sales-gaming-2025-1">according to Business Insider</a>, which - citing "people familiar with the matter" - reports impacted employees were notified of the layoffs on Tuesday. A Microsoft spokesperson told the publication a "small" number of job cuts had been made, but did not specify a figure. It also said the move was unrelated to recent job cuts targeting underperforming employees.
</p>
<p>
The news follows several rounds of layoffs at Microsoft over the last year. In January 2024, the company announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">cutting 1900 jobs across its gaming division</a>, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">further 650 cuts</a> being made in September. Eurogamer understands Microsoft's latest layoffs have impacted a small number of gaming employees, but that the division wasn't specifically a focus.
</p>
<p>
In response to a request for comment on Business Insider's report, a Microsoft spokesperson told Eurogamer, "Organisational and workforce adjustments are a necessary and regular part of managing our business. We will continue to prioritise and invest in strategic growth areas for our future and in support of our customers and partners."
</p><p>
Microsoft's latest layoffs follow a devastating 2024 for the games industry, in which around 13000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs. Those layoffs have continued into the new year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">numerous job cuts having been reported</a> amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">studio closures</a>. Last year, Chris Dring shared his thoughts with Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">why these layoffs are happening</a>.
