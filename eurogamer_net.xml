            <p>No matter how you feel about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders</a>' use of AI for NPC voices, it's hard to deny the game has been a massive success that's "cracked open" the extraction shooter subgenre for casual players and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-games-performed-really-well-on-steam-last-year-shaking-the-dominance-of-the-same-old-live-service-games">even harpooned some older live service whales</a>. Now, it's hit a new milestone which positions it as one of the new online shooters to watch out for.</p>
<p>On 13th January, developer Embark Studios announced <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620?s=20">via its social channels</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has recruited over 12 million players to date. That means over 12 million copies of the game sold, as the studio made a "premium entry" bet which has paid off big time. <a href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/arc-raiders-sold-over-12-4-million-units-in-just-ten-weeks/">GamesMarkt</a> shared a more specific number: 12.4 million copies sold in just 10 weeks. Moreover, the game reached "960,000 concurrent players on all platforms in January 2026."</p>
<p>For Embark Studios, the most important fact might be that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">player retention has been notable</a>, with the game holding its ground against <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players">Battlefield 6's massive success</a> and capturing much of the attention that normally would've gone towards Call of Duty after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> was a disappointment that many longtime fans feared.</p>
<p>To celebrate, Embark Studios is gifting everyone "who logged in since launch till 23:59 CET, 13th Jan" a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool that will be added to their inventory upon logging into the game. The update is rolling out today.</p>

<p>We could also argue Arc Raiders is partially responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Steam setting a new concurrent users record earlier this month</a> as it's managed to comfortably sit among olden heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-update-wipes-nearly-2-billion-off-skin-market-value-by-making-fancy-knives-and-gloves-easier-to-get">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">DOTA 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>. That's no small feat.</p>
<p>With PlayStation and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Marathon</a> seeking to capture at least part of the same crowd's attention come March, more players being into PvPvE shooters after Arc Raiders could be a surprise blessing for the beleaguered game.</p>
<p>So, what's the next stop for this newborn franchise? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-sure-sounds-keen-to-make-an-arc-raiders-film">A movie, probably</a>.</p>

            <p>The dispute between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> studio Rockstar and over 30 of its former developers rages on, with those affected denied interim pay by a UK tribunal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 12th January, a judge ruled against making Rockstar to pay interim relief to its former developers, which the studio fired in October of last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">in a move called by many "union busting"</a>. Rockstar itself has claimed the affected staff were let go due to gross misconduct, but this didn't appease UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB). Soon after the dismissals, the organisation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a>, noting that all those affected were members of a union.</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-games-and-iwgb-clash-at-preliminary-hearing-for-fired-gta-6-workers">IWGB asked a judge to grant the fired developers interim relief</a>, which  is a method of financial support for people awaiting a full hearing. If the motion had been granted, the fired employees would have returned to Rockstar's payroll. However, it was not, though the union and its members remain undeterred in the fight for justice.</p>

<p>"We are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar's flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful," the IWGB said in a statement shared with Eurogamer.</p><p>It added "the judge stated in her ruling that: 'There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings'". The IWGB additionally said Rockstar had broken multiple procedural guidelines with its firing of the affected employees. This included the lack of disciplinary meetings, employees being unable to appeal "until six weeks later", and zero evidence of an investigation.</p>
<p>"Comments relied on by Rockstar's lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using a private union Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring'," the union said. It added the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">Discord members Rockstar claimed were journalists and competitors were in fact union officials and employees who had recently left the company</a>. The IWGB said those in the server were still bound by the same non-disclosure agreements as then-current employees.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the judge's decision to deny interim relief to the former Rockstar employees, the IWGB said it knew this was going to be a long shot, and had it been secured it would have been "unprecedented" for a group of this number. However, the union said this latest development does not mean that "Rockstar will not be found guilty of unfair dismissal" when the case goes to trial. IWGB president Alex Marshall stated the union is "more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar's calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful", despite the refusal for interim relief.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an anonymous former Rockstar employee said: "This decision to fail to award [interim relief] is a gut-punch to everyone legitimately engaged in trade union activities. The real world consequences of this are forcing valuable people to leave this country, upending their families and destroying their lives, and all because of the actions of a ruthless, uncaring employer's quest to crush a trade union." </p><p>They added they will "continue to fight" in order to clear their name, and the names of other affected employees. "This decision, while not in our favour, is not an exoneration of Rockstar's behaviour and actions. Merely a stumbling block on the road to justice," they closed.</p>
<p><strong>[UPDATE 11.43am]</strong> A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> has just shared a statement with Eurogamer regarding this week's rejection of interim relief, which you can read below:</p>
<p>“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union's application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar's position throughout.</p>
<p>"We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing."</p>

<p>In addition to the IWGB's legal case against Rockstar, over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">200 employees at Rockstar have signed a letter to management condemning the firing</a> of their fellow staff members.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">dismissals were also discussed in the UK Parliament last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK prime minister Keir Starmer has since called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning"</a>. The PM added that ministers would be looking further into the dismissals at Rockstar.</p>

            <p>Much has been written about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a>'s handling of its lead female character, the culture war surrounding it, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/stellar-blade-cuts-unintentional-reference-to-racial-slur-3750534">developer Shift Up's several eyebrow-raising missteps</a> as the game broke through into mainstream consciousness. Regardless, the PS5 title was a big success and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">a sequel is now in development</a>. Before we even get a first look at it, however, a new storm appears to be brewing.</p>
<p>AI, generative or not, is the talk of town, and by town I mean the entire games industry. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Larian tries to toy with gen-AI while not using the tech for final assets</a> and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-cancerous-manor-lords-publisher-hooded-horse-wants-to-avoid-genai-like-the-plague">publishers like Hooded Horse unequivocally dunk on studios using it</a>, the debate refuses to go away. 2026 may be defined by the widespread adoption or rejection of AI tools, and hopefully, by people finally figuring out the difference between tools that have been around for a while and the controversial gen-AI. The well has already been poisoned, sadly.</p>
<p>Shift Up CEO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> director Hyung-tae Kim is bullish on the whole package, it seems. During a national briefing on South Korea's 2026 Economic Growth Strategy, the developer claimed it's "an essential tool for going up against large competitors like China on a global level". <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">Automaton</a> reported on (and translated) the news first shared by <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1770030">GameMeca</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who's been paying attention to the games industry for the last few years is well aware of China's increasingly large presence, with behemoths like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chinese-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-reaches-two-million-players-in-just-24-hours-of-global-release">Where Winds Meet</a> making waves and rising to compete against the Japanese and Western giants that have typically dominated the market. Meanwhile, South Korea has started to exit the MMO-oriented creative trends and begun to punch above its weight with triple-A projects. It comes as no surprise to see more and more developers in the country betting on AI (even if it's not of the <em>generative</em> kind) as its ambitions grow larger, too.</p><p>Kim "argues that widespread use of AI will not result in people losing their jobs, because competing with major industries like China and the US will require not only utilising all available manpower, but also making everyone proficient in AI". Press X to doubt, as immediately, he stated one person could "perform the work of 100 people" with the assistance of these tools.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the adoption of AI assistance into the general pipeline really will make games bigger, better, or more profitable for publishers, but either way, it seems like the conversation around this topic - and the consequences of its general usage - will not go away any time soon.</p>

            <p>Capcom has announced a Resident Evil showcase, which will give us all a closer look at what the team has in store for its upcoming release, Requiem.</p>
<p>The showcase itself will take place this Thursday, 15th January (that's our Lottie's birthday, if you want to send her a message :D). It will begin at 10pm UK time, which for those across the pond is 2pm PST / 3pm MST / 4pm CST / 5pm EST.</p>

<p>As for what we will see, Capcom has assured gameplay and news for Resident Evil Requiem. The showcase will run for roughly 12 minutes, <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/showcase/en-us/">the studio has said</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to be released across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a> on 27th February. Along with Grace Ashcroft  - who is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft, a character that featured in spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-outbreak">Resident Evil Outbreak</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">fan favourite Leon Kennedy will also be returning for Requiem</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-leak-points-to-a-second-playable-character-and-it-isnt-leon">another potential returning face from the series that could show up</a>, if earlier store page leaks are to be believed (I won't spoil it here, don't worry).</p>
<p>So, will you be joining in for the Resident Evil Requiem showcase this Thursday?</p>

<p>Last year, Capcom assured its Resi fans the team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-pc-woes-like-monster-hunter-wilds-says-capcom">working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC</a>, after a multitude of technical issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. So, that bodes well!</p>
