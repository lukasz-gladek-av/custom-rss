            <p>The animator behind the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film credits has detailed the creation of its low poly character models, including the first ever Classic Shadow.</p>
<p>Each of the Sonic films has had a retro-themed credits sequence, gradually moving from 2D pixels to the low poly 3D models in this film, which were based on arcade game Sonic the Fighters.</p>
<p>However, with the inclusion of Shadow the Hedgehog in the film, this provided an opportunity to create a Classic Shadow model for the first time.</p>

<p>Back in 2023, Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka told GameInformer (thanks <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/takashi-iizuka-says-it-again-shadow-will-not-appear-in-classic-sonic-games-r1352/">Sonic Stadium</a>) during a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> preview that Shadow would not be mixing with classic characters.</p>
<p>"Shadow is from the Modern series of characters and gameplay that we have introduced," he said. "The Classic series exists before the Modern series, so they haven't met at that time. There's no relationship, so we won't be bringing Shadow into the Classic series."</p>
<p>Then, with last year's Sonic x Shadow Generations,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia"> Iizuka confirmed to Eurogamer before its release</a> there would be no Classic Shadow.</p>
<p>Yet animator suitNtie managed to do it, which he's detailed in a new video discussing the creation of the credits.</p>
<p>"[Shadow's design] is something that is probably one of the most important things to me on the project," he said.</p>
<p>"It feels almost like [Sega is] allergic to this idea completely. So I was really sceptical if I was going to be able to."</p>
<p>The model itself was based on the same used for Sonic, but with a few tweaks: the colour scheme, of course, as well as the shoes and eyeliner.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>These low poly models are such a thrill for fans | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sega / Paramount / Picturemill</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"But then it came down to the torso - what I would consider Classic Sonic's main thing is the torso and also the proportions," he continued, pointing to the model's round body design. "Will they want the more normal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>-style body, instead of this Classic one?</p>
<p>"If you watch the movie you see that it's Classic Shadow! I got Classic Shadow in an official Sonic product!"</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the video, suitNtie discusses how he got the job. At the end of 2023 he was laid off from his job as a VFX artist in the games industry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">similarly to so many employees</a>. It's great, therefore, to see such a success story emerging from its aftermath.</p>
<p>In addition to the video, the animator has shared a thread on X discussing some extra titbits, including how he tried to sneak a Dreamcast console into the background.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo lawyers reportedly visited accessories manufacturer Genki on the CES trade show floor last week, a reporter has claimed, after videos of its dummy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console went viral.
</p>
<p>
High profile French tech journalist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuKVsoHCgXk">Julien Tellouck</a> was one of several reporters to stop by Genki's CES booth last Friday, when he claimed the company had been dropped in on by Nintendo lawyers.
</p>
<p>
Images of Genki's mock-up Switch 2 unit - which the company's chatty CEO initially claimed was based on the actual final design of Nintendo's under-wraps console - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">spread across the internet last week</a>. Clearly, Nintendo noticed. 
</p>

<a aria-label="Newscast: Everything we learned this week about Switch 2 - and what is going on with Ubisoft?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J1BtAZoo1S0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
According to Tellouck, though, Genki simply told Nintendo it had never signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the company and therefore hadn't technically broken any rules.
</p>
<p>
"I talked to the guy from Genki just behind me, he told me that Nintendo had stopped by with lawyers - they had nothing to be reprimanded for because they had never signed a paper with Nintendo - no confidentiality agreement, no NDA," Tellouck said. "So the Japanese brand are quiet. 
</p>
<p>
"On the other hand, [Genki] told me that they were sure that the Nintendo Switch 2 - except for a few details - would look like this 3D prototype."
</p>
<p>
Perhaps notably, by the end of last week <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html">Genki had decided to make clear it hadn't actually seen Switch 2 itself</a> - after previously saying it was aware that units were now available on the black market.
</p>
<p>Last Friday finally also brought an acknowledgement of the leaks by Nintendo. Speaking to Japanese newspaper The Sankei Shimbun, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">Nintendo spokesperson simply stated the images and videos from CES were "not official"</a>.</p>
<p>With details of the Switch 2's hardware design spreading, further leaks have also begun detailing Switch 2's third-party software line-up. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">Microsoft will reportedly be a major supporter, alongside Square Enix with multiple Final Fantasy titles</a>. Surely, after months of waiting, official word is now imminent.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> will receive its first major patch later this week, 0.1.1, which primarily brings some big changes to endgame content.</p>
<p>More is planned for a future update too, as game director Jonathan Rogers explained in a new video (below).</p>
<p>"We have a huge amount of much more meta-shifting changes that we know we want to make," he said. "And one of the best things about having the game in early access with the endgame, is that we now have a much better idea of where we want character powers to be and what the balance of bosses and monsters should be relevant to that. But, those types of changes are going to have to wait until we are ready to make a new league and a new economy for people to play in.</p>

<p>"That's still a little while away yet, but in the meantime we'll be continuing to identify things that are causing frustration and try and address them."</p>
<p>So what are the biggest changes?</p>
<p>Firstly, maps have received balance tweaks to the likes of monsters, chests, essences, and other materials. This is to ensure maps are more rewarding to explore.</p>
<p>Four new towers have also been added, as only one tower map was available previously, in order to improve variety. The existing map has also been "redone" to "make playing there less boring".</p>
<p>More maps with bosses will also be spawned as the rate was previously incorrect. What's more, Pinnacle content currently takes too long to reach and players have only one attempt at the boss. Now Citadels will spawn within closer reach on the map, and six respawn attempts will be provided on bosses - though only on the Arbiter of Ash boss so far.</p><p>Other quality of life changes include: better visibility of attack effects thanks to reduced clutter on maps; tweaks to strongboxes to spawn monsters more quickly; an increased zoom level on the Atlas; removal of terrain collision issues; the ability to overwrite item sockets with new runes; and other boss balance changes.</p>
<p>Full patch notes will be revealed later this week when the patch arrives. For now, check out the video above for details.</p>
<p>Developer Grinding Gear Games admitted back in December <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-not-rewarding-enough-its-developer-admits-amid-incoming-changes">Path of Exile 2 was "not rewarding enough"</a> and listed a number of tweaks it's been working on. It's clear, then, the developer is not slowing down now the game is out in early access.</p>
<p>"Soulslike thrills combine with sky-high production values to make Path of Exile 2 a hugely impressive package, even in early access," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
