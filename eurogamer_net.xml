            <p>
Following the Federal Bureau of Investigation's widely reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-rom-site-seized-by-fbi-as-companys-crackdown-against-piracy-continues">seizure of pirate ROM site Nsw2u.com last week,</a> the US government agency has confirmed the move was part of an operation that impacted "multiple" targets.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/atlanta/news/fbi-atlanta-seizes-major-video-game-piracy-websites">statement shared on its website</a>, the FBI announced "the seizure of several online criminal marketplaces" that it said had, "for more than four years", provided access to "pirated copies of highly anticipated video games days or weeks before their official release date". It also claimed these websites had seen cumulative downloads of 3.2m in just three months this year - from 28th February and 28th May - resulting "in an estimated loss of $170m".
</p>
<p>
On top of Nsw2u's closure, the FBI says its investigation - performed with the assistance of the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service in the Netherlands - had additionally resulted in authorisation to seize the domain of "multiple" other sites, including nswdl.com, game-2u.com, bigngame.com, ps4pkg.com, ps4pkg.net, and mgnetu.com.
</p>
<p>
"These domains hosted and facilitated access to the pirated video games," it continued. "Anyone visiting these sites will now view a seizure banner that notifies them the domain has been seized by federal authorities."
</p>
<p>
The FBI's operation is just the latest move in an ongoing crackdown against video game piracy. Earlier this year, Nintendo<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry"> won a legal battle against French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, meaning European file-sharing companies must now remove illegal copies of games when asked to do so. It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">successfully shut down Switch emulator Yuzu</a> last year, after claiming the software facilitated piracy "at a colossal scale".

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is reportedly working on a full remake of Dragon Quest 7, following the success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake last year.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/square-enix-developing-dragon-quest-vii-remake-for-release-in-2026">mp1st</a>, Square Enix has specifically described the project as a remake - as opposed to a remaster - meaning the PS1 classic Dragon Quest 7 (released in 2000) will receive more than just a graphical update.</p>
<p>The report states the game is intending to launch in either the last quarter of the current fiscal year, or at the beginning of the next - in essence, Square Enix is aiming to release the game in early 2026.</p>

<p>This won't be the first time Dragon Quest 7 has been re-released. A remake was released exclusively on the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013, arriving worldwide in 2016 with the subtitle Fragments of the Forgotten Past. One major change was visible enemy encounters instead of random encounters, while the international release was localised afresh.</p>
<p>Square Enix has not officially announced the remake of Dragon Quest 7.</p>
<p>Instead, it's gearing up for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-coming-to-switch-2-but-physical-version-is-just-a-download-key">release of Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a>, coming to Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Windows) in October.</p>
<p>It will follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">huge success of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">Japan especially</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-7-remake-reportedly-in-development-at-square-enix]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Campaign previously surpassed 1m signatures.</p>

            <p>Nicolae Ștefănuță, Romanian poliician and vice president of the European Parliament, has spoken out in support of Stop Killing Games, saying, he "stands with the people" behind the initiative, and that "a game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company."</p>
<p>Ștefănuță voiced his support - and confirmed he'd added his own signature to the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">EU petition</a> - in an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stopkillinggames.bsky.social/post/3ltseohvy7k2b">Instagram Story spotted and shared by Stop Killing Games</a>. "I stand with the people who started this citizen initiative," he said. "I signed and will continue to help them. A game, once sold, belongs to the customer, not the company.'</p>
<p>Ștefănuță's offer of help comes after Stop Killing Games' official EU petition surpassed 1m signatures earlier this month, meaning it can now be submitted to the EU for verification and then, potentially, either progress to a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament. However, organiser Ross Scott is still encouraging more signatures ahead of the EU's deadline to ensure its signature count remains above the essential 1m threshold once mistakes or deliberate spoofing are eliminated.</p>
<p>But while Stop Killing Games now has at least one prominent EU politician on its side, it's unlikely its aim - of securing legislation that'll leave purchased games in a playable state once support is terminated - will reach fruition without significant resistance from the games industry itself. Last week, EU industry body Video Games Europe - which represents the likes of Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">released a statement</a> insisting the initiative's proposals would make games "prohibitively expensive to create".</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, Stop Killing Games' <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">official UK petition</a> has surpassed over 150K signatures, meaning it must now be considered for debate in parliament, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/favourite-game-no-longer-playable-uk-government-says-it-wont-tighten-rules-to-punish-publishers-who-switch-off-servers">government's earlier response</a> that it had "no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games".
