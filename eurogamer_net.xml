Nintendo has unveiled a new feature for Switch and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> that'll let players share their digital games with another console or Family Group members in the same way they might swap a physical cartridge. It's called Virtual Game Card and it's coming to Switch 1 in "late April".
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works: once the feature becomes available, any digital purchase made will be added to the associated Switch as a Virtual Game Card. By default, any registered users on the main console can play the game, just as they would with any other digital purchase. But there's obviously more to it than that.
</p>
<p>
Virtual Game Cards are managed on a separate screen, with players able to chose whether they're considered 'loaded' or 'ejected'. An ejected Virtual Game Card can, firstly, be played on a second Switch that's owned by the same main account holder - with users able to freely eject and load cartridges between up to two owned machines. Nintendo notes local communication with the other console is required to enable the feature for the first time.
</p>

<p>
However, Virtual Game Cards can also be lent to anyone within a Nintendo Account Family Group, which can support up to eight Nintendo Account users. Again, this initially requires the lending user to connect to the Family Group member's console locally, after which it's simply a case of choosing the title being lent and who it's being lent to.
</p>
<p>
Only one game at a time can be lent to each member within a Family Group and only for a total of 14 days. After the two weeks comes to an end, a Virtual Game Card will be automatically be returned to its original owner. Expect the Virtual Game Card system to feature in much the same way on Switch 2 when it releases later this year.
</p>
<p>
And speaking of which, we're less than a week away from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's long-awaited Switch 2 Direct</a>, which should provide details on everything from launch titles to a release date for Nintendo's hugely anticipated next machine. Things kick off next Wednesday, 2nd April, at 2pm in the UK - and we'll be keeping tabs on all the important stuff with fingers and eyes.

First footage of Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake has been revealed, following last year's Dragon Quest 3 remake.
</p>
<p>
While that game ends with a tease of future remakes after the credits, the footage shown at today's Nintendo Direct is the first look at gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The two games will come as a pair, set to release later this year. Though revealed for Switch, the game will also be coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as with the previous game.

<p>
Why out of order? Dragon Quest 3 was a prequel to the first two to complete what's known as the Erdrick trilogy. So while DQ 1 &amp; 2 were released earlier, DQ 3 is chronologically the first so was the starting point for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s remakes.
</p>
<p>
The company will have high hopes for sales of Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake. The remake of Dragon Quest 3 became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">best-selling game of 2024 in Japan after just one week</a>.
</p>
<p>
A couple of weeks later, Square Enix announced <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1864846226392588539">2m sales globally</a>, while at its following earnings report it stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">the game exceeded expectations</a>.

            <p>
At today's Nintendo Direct, we finally got a first proper look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>: Beyond gameplay.
</p>
<p>
It takes place on the Planet Viewros and promises the start of a new story. Most interestingly, Samus will be given new psychic abilities.
</p>
<p>
There's still no firm release date beyond 2025, but the game's inclusion at this Direct - focused solely on the original Switch console - confirms it will be released on the older system. A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version is yet to be announced.

<p>
So what about those psychic abilities? The trailer explains Samus can use them to operate mechanisms from afar, open doors, and even control the trajectory of beams in slow motion.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, Metroid Prime 4 is more 3D Metroid in first-person. So far only a verdant jungle biome has been shown, with Samus scanning flora and fauna, rolling in morph ball form, and shooting alien creatures with her beam weapon.
</p>
<p>
The trailer ends with Metroid in a new scarlet suit, with a mysterious voice stating: "We place our faith in you, Chosen One".
</p>
<p>
Metroid Prime 4 will follow the excellent remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime">Metroid Prime</a> released on Switch in 2023. There's still no news of similar remasters for Metroid Prime 2 and 3.
