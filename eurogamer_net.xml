            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> developer Grinding Gear Games has acknowledged feedback to its Dawn of the Hunt update from players frustrated with the game's slow pace.</p>
<p>The update, <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3740562">0.2.0</a>, arrived last week with a wealth of new content and a new playable character class, the Huntress. Simultaneously, the developer nerfed plenty of abilities and made other changes to tweak the endgame, many of which have unintentionally impacted the main campaign.</p>
<p>Now Grinding Gear Games has <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205">released a post</a> detailing new and forthcoming changes to appease fans, as development continues in early access.</p>

<p>"Many people are reporting that gameplay is feeling too slow," the developer acknowledged. "Sometimes this comes in the form of people saying that monster life is too high, or player damage is too low, or areas are taking too long. In this post we will talk about some of the things we have already done, and more of the changes we are planning on making."</p>
<p>Having nerfed minion damage and life, these will now be increased to a level similar to before the update, while retaining the new scaling for the endgame.</p>
<p>Monster health has also already been dropped by 25 percent to alleviate clearspeed concerns.</p>
<p>The developer is also looking into the size of environments, with players criticising their large size. "Many players are reporting that areas feel like they are too large," wrote the developer. "Normally when this is the case, the main reason is due to other concerns such as monster life or player damage being incorrect, or just a lack of entertaining content in the area. However, we are checking to see if there are any outliers that players are spending too long in to see if any changes to area size need to happen."</p>
<p>Additionally, the developer is making changes to its new Huntress class, following concerns the power of the class is locked behind the parry mechanic. As such, a new skill will be added to provide Frenzy charges without needing to parry, though this will be carefully balanced to still reward those using the mechanic.</p>
<p>Further, the feel of the parry itself will be improved and spear throws will be buffed to incentivise players alternate more between ranged and melee playstyles.</p>
<p>Server side crashes have been approximately six times higher in this update, but the developer noted these are "significantly easier for us to debug" so should be fixed imminently.</p>
<p>Lastly, quality of life features are on the way such as bookmarking locations on the map, and adding stash tab affinities for more item types.</p>
<p>It's hoped these changes will address concerns from players, with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/">game's subreddit</a> full of memes and frustration. Perhaps the game's most famous player, Elon Musk, however, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/themayormccheese/comments/1jt42f8/elon_musk_tried_to_prove_hes_a_real_gamer_by/">attempted to play from his private jet and died to the tutorial boss</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Grinding Gear Games is attempting to give Path of Exile 2 more demanding combat in comparison to its biggest competition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Indeed, Eurogamer's Bertie described "Souslike thrills" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 early access review</a>.</p>
<p>As for the full release of the game, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2s-full-release-has-a-65-chance-of-arriving-this-year-says-grinding-gear-games-so-what-could-go-wrong">65 percent chance it will be released this year</a>, according to game director Jonathan Rogers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mouse Work is a fun-looking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight-dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a> developer Nitrome began work on in January, just four months ago, following Nintendo's first Switch 2 trailer. 
</p>
<p>
Remember in that trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">how we got a glimpse of a Joy-Con 2 controller zooming along a flat surface</a>? This prompted whispers that Switch 2 would include mouse controls - which, of course, we now know that it does! And it was this hunch that prompted Nitrome to begin work.
</p>
<p>
"The truth is that this project has been developed very rapidly after assuming the mouse mode rumour was true from the January Direct," Nitrome founder Mat Annal told Eurogamer, following the launch of Mouse Work's first trailer - which has already been positively compared to Switch 1 launch title SnipperClips.

<p>
Like SnipperClips, Mouse Work is an indie game from a British studio with experience in Flash development - and it's this background which has enabled Nitrome to make such fast progress, Annal continued. 
</p>
<p>
"We have a background in making games in one month back in the browser days so we are used to working fast," Annal told me, adding that the team was aiming to get Mouse Work ready as soon as possible for the Switch 2's launch window.
</p>
<p>
Mouse Work sees one to four players completing quick mini-games using mouse controls, with more than a dozen shown in the game's reveal trailer, above. There's a distinctive visual style to the project, too, reminiscent of Nintendo's own mini-game compilation, WarioWare. It's definitely one to keep an eye on.
</p>
<p>
Nitrome won <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-dig-a-great-series-safe-in-the-hands-of-the-very-best">praise for its work on Shovel Knight Dig</a>, as well as other past titles such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gunbrick-reloaded-an-ingenious-platformer-gets-a-new-direction">Gunbrick:Reloaded</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bomb-chicken-review-a-blast-from-the-past-that-doesnt-quite-fill-you-up">Bomb Chicken</a>. For more from Annal, Eurogamer previously chatted with Nitrome's founder for a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-spirit-of-flash-gaming-must-never-die">why the spirit of Flash gaming should never die</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> game cartridges taste horrible, Nintendo has confirmed, just like Switch 1.</p>
<p>This may sound like a silly thing to write about (because why is someone tasting a Switch 2 game?) but, once again, the bad-tasting Switch cartridge coating is a safety measure.</p>
<p>Original Switch games are coated in denatonium benzoate, which on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/FAQ/After-touching-a-Nintendo-Switch-game-card-my-hand-has-a-strange-bitter-taste-Could-this-be-harmful-/After-touching-a-Nintendo-Switch-game-card-my-hand-has-a-strange-bitter-taste-Could-this-be-harmful-1204008.html?srsltid=AfmBOorBwyOUad4PwhRea2L1pf4c0Yx4LyMH_5sVFlmjF7WNVHysxrXC">Nintendo's own support page</a>, the team describes this as "a bitter-tasting substance". But don't worry, it isn't harmful to your health. It is often used in those polishes that are meant to deter wearers from biting their nails (a tactic my parents' deployed on me when I was younger, I can still recall the taste very well).</p>

<p>"We don't want anybody to be at risk of any unwanted consumption," Nintendo Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta explained to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/">GameSpot</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo had "indeed made it so that if [a Switch 2 game card] enters your mouth, you'll spit it out", Dohta continued. While I assume the likes of you and I would know instinctively not to pop a game into our mouths, small children may not think along those same lines. </p>
<p>Continuing, Dohta said he would not advise even trying just a cursory lick of a Switch 2 cartridge, no matter how tempting it may seem.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto also joined in with the 'why you shouldn't pop a game cart into your mouth' conversation, stating he did indeed lick an original Switch game, but only once and once was more than enough.</p>
<p>"Never again," Kawamoto said, "I can't believe that other people are trying that."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be released across both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> and the original Switch.</p>
<p>After months of fans awaiting news on the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-release-window-finally-narrowed-down">Silksong appeared briefly at last week's Switch 2 Direct</a> confirming its release on the new console and a launch window of 2025. It doesn't narrow down the date, but it at least confirms the game remains on the way.</p>
<p>Some fans presumed this meant the game was a Switch 2 exclusive, but Team Cherry's marketing boss Matthew Griffin confirmed on social media Silksong is coming to both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>As one response reads: "...anywhere else?". Silksong is also set for release across PC (Steam), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, and PS5.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-lists-hollow-knight-silksong-as-part-of-incredible-upcoming-indie-line-up-and-i-am-acting-totally-normal-about-that">Xbox listed the game in a recent Xbox Wire post focused on its lineup of indie games</a>. And while an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">ARG on the release date was debunked</a> at the start of the year, Griffin confirmed at the time "the game is real, progressing and will release".</p> <div>

<p>Along with its appearance at the Direct, it certainly feels like information is starting to build towards a proper reveal. Or is that wishful thinking?</p>
<p>At the least, the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000096731">Japanese Nintendo site</a> has published some new screenshots of the game showing insect protagonist Hornet in action.</p>

<p>It certainly looks pretty and a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, but fans are still keen to see how the game has developed through its multiple delays.
