            <p>It turns out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s NPCs are basically playing their own game of Grand Theft Mario.</p>
<p>A video shared on social media by Supper Mario Broth explains how NPCs can actually steal a car belonging to another character.</p>
<p>Specifically, the video shows a green Shy Guy parking a vehicle and walking away. A Toad NPC then saunters up to the vehicle, jumps inside, and drives off, leaving the oblivious Shy Guy plodding down the road. Incredible!</p>

<p>Supper Mario Broth explained there are a few scenarios for the Shy Guy after this: the NPC will either keep walking until the player leaves and they despawn; they'll enter a building to despawn; or they'll steal a car themselves.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">In Mario Kart World, NPCs will park their cars, exit them, and walk around. However, the game does not actually keep track who each car belongs to. As such, a different NPC than the owner may drive away with a car, seemingly stealing it. <a href="https://t.co/KTXsDHXwiL">pic.twitter.com/KTXsDHXwiL</a></p>— Supper Mario Broth (@MarioBrothBlog) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/1968013677367525789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As much as Mario Kart World is full of these little details designed to make its open world feel alive, jacking cars seems very un-Nintendo for such a family-friendly game. Children, avert your eyes!</p>
<p>Have you spotted NPCs stealing cars in Mario Kart World?</p>

            <p>EA's Skate has now released into early access and has already proven so popular there are long queues to get in, with the team fixing ongoing outage issues.</p>
<p>Yet when players do get in, they're discovering skating isn't actually the optimal way to get around. In fact, videos on social media make the game look more like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>One player shared a video of their character rolling and jumping without a skateboard to overtake traffic and speed around the city.</p>

<p>Another player responded with a video of their character similarly rolling and jumping before belly flopping to slide over the ground.</p>
<p>Yet another player has found jumping from their board and flying to be an optimal way to build up speed.</p> <div>

<p>It's clear, then, Skate is not quite performing as expected. But for now, the studio is busy improving wait times, with the team "hard at work adding more servers and getting more skaters into San Van", it <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968048173492081010">wrote on social media</a>. "We appreciate your patience."</p>
<p>As per the game's subreddit, many players have been sitting waiting in queues, while others have joined a session but been shortly kicked out due to server issues.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="659"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1ninsuf/the_gameplay_so_far/">The gameplay so far</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/BittaminMusic/">u/BittaminMusic</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/">SkateEA</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>As a result, many players have complained about Skate's online requirement. Developer Full Circle confirmed back in April the game would require an online connection.</p>
<p>"The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving," it wrote in an <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/skate-game-info-hub-en/the-grind-vol-1/12126312">FAQ</a>. "You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities. In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection."</p>
<p>Still, that only works if players are able to get in, for which the studio is at least prioritising a fix.</p>

            <p>As criticism of Borderlands 4's technical performance continues, Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has told players to "get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it".</p>
<p>Since Borderlands 4's release last week, Pitchford has been on a tirade on social media <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-is-pretty-damn-optimal-randy-pitchford-responds-to-borderlands-4-pc-performance-complaints">in defence of the game</a> calling it "pretty damn optimal".</p>
<p>In his latest post, Pitchford stated every PC gamer "must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing", effectively placing responsibility on individual players to perform their own optimisations.</p>

<p>One player responded "Your product doesn't meet the standards" and said it took days to get the game to a tolerable state.</p>
<p>"You can do whatever you want," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510">replied</a>. "The game is the game. Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it.</p>
<p>"You made an analogy to a vehicle. I would not put a Ferrari engine in a monster truck and expect it to drive like a Ferrari. If you tell me about your specification, I can help you optimise your performance. I'm sorry you don't like being told to use DLSS, but that is the way. If you're not happy using the tools available to you to improve frame rate and you're not happy with the frame rate you have, you should play a different game.</p><p>"The game is awesome and it is designed to be just fine of an experience at 30fps and feel great at 60fps. We also have provided a lot of options for you to make different trade offs between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features than we would make and we encourage you to use those tools to optimise to your taste. Would you like help tuning your experience better to your liking?"</p> <div>

<p>Despite performance issues across both PC and console platforms, Borderlands 4 is proving popular. On Steam alone it's reached a concurrent player count of over 304k (though this remains behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>).</p>
<p>The official Borderlands account released some player stats such as items looted and bosses defeated, with <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1968049883925078218">Pitchford adding</a>: "Holy bananas you guys played a LOT of Borderlands 4 over the weekend. The backend on-line services all held, which is what we hoped would happen!"</p>
<p>It also looks like a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/easy-queasy-borderlands-4-fov-sliders-may-be-coming-to-console">POV slider could be added for console players</a>, following complaints of motion sickness.</p>
