            <p>No, Blizzard is not preparing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> 2 announcement for BlizzCon 2026, I've been told, but there is something significant being announced later this year.</p>
<p>The company aroused suspicion for a sequel during a Hearthstone broadcast this afternoon, while announcing a Cataclysm-themed expansion for the World of Warcraft card game. The company teased that a major announcement was coming at BlizzCon 2026 in September, and for something bigger than usual.</p>
<p>I watched this 'spotlight' broadcast at Blizzard headquarters, just over a week ago, so I was able to quiz the team afterwards about it. I asked executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith whether we were talking about something as significant as a sequel, and he put me straight.</p>
<p>"No, this is not a Hearthstone 2," Lyons-Smith told me. "There's no whole new game that is launching as part of that. Over the years we've done mixes, new types of content, new modes and such in the game, and it will be of that familiar ilk."</p>

<p>However, the BlizzCon 2026 announcement will still be especially notable. Familiar, yes, but "in a bigger way than we would normally do"," Lyons-Smith said. "Bigger than what's happening with Cataclysm."</p>
<p>Cataclysm arrives for Hearthstone on 17th March and reimagines the World of Warcraft expansion of the same name. That means world-breaking dragon Deathwing is back, and he's bringing some colossal pals with him. Literally colossal: Colossals are returning to the game.</p><p>These are mega-minions who, in the case of Magmaw, for instance, a giant lava worm, fills all available minion spaces with their wormy body, and keeps refilling them whenever any segments are killed. Magmaw has 99 minion recharges, so you can begin to see what kind of a problem that card represents. The other Colossals are similarly chonky.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Cataclysm also brings new keywords, a new story, and powerful new abilities like Rewind that allow you to redo some plays. Also, on 10th March, one week before the expansion arrives, Blizzard will make every card from the recent Un'Goro and Emerald Dream expansions available to everyone for the duration of the Cataclysm expansion cycle, which is nice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hearthstone-isnt-on-console-switch-or-steam-deck-but-increasingly-likely-to-happen">But Blizzard isn't yet ready to bring Hearthstone to consoles or handheld devices like Switch or Steam Deck</a> - not officially, anyway. Nevertheless, there's a suggestion this is now more of a priority under Microsoft than it was under Activision before. Could we perhaps be in for a new platform announcement at BlizzCon?</p>

            <p>Blizzard has explained why Warcraft-based collectible card game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, still isn't available on console, 12 years after release. The game is available on handheld devices like tablets and mobile, but has never made the jump to the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> or Steam Deck. In explaining its thinking, the developer suggested that belonging to Microsoft and Xbox means these console conversions are now more of a priority than ever.</p>
<p>"There's a level of investment that we need to make to make that happen," explained Hearthstone executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith during a group interview I was a part of at Blizzard recently, "primarily in terms of UI and UX and making sure that it's very natural to go and play a card game on those platforms. I know it's possible - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gathering-duels-of-the-planeswalkers-2013-review">Duels of the Planeswalkers for Magic [The Gathering], many years ago now, was absolutely delightful</a> with the controller - so I know we can do it.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of are there enough players there wanting that beyond who's going to pull out their phone or their tablet to play? It's been so exciting seeing that segment of the market grow such that we can then say, yeah, actually, let's go and do this."</p>
<p>Hearthstone was quickly ported to mobile in 2015, a year after a release, mostly because Blizzard recognised an opportunity there and rushed to fill it, Lyons-Smith said. "We ported that thing to get fast to market and <em>a whole lot</em> more players showed and so it was the right strategic choice at that time," he said. But the Hearthstone codebase is old now, and the quality bar is high on consoles and handheld console machines.</p><p>"I asked an engineer who'd been on the project a long time and he estimates the code is 16 years old," Lyons-Smith said, "and the team was 15 people 16 years ago. And so there's more of an effort to go: 'I want to make sure when we go that it's awesome.' That it doesn't just feel like, yeah, they ported it here and you <em>can</em> play... I want to make sure that when we go, we're going to go and it's going to feel awesome for players that love that form factor, whether they're leaning back on the couch or sitting on the couch with their handheld."</p>
<p>Game director Tyler Bielman echoed that sentiment by saying, "If we're going to bring it specifically to that living room big screen platform, we would want to make sure that the full experience is optimised for that mode that you're in."</p>
<p>Lyons-Smith added: "So let's get there and let's do it right and we'll find the right time to do it."</p>

<p>It was to a follow-up question asked after this that Lyons-Smith made the remark about owner Microsoft being keen to get games on as many platforms as possible. "In the future as we explore console and handheld, we'd probably go as wide as we could," he said. "Certainly we have a different owner now than we did three years ago and they're more invested in Xbox and 'anything's an Xbox'. Their high-level goal [being] games playable anywhere."</p><p>Play Anywhere is one of Microsoft's key ideas as it transitions Xbox away from hardware and more towards being a platform-agnostic gaming brand. The idea is that you buy a game once to play on multiple platforms - wherever houses an Xbox ecosystem or app. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Last year's expensive Asus Rog Ally X</a> handheld device was and is a key proponent of this.</p>
<p>Blizzard has just announced a Cataclysm themed expansion for Hearthstone that will launch on 17th March. It'll bring a whole new story to the game as well as reintroduce Colossal cards, which are play-space-filling brutes, and new keywords, funky mechanics, and more. Blizzard is also teasing a major Hearthstone announcement for BlizzCon 2026, though as I discovered, this will not be Hearthstone 2.</p>

            <p>The upcoming God of War series has finally got its Atreus, as Callum Vinson has been cast as none other than the son of Kratos.</p>
<p>He comes from prior work as a young Jason Voorhees in Crystal Lake, as well as Piglet in Me &amp; Winnie the Pooh. He also has a history of voice over work, having played Lope in Mobile Suit Gundam: Cucuruz Doan's Island. It makes sense, after all, that an archer would have range. I'll be here all night, folks.</p>
<p>As well as the God of War series, Vinson is set to play a role in both season three of The Night Agent, a popular Netflix drama.</p>

<p>Vinson comes in the wake of some other impressive casting calls, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-has-a-head-for-casting-with-the-return-of-mimir-actor-alastair-duncan-confirmed">including Alastair Duncan returning to the role of Mimir from the games</a>.  Odin and Thor also have assigned actors, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-keeps-casting-characters-from-ragnarok-adds-severance-and-homeland-stars-as-odin-and-thor">Mandy Patinkin and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson taking these antagonistic roles respectively</a>. Kratos too has been chosen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-series-has-found-its-kratos-and-its-ragnaroks-thor">with Ryan Hurst taking the lead role</a>.</p><p>This God of War adaption, being produced by Amazon, has still yet to have a release date as of writing. Nor does it have a proper trailer announcing it to those not paying attention to early casting decisions. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">it is already approved for a second season</a>. The show also has some stellar talent directing it, including Frederick E.O. Toye <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emmy-winning-shogun-director-joins-amazons-live-action-god-of-war-series">who'll be taking the lead over the first two episodes</a>.</p>
<p>What do you think of this casting decision? Is Vinson the right actor for the role? Let us know!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> player-numbers are currently the strongest they've been on Steam since the game arrived there, spiking ahead of the game's first expansion-like release, The Reign of Talon, which arrives tomorrow, 10th February.</p>
<p>Sunday, 8th February saw approximately 70,000 people playing Overwatch 2 together on Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a> - which is only 5000 fewer than when Overwatch 2 launched there in August 2023. The game has struggled to break 60,000 concurrent players since then.</p>
<p>The numbers aren't gigantic - they put Overwatch 2 39th in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">Steam's Most Played list</a>, which is notably lower than competing hero shooter Marvel Rivals, in 21st - but Steam isn't the only platform Overwatch 2 is played on. The primary home of Overwatch 2 is Battle.net, so the true number of people playing Overwatch 2 is likely to be markedly higher.</p>

<p>It bodes well for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">Overwatch 2, which undergoes a bit of a relaunch this week</a>, dropping the "2" from its name and welcoming five new heroes at once - and further five throughout the year - in a huge, unprecedented-for-the-game, expansion-like release. And the plan is to do these expansion-like releases every year. There's a lot to unpack, as I found out when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-unveils-major-overwatch-2-revamp-expansion-plan">I travelled to Blizzard recently to learn about Overwatch's bold new plan</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-review-a-brilliant-teamplay-experience-in-the-grip-of-an-existential-crisis">Overwatch 2 launched in 2023, after a year in early access</a>, controversially overriding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> 1, a game that no longer exists. Overwatch 2 moved the series to being fully free-to-play, supported by a Battle Pass, and changed group sizes to five from six. It was a rough transition, but lots of good work has been done on the game in the years since, reintroducing 6v6 battles and ironing out a lot of Battle Pass kinks, and adding significant new game modes like Stadium, in which you can mechanically customise a hero similar to how you would in a MOBA - earning new abilities as you play.</p>

            <p>
Discord has announced a new "teen-by-default" approach to its platform, meaning age-verification will be a mandatory requirement for all users around the globe in order to access certain settings, channels, and "sensitive content."
</p>
<p>
Beginning in early March, Discord will implement a "phased global rollout" of a new update designed to give all new and existing users worldwide a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Once live, users will be required to undergo age verification - either via facial age estimation or by submitting a form of identification - in order to access certain features. This builds on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">changes previously rolled out</a> to users in Australia and the UK.
</p>
<p>
Without age verification, users will be unable to bypass sensitive content filters, and will not be able to access age-gated channels, servers, or app commands. Nor can they speak on Discord server stages or access messages sent to their inbox from people they do not know. Additionally, all users will see warning prompts when receiving friend requests from users they may not know.
</p>
<p>
As for the age verification process, Discord is adopting what it calls "privacy-forward age assurance". It says video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device, and insists all identification documents submitted to its vendor partners for processing will be "deleted quickly" — "in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." It does note, however, that while only one verification method will be required for most users, it may sometimes request multiple methods when "more information is needed to assign an age group." Once age verification is complete, user will be alerted via a direct message from Discord's official account.
</p><p>
"Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility," the company wrote in a statement accompanying the news. "We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform."
