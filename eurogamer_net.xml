            <p>Players are still very much focused on a handful of live-service games, as over 70 percent of PS5 and Xbox Series X/S players in the US played at least one of the top 10 live-service games in January.</p>
<p>Further, more than 40 percent of all playtime in the US in January across those consoles was spent on those same 10 live-service games.</p>
<p>That's according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella, based on Circana's Player Engagement Tracker. "Used to be that players would jump from big game to big game to some other games but they were most often moving to something new that they purchased," he surmised. "Now, the live-service games suck out a ton of available time, and it's hard to beat free if it's good."</p>

<p>He continued: "Really could use some positive surprises this year, and for a bunch of things to go right in 2025. So a lot is riding on the new products coming to market this year to hopefully combat or reverse some of these trends."</p>
<p>Namely, he's referring to the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo's Switch 2</a> and its subsequent new games, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">hotly anticipated GTA 6</a>.</p>
<p>Piscatella's analysis speaks to the dominance of live-service games in the industry, including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Minecraft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and Roblox. And while other studios have attempted to cash in on the live service trend, they've struggled to compete with established franchises.</p>

The biggest concern was players losing interest, with competition from other live service games a close second.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/older-games-like-fortnite-account-for-over-60-of-playtime-new-report-suggests">further report last year from Newzoo</a> found games at least six years old accounted for more than 60 percent of playtime in 2023, with Fortnite the top game across all platforms that year. The top five games alone accounted for over 25 percent of all playtime: that was Fortnite, Roblox, League of Legends, Minecraft, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>.</p>
<p>Sony in particular has struggled with live service projects - last month it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled two in-development games</a> from Sony Bend and Bluepoint.

Well, here's a surprise. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> will be part of Sony's PlayStation Plus Essential Games for March.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's big role-playing game only launched four months ago, so it's a surprise to see it included within the subscription service so soon.
</p>
<p>
Reception to the game has been mixed, with a solid launch last October and a decent critical response not translating into sales. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">publisher EA said the EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard had "underperformed"</a>. This month, its boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">Andrew Wilson suggested the game might have performed better if it was live-service</a>.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation Plus Essential games for March 2025 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (PS5)</li>
<li>Sonic Colors: Ultimate (PS4)</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection (PS4/PS5)</li>
</ul>

<p>All the above join the PlayStation Plus game catalogue next Tuesday, 4th March, and you'll find more details on what else is on offer in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.</p>

Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the fourth major entry in its long-running fantasy series, and its first in a decade. It picks up storylines from across the franchise so far and ties many of them up - but it's also a good point for new players to drop in. "A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. 
</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours-ultimate">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> is the 2001 remaster of Sega's Wii platformer that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-sonic-colours-ultimate-tech-review">according to Digital Foundry</a>, "is still a lot of fun and it plays even better now".</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a>, launched in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-sees-return-of-13-retro-classics">features 13 classic Turtles games from the series' Konami era</a>, released between 1989 and 1994.</p>
