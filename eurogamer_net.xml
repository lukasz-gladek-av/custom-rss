BioWare has announced a standalone launch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s character creator, and detailed the game's next patch. 
</p>
<p>
Today is Dragon Age Day 2024, and BioWare has confirmed it will imminently release its impressive character creator for The Veilguard as a free download on PC, PlayStation and Xbox. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking from experience, you can lose a lot of time exploring the game's customisation options - and in particular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguards-impressive-hair-tech-was-built-on-the-heads-and-shoulders-of-ea-sports-fc">Dragon Age: The Veilguard's brilliant hair tech</a>. Of course, any completed character design can also be exported to the full game. Look out for it later today.

<p>
The Veilguard's upcoming Patch 4 will add a sprinkling of new features, including a tool to take photos within the game's cutscenes, extra Qunari complexions, and an array of bug fixes. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the coolest addition is a set of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> armour, complete with body paint and nose blood, for your Rook to begin wearing.

            <p>Sony is releasing My First Gran Turismo this week, a new free-to-play game that pays tribute to the origins of the series' first game on the original PlayStation.</p>
<p>It will be available through the PlayStation Store from 6th December across PS4 and PS5, in honour of the PlayStation's 30th anniversary.</p>

<p>"This isn't just about playing a game; it's about embarking on a personal driving journey," said Polyphony Digital president Kazunori Yamauchi in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/04/my-first-gran-turismo-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-december-6/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>"We've made sure the experience is intuitive, allowing anyone to get behind the wheel and master the essentials, such as cornering, braking, and acceleration. By playing it, users will build confidence one lap at a time, tackling new challenges that'll steadily refine their driving skills."</p><p>My First Gran Turismo features simplified versions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>'s modes, including Race Events, Time Trials, and Music Rally stages. There are 18 unique cars to drive and iconic tracks from series past like Kyoto Driving Park, Deep Forest Raceway, and Trial Mountain Circuit.</p>
<p>Gran Turismo first released on the original PlayStation and became its best-selling game. Earlier this week it made our list of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-10-ps1-games-that-mattered-the-most">the most important games on the console</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony has given us our first look at controller-free hand tracking on PlayStation VR2, thanks to footage which has started making the rounds on social media.</p>
<p>The footage in question is of a demo at the Siggraph Asia 2024 computer graphics conference in Tokyo. This demo sees the user taking part in a cleaning mini-game. The actions on screen are achieved by using hand gestures, with no controllers required (see first embed below)</p>

<p>Text accompanying the PlayStation VR2 demo states this feature "tracks the position and posture" of the users' hands, and the "library is available with the latest SDK of PlayStation 5".</p>

<p>Sony's demo booth additionally lists the tracking rate at 60 fps, claiming the system "displays the hands smoothly" with "low latency". According to the text, the hand tracking tech will be able to detect 12 types of gesture.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while PS VR2 hasn't had hand tracking up until this point, other VR sets such as Quest 2 and 3 have hand tracking as standard.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment on the PS VR2's potential hand tracking future. We will update you when we know more.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in VR news, we recently got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps-vr2-exclusive-alien-rogue-incursion-lands-december-release-date">release date for Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>. That's coming later this month. If getting yourself into a number of different disguises to pop off unsuspecting victims is more your VR bag, I am afraid you will have to wait a little bit longer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>'s PS VR2 release.</p>
<p>While once slated for December, this particular fellow is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-world-of-assassination-delayed-until-march-on-psvr2">now set for release in March next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
