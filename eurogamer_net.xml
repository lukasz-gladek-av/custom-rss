            <p>Nintendo's Switch successor - the aptly named <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> - has become the fastest selling video game hardware device in US history, knocking the PS4 off the top spot.</p>
<p>That's according to the latest data from Circana, with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k">analyst Mat Piscatella</a> revealing 1.6m Switch 2 units were sold in the US during the console's launch month. The previous record holder was Sony's PlayStation 4, with 1.1m units sold during November 2013.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given what I have just told you, the Switch 2 was the best-selling console of the month in terms of both physical unit sales and dollar sales. </p>

<p>Piscatella said 82 percent of US Switch 2 owners who purchased their console in June also plumped for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-games-everything-you-can-play-on-day-one">launch title Mario Kart World</a>. This was either via a physical new game sale or as part of the Nintendo Switch 2 + <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> Bundle.</p>
<p>These figures come despite the tariff situation in US around the Switch 2's launch. As a reminder, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo delayed pre-orders in the US back in April</a>. It additionally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raised the cost of Switch 2 accessories in US due to tariffs</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-us-preorders-reportedly-cancelled-by-major-retailers">some US retailers were reportedly cancelling pre-orders ahead of the console's launch</a>. </p>
<p>All in all, the launch of the Switch 2 boosted the gaming market more generally. Consumer spending in the US - for both hardware and accessories - reached new all-time records. Last month, hardware spending in the US rose by 249 percent compared to this time last year, to $978 million. The previous high for June was $608m, which was recorded in 2008.</p>
<p>June accessories spending in the US, meanwhile, reached $293m. The previous record was $247m, which happened in June 2021.</p>
<p>"What the launch sales of Switch 2 primarily tell us is that they made a lot of Switch 2 to sell at launch," Piscatella said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history">IGN</a>, when asked if this record breaking launch means that the Switch 2 is now set to surpass the original Switch's lifetime sales. In February of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-sales-below-expectations-as-wait-for-switch-2-continues">Nintendo had sold 150.86m Switch consoles</a>.</p>
<p>"Lifetime sales and launch sales of a console often do not correlate, meaning that some consoles with small launches ended up doing incredibly well," Piscatella continued, noting that the PlayStation 2 only sold 400k in its launch month.</p>
<p>"Since launch month demand is rarely satiated by available supply (and it is certainly not a great sign when it is, historically) all we can really get a read on at launch is the confidence of the manufacturer to make so many units available, and the ability of the supply chain to get those units into the market," the analyst closed.</p>
<p>"But having the biggest launch month sales for any new video game hardware platform is a helluva good start."</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has walked back on its previous decision to hike the price of its new first-party Xbox games up to $80 USD this 'holiday season', saying it's sticking to a lower price point "in line with current market conditions".
</p>
<p>
Hints of a pricing rethink first emerged earlier today, when Microsoft first-party studio Obsidian Entertainment revealed its upcoming sci-fi action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2, which had previously been given an $79.99 price tag, would now cost $69.99.
</p>
<p>
"We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing," the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obsidian.net/post/3lun6okl2us2q">wrote</a>. "As an organisation devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2."
</p>
<p>
In a follow-up statement <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-concedes-that-the-outer-worlds-2-retail-price-was-too-high">to Windows Central</a>, Microsoft confirmed the pricing adjustment wasn't unique to The Outer Worlds 2. "We're focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore," an Xbox spokesperson told the publication, "and will keep our full-priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99." It didn't provide a precise reason for its strategic U-turn, only saying the move was "in line with current market conditions."
</p>
<p>
Xbox was, of course, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">first major publisher to announced a price increase to $80</a> for "some" of its new first-party games earlier this year, and Nintendo swiftly followed suit, slapping an $80 price tag on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. At the time, however, the company stressed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">would be adopting a "variable pricing" system</a> for its new console and, to date, Mario Kart World is the only Switch 2 game to sport that bumper price tag.
</p>
<p>
And no other publisher has yet followed Xbox's bullish lead. Even Take-Two, which has long been rumoured to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">considering an $80 price tag for GTA 6</a>, has remained firm on its variable pricing stance, pointing to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">upcoming $50 Mafia: The Old Country</a>.
</p>
<p>
While some in the industry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">see rising game prices as inevitable</a>, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-soaring-prices-have-a-cost-beyond-your-wallet-the-concept-of-ownership-itself">took at look at the phenomenon earlier this year</a>, noting that soaring prices have a cost beyond buyers' wallet - the concept of ownership itself.
