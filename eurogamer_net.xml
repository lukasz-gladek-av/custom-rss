Daft but brilliant curation sim Two Point Museum is grabbing its D20s and venturing into the world of medieval fantasy for its first paid DLC release, which promises magical exhibits (and ensuing curses for unsuspecting guests), RPG-inspired expeditions, and more this July.
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Finds, as developer Two Point Studios is calling its DLC, introduces a total of 40 mysterious and magically inclined exhibits. You've got your Flying Carpet, your Teanie Kettle, your Novel Wardrobe, and more, all granting beneficial blessings to guests. Unless, that is, you fail to keep them well-maintained - in which case you'll be dealing with cursed patrons instead.
</p>
<p>
As in the base game, all these curios are acquired out on expeditions, which is where Fantasy Finds' RPG-style twist comes in. In order to track down or maintain the DLC's new exhibits, you'll need to hire new Fantasy Experts. These come in a range of familiar classes - barbarian, wizard, rogue, and bard - each with their own stats. "Does your team have enough combined Strength and Dexterity to counter a dragon attack?", Two Points Studios teases. "Perhaps you need the right combination of Intelligence and Luck to overcome a Picked Lock shortcut."

Fantasy Finds also includes three new guest archetypes, 26 decorations and utility items, a new medieval-themed paint job for your expedition chopper, Mythical Gear buffs for staff, plus new interactive displays, banners, wallpapers, floors, and more. All this arrives for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC on 17th July, and while there's no word of a price yet, a week-long 10 percent launch discount is confirmed. And if you haven't played Two Point Museum yet (which you should if you're a management sim fan, because it's great and easily the best entry in the series so far) you can currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/">pick it up with 20 percent off as part of the Steam Summer Sale</a>.

"Come for the clowns and cavemen," Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-review">four star review of Two Point Museum</a>, "stay for the zombie capitalism."

            <p>
Just days after barreling through the 1m sales barrier, Peak - the daft co-op climbing game from developer Landcrab - has reached another impressive milestone. It's now sold over 2m copies, and Landcrab is celebrating the occasion by talking a little about its plans for future updates.
</p>
<p>
Peak, if you've not yet had the pleasure, sees up to four friends attempting to scale an ever-changing mountain. You've got ropes, climbing spikes, and other useful tools to aid in your upward adventure, but key to your slapstick survival is communication and coordination. Poorly orchestrated ascents have a tendency to end in hilarious chaos - the kind of Tok Tok and YouTube friendly calamity that's helped catapult Peak up the charts.
</p>
<p>
It took <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charming-co-op-climbing-game-peak-takes-steam-by-storm-selling-one-million-copies-in-six-days-and-mounting-the-top-sellers-page">just six days for Peak to cross the 1m sales threshold</a> following its launch, and it's now shifted another 1m copies three days after that. "We seriously cannot thank you enough for all the love and support we've had on this game," Landcrab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498325386812195119?l=english">wrote on Steam</a>. "There's an abundance of ways we would like to say thank you, but I think the best way we could do that is by sharing with you all what's next: Yes, we are now looking into possible updates."

<p>
Landcrab says its update plans are in the "very early stages", but it's collating player feedback and is considering everything from "quality of life features to new content and all the funny additions that we wished to make real from the start." There are some caveats, however; firstly, it will continue to prioritise bug fixes and stability before anything else, so "don't expect a huge content update right away."
</p>
<p>
Secondly, Landcrab's somewhat unusual set-up - it's actually two studios, Landfall Games and Aggro Crab, working in collaboration - means there's a degree of uncertainty about what it'll actually be able achieve: "We don't know how many major updates we're planning... Since we're two studios who have other projects to work on, and neither of us being live service studios... The last thing we want to do is promise any features that we can't make a reality."
</p>
<p>
As for those bug fixes, Landcrab says it's continuing to investigate some of Peak's most widely reported issues, including those relating to disconnection and reconnection, performance and optimisation, crashes, and mic/audio problems. "We are still a small team," it adds, "so we really appreciate all the patience with us tackling bug reports. We're reminding ourselves to take breaks, fix bugs and also appreciate the success of the project."
</p>
<p>
Peak (which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for Landfall, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/content-warning-dev-investigating-server-issues-as-steam-smash-hits-62m-downloads">Content Warning</a> and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds) is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">available now on Steam for a mere Â£6.39</a>. Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">earlier this week</a>, writing, "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."
