Nintendo has sought to justify its bumper £75/$80 price tag for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and pointed to the lower cost of fellow <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> big hitter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> as evidence it had not established a new, more expensive "benchmark".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/04/07/mario-kart-world-price-nintendo-doug-bowser/">The Washington Post</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser said Mario Kart World's higher price tag was simply an example of "variable pricing" that reflected the "breadth and depth of the gameplay".
</p>
<p>
"I think you can anticipate that there will be variable pricing, and we haven't set a benchmark," Bowser said.

<p>
Historically, Nintendo has set some game prices higher than others - most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which was priced at $70, an extra $10 on top of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
</p>
<p>
Other Switch 2 games from Nintendo include Donkey Kong Bananza (£65/$70) and the budget Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which is expected to cost around £5. It's worth noting, too, that Mario Kart World can be bought at a significant discount in a bundle with a Switch 2 - though it's unclear how long this offer will last, or whether stock will be sufficient to meet launch demand.
</p>
<p>
Bowser's comments, published today, were apparently recorded before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo made the dramatic decision to delay US Switch 2 pre-orders</a> due to the impact of tariffs. 
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 will still launch on 5th June worldwide, including in the US, though fans there fear Nintendo may decide to increase the console's price in response to the current global economic situation.
</p>
<p>Earlier today, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return">Nintendo Korea leak revealed the return of an iconic location to Mario Kart World</a>, which Nintendo has so far tried to keep under wraps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Last week's big <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> unveiling prompted plenty of excitement for the game's new open world formula and its expanded character roster - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">including its Cow</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But the reveal also came with questions - namely, where the heck is Rainbow Road? Well, thanks to sneaky leak by Nintendo Korea, we now have an answer.

<p>
Mario Kart World will indeed include Rainbow Road, it appears, after an icon for it was briefly displayed on the Nintendo Korea website for the game. 
</p>
<p>
The image including Rainbow Road has now been removed, presumably to keep its inclusion a secret, but of course the internet has already taken notice.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1jqrwq8/rainbow_road_has_finally_been_found_it_seems_it/">Rainbow Road has finally been found. It seems it will be unlocked later in the game.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TonkyTc/">u/TonkyTc</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/">mariokart</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Does this secrecy mean Rainbow Road will be kept as an unlockable extra area in-game? Or perhaps Nintendo is just holding something back for its next marketing push - likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">the game's dedicated Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct</a>, due on 17th April.
</p>
<p>
Looking at Mario Kart World's full world map, it looks like Rainbow Road will sit just below Princess Peach's Castle, in the lower centre of the map.

<p>
Mario Kart World's demo, which Eurogamer played last week, limited players to only exploring certain sections of the game's open world, with others off-limits. It remains to be seen how the game's world will open up when it is fully playable on launch, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, on 5th June.
</p>
<p>
In other news, Nintendo Korea's website has been responsible for another slip-up. Earlier today we noted that it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-nintendo-accidentally-reveals-surprise-character-appears-in-donkey-kong-bananza">revealed a surprise character set to appear in fellow Switch 2 game Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.
