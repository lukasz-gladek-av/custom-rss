            <p>Sega has revealed the post-launch roadmap for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, including last night's announcement that Mega Man will be joining next year as paid DLC.</p>
<p>Capcom's iconic hero will be joined by Proto Man too, plus there will be a Dr. Wily's Castle course and a vehicle inspired by canine companion Rush.</p>
<p>The DLC will be available in Q2 next year in the third patch of the game's Season Pass. That begins later this year with the addition of Minecraft and SpongeBob Squarepants, with Pac-Man to follow early next year.</p>

<p>Then, Q3 of 2026 will see the arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> and anime Avatar Legends. Each Season Pass Content Pack includes playable characters, a new vehicle, a new track, emotes and sounds.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be a number of free updates adding new characters and more. Hatsune Miku and Sonic Prime characters are available at launch for Digital Deluxe owners. Then later this year Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban from Like A Dragon will be added, along with another unknown character.</p>
<p>More free additions will arrive in each quarter next year. You can see the roadmap in the image below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-leak-reveals-more-iconic-characters-coming-to-its-roster-which-retro-fans-will-love">Mega Man's inclusion leaked last week</a>, so his reveal at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a> came as little surprise.</p>
<p>However, the back of the physical box includes artwork for Sega Saturn icon NiGHTS, with fans presuming the jester character will be one of the free characters coming to the game.</p>
<p>Who else do you hope to see join Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds?</p>

            <p>The next grand open-world setting for the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> game will be Japan, Microsoft has accidentally announced, and it will be released in 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement came via an Instagram post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/forzahorizonofficial/">the official Forza Horizon account</a>. This let slip, ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-live-watch-it-with-us">Tokyo Game Show 2025 Xbox briefing</a> today, that "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan. Coming 2026." The post has since been removed. Whoops!</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Playground Games / Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The full announcement is expected to occur in the Xbox briefing that's only moments away - due to begin at 11am UK time. How much of the game we'll see, we don't yet know, nor how much of Japan it will allow us to explore.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> was released four years ago now, in 2021, and this year debuted on PlayStation 5, in the spring. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-now-has-one-of-the-greatest-racing-games-of-all-time-and-it-feels-like-im-cheating-on-my-xbox?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExNHhTNEVIUmNRc1d6dFJ3ZgEeNeEeu8Qu5tD-zcBwnMvjnEelfLbKhqomunPmhYChqepr7UZmU8nQvQuCyqw_aem_FMSnw25d-mSOyt9PPW3ayQ">Tom thinks it's one of the greatest racing games of all time</a>. Given that, the question of whether this new instalment could launch on PlayStation 5 is probably more "when?" rather than "if?". Or, "How long will Microsoft keep it exclusive to Xbox for?"</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> is set to release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and Xbox next January and will come with boost features familiar to players of the Pixel Remasters, known as Streamlined Progression.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed to Eurogamer these boosts will also be coming to the PS5 and PC versions of the game in a future update, though there's no date yet. The PC version's enhanced lighting features will be coming to PS5 too.</p>
<p>As outlined previously in a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch2-xbox-series-x-s">Square Enix blog</a>, players will have access to a new menu where they can implement a number of boosts such as HP full, MP full, Limit gauge full, and maximum damage dealt, which can be toggled individually.</p>

<p>"I feel that the way people enjoy content has become more flexible these days, as we see with video streaming platforms, and that people also want the same thing from games, with options to tailor the experience based on the time they have and their levels of interest," said director Naoki Hamaguchi. "I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p>
<p>"That’s exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hamaguchi stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> is "doing very well" on PS5 and PC in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">Automaton</a>, so there's no need to worry about part three.</p>
<p>For its remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, Square Enix decided to create a trilogy. But as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">sales appear to have decreased with each installment</a>, some fans have been worried about the quality of the third game, presuming the company may be keen to move on.</p>
<p>"I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we'll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third installment," said Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>He additionally provided a status update on the project.</p>
<p>"Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely," he said. "A lot of the content is already playable, and the game's direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything."</p><p>For now, the game remains without a release date, but as Remake is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">heading to Switch 2 and Xbox in January</a>, and Square Enix has confirmed the whole trilogy will be coming to both platforms too, the final part presumably won't be released until after then. Perhaps it'll even be a simultaneous multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Indeed, the multiplatform release of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake project will certainly boost sales, helping to counter any decline in sales.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Windows Central</a>, Hamaguchi declared himself an Xbox fan. "I'm going to do my best to make sure that Square Enix can continue to reach a wider audience, including Xbox," he said. "So thank you from me as well."</p>
<p>He also discussed optimising the game for the Xbox Series S, which is notoriously tricky due to its lower specs.</p>
<p>"In terms of hardware specs, I would say the Xbox Series S is actually quite solid in terms of spec," said Hamaguchi. "We didn't come across much of a processing challenge, but many of the challenges were more memory related.</p><p>"Optimisation is something we were strongly cognizant of as we worked on the PC version as well. For Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we took some of the philosophies found in Nanite for Unreal Engine 5 and created our own solution for Unreal Engine 4. We were successful in delivering stable graphics there, and gain Steam Deck verification as well. We have been pretty proud of what we were able to achieve, even on lower spec systems."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has hinted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version">that game may also be headed to Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>There are two available game modes: Survival Capture and Survival Intrude. The first is a capture the flag style mode where players must secure a dwindling number of cute green Kerotan, and the latter a battle royale style mode where players must battle over a shrinking play area.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has proven popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-surpasses-a-million-sales-on-launch-day">selling over a million copies on its launch day earlier this month</a>. Since its launch the game has received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stability-improvements-promised-as-new-patch-addresses-crashes-and-textures">a variety of patches to improve stability and performance</a>, some good news for those who were waiting to give it a try.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is itself a fantastic recreation of the original game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">In Eurogamer's review</a> it's described as "an achievement for the development team behind Delta too, some of whom were original staff from the Metal Gear Solid 3 team. The legend of Metal Gear Solid 3 has been brought back to life thanks to their efforts, and the experience of playing it has put me in a position I could not have foreseen just a few years ago."</p>
