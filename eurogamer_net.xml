            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is reviving its beloved original map once again - but this time as a permanent mode.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 1 Season 1 of Fortnite will begin once more on 6th December, developer Epic Games said today, with future updates offering the chance to "relive OG seasons". 
</p>
<p>
Fans expect the permanent Fortnite OG mode to rotate through each of the game's first 10 seasons over time, giving players a chance to relive the map's various iterations. Remember when the meteor hit? When the iceberg arrived? When the volcano erupted?

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">Fortnite OG originally returned last November to enormous success</a>, giving the game its best-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours. As a result, Epic Games promised to revive Fortnite OG again this year. 
</p>
<p>
Exactly what that meant, however, remained unclear - until now. Earlier this year, Fortnite launched its faster-paced Reload mode based on a shrunk-down version of the game's OG map. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-estimated-release-date-and-time">Fortnite is currently hosting another OG-style take, this time of its Chapter 2 incarnation</a> - although now remixed with various musical stars like Eminem and Snoop Dogg. 
</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>THIS. IS. NOT. A. DRILL.</p><p>OG is coming BACK and is here to stay. Relive Battle Royale from the start and explore the OG map, collect OG loot, and relive OG seasons.

<p>
It should be made clear, all of this comes alongside Fortnite's next all-new map. Fortnite Chapter 6 is expected to arrive on Sunday, 1st December, meaning players have around five days to check that out before the OG mode goes live. 
</p>
<p>
What is Epic Games cooking? Well, based on leaks and teases, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-map-features-japanese-theme-leaks-suggest">Fortnite Chapter 6 looks like it'll have a Japanese vibe</a>.

            <p>We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games has released a half hour documentary all about its upcoming game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>South of Midnlight was first revealed in June last year, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-happy-few-developer-reveals-south-of-midnight-at-xbox-showcase">eye-catching and atmospheric stop motion trailer set in an alternate version of the American Deep South</a>. Described as a "fantastical" and "macabre third-person action-adventure", South of Midnight will place players in the role of a young Weaver named Hazel. And it is Hazel that this newly-released documentary has been named after.</p>

<p>Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary debuted today, and offers a fresh look at gameplay, as well as interviews with the cast and crew, who share more on behind-the-scenes processes and the game's inspiration.</p>
<p>Speaking in the documentary, creative director David Sears reflected on his own childhood, and his sense of exploration and discovery. His imagination led him to start creating his own adventure stories, as he made his way through the world around him. These stories often featured fantastical creatures and monsters.</p><p>It is this sense of adventure and discovery that Sears wants players to feel with South of Midnight. "The genesis of [South of] Midnight was my desire to create a love letter to the South," Sears said. As such, the creatures that Hazel will meet in South of Midnight have been inspired by folktales and urban legends from the South.</p>
<p>"Every region [in South of Midnight] has a distinctive creature, and they rule entirely," the developer said. "Each kingdom is structured so that you understand 'how did a creature become a monster'."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the landscapes are also inspired by real places found within the American Deep South such as New Orleans, with art director Whitney Clayton saying these locations are almost characters themselves.</p>
<p>As well as Sears, Ahmed Best - best known for playing Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars - also features in South of Midnight's documentary. Best serves as the game's performance and voice director. He and the cast note <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-of-midnight-developer-ensured-its-black-heroine-was-created-by-black-women">how important representation is in games like South of Midnight</a>. "When I think about how many games are set in the South with a strong Black female lead, I don't recall that many," said Hazel actress Adriyan Rae. "That in itself shows how important this is." </p><p>"I think it's really cool that a little Black girl could cosplay Hazel with the hair that is growing out of her head," added writer Zaire Lanier. "It is nice to see yourself reflected in a piece of media, and not in a way that feels sterotypical or inauthentic."</p>

<p>Those interested can pre-order the box set from Cook and Becker <a href="https://www.cookandbecker.com/en/artwork/3528/the-art-and-music-of-south-of-midnight-compulsion-games.html">starting today</a><em>.</em></p>
