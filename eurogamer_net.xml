Control fans eager to return to the depth of the Oldest House won't have long to wait. Remedy Entertainment has confirmed its three-player PvE Control spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, releases for PC and consoles on 17th June, with talk of plenty of post-launch support to come.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">unveiled last October</a>, promising a co-operative take on the Control universe in which players, cast as members of the Federal Bureau of Control's Firebreak response unit, must keep the Oldest House's numerous paranatural anomalies - from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreaks-latest-trailer-brings-extradimensional-furnaces-and-exploding-pink-goo">weird pink goo</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">sentient Post-It notes</a> - in check. Each Job takes players to different corners of the ever-changing building - some familiar and some new - and features different mechanics, enemies, objectives, and even status-effect-style conditions.
</p>
<p>
Remedy offered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s2x2a35wP8">another look at FBC: Firebreak in its latest developer livestream</a> earlier today, sharing details about the game's battle-pass-style progression system, Requisitions. These come in two flavours: standard Requisitions, which are free to all players, and premium Classified Requisitions, which must be purchased with real money.

<p>
Standard Requisitions contain weapons, armour, and equipment that can be unlocked using in-game currency earned through play, while items in Classified Requisitions are cosmetic only with no gameplay benefits. Notably, there's no expiration date on Requisitions, meaning players can unlock items in their own time. In addition to Requisitions, Remedy has outlined its post-launch content plans, confirming it intends to release at least new Jobs in 2025, with more coming next year. These will be free to all players.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fbc-firebreak-fc3830">Epic</a>) on 17th June. The standard edition costs £32.99/€39.99/$39.99 USD, and it'll also be available on day one via PC Game Pass, Game Pass Ultimate, and PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
</p>
<p>
Those looking for something a bit fancier can pick up FBC: Firebreak's Deluxe Edition which costs £39.99/€49.99/$49.99 USD and throws in a variety of premium cosmetics. These include the Firestarter and Pencil Pusher premium voice packs, the Golden Firebreak spray, the Firestarter armour set, the Scorched Remnant double-barrel shotgun skin, plus the premium Firestarter Classified Requisition, which features 36 unlockable cosmetics. Remedy notes standard edition owners can upgrade to the Deluxe version for £7/€10/$10.
