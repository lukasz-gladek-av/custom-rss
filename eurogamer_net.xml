<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> has been getting increasingly, delightfully weird over the last couple of years, leading up to last year's time-travelling, NPC-romancing blast back to 1999. And things are about to get even wilder when developer Digital Extremes invites players to start kicking boy band butt in its new Techrot Encore update, arriving on 19th March.
</p>
<p>
Techrot Encore sees Digital Extremes building on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-motorbiking-pal-romancing-boyband-battling-1999-expansion-finally-has-a-release-date">last year's 1999 update</a> by introducing a range of new gameplay systems. That begins with the introduction of the Technocyte Coda - a corruption of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88">Warframe's in-game 90s boy band On-lyne</a>, whose members (Harddrive, Zeke, Drillbit, Packet, and DJ RoM) will randomly appear in levels until players defeat them.
</p>
<p>
It's an adversary system - originally due to launch last year until it ballooned into something more expansive - that works similarly to Warframe's Kuva Lich and Sisters of Parvos. As such, players - who'll need to have completed The Hex quest first - can't have a Lich or Sister tied to them if they want to experience the Technocyte Coda. Oh and be warned that you'll gain a steadily growing pimple until you manage to defeat your bothersome boy band foe.

<p>
On top of that, Techrot Encore adds four new Protoframes to 1999's HÃ¶llvania Mall, which has been expanded to provide access to the grungy The Round Table pub. Here, players can meet Velimir (the Protoframe of Frost) and his ex-wife Minerva (Saryn), as well as brilliant young engineer Kaya Velasco, the Protoframe of Nova. And lastly, there's the David Bowie-inspired Flare - the only surviving member of a band called Temple, and the Protoframe for the game's musically inclined, talking-guitar-wielding 60th Warframe, Temple.
</p>
<p>
All these characters have a presence in the mall, meaning you can talk to them in the world, or delve deeper into their backstories through conversations using 1999's AOL-inspired KIN system. You won't, however, be able to romance any of the new NPCs. Not even the guitar.
</p>
<p>
Away from the story stuff, Kaya's your port of call for accessing Techrot Encore's tough new Temporal Archimedea missions. These can be played for various rewards, and feature a stackable sticker-inspired boost system players can explore to gain advantages while out in the field. That's alongside Flare's new Stage Defence missions, which see players venturing out to Solstice Square. Here, their job is to protect Temple from incoming foes across three waves (all Defence missions have been reduced to three waves in the new update) as he rocks out on stage in mourning for his bandmates.
</p>
<p>
Rewards for successfully completing a Stage Defence mission include Techrot Heartstrings. These can be given to Flare at The Round Table to get Temple's blueprints if you're not lucky enough to receive them as a mission reward. Temple, incidentally, is a heat-based Warframe with a distinct musical twist, given that he - and his sentient guitar Lizzy - gain an attack boost if players manage to cast his abilities on the beat.
</p>
<p>
Pyrotechnics, for instance, causes Temple to rock out on guitar and unleash pillars of fire, which can be doubled if deployed on the beat. Overdrive, meanwhile, is a crit debuff that spawns a circle of subwoofers to stun enemies, and can extend the duration of Ripper's Wail if on-beat. Speaking of which, this one's a buff ability that heals player and makes them invulnerable for a time, all while giving fire damage to allies. Landing on the beat makes healing twice as effective. And finally there's Exalted Solo, which turns Lizzy into a flame thrower (because why not!) that can be augmented with additional electricity attacks.
</p>
<p>
And there's plenty more! Techrot Encore also features a new Rainbow Road-inspired bike-racing arcade game known as Ollie's Crash Course, and brings new Ollie-themed cosmetics, including an Ollie floof. That's alongside a huge range of adjustments and quality of life improvents, including Warframe augments for Gyre, Qorvex, Koumei, and Wisp, plus a Pseudo Exalted Rework for Kora, Atlas, Gard, and Ash. Players can also expect a shortened Star Chart path - making it easier to access the Second Dream quest and the wild new content Warframe's added in the last few years. There's also easier Archwing crafting, plus changes to make The Duviri Paradox and the The Hex Quest more replayable. And most exciting of all, there'll finally be a way to replay Fortuna's iconic We All Lift Together cinematic.
</p>
<p>
All this will be available when Warframe's expansive (and free) Techrot Encore update launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 19th March.

            <p>
Minecraft's live-action movie adaptation is almost upon us, and with its 4th April release date looming, Warner Bros. has shared a "final" trailer - giving us a quick glimpse of Jack Black's Nether region, as well as Jennifer Coolidge in a still-mysterious role.
</p>
<p>
For this fourth and final trailer, the bombastic action of earlier showings is cranked even higher, as huge armies of classic Minecraft mobs - including Piglin Brutes and Iron Golems - amass for some sort climactic set-piece battle. That's balanced out by some sillier moments, but none of this is likely to win over anyone who's previously been put off by the <em>ugliness</em> of it all.
</p>
<p>
We get even more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-its-villagers-and-they-are-sight-for-sore-eyes">those nightmare villagers</a>, as well as Ghasts that looked like they've just slipped in from some eldritch dimension. I'm still not convinced by the Creepers either, given what I'd always assumed were a sort of sentient cactus have been reimagined as angry shoeboxes covered in astroturf. Thank goodness for Jennifer Coolidge, then, who immediately improves the situation at the end of the trailer, simply by being Jennifer Coolidge.

<p>
The Minecraft movie, if you haven't been keeping up, follows four "misfits" - played by Sebastian Hansen, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Jason Momoa - who're suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a "bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination". To get back home, they'll need to embark on a magical quest with help from Jack Black's Steve.
</p>
<p>
I can't honestly say the Minecraft movie is something I'll personally be rushing out to watch based on everything Warner Bros. has shown so far, but it does at least look like the kind of harmlessly amusing fluff that - between its silly gags and mild peril - should shut the kids up for an hour or two. And if that suits, it's coming to cinemas on 4th April.

In other Minecraft news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">Netflix's animated Minecraft series</a> is getting closer to release, and there's some real-world Minecraft on the way too, as Alton Towers owner Merlin Entertainments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-attractions-set-to-open-in-uk-and-us-as-85m-deal-with-alton-towers-owner-signed">readies to open a number of Minecraft attractions</a> in the UK and US.

            <p>
IGN Live will return this June for a second year, with plans for an even bigger physical event in Los Angeles during the summer's annual game announcement season.
</p>
<p>
Held once again at LA's Magic Box downtown event space, IGN Live (organised by Eurogamer's parent company, IGN Entertainment) will feature various hands-on oppurtunities, plus a stage with fresh reveals and trailers, interviews and celebrity panels.
</p>
<p>
Last year, IGN Live welcomed Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> to the stage, and featured over 100 gaming stations. The plans for this year's edition are even bigger, organisers have said.
</p>
<p>
For those across the pond, more details on dates and tickets, when announced, will be available at <a href="http://ign.com/live">IGN.com/live</a>. Alternatively, you'll be able to follow the biggest announcements live online.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">E3 might be dead and buried</a>, but the beginning of June remains a time we're all glued to the internet to find out what's next from the games industry.
</p>
<p>
Expect the usual glut of publisher shows around the same time, including the regular conferences from Microsoft, Sony, Ubisoft and more - and hopefully more from Nintendo as it gets ready to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.
