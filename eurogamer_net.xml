            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has received one last patch in its early access journey ahead of a full release, though there's still no release date.</p>
<p>This new patch, the eleventh, includes "further improvements, balance adjustments, and fixes based on your feedback and what we've observed" developer Supergiant Games stated in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512964244473382774">Steam blog post on the patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>There's a long list of minor tweaks, adjusting the balance of multiple weapons and boons, as well as changes to enemy encounter rates, adjusted visuals and music, and of course some bug fixes.</p>

<p>The developer also noted: "In preparation for our v1.0 launch and forthcoming story sequences surrounding the True Ending, please note that any Zodiac Sand or Void Lens resources you have when you load your save progress at that time will automatically be converted to Prestige."</p>
<p>Still, what we're all after is a full release date, and there's no sign of that yet.</p>
<p>Hades 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-fresh-early-access-update-as-development-finally-approaches-full-release">received a sizable update back in June</a>. "We're heading into the final phase of Hades 2 development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches," said Supergiant at the time. "Please note we do not yet have a v1.0 launch date, though we'll share more as soon as we can."</p>
<p>For now, Hades 2 is available in early access on Steam, but its full launch will include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">release on both Switch and Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive</a> - just like the first game (after its own PC early access period).</p>
<p>The original Hades later arrived on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and then iOS.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release]]></content:encoded>
