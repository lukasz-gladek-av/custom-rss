            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will include console-only crossplay, meaning Xbox and PlayStation players can avoid those pesky cheating PC players.</p>
<p>Senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson detailed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042">IGN</a> the online shooter's crossplay options, activated with a simple on/off toggle. Turned on, console players will be prioritised before PC players fill a lobby. Turned off, and only console players will be included across both PlayStation and Xbox. The option is turned on by default.</p>
<p>"We're very confident but also very keen to what crossplay means for Battlefield 6," said Nickerson. "We've gone the extra mile and put in a lot of effort in terms of balancing the inputs, understanding where the inputs lie [not just] in terms of relationship to general play styles but general performance of what they're good at and maybe what they lack."</p>

<p>Cheating is a major issue across online shooters, with PC players being the most likely to cheat. That's why console players often prefer to exclude them, if possible.</p>
<p>Technical director Christian Buhl said Battlefield Studios is "taking cheating extremely seriously".</p>
<p>"Obviously, cheating is much more prevalent on PC than on console, but we are taking a lot of effort, putting a lot of work into prioritising fighting against cheaters," he said. "We've turned on secure boot. We've got Javelin, our new anti-cheat system, which is required in order to play.</p><p>"So, we're doing a lot on the PC side to clamp down on cheating as much as possible. We have a whole team within Battlefield dedicated to anti-cheat, which includes engineers, analysts who are reviewing things and banning players, and figuring out what the latest cheats are. We have another whole dedicated team at EA to anti-cheat that we work closely with. That's what I can say. Now, we can never win against cheaters, right? Cheaters will always be there. It's a never-ending cat-and-mouse game. I can't promise that there will be zero cheaters if you're playing against PC players. That's just simply not possible, but I can say that we are being extremely aggressive. We see this as critical to the success of - to the health of - the game."</p>
<p>Console players also use aim assist to balance play with PC players using mouse and keyboard for increased accuracy. But aim assist has been "completely redone" from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, said Nickerson.</p>
<p>"We've added aim assist for what we call our 'combat triangle' now - and that's infantry versus infantry, infantry versus vehicles, and vehicles versus vehicles - to give that cohesive experience if you are on controller, compared to, maybe, something that's a little bit easier on keyboard and mouse. So [we're] very dedicated to crossplay, and we're trying to nail it across multiple vectors when it comes to crossplay. It's just such an important aspect for us and for Battlefield 6."</p>
<p>It's all part of the studio's console-first approach. It's this that's led to strong optimisation across consoles.</p>
<p>Buhl explained to <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487">Kotaku</a> the team struggled to get the game running on Xbox Series S due to its lack of memory, with levels crashing. As a result, the team has optimised memory usage in the game which has in turn made the "whole game better and more stable".</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 will release on 10th October across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon">don't expect a Switch 2 release any time soon</a>.</p>
