            <p>OutRun is the next video game to be reportedly getting itself a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>As revealed by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">Deadline</a>, sources say Universal is planning to release a film based on Sega's arcade video game, with with Michael Bay - known for the likes of Bad Boys, The Rock ("Welcome to The Rock!") and the first five films in the Transformers film series - acting as director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Euphoria and The White Lotus actress Sydney Sweeney is attached to produce the film, with Jayson Rothwell on writing duties. Rothwell's previous credits include <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4139588/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Polar (2019)</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2347497/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Silent Night (2012)</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397753/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Zemanovaload (2005)</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, further details are fairly thin on the ground. In the words of Deadline, "plot details are vague". Given its source material, though, we can assume that it will have something to do with racing. Perhaps, more specifically, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-of-the-best-cars">racing in a Ferrari</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Martin Robinson wrote a feature dedicated to OutRun back in 2019.</p>
<p>"I've made OutRun's journey countless times over the years, whether that's in one of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>'s virtual Hong Kong arcades, via M2's phenomenal 3DS port or more recently its Switch effort," he wrote in his snappily titled article <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outrun-is-still-the-pinnacle-of-driving-games">OutRun is still the pinnacle of driving games</a>.</p>
<p>"Such platforms can only deliver a sliver of the full experience, though - playing OutRun on the deluxe cabinet is a revelation. It's an all-body experience, a kind of funky alternative to virtual reality that plays to all of your senses."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in video game to big screen news, earlier this month a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-teaser-for-five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-is-here">new teaser trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was revealed</a>. Additionally back in January, Sony announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers 2 were both being adapted into films</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
