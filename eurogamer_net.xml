<p>There are some decent games here well worth your time. As a Sonic fan, I personally had a very fun time with the open world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>, while I maintain <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a> is a great action-adventure unfairly maligned.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> has been usurped by the brand new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, while GTA 3 leaves just as GTA 5 joins.</p>
<figure>

<p>It's also a shame that both Arcade Paradise VR and Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge will soon be off the service, leaving PSVR2 with even fewer games to play.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-november">new slate of games added to PS Plus joined yesterday</a>, including the likes of Still Wakes the Deep and Thank Goodness You're Here, alongside the aforementioned GTA 5.</p>

            <p>The developer of indie game Megabonk has withdrawn from The Game Awards after being nominated for Debut Indie Game.</p>
<p>Following the nominations reveal earlier this week, the developer of the game has admitted Megabonk is in fact not his debut game - he's been making games under different studio names.</p>
<p>"I'm withdrawing from The Game Awards," the developer shared on social media. "It's an honour and a dream for Megabonk to be nominated for TGA, but unfortunately I don't think it qualifies for the category 'Debut Indie Game'. I've made games in the past under different studio names, so Megabonk is not my debut game."</p>

<p>He added: "I really appreciate the nomination, support and votes, but it doesn't feel right in this category. You should vote for another one of the amazing debut titles, they are all amazing games! Thanks again! new megabonk update coming soon."</p>
<p>The post is signed off as John Megabonk and includes a disguised face emoji. That's because the developer himself is something of a mystery, which has inevitably, confusingly, led to this nomination.</p> <div>

            <p>A new Battlefield 6 update has extended the time required to capture objectives in one of its major game modes, and has gone back to fix an ongoing issue with its challenge system. In addition, somehow, many players had their controls reset. Accidentally, one assumes.</p>
<p>The major game mode change comes to Escalation, a new mode to Battlefield 6, where large teams of players fight over a limited number of control points. When one of these is captured, a control point is removed from the match.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1990799899080688037">The official statement</a> released alongside this change states: "Following your feedback to our communication last week, Escalation now has had its time increased for capturing objectives by roughly 20 percent, extending the length of each phase for a smoother, more tactical flow. This change gives your squad more time to react, reposition, and coordinate vehicle spawns while maintaining the mode's fast-paced intensity."</p>

</figure>
<p>Next up, a fix to challenges not being registered as completed despite players reaching the required milestone. This appears to have been a consequence of the widespread challenge adjustments made a short while ago, shifting them to be easier to finish in response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">player frustrations at how difficult completing some challenges were</a>.</p><p>The statement explains this should  now be remedied in the latest update. It reads: "We've also deployed backend fixes for challenge rewards not unlocking correctly. These updates address issues where completed challenges could fail to grant rewards or appear multiple times. Participating in a match should now reward you with any outstanding rewards from challenges."</p>
<p>Finally, a fun little change to kill-death statistics has been made, so kills made against computer-controlled bots no longer count for player statistics (often used as evidence of player skill). Funnily enough, deaths to bots still appear to be counted, so bots may still be able to make you look <em>worse</em> at Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>The Battlefield update statement concludes with: "Additionally, we have also rolled out a small change to how Player Kill/Death statistics are shown within your Player Profile. Going forward Portal Kill/Death Statistics will no longer be listed within the Kill/Death amount on your profile and Kill will only showcase Human Kills. Portal statistics will be shown in a different capacity in a future time."</p>
<p>Then there's what is clearly an unintended consequence of this update, which are widespread reports of reset controls following its addition to Battlefield 6. Across social media and community hubs like Discord and Reddit, users are complaining about their own custom control schemes being reset to the default. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1p0ef5a/comment/npibpyw/?context=3">Take Spetsnaz_420</a>, who wrote: "You left out the part where you reset our controls".</p><p>This marks the latest in an extensive spree of updates made to Battlefield 6. It was just over a week ago when Battlefield Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-update-fixes-recon-drone-exploit-letting-players-ride-them-into-the-sky-without-a-care-in-the-world">killed the Recon Drone bug</a> letting players float far up into the sky. All while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the game remains incredibly popular</a>.</p>
