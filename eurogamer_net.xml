            <p>The second season of HBO's The Last of Us is almost upon us, and finally more about Catherine O'Hara's new character has been revealed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">O'Hara's casting was announced in February of last year</a>, although at this time who she was playing remained a mystery. There were rumours her character was called Gail, and these have ultimately been proven correct. But, who exactly is Gail?</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us (both games and the show) below</strong>.</p>

<p>In an interview during The Last of Us season 2's premiere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann confirmed O'Hara is playing a therapist living in Jackson, but also that she is - somewhat of a surprise to me - Eugene's wife. This marks a significant change from the games, and has made me curious about what this will mean for season two's story.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">it was announced Joe Pantoliano had joined The Last of Us' cast as Eugene</a>, a character mentioned in Part 2 but who doesn't appear in person, barring collectables.</p>

<p>In the game, Eugene is a patrolman who lived in Jackson before dying of a stroke aged 73. Prior to his death, he formed a close relationship with Dina (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-dina-and-alien-romulus-have-an-unexpected-connection">played in the show by Isabel Merced</a>). Little else is really known about Eugene, but players can find a letter in the game which reveals he had a wife and daughter, however he left them to join the Fireflies, where he served with Joel's brother Tommy.</p>

<p>The showrunners previously said Eugene's story was going to be expanded upon for the show, with an episode akin to season one's Bill and Frank episode, so I assumed this meant they would be telling Eugene's story of leaving his family to join the Fireflies. Maybe it still will, and maybe O'Hara plays Eugene's second wife butâ€¦ how will the fact that Joel killed a load of the Fireflies at the end of the first season impact those therapy sessions?!</p>
<p>Ooh, I am looking forward to finding out. You can check out a clip of O'Hara as Gail with Pedro Pascal's Joel in the second season of The Last of Us below.</p>

<p>During the same The Last of Us premiere event, <a href="https://x.com/Variety/status/1904351105447809242">Druckmann also teased some of the show's impactful moments</a>, noting during the filming of episode six of season two: "Our actors...left a piece of their soul in this episode."</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us will kick off next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. Spores have been confirmed for The Last of Us' second season, with the showrunners <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-promises-viewers-a-different-evolution-of-infection-plus-spores-make-a-return">promising viewers "a different evolution" of infection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
