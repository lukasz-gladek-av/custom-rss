            <p>According to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025"> Battlefield 6</a> head Vince Zempella, the upcoming military FPS will not be coming to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. Sorry, Nintendo fans.</p>
<p>In an interview with Eurogamer, Zempella confirmed that EA "doesn't currently" have plans to bring the game to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and that Battlefield Studios is currently focused on PC, PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<p>When asked why, Zampella confirms that those were the platforms where the core Battlefield audience is present, though he adds that he is "a huge Switch fan".</p>

<p>As of today, Battlefield Studios revealed the multiplayer trailer for Battlefield 6, as part of a global event where press and creators get to try out the game out ahead of the its launch on October 10.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">&gt;In Eurogamer's preview</a>, I noted:</p>
<blockquote>"Battlefield 6's multiplayer is a bold spin on a formula enshrined in the hearts of FPS fans around the world. Instantly recognisable with bombastic battles and a polyamorous partnership between boots-on-the-ground, vehicular, and aerial warfare."</blockquote>
<p>The game is also set to have open beta weekends on the 9th August and 14th August, so that'll give eager fans a chance to try it out ahead of launch. Unless all you own is a Switch 2, in which case... bad luck.</p>
<p>The game will have crossplay, as confirmed at the press and creator preview, as well as the Battlefield Portal; an improved map and game mode creator that'll allow players to build their own experiences that'll be shared among other Battlefield 6 players.</p>
<p>Do you think Battlefield 6 is missing out with its absence on the Switch 2? Or do you think the console doesn't really make sense as a home for a modern military FPS? Let us know below!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-not-coming-to-the-switch-2-any-time-soon]]></content:encoded>
