            <p>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have shared a release date for their new action-adventure IP, Hell is Us.</p>
<p>Hell is Us will release later this year, on 4th September, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>We also got a new trailer for Hell is Us during this evening's State of Play, which you can see below. There may just be a voice you recognise.</p>

<p>Yep, that was Elias Toufexis chatting away during today's Hell is Us trailer, aka Adam Jensen from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series. Toufexis is voicing the game's protagonist, Rémi.</p>
<p>"I'm delighted to join my friends on Hell Is Us," Toufexis said in a press release following news of his participation. "I wanted to take this role because Rémi is particularly interesting: while he may seem cold or reserved at first, we gradually discover the complexity of his character, and the events that have shaped his personality.</p>
<p>"The world of the game is so endlessly fascinating. I can't wait for people to play it!"</p>
<p>If you also can't wait to play, you can pre-order yourself Hell is Us. Pre-orders are now open on the PlayStation Store and will open in the coming days for those interested in playing on either Xbox or PC.</p>
<p>Our Lottie had a little shot with Hell is Us last year. "The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">Eurogamer's Hell is Us Gamescom preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Housemarque, the studio behind the sublime likes of Nex Machina and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>, has unveiled Saros - a third-person action game that's coming to PS5 next year.
</p>
<p>
Details on Saros are slim right now, but we do know it's a single-player game set on a "hostile, shape-shifting planet, haunted by an ominous eclipse." It stars The Fall of the House of Usher's Rahul Kohli in the lead role, with its gameplay said to build on the third-person action seen in Housemarque's critically acclaimed Returnal.
</p>
<p>
Saros' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rK4W-hBrSZs">cinematic announcement trailer</a>, which incongruously opens with the sound of laughing children, sees Kohli waking on a beach beneath a shrouded alien sun, only to encounter a terrifying multi-limbed creature rising from beneath the pitch-black water. "Every time the sun dies," Kohli's character intones in voiceover, "madness reigns, then everything begins again. But after every death, I always come back stronger."

<p>
That final sentence - reflected in the game's Come Back Stronger tagline - certainly implies Housemarque will be revisiting the roguelite structure seen in 2021's acclaimed Returnal (and the bullet hell swirl of Kohli's subsequently unloading weapon is a classic Housemarque touch), but whether Saros has anything more than a spiritual connection to Returnal remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
Saros launches next year for PlayStation with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhancements also promised, and Housemarque says it'll be sharing a first look at gameplay later this year.
