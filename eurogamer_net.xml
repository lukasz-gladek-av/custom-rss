            <p>When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a>, from Ukrainian developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>, was released last month after multiple delays, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">sold exceptionally well</a> but received a mixed reaction from critics due mainly to issues with its performance and bugs. </p>
<p>However, another delay simply wasn't an option for the team, which found itself exhausted at the end of a long development during a time of war.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer this week, GSC Game World studio CEO Ievgen Grygorovych compared the game's development and delays to running multiple marathons. "It's very hard to explain your state when you're in a very intensive work process for many months until release, and you're working over, over, over what you usually can do and in the highest possible stress and overwhelming period," he said.</p>

<p>"You have no energy at all and you decide - should we take one more marathon? And you just can't say yes, let's make one more marathon, because you're already broken."</p>
<p>Even with more time to polish the game, there was never a time where everything was fixed, added Grygorovych. And with the end of the year and its key sales period looming, the decision was made to continue on and release Stalker 2 in the best state possible.</p><p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," said Grygorovych. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'." After that, further patches and story expansions can then always be added, he continued.</p>
<p>I spoke with Grygorovych, and creative director (and his wife) Mariia Grygorovych, after a screening at BAFTA of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">documentary War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> (which you can watch on YouTube, above). The film follows development of the game during Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It's a powerful and harrowing watch that provides further context to the game and explains its status as a political piece of art.</p>
<p>In particular, one thread of the film explores the development team grappling with traitorous feelings as they fled Ukraine for their own safety - though other team members did remain in Kyiv to lend support. I had to ask, then: has that feeling changed since the release of the game?</p>
<p>Grygorovych noted the "good response from players from our nation" and the extent of coverage from TV news outlets mentioning the game and the release of its patches. "It's something so unimportant in the scale of the country, but they were talking about the game!" he said.</p><p>"It touched everyone in the country, but after releasing this it slightly justified that, yes we left our country and decided not to stay there, but we still made something that could help Ukraine in some way. We are artists, we are creative people, but it was our way to bring value to our country."</p>
<p>He continued: "When you finish the project, you release it and show that it's a good game. And not everyone will love it, that's ok, but for the people who like it we made them happier."</p>

<p>Releasing the game (and the documentary) has helped highlight the plight of Stalker 2's developers, but also raise awareness of the continuing situation in Ukraine at large, Grygorovych continued. "It's very important to remind people what's going on, because when there is something evil and you stop calling it out and mentioning it... it won't help to stop it," he said.</p><p>"One layer is we are making the game and we want to entertain people and make it as good a game as possible. And second, it's about what we can do for our homeland, because we are in a hard situation. I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</p>
<p>As such, the only way to develop and release the game was to divide the team and make it work across two offices in two countries - one in Kyiv and another in Prague. Yet Mariia Grygorovych added that had the team remained in Kyiv, it still would've released the game in some form. "I can't imagine that we would give up in this theoretical situation," she said, "because giving up is something not about even our culture. It's hard but you will do it. Why? Because we don't have any options. Why is Ukraine even fighting with big evil Russia? Because we don't have any options."</p>
<blockquote>"I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</blockquote>
<p>Stalker 2 has proven so popular in the studio's homeland that there were countrywide internet issues for five or six hours once the game was released. "It was hard for the whole country and it's a bad thing because the internet is important, but at the same time it's like whoa!" she said.</p>
<p>"For us and our team what's most important is, for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier than they were before release," she continued. "We did something for our home country, something good for them.</p>
<p>"It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems. But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems, you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p><p>As for fixing those bugs, Ievgen Grygorovych said doing so was the easy part in comparison to the creative process of making the game itself. Still, it struggled with wanting to release the game in a playable state, and not make matters worse by introducing fixes to some issues that then destablised other parts of the game elsewhere.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, GSC Gameworld's team say they are still adjusting to their new normal, split over two locations and with Ukraine's future still uncertain. Grygorovych believes the studio is now forever changed. "It's like an evolution," he said. "There's no way for evolution to move somewhere in the past... it leads you to the place where we are now and it's impossible to get back to the place that was safer, better, warmer. We are in this state and sadly we can't go back, but we can move forward and we can be better."</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-gets-third-big-patch-in-less-than-a-week-this-one-targeting-crashes-memory-leaks-and-more">Stalker 2 received its third major patch</a> in less than a week, bringing crash fixes and more.</p>
<p>The game's success has also reportedly made it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">target of a Russian disinformation campaign</a> claiming it's used to draft players into the Ukraine war.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Breakout musical movie success Wicked has signed itself up to a crossover with... Funko Fusion, meaning you can wobble around its world as big-headed versions of Elphaba, Glinda, the Wizard and Madame Morrible.
</p>
<p>
For the uninitiated, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funko-fusion-is-a-co-op-clash-of-big-headed-pop-culture-brands">Funko Fusion is an action-adventure game solely based around the power of brand crossovers</a>. Character packs are available for a range of prices, from free up to around a tenner for a few extra figures.
</p>
<p>
Funko Fusion is developed by 10:10 Games, the Warrington-based studio founded by Jon Burton, former boss of licensed Lego outfit TT Games. Similar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a>, Funko Fusion hosts an eye-opening array of intellectual properties, from Back to the Future's Marty McFly to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> Freddy Fazbear to Hot Fuzz's Nicholas Angel and Danny Butterman.

<p>
Alongside those are characters from (deep breath) Battlestar Galactica, Chucky, Jaws, Jurassic World, Knight Rider, Masters of the Universe, M3gan, Mega Man, Scott Pilgrim, Shaun of the Dead, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, The Walking Dead and Xena: Warrior Princess. KFC's Colonel Sanders is also in. Also, Bob Ross.
</p><p>
What is this feeling? Gameplay-wise, Funko Fusion is very much a spiritual successor to Lego Dimensions - though without the natural charm of Lego and with more digital plastic. Does its array of licensed IP outweigh its simple gameplay? Well, you can't defy gravity.
</p>
<p>
Next up for Funko Fusion? Characters from the US version of The Office.

            <p>It appears The Thing: Remastered has secured itself a release date, and not only that, it appears that date is imminent.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/29/next-week-on-xbox-new-games-for-december-2-to-6/">Xbox Wire post</a>, The Thing: Remastered is set to arrive tomorrow, 5th December.</p>
<p>However, as noted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-thing-remastered-release-date-quietly-revealed-for-later-this-week">IGN</a>, other platforms such as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/">Steam</a> still have the upcoming game listed as simply 'Coming Soon'. The <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10011616">PlayStation store</a> has The Thing: Remastered down as 'Announced', but with no further release date information provided. Meanwhile, a recent post on social media platform X by developer <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1864064101829554268">Nightdive</a> stated the game was set for a December release, but it didn't specify a date.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Nightdive - which was also responsible for last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake - for clarification on The Thing: Remastered's release date. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>The Thing: Remastered was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightdives-the-thing-remaster-is-official-and-coming-later-this-year">announced earlier this year</a>. It casts players as United States Army Special Forces member Captain Blake, who heads to the Antarctic outpost seen in the movie to find out what happened to its ill-fated research team.</p>
<p>The game itself promises players plenty of "blood-curdling events" and "enigmatic deaths". So, even though The Thing: Remastered may well be releasing this December, it is less about sleigh bells and more about slay bells.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you want to take a look at the studio's previous work, we were rather impressed with its System Shock remake, giving it four out of five stars on release.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo will no longer launch its Alarmo alarm clock to the general public this January within Japan, the company has said, blaming its "production and inventory situation".
</p>
<p>
Alarmo has been available for several months here in Europe, and in America, but only to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. In Japan, the popularity of the product - and the lack of stock - led Nintendo to open a lottery for subscribers to get a chance of obtaining one.
</p>
<p>
A wider launch for Alarmo had been set for January worldwide, but Nintendo has now <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/1204.html">said</a> this won't happen - at least in Japan. Eurogamer has asked Nintendo UK whether there has been any similar impact to the company's European plans.

</figure>
<p>
There's no word yet on when Alarmo's postponed public launch will actually occur in Japan. As it is, Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in the country who pre-order an Alarmo from mid-December face a wait for delivery until February 2025.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's stock issues come as the company quietly prepares for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. Nintendo is yet to make any comment on the device's manufacturing or production schedule, but has said it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">publicly unveil the console before the end of March 2025</a>.  Last month, an analyst told Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">the "ship had sailed" on Nintendo lifting the lid this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
After a couple of weeks waking up to Alarmo each morning, I ultimately decided its fun probably wasn't worth the £99 price tag, despite an array of tunes themed around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a>, Mario, Zelda and other top franchises.</p>
<p>
  "Alarmo's clever motion sensor is the star of the show in this pricey Nintendo-coated lifestyle gadget that otherwise skimps on the fun," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Eurogamer's Nintendo Alarmo review</a>.
