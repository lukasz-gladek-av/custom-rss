            <p>If you enjoyed your flirtations (and more) with Astarion in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and want more, well, you can now romance the sultry vampire in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>This new line of romance comes thanks to the fan made Baldur's Village mod, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romanceable-baldurs-gate-3-companions-are-being-modded-into-stardew-valley">which we first got wind of last year</a>.</p>
<p>"A new village has recently been built north of Pelican Town, and its new residents seem... rather unusual," <a href="https://x.com/XunHe1145/status/1898186199790981284">reads a post on social media</a>, announcing the mod's arrival.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Baldur's Village mod is described as a "large expansion mod for Stardew Valley". Along with the ability to romance and eventually marry Astarion, this mod also adds new stores including a tavern, and other Baldur's Gate 3-inspired characters.</p>
<p>While Astarion is the only romanceable character right now, more are planned for down the line, with Halsin's storyline the next focus</p>
<p>"Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items," the Baldur's Village creators explained.</p>
<p>The mod's creators also assure that Baldur's Village will not "alter or break the original game", and you won't need to start a new save to play.</p>
<p>Interested? You can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">find the Baldur's Village mod on Nexus</a>.</p>

<p>As for Stardew Valley, as of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">the farming sim has sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p>
<p>Last year, creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone also released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status. This beefy update introduced a vast number of features to the base game, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations and turtle pets</a>. This update was released on PC first, before becoming available across all platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 2.30pm UK:</strong> Nintendo's Alarmo is on general sale now worldwide.</p>
<p>Previously only available for Nintendo Switch Online members, the clock is available for all exclusively on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo-2670177.html">My Nintendo Store</a> in the UK and Ireland. It's also on general sale on the European and American My Nintendo Stores.</p>
<p>Emails were sent over the weekend to customers notifying them of the change. Perhaps Nintendo only updated its notice earlier today in Japan due to the popularity of the product there in comparison to the rest of the world.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 12pm UK:</strong> Nintendo has announced its Alarmo clock will be available on general sale in Japan in May.</p>
<p>Previously, only Nintendo Switch Online members have been able to order the alarm clock worldwide, though in Japan a lottery system was put in place due to its popularity.</p>
<p>A wider launch of the clock was expected in mid-January, but this was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hits-snooze-on-alarmos-public-release">later postponed to early March</a> due to stock shortages. The clock will finally be ready for general sale in May - but only in Japan.</p>

<p>Nintendo Japan added an update to its <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2024/1204.html">Alarmo notice</a>, stating the launch date for non-members will be 22nd May 2025, both from the My Nintendo Store and game retailers. Pre-orders will open before this, though a date is unknown.</p>
<p>So far this is only in Japan, but presumably news of a worldwide general release will follow.</p> <div>

<p>First revealed in October, the Alarmo is an interactive alarm clock that responds to your body's movements by playing different sounds based on Nintendo video games.</p>
<p>Indeed, Nintendo has today added classic sound effects from Super Mario Bros. on the NES to the device, available to download for free.</p>

<p>Last month, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-coming-in-june-at-400-former-nintendo-employee-predicts">former Nintendo employee</a> - sales lead in the sales and retail department - suggested the Alarmo release being tied to Nintendo Online accounts may have been an intentional test ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> pre-orders.</p>
<p>Switch 2 is yet to have its release date announced. Perhaps the general sale of Alarmo in May will free up Nintendo's online store for the new console.</p>
<p>"Alarmo's clever motion sensor is the star of the show in this pricey Nintendo-coated lifestyle gadget that otherwise skimps on the fun," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-review-marios-charm-cant-justify-alarm-clocks-90-price-tag">Alarmo review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Doom: The Dark Ages serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom and its sequel Doom Eternal, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">tells the "epic cinematic origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage"</a>. But, even though it's a prequel, don't expect The Dark Ages to end with the Slayer being popped in a coffin.</p>
<p>As a reminder, 2016's Doom opens with the Slayer lying in a coffin, before he swiftly breaks free from the chains binding him so he can shoot the faces off advancing baddies. It is quite the way to kick things off.</p>
<p>So, if The Dark Ages is going to set us up for Doom 2016, surely we already know how the upcoming game is going to end, right? Wrong!</p>

<p>"I mean, that would end the Dark Ages, the medieval chapter of the Doom saga. This is kind of like the Chronicles of the Slayer," Doom: The Dark Ages game director Hugo Martin told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-end-with-the-slayer-in-a-coffin-waiting-for-the-start-of-doom-2016-that-would-mean-that-we-couldnt-tell-any-more-medieval-stories/">PC Gamer</a>, when asked about potentially seeing the Slayer getting locked away.</p>
<p>"So if we took it all the way to that point, then that would mean that we couldn't tell any more medieval stories. And I'm not announcing projects or anything other than to just say it's better to leave it open."</p>
<p>The game director added that the Doom: The Dark Ages team has some DLC planned for the prequel, so again putting the Slayer in a coffin during the main story wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>"We do have a DLC and things like that, so it won't - I'm not giving away spoilers - but it doesn't end with him [in the coffin]," the developer continued.</p>
<p>"The story is that they collapsed a building on top of him and then put him inside of that sarcophagus that we find him in at the beginning of 2016," said Martin.</p>
<p>"And this game doesn't end that way."</p>
