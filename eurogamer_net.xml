            <p>A major shareholder in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released a 100-page document criticising the company for its poor sales and urging for a "fundamental reassessment of the medium-term management plan".</p>
<p>3D Investment Partners is the third largest shareholder in Square Enix, with a 14.36 percent stake it began amassing back in April. Now the Singapore-based investment firm has gone public with its critique of the company, after reportedly being dissatisfied with Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu's response to its analysis back in October (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enixs-major-shareholder-drops-100-page-presentation-criticizing-how-the-company-is-managed-rallies-other-shareholders/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.3dipartners.com/wp-content/uploads/square-enix-presentation-material-en-202512.pdf">The report</a> states Square Enix is a "preeminent Japanese game developer" that "possesses globally renowned game titles" including Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. However, it's seen a "significant deterioration in earning power" and the investment firm believes the current management plan is insufficient in revitalising the company.</p>

<p>That management plan was shared by Square Enix last year, as it announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a> for its games, aiming to "diversify earnings opportunities" following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">review of its development system</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-abandons-112m-of-in-development-projects-in-an-effort-to-improve-quality">abandonment of £112m of in-development projects</a>.</p><p>3D Investment Partners has argued Square Enix has stagnating profit margins. Games sales have reduced and margins have declined, which the investor attributes to platform exclusivity, poor revenue return on advertising expenditures, low sales of its legacy games, and excessive development costs, among many factors.</p>
<p>The document also goes to great lengths to compare Square Enix with key Japanese competitors like Capcom and Konami to highlight its lack of success, while claiming Square Enix relies too much on the domestic Japanese market and is failing to grow overseas.</p>
<p>It should be noted Square Enix is addressing some of these issues already - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-remake-are-finally-on-xbox-but-is-it-too-late">Final Fantasy 16 made its way to Xbox</a> this year following PlayStation exclusivity, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy will be coming to both Xbox and Switch 2</a> in future.</p>
<p>What's more, 3D Investment Partners is here an activist investor stirring up outside support. It offers little in the way of tangible advice, beyond picking holes in Square Enix's strategy, seemingly with an agenda to oust Kiryu as CEO. It's unclear where sales data in the report has been taken from, while sentiment against the likes of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake (which was certainly successful) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> (which certainly has a fanbase) have been hand-picked from Metacritic to highlight harsh criticism.</p><p>Still, the investment company claims Square Enix's current "Reboots" strategy justifies its lacklustre performance and fails to "articulate a forward-looking vision". Further, it highlights a "lack of synergy with non-gaming", stating its cross-media strategy with films, anime and the like is lagging, as are merchandise sales. Additionally, Square Enix's arcade and publishing (manga) business are said to be significantly underperforming.</p>
<p>The report comes at a critical time for Square Enix. The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">admitted last year both Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth initially failed to meet sales expectations</a>. Its earnings report in May this year showed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sees-game-sales-drop-but-multiplatform-strategy-continues-in-earnest">year-on-year drop in sales of its single player games</a>, although profit did increase due to strong sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake.</p>
<p>Then, in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">Square Enix announced it wants generative AI to do 70 percent of QA work</a> by 2027. This announcement came alongside <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-announces-mass-layoffs-as-restructuring-plan-pulls-development-from-overseas">mass layoffs as the company's "fundamental restructuring" plan pulled resources from "overseas" development</a> - an unknown number of US employees are at risk, while reportedly 137 jobs are at risk in the UK.</p>

            <p>Developer Goichi "Suda51" Suda has assured Grasshopper Manufacture fans that the studio's next game, the ultra-violent Romeo is a Dead Man, contains no AI-generated material. </p>
<p>The executive director and scenario writer was <a href="https://x.com/suda_51/status/1998036236964135256?s=20">initially teasing a possible Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> of the game, stating Grasshopper is "looking into what we can do" to make that happen. Currently, Romeo is a Dead Man is slated for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3050900/ROMEO_IS_A_DEAD_MAN/">PC via Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10016000">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Suda then went on to confirm Romeo is a Dead Man "contains no AI-generated stuff whatsoever", asking the community to "please rest easy on that front".</p>
<p>Suda's AI comment comes after a sequel to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-is-grasshoppers-refreshingly-different-return-to-form">studio's Let it Die</a> appeared to have been built using a considerable amount of generative AI, though Grasshopper was not involved with this project. Rather, Let it Die: Inferno was developed by Supertrick Games, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/made-with-ai-let-it-die-sequel-inferno-discloses-substantial-generative-ai-use">met with a number of raised eyebrows on its debut earlier this month due to its use of AI</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/let-it-die-inferno-developer-responds-to-generative-ai-controversy">developer then released a statement to address the controversy</a>, saying: "We'd like to begin by being transparent about the use of AI tools during development."</p><p>But, back to Grasshopper and Romeo is a Dead Man. The game is due to release next year, on 11th February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda-51s-next-game-is-the-ultra-violent-romeo-is-a-deadman">having initially been announced in June</a>. The ultra-violent shooter will see players take the role of FBI investigator Romeo Stargazer, who tracks down wanted criminals across spacetime and battles with both guns and swords. You can check out a trailer below.</p>

<p>As for AI, well this is a topic we can't hide from, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">many developers now flirting with the technology</a>. Last week, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Also last week, Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> told Eurogamer that while he sees AI as a "tool", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games">the studio always aims to "protect artistry" and "human intention" in its games</a>.</p>

            <p>Two former lead developers from Perfect Dark's The Initiative have joined 2K to launch a new studio under Rockstar owner Take-Two.</p>
<p>Darrell Gallagher, who previously served as The Initiative's studio head and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">working on the Perfect Dark reboot before it was cancelled by Microsoft</a>, announced the news last night.</p>

<p>"I'm excited to share that I will be joining 2K as SVP, Studio Head, where I'll be building a new studio and leading an ambitious opportunity unlike anything I've taken on before," Gallagher <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/?originTrackingId=x%2FyCRM50FXYKNFel5poliA%3D%3D">wrote on LinkedIn</a>. "I've spent my career believing in what's possible when great people come together with a bold vision. I can't wait to get started with the exceptional team at 2K!"</p>
<p>Gallagher also previously worked at Crystal Dynamics on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>, to name just one.</p>
<p>Joining Gallagher at 2K's new studio is Brian Horton, who was the creative director in charge of Perfect Dark's creative vision and execution at The Initiative. Horton's other work includes as creative director on Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man.</p>
<p>"Happy to announce I joined 2K as VP, head of creative at a new studio with Darrell Gallagher," Horton <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403908881246318592/?originTrackingId=FDZjmkOp3OMe7yfwvoD13Q%3D%3D">wrote on LinkedIn</a> last night.</p>
<p>Neither developer revealed exactly what they will be working on at 2K, though many are hoping to see a revival of the Perfect Dark reboot. Back in September, it was reported the reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two.</p>

<p>Allegedly, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-almost-saved-by-rockstar-owner-take-two">plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">Perfect Dark reboot was initially announced back in 2020</a>, with The Initiative set to lead development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was then brought in to support</a> in 2021.</p>
