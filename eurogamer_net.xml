Following Amazon's decision to cuts 14,000 jobs, a new report has claimed the company is "gutting" its video games division as part of the move.
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who, referencing a memo sent to Amazon employees, says the company plans to reduce the amount of work it does on big-budget titles, particularly MMOs. In the memo, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and Game) wrote, "While we're proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs – within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team."
</p>
<p>
While Amazon hasn't revealed the exact number of jobs being cut across its games division, affected employees are already taking to social media, suggesting teams from two projects - New World and the Lord of the Rings MMO announced back in 2023 - are impacted. On LinkedIn, former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7388974384306221056/">wrote</a>, "This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it)."
</p>
<p>
Amazon entered the video games market in disastrous fashion, cancelling its free-to-play shooter Crucible <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-crucible-five-months-after-release-and-four-months-after-un-release">just five months after its release</a> in 2020, and four months after it was "unreleased" back into beta. Its other failures include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-announces-fresh-stab-at-turning-the-lord-of-the-rings-into-an-mmo">first stab at a Lord of the Rings MMO</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-cancels-its-lord-of-the-rings-mmo">cancelled in 2021</a> following a dispute with Chinese mega-corp <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>. New World, too, has struggled to sustain interest after a strong start in 2021. Amazon's other major project is its upcoming Crystal Dynamics-developed upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-huge-huge-task-but-things-are-going-well">said to be "going well"</a> in August last year.
