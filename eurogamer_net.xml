            <p>Rematch - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap's newly launched football action title - has dribbled and passed its way to an impressive player and sales milestone, less than one week since the game's debut.</p>
<p>The game has surpassed 1m sales since its release. What's more, the studio also announced Rematch has already reached three million "unique" players since its launch on 19th June, thanks to it being available on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>. </p>
<p>Those three million players have played 11.8m matches, while 55.6m goals have been scored. That number will likely be getting higher even as I type, given that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/">over on Steam</a> there are currently still 19,008 footy fans kicking about in the game.</p>

<p>Additionally, Slocap said there have been 33.5m assists in Rematch, and 69 (nice).1m saves. "This is just the beginning," <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1937571625752236446">Slocap wrote</a>, celebrating the latest Rematch numbers. "Thank you for being with us, in and out of the pitch!"</p>
<p>While it has undeniably had a successful debut, one thing missing from Rematch currently is crossplay. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/adding-crossplay-to-rematch-is-our-absolute-highest-priority-says-sloclap">Sloclap said adding crossplay was its"absolute highest priority"</a>.</p>
<p>"We're dedicated to making Rematch the outstanding multiplayer football experience you deserve, and we're committed to communicating regularly and transparently with our community to keep you updated on our progress," the studio said at the time.</p>

<p>Our Tom is one of those three million Rematch players, and he has been having a good old time with it. He does wish, however, that fellow Rematch players learn one important thing: passing the ball.</p>
<p>"I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it. In fact I love it despite the fact that a large portion of the player base is the absolute worst kind of person: a ball hog."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones]]></content:encoded>
