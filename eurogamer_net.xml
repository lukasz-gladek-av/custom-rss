            <p>The launch of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> has finally brought GameCube games to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, but there's also a secret startup sound.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, the GameCube collection features three games so far: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Soul Calibur 2, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>. Open the collection and it works just like others for the N64, SNES and more.</p>
<p>But! If you hold the Switch 2's left stick in any direction as the collection loads, you'll be treated to the iconic GameCube startup screen with its plinky-plonky sound effects and rolling cube. Cute!</p>

<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dwKgKoSGHQ">Spawn Wave</a> shared a video of the screen over the weekend. I then had to try it myself for that hit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>I tested it with other buttons too - the face buttons and the shoulder buttons - but only the left stick works for this little Easter Egg.</p>
<p>If you're planning on playing F-Zero GX - and you should be, it's great - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">note the default controls mean the game is virtually unplayable</a>. You'll need to enter the suspend menu to remap the controls, specifically moving boost to a more easily accessible button.</p>
<p>So far <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">only three games are available in the collection</a>, though you can buy a GameCube controller too. Other games on the way include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-path-radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, Mario Smash Football, Chibi Robo, Luigi's Mansion, and Pokémon Colosseum.</p>
<p>What other GameCube games are you hoping to see added to the collection? Personally, after splashing around in Mario Kart World over the weekend, I am hopeful Nintendo will whip out Wave Race: Blue Storm from its vault.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> may well be a Nintendo legend, known for giving the world iconic characters such as Mario, Zelda and Donkey Kong, but even so, fans have noticed that his name has been omitted from the credits of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World is the latest iteration of Nintendo's racing series, debuting last week alongside the launch of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>. Many have now raced through World's variety of tracks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-track-list">from Acorn Heights to Whistlestop Summit</a>.</p>
<p>However, Miyamoto is not mentioned in the credits for Mario Kart World, despite being an instrumental part of the series' legacy. This means that Miyamoto's last Mario Kart credit was with the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>

<p>"It definitely feels weird, especially as the 'father' of Mario," one person mused on Bluesky while discussing Miyamoto's lack of credit in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>However another suggested that, perhaps, the creator asked not to be credited if he wasn't actually part of the development, so that "people would focus on the new" team. </p>
<p>"I would feel like that is a classy move," they reasoned.</p>
<p>Miyamoto has steadily moved away from game development itself in recent years, taking on more of an advisory role within Nintendo. As such, this isn't the first time Miyamoto has been absent from the credits of a Nintendo game. He also doesn't feature in mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a>, nor does he <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/echoes-of-wisdom-is-the-first-zelda-game-without-miyamoto-in-the-credits/">pop up in credits for last year's Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry has confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will be coming out before the holiday season this year, following the game's appearance at last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-showcase-2025-round-up-everything-announced">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the official Silksong Discord, Team Cherry's Matthew Griffon wrote: "I confirmed BEFORE holiday - we are not tied to a console release." This indicates that Silksong's release is not tied to that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">Xbox's new Xbox ROG Ally handheld</a>.</p>
<p>The reason for the confusion is due to the game's sudden appearance at the tail-end of the Xbox ROG Ally reveal at the Xbox Games Showcase. Xbox's Sarah Bond stated that people will be able to play Silksong on this new handheld, leading some to interpret the two sharing a release date.

<figcaption>Check out Eurogamer's video on the Silksong release date situation here!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2nAnDLgHBM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The gaggle of people who have been fiending for anything and everything Silksong related have been desperate for anything concrete about the game and its release. Prior to the event-heavy weekend, interest was piqued <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-update-ignites-perfectly-reasonable-shadow-drop-hopes">due to an update to the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Before that, the game was confirmed as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-is-playable-in-a-museum-this-september-but-that-probably-doesnt-help-narrow-down-its-release-date">playable at an Australian museum this September</a>. Earlier still, Nintendo included the game in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">Nintendo Direct and locked in the game's presence on both the Switch 1 and Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>There was also the cake fiasco, in which the eagle-eyed Silksong lovers went all in on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">cake recipe as the core of a release date tease</a>, a theory Team Chery had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">come out and put to rest</a>. With last night's news, those down bad for the smallest crumb of Silksong info may be able to rest, at last.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the concrete confirmation last night has folks very excited. A peak at the Silksong Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/">provides a window into the joys of happy gamers far and wide</a>. However the scars of hopium still ache in the hearts of some battle-hardened Silksong-minded folks. One user, Breadbowl004 wrote in response to Griffon's post: "Notice how he didn't say Holiday 2025".</p>
<p>That being said, it's still unknown when <em>exactly</em> the game will be released. Also consider this, it would be incredibly funny if the game was pushed back to 2026. Something to think on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Persona-inspired horror game Demonschool has a new release window, following a delay last year.</p>
<p>As revealed at the PC Gaming Show, the RPG will be released this summer. It was originally intended to launch last September, but in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-and-italian-horror-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay">August was delayed to allow the studio to "manifest our bigger dreams into reality"</a>.</p>
<p>The new trailer, below, provides a gameplay summary of Demonschool and its parallel social activities and tactical battles, all with a cartoon horror aesthetic.</p>

<p>Demonschool will be released across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC (Steam, Epic), with Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>Set in a haunted university, Demonschool includes both Persona-esque social activities and romance, with tactical battles inspired by Into the Breach. There will be 15 playable characters, each with special combat skills.</p>
<p>"Our team took great pride in fleshing out the world of Demonschool as much as possible," said Brandon Sheffield, creative director of developer Necrosoft Games. "With plenty of class and demon assignments to complete, characters to hang out with, and minigames to play, students won't run out of things to do on Jabberwock Island."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-is-persona-meets-buffy-and-i-love-its-90s-vibes">demo of the game was released last year</a>, which I described as "Persona meets Buffy" with its 90s vibes. "Added to the bold artwork, a dark yet funky soundtrack, and an over-the-top cartoonish aesthetic (I love the bouncy run animation), and Demonschool is yet another brilliant example of silly adults bested by a plucky gang of pesky kids."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is finally leaving early access with a full 1.0 release set for August.</p>
<p>A fresh trailer for the game was shown at the PC Gaming Show over the weekend, showing plenty of its 2D roguelike gameplay, parkour abilities, and stylish combat.</p>
<p>Published by Ubisoft, The Rogue Prince of Persia is being developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> studio Evil Empire. It released into early access last May.</p>

<p>The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">received a huge update back in November</a>, revamping the art style and doubling the game's size.</p>
<p>The full version will finish the story, add extra biomes with a proper final boss, and include more enemies and weapons. The developer has also promised news of an exact release date as well as console releases on the way.</p>
<p>It's heavily inspired by Dead Cells too, as you'd expect from the same studio.</p>
<p>"What it definitely gets from Dead Cells is an enviable forward momentum," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-lot-of-dead-cells-in-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">Christian Donlan for Eurogamer last year</a>. "The Prince is all leanness and athleticism, decked out like a modern Olympian but with a bright red sash that flows out behind him and highlights his swiftness, his elegance."</p>
<p>Evil Empire is a subsidiary of original Dead Cells developer Motion Twin, which was spun off to work on updates and DLC. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developer-ends-support-focusing-on-new-projects">ended support for Dead Cells last year</a> to work on a "secret project", which turned out to be The Rogue Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>Motion Twin, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/motion-twins-windblown-releases-in-early-access-even-sooner-than-you-think">its own game in early access: Windblown</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
