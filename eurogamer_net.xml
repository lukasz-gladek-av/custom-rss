            <p>Nintendo has confirmed its Switch successor will be backward compatible with Switch games.</p>
<p>Company president Shuntaro Furukawa shared the news earlier this morning. Writing on social media platform X, Furukawa said:</p>
<p>"At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch."</p>

<p>In addition, Furukawa confirmed Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the company's next console, which for now has been dubbed '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>'. According to Nintendo, there are over 34 million Switch Online members as of 30th September, 2024. </p>
<p>While Furukawa made no mention specifically about issues such as cartridges, the exec said more information on the Switch successor will be shared at "a later date".</p>
<p>CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy Kantan Games Serkan Toto noted Nintendo's stock saw a boost following confirmation of the Switch 2's backwards compatibility. It closed up at +5.80 percent at 3:30pm Japan time on Wednesday, the industry analyst said.</p>
<p>"Investors think this is a sign Nintendo's next device will not be a risky experiment but rather a continuation," <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1854050495566061608">Toto wrote on X</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo highlighted several upcoming Switch games set to release in 2025. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, for which we are yet to see gameplay for, leading many to assume this could also be a Switch 2 launch title. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is also listed on Nintendo's slate for next year.</p><p>The company said the Nintendo Switch is being played by over 100 million people worldwide, with that number covering every age range from children to seniors. It added "more software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware".</p>

<p>Following confirmation of its existence in May, Nintendo is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">officially announce its next console by the end of March, 2025</a>. However, it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">unlikely to reveal anything this calendar year</a>, analysts say.</p>
<p>Nintendo recently revised down its expectations for total Switch console and game sales. As Tom reported yesterday, Switch hardware sales were down 31 percent year-on-year for the three months ending 30th September. The company has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-as-the-wait-for-new-hardware-continues">cut its total Switch sales forecast for the financial year to 12.5m</a>, down from the 13.5m it expected previously.</p>
<p>Most recent figures state the Nintendo Switch stands at 146.04m total units sold.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following a seemingly solid launch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, there's probably a fair few series newcomers considering delving into the original trilogy. But anyone hoping for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-shares-detailed-breakdown-of-mass-effect-legendary-editions-extensive-changes">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition style remaster</a> shouldn't hold their breath; Dragon Age: The Veilguard creative director John Epler says the project "wouldn't be easy" because hardly anyone left at BioWare knows how the studio's old engine works.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> was well-received when it launched back in 2021, introducing the likes of improved performance and visuals, enhanced models, new lighting, gameplay tweaks, and more. It was a welcome finessing of a classic trilogy, and the kind of treatment most would probably agree BioWare's other beloved series deserves.
</p>
<p>
However, in a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">recent interview with Rolling Stone</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/dragon-age-boss-says-a-legendary-edition-style-remaster-of-the-old-games-in-the-series-is-unlikely-because-theres-maybe-20-people-left-at-bioware-who-know-how-their-engine-works/">PC Gamer</a>), Dragon Age: The Veilgaurd creative director John Epler - who's been with BioWare since the original Dragon Age's release back in 2009 - noted that while he'd love to see the trilogy get the remaster treatment, it would be a challenge due to the games' proprietary engines.

</div><figcaption>Here's a video version of Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Unlike the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> trilogy, which was developed in Unreal Engine 3, Dragon Age Inquisition was created using EA's Frostbite engine, while Dragon Age 1 &amp; 2, more problematically, were built using BioWare's own Eclipse Engine. "I think I'm one of about maybe 20 people left at BioWare who’s actually used Eclipse," Epler explained. "[Remastering Dragon Age is] something that's not going to be as easy Mass Effect, but we do love the original games."
</p>
<p>
But there's perhaps some small hope for Dragon Age fans, given Epler didn't entirely shut down the idea. "Never say never," he added, "I guess that's what it comes down to."
</p>
<p>
Of course, EA's interest in giving Dragon Age the Legendary Edition treatment - and indeed its continuing interest in the series as a whole - will likely hinge on the success of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-off-to-solid-start-on-steam">appeared to get off to a solid start</a> when it launched last week. The publisher hasn't yet trumpeted any official figures, but The Veilguard did manage an all-time peak of 89,418 concurrent players on Steam, setting a new record for a single-player EA game.
</p><p>
What that means for The Veilguard's future is unclear, but speaking ahead of launch, Epler said BioWare's "full attention... has shifted entirely to the next Mass Effect", meaning it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dlc-plans-unknown-as-bioware-shifts-full-attention-to-next-mass-effect-game">no DLC plans</a>, beyond "quality-of-life improvements and a handful of smaller content updates".
</p>
<p>
Regardless of what happens next, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a bit of a treat. "What BioWare has managed to accomplish here, in the face of all the pressure it's faced since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> came out 10 years ago, is extraordinary," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">five star review</a>. "The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling. It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general. This is among the very best of them."
