            <p>
Cast your mind back to the distant days of last December, and you might remember Sega unveiling Project Century, a curious new venture from Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. Well, it's not been given a proper name alongside a new trailer.
</p>
<p>
Project Century's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-new-virtua-fighter-sonic-racing-and-like-a-dragon">initial showing</a> was eye-catching but not entirely informative, revealing it to be a Yakuza-style third-person action game with real-time combat set in an open city located somewhere in 1915. And honestly, its latest appearance isn't a whole lot more illuminating. But! We've shifted to 1943 this time around, perhaps suggesting the game - just like its codename implies - does indeed unfold across the course of 100 years.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that curiosity, we get an extremely evocative new trailer, featuring some era-appropriate music, a whole lot of fisticuffs, and more of that lovely warm art style. More crucially though, Sega has jettisoned the Project Century moniker in favour of its final title, Stranger Than Heaven.

<p>
But, unfortunately, that's your lot. There's no hint of a release date, or even the platforms Stranger Than Heaven might be coming to, so for now about all we can do is soak up the ambience of its new trailer and patiently wait to learn more.

            <p>Two of my words are colliding, people! Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is currently updating Hitman with a new elusive target - it's only ruddy La Chiffre from Casino Royale!</p>
<p>The news was revealed this evening, with actor Mads Mikkelsen joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> and IO boss Hakan Abrak to announce the Hitman x Bond collaboration. Le Chiffre will be available to hunt for free via PC and consoles soon. As in, very soon - the devs are getting it all prepped as we speak, so in a few moments or so we are go!</p>

<p>Above is a little trailer for the whole thing, which takes place in Paris, and yes I am reacting perfectly normally about it all and not getting overexcited at all.</p>
<p>And, below's an infographic for Agent 47's next elusive target. As you can see, playing and killing La Chiffre will unlock awards for 007: First Light. </p>
<p>"Le Chiffre is a character I have always enjoyed - he's calculating, cold, and ruthless," said Mads Mikkelsen. "Bringing him into the world of Hitman makes for a thrilling collaboration. Players can expect mind games, high stakes, and twists that only this character could orchestrate. To succeed, they'll need to play their hand wisely."</p>
<p>"We are beyond thrilled to welcome Mads Mikkelsen to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>," added IO's Hakan Abrak. "Players are really going to enjoy this new mission, which marks the return of Le Chiffre after nearly 20 years. I'm excited to see our players jump into this small taste of bigger things to come in the Bond franchise from IO Interactive."</p>

<p>IO, of course, also recently lifted the lid on its upcoming Bond game. Earlier this week, we got a reveal trailer which introduced us to the young Bond at the start of his life as an agent.</p>
<p>But, while it may be an origin story, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-may-be-an-original-story-but-you-might-have-missed-plenty-of-homages-to-the-bonds-that-came-before">007: First Light already has plenty of nods to the Bond books and films that came before</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
