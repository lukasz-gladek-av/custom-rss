            <p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">The Witcher 4's impressive, ultra-high-fidelity debut trailer at The Game Awards</a> last week, there's been a fair bit of consternation from fans as to whether it'll actually be playable on current-gen hardware. That's something only compounded by the mention, in the trailer's small print and a brief <a href="https://press.cdprojektred.com/en/news/1702/the-witcher-iv-revealed-at-the-game-awards">official blog</a>, that the trailer was pre-rendered on a mysterious, "unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX" graphics card, "using assets and models from the game itself" - suggesting at least some minor level of similarity to what the game will look like on arrival.</p>
<p>Developer CD Projekt Red also has some history with older console struggles of course, with the last-gen consoles of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One proving hugely problematic for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s launch. The studio ultimately dropped them for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion that arrived in 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">Speaking with CDPR in a new interview this week</a>, Eurogamer asked whether the studio could reassure console owners that they could actually run it - and whether it could run on, say, an Xbox Series S, which as things stand is still required for any game releasing on the Xbox Series X. The developers were a little coy in response.</p>
<p>"You know, first of all, this is good to say: this is not a kind of 'beginning of marketing' campaign," said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s game director, Sebastian Kalemba, referring to the trailer. "We firstly wanted to showcase and share with the entire world that: Ciri is the main protagonist; it's The Witcher 4; and she's mutated; and she's on The Path, definitely, right?"</p>
<p>Rather than specifically referencing concerns about certain consoles, Kalemba elaborated a little more, but only went as far as to mention it would be coming to the key platforms more broadly.</p>
<p>"The second thing is that, yes, we are working on a new engine right now, together with Epic's engineers, and there is a great synergy and a great collaboration between us. And currently we're working on Unreal Engine 5 and our custom build. And obviously we want to support all the platforms - meaning PC, Xbox and Sony, right? - but I cannot, right now, tell you more specifics regarding that."</p>
<p>He also stressed for a second time that this trailer was just a technical showpiece and "good benchmark" for now.</p>
<p>"For sure, it's definitely worth remembering [that for this] first time, we created the cinematic, pre-rendered, without post production piece, that we want to [show that we're] simply aspiring to achieve such quality in cinematics as much as possible. That's my opinion: it's a good benchmark."</p><p>The emphasis on this just being an early showcase, rather than a true 'beginning of marketing' campaign, brings to mind some comments from CDPR joint CEO Michał Nowakowski to Eurogamer recently, detailed more fully in our recent report on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">what we can expect from The Witcher 4</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer earlier this summer, Nowakowski explained that while Phantom Liberty had a more truncated, six-month marketing campaign before its launch, "for a new game, we would still expect a slightly longer - but not two-year - lasting campaign." (The two years it took for Cyberpunk 2077 was down to its delays, he explained, with the studio originally planning something closer to 12 to 18 months from its big Keanu Reeves moment at E3 to launch.)</p>
<p>Nowakowski also referred to as a marketing "mass attack" being the main kick-off point for that less-than-two-year run up to launch. "Having said that, I want to stress: it doesn't mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]. Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p>
<p>For example, he continued at the time, "If I ask you, what do you know about The Witcher 4? The answer is not much, probably - yes, there's theories and so on. But there's nothing really specific. So we want to drop the crumbs here and there so that people - and the media as well - can, you know, pick up on it and try to figure out what it is we're trying to say this time. So that [is something] we can start doing a little bit earlier." That would involve aspects such as "having some video assets, or something to whet the appetite of the fans - not even to create the hype so much," he said, as to simply get the early conversations flowing.</p><p>More simply: it might be reasonable to infer that this first trailer would count as one of those "cool assets" releasing as an earlier tease - establishing we're playing as Ciri, and some basic foundations of lore such as her having become a fully fledged witcher - but still coming a little way before that roughly 18-month countdown.</p>
<p>Coming back to the consoles, there's also some interesting context in the form of CDPR vice president of technology Charles Tremblay's comments to Eurogamer earlier this year. There, Tremblay noted that the studio's next game likely wouldn't launch on just PC. "I don't think this is a strategy we want to adopt right now. That being said, will it mean that we will have - let's say there were 20 platforms available - we'll have 20 at launch? Maybe not. But at least PC only, and then scattered, it's not necessarily the approach we want to go forward, for sure."</p>
<p>He also noted that the studio now develops all of its games on the "lowest" spec hardware, such as consoles, at the same time as it does on PC, rather than its old method of working to PCs first and going backwards from there - one of the many causes for Cyberpunk's launch woes.</p>
<p>Console versions "working super late" are now "unacceptable," he explained. "It's part of our process; we do the reviews on console so we know exactly where we are on all the platforms, [including] the lowest [spec] platform we have, rather than saying, 'PC's fine, we can go forward'."</p><p>With the process applied across all of the studio's upcoming games, it makes for an interesting situation with The Witcher 4. If the studio's hesitant to commit to its viability on current-gen platforms (albeit not ruling that out of course), and it also now develops games on the lowest-spec platforms alongside high end PCs, what might those platforms be here? Going from what CD Projekt Red's said so far, we might be waiting a fair bit longer to find out.</p>
<p>In the meantime, our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">full interview with CD Projekt Red about The Witcher 4</a> has more crumbs of detail, while our report on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">the studio's technical ambition, optimism, and development timeframes</a> and our full long read on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">what went wrong with Cyberpunk 2077 and how the studio responded</a> offer plenty more context on how CDPR works today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Will Wright, creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and co-founder of its developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/maxis">Maxis</a>, has shared fresh details of his forthcoming AI life sim, Proxi.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spore-and-sims-creator-will-wright-unveils-proxi">first announced back in 2018</a> and a gameplay trailer was shared a month ago by its developer Gallium Studio to explain its concept. Then yesterday, Wright appeared on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> to discuss development of the game (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/the-sims-designer-will-wright-is-making-his-next-life-sim-more-personal-by-building-it-with-your-actual-memories-no-game-designer-has-ever-gone-wrong-by-overestimating-the-narcissism-of-their-players/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>Proxi is a dreamlike life sim where players seemingly train an AI to create worlds from their memories. Players record a memory through text, known as a "mem", which the game interprets and forms into an animated scene using assets created by the developers (and eventually players too).</p>

<p>These scenes can then be edited by players to tweak the details. Then players "train your Proxi's mind with each new memory" by placing them on a memory timeline and mindmap to create connections.</p>
<p>Players also place these memories into a private mind-world made of terraformable hexagons, while sentiment analysis will alter the world according to the emotions of memories placed within. Shared worlds will also be possible, constructed with others.</p>
<p>The trailer shows players can add Proxies of friends and family to their world, play games together, and export them to other worlds - Minecraft and Roblox are used as examples.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2329386880">BreakthroughT1D Twitch stream</a>, Wright explained why he wanted to use the real memories of players for a personal experience.</p>
<p>"I found myself getting continuously closer and closer to the player," he said. "Kind of a saying I've lived by, which is that no game designer has ever gone wrong by overestimating the narcissism of their players."</p>
<p>He laughed: "It goes to figure that the more I can make a game about you, the more you'll like it."</p>
<p>BreakthroughT1D is a global organisation funding research into type one diabetes, with a Twitch channel of talk shows and podcasts. The stream was hosted by Simmers Arielehm and Emily Morganti.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.galliumstudios.com/">studio website</a> states Proxi is coming soon and doesn't list platforms.</p>
<p>Wright appears keen for Proxi to explore the varying perceptions and philosophy of memory. It certainly seems like a powerful tool and a clever concept, though six years after its initial reveal the perception of AI has drastically changed. I suspect Gallium Studio has an uphill battle explaining Proxi in full.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing the future of game development</a> as it becomes more widespread across the industry. Recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-has-developed-an-ai-tool-that-generates-fully-playable-3d-worlds">Google unveiled its Genie2 tool</a> it claims can create playable 3D worlds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has received its first ever crossover DLC, adding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-2">Killzone 2</a> cosmetics.</p>
<p>The crossover is part of a new tier of special Premium content, a post from developer Arrowhead reads, suggesting more collaborations will be on the way.</p>
<p>"We decided a long time ago to do crossovers only if and when they make perfect sense for the game," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491?sf275819234=1">Steam post</a> reads. "So in that spirit, we're hyped to announce our very first crossover: Killzone 2."</p>

<p>Available now in the Superstore are a new armour set, primary weapon, player banner, cape, and player title.</p>
<p>A second batch will then be available from 23rd December.</p>
<p>The post also hints at other content: "High Command informs us that beyond the Superstore content, there’s also an additional Killzone 2 reward for all <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> depending on your success in the Galactic War…"</p>

</figure>
<p>The collaboration additionally marks the start of a longer rotation of items in the store, as Arrowhead temporarily tests a five day rotation.</p>
<p>"Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on," it said. "At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation."</p>
<p>Following the collaboration, page rotation on the store will return to normal as the developer gathers feedback.</p>
<p>Last week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-soon-be-able-to-spread-democracy-with-a-limited-edition-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-in-hand">Helldivers 2 limited edition controller</a> was revealed.</p>
<p>Killzone 2 was released for the PS3 back in 2009 by Guerrilla Games, published by Sony. It was followed up by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-3">Killzone 3</a> in 2011, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-mercenary">Killzone: Mercenary</a> on the PS Vita in 2013, and then Killzone: Shadow Fall for the launch of PS4 that same year.</p>
<p>Since then, there's been no word of a new game in the series.</p>
<p>Indeed, in October Guerrilla art director Roy Postma suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">studio was done with the series</a> and created Horizon Zero Dawn to "refresh the palette".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fresh details on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra have been revealed by writer Amy Hennig, as well as a first look at its version of Wakanda.</p>
<p>The game was first announced in 2021, with former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> writer Hennig (Uncharted) at the helm of Skydance New Media, and a proper reveal was given earlier this year at the State of Unreal livestream. It features Captain America and Black Panther feuding during World War 2.</p>
<p>"[The setting] led us to do a bunch of interesting things," Hennig told <a href="https://ew.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-globe-trotting-wwii-epic-wakanda-setting-exclusive-8760326">Entertainment Weekly</a> in a new interview, "one of which was to not only tell a story with a young Steve Rogers who's still trying to find his feet, as opposed to the more seasoned guy that we've seen in a lot of the films. It also let us introduce a new Black Panther of 1943."</p>

<p>She continued: "It led us to tap into all the things that I love, all of the wonderful tropes of World War II-era adventure films, classic men-on-a-mission movies and all of that.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of intrigue in our story, a lot of twists and turns, fascinating characters, and interesting locations."</p>
<p>This era's Black Panther is Azzuri, T'Challa's grandfather, who Hennig described as "more mature" than the young Captain America.</p>
<p>The jungles of Wakanda will be a key setting alongside Occupied Paris, with the below screenshot providing a first look at its "photo-real, cinema-real level of detail", according to Hennig.</p>

</figure>
<p>The game will tell a "globe-trotting story" she added, stating there are more locations yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>"Wakanda at this point in time is hidden away from the outside world and protected by this impenetrable jungle," she said. "They are non-interventionist, but events transpire that pull them into the conflict. They have to protect their interests. The world is getting smaller. No satellites yet, but there will be soon. You can shoot down planes that maybe want to fly over Wakanda, but how long can you stay in the shadows?"</p><p>The story will see Captain America and Black Panther work together against the same enemies, though they begin as rivals. And as the game's name suggests, the villains are clear. Said Hennig: "It's pretty black and white. Who doesn't want to punch a Nazi?"</p>
<p>The previous trailer hinted a third super soldier will also feature in the game, though their identity remains under wraps.</p>
<p>That trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">impressed for the game's use of Epic's MetaHuman Creator</a> that gives each character remarkable detail.</p>
<p>"We really wanted the visual fidelity to be high so that you could kind of forget that you're looking at a game, that it should feel and look and sound and smell like you're watching a great Marvel movie or TV show, but you're driving the action," said Hennig in this new interview.</p>
<p>"As a new studio trying to do some groundbreaking stuff with cinematically presented games, the way we invite the most people in is by bringing them something they already know and love, but in a new form."</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is expected to release next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Archetype Entertainment has finally unveiled a first look at gameplay of its forthcoming sci-fi RPG Exodus.</p>
<p>The game was first revealed at last year's The Game Awards and was notable for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-to-make-his-video-game-debut-in-sci-fi-rpg-exodus">starring Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role</a>.</p>
<p>A year later and we finally have a better idea of how exactly it will play, thanks to a new gameplay trailer (below) - it's got alien planets, third-person space shooting, and a very very angry bear.</p>

<p>In short, it's looking a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> running on current platforms: from its shooter gameplay to its sci-fi aesthetic and narrative focus.</p>
<p>That's not surprising considering the studio's BioWare pedigree. This is the debut game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-bioware-vets-working-on-story-driven-sci-fi-game-at-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio">Archetype Entertainment</a>, co-founded by BioWare veterans James Ohlen (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>) and Chad Robertson (Anthem).</p>
<p>The game will be published by Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p>Further details on Exodus were provided in a livestream following the trailer's reveal with both Ohlen and Robertson.</p>
<p>In particular, details on its setting were shared. It takes place in a post-Earth exodus scenario (hence the name, presumably), where humanity has explored star systems and created advanced civilisations, as well as genetically modified creatures. That explains the bear, then.</p>
<p>There's competition between the human colonies, too, creating a web of various relationships and alliances players will need to navigate.</p>
<p>A key element will be Livestone, a hybrid of mineral and vegetation created by the Celestials that can be controlled by certain humans - I'm guessing the player protagonist will be one of them.</p>

<p>Time dilation is also a major focus, with the passage of time moving at different speeds across the universe. For instance, players will make personal and civilisational choices in their journey to other star systems, and while this may only be weeks for their character their homeworld will be significantly changed once they return due to differences in time.</p>
<p>Missions will be led with two companions - and yes, there will be romance.</p>
<p>We still don't know, though, who Matthew McConaughey will be playing.</p>
<p>So if you're done with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and you're itching for some space adventure ahead of the next Mass Effect game, Exodus should have you covered.</p>
<p>That said, Exodus still doesn't have a release date. However, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">themed episode in Amazon's Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next Mass Effect, project director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">Michael Gamble said it won't feature stylised visuals</a> like the latest Dragon Age. "Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," he said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Secret Level is set to return for a second season, following its debut on Amazon last week.</p>
<p>The animated anthology is inspired by video games, with episodes dedicated to the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, Pac-Man, and Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>Details of the second season are under wraps, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/secret-level-season-2-amazon-prime-video-1236251726/">Variety</a> reported, though Secret Level is the most-watched animated series debut of all time on Amazon's Prime Video streaming platform.</p>

<p>Exact viewership numbers have not been released, though Luminate estimates the series was watched for 155.3m minutes in the US during its first week - that's around 1.4m views as per its 109-minute runtime.</p>
<p>The series covers gaming past, present and future, from the iconic Mega Man to Amazon's MMORPG New World, to forthcoming space opera Exodus.</p>
<p>It's perhaps become best known for its Concord episode, which follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony's decision to shut down the online shooter</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">series creator Tim Miller told Rolling Stone</a>, "because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters. If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."</p>
<p>Miller also directed the first Deadpool movie and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated anthology Love, Death &amp; Robots.</p>
<p>Ahead of the release of Secret Level, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer sampled the first four episodes</a> to see how the series fares.</p>

            <p>Amir Satvat was the recipient of the first 'Game Changers' award at The Game Awards last week, but has since received "countless hateful messages", "disturbing comments" and antisemitic remarks about his wife.</p>
<p>Satvat received the award for his work helping laid-off employees across the games industry to find new work. The award was host <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s way of addressing the "significant and unprecedented industry-wide layoffs", which he admitted the show struggles to address "in a constructive way".</p>
<p>Satvat has helped to place nearly 3000 people into jobs, and was described at the awards show as "career Santa Claus". Yet since last week, he's been subjected to abuse online due to his current work at Chinese tech conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>.</p>

<p>"Over the past four days, I have received countless hateful messages targeting me personally, alongside hundreds more on YouTube and Twitter," Satvat wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amirsatvat_fellow-members-of-the-games-industry-i-need-activity-7274667576159350787-Zzpw?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn post</a>.</p>
<p>"People have made disturbing comments about my family - I am only not sharing those comments because they are disgusting, but I will share some other sample comments. My wife and me have been targeted with anti-Semitic slurs. Several videos mocked my comments suggesting I sounded autistic - riffing on it for their audience's amusement."</p>
<p>Due to his work as a business development director at Tencent, Satvat has been accused of being some sort of agent or plant exploiting the community, or that he's a fraud, he wrote.</p>
<p>However, he explained his community work began in November 2022 before he started at Tencent in August 2023. Before this he worked for Amazon, but again his community work was separate.</p>
<p>"I didn't / don't work on mergers and acquisitions at Tencent or Amazon," Satvat continued. "This stems from one innocent, erroneous mention of what I do in a Level Infinite article, since corrected to show I only work on investments."</p>
<p>He has also never laid employees off.</p>
<p>"They simply didn't mention Tencent at TGA because it had nothing to do with this community and they wanted to focus on how we drove this ourselves," he said.</p>
<p>"I've been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into', usually by people who spent all of eight seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across five different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know."</p>
<p>He surmised: "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry - this is the 'reward' for two years of service."</p>
<p>Finishing the post, he said he would now "return to our mission of positive, public service".</p>
