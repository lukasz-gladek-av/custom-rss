            <p>Ubisoft has revised its <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/units-discount">loyalty program</a>, allowing players to "exchange units on a wider selection of products".</p>
<p>In an email sent out to players subscribed to the loyalty scheme and seen by Eurogamer, Ubisoft announced that effective immediately, the units collected by players "will now also apply to pre-order and new release purchases made on the Ubisoft store", with 100 units equating to a 20 percent discount.</p>

<p>As well as 20 percent discount on games and DLC for every 100 units - you get one unit for every $/Â£1 spent - you can also get "exclusive" in-game content and rewards, like legendary weapons, character skins, emotes, and consumables.</p>
<p>If you're interested in signing up, don't forget that new Ubisoft accounts start with 100 units, which is enough for a 20% discount on your first Ubisoft Store purchase.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">Ubisoft is continuing its talks with Chinese giant Tencent</a> over a possible buyout deal that would take the Assassin's Creed maker private.</p>
<p>The move - first mooted last month - would see Ubisoft take back control of its company from shareholders, and yesterday, Reuters reported that Ubisoft is seeking a deal which would see its French founders, the Guillemot family, retain control. However, the same report states that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra has slammed Marvel Rivals, intimating its an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> clone.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted tweet posted yesterday, Ybarra called NetEase Games' free-to-play team-based PVP shooter "Overwatch Marvel Rivals", adding that much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Light of Motiram</a> is "a clear copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>", Marvel Rivals clearly took inspiration from Blizzard's own team-based PVP shooter, Overwatch.</p>

<p>"Looks like Overwatch Marvel Rivals ships tomorrow," Ybarra wrote in the now-deleted tweet. "Much like Light of Motiram (a clear copy of [Horizon Zero Dawn]) out of China.</p>
<p>"I mean, even the character name - Windowmaker in [Overwatch] vs. Black Widow in Marvel Rivals lol - NetEase/Tencent - all the same."</p> <div>

<p>Before Ybarra deleted the post, however, a community note appended to the tweet said: "Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, is a popular Marvel hero who made her comic debut in 1964, more than 50 years before Overwatch and Widowmaker were created."</p><p>Marvel Rivals finally released in full yesterday on 6th December 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">Getting off to a heroic start on Steam</a>, it managed to already reach a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">Valve's platform</a>, with this number likely rising further again over the weekend.</p>
<p>The game itself is described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", and one which on its announcement head of Marvel Games Jay Ong called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-is-a-free-to-play-pvp-shooter-where-heroes-and-villains-fight-together-and-against-each-other">one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects"</a>, and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Good news, PokÃ©mon fans - PokÃ©mon TV is back.</p>
<p>PokÃ©mon TV, the app and website that let you watch episodes from the long-running PokÃ©mon anime for free, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tv-app-axed-leaving-episodes-scattered-between-paid-streaming-services">was removed from app stores earlier this year</a>, but now it's returned, albeit in a new home on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialPoke%CC%81monTV">YouTube</a> and with a truncated library.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the official PokÃ©mon TV YouTube channel, where you can explore the world of PokÃ©mon with Ash &amp; Pikachu!" announces the channel description. "Experience some of the most iconic moments from their adventure with our full episodes, live streams, compilations, and so much more!"</p>
<p>Right now only nine episodes from the first season are available, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRcHmntfmJ8CnSmj4C284-a1euH518aQa">playlist itself</a> seemingly contains another 16 unpublished videos, so it looks like more episodes are on the way.</p>
<p>The app's removal in March was especially upsetting given after that point, PokÃ©fans were unable to follow the saga of Ash Ketchum - and beyond - without needing to subscribe to a streaming service.</p>
<p>Now, however, it looks as though PokÃ©mon has found a new home where fans can once again follow Ash for free.</p>
<p>In related PokÃ©mon news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reportedly-surpassed-200m-in-first-month">PokÃ©mon Trading Card Game Pocket is thought to have raked in over $200m during its first month of launch</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly Â£164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play. The report also said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">PokÃ©mon TCG Pocket</a>'s average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Ballistic is a new 5v5 mode launching next week in early access within the main Fortnite client. 
</p>
<p>
It's also Epic Games' first proper foray into first-person for Fortnite - a move that has been long-awaited by some fans.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic arrives on Wednesday 11th December with one map - Skyline 10 - plus a limited number of weapons and items. These will all be expanded over time based on player feedback, Epic Games has said. 
</p>
<p>
Matches begin with players sorted into teams of either attackers or defenders. Attackers must deploy a payload - a Rift Point Device - while defenders must stop them. Players swap sides after six rounds, and the game is over when one team wins a seventh round in total.
</p><p>
If it all sounds a bit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> or Valorant, well, there's clearly inspiration here. But, of course, Fortnite is already full of character skins - which will all be supported - and so the different loadouts you get here seem more customisable. 
</p>

 </a>
</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Epic Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Each match begins with players picking one of five Flex Gadgets, such as proxy mines, bubble shields, and different types of grenade that can launch you (and your enemies) or mark them for your teammates. 
</p>
<p>
As with most other Fortnite shooter modes, Ballistic will host both Ranked and Unranked modes, with the former offering a ladder to climb and penalities if you leave matches. 
</p>
<p>
The addition of Fortnite Ballistic follows yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-og-will-rotate-chapter-1-seasons-every-couple-of-months">arrival of Fortnite OG as a newly-permanent mode</a>, and last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-season-1-map">launch of Chapter 6 for the game's main battle royale</a> offering. 
</p>
<p>
Next up? Epic Games has already begun teasing a fresh update for its main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> mode that seems like it may feature the Storm King...

<p>In a statement, CEO Mark Lyons said it had been "an extremely difficult decision" but "reflect[ed] the challenging times many companies in our industry are currently facing".</p>
<p>Lyons' words stopped short of confirming how many staff had been impacted by the most recent round of cuts, or how it will affect its development pipeline.</p>

<p>These are the second round of layoffs this year alone. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-true-colors-studio-deck-nine-lays-off-20-of-staff">Deck Nine also laid off around 20 percent of its workforce back in February</a>. A couple of months later, an investigation into Deck Nine showed that although its games celebrated diversity and inclusivity, its own culture allegedly fostered toxicity, hate speech, harassment, crunch, bullying, and abusive leadership as a result of inaction from senior management.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
