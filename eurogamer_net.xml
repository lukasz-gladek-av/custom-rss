            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-files-unfair-labour-practice-charge-against-fortnite-maker-epic-following-ai-generated-darth-vader-voice-lines<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labour practice charge against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic, following its use of AI to recreate James Earl Jones' voice for Darth Vader.</p>
<p>Prior to his death, actor Jones - who along with Darth Vader also lent his vocal stylings to Disney's The Lion King as Mufasa - gave <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/09/darth-vaders-voice-emanated-from-war-torn-ukraine">permission for his voice to be replicated using AI</a>, and technology was used to generate Vader's voice in the Disney+ show Obi-Wan Kenobi. Jones' AI-powered voice as the Star Wars Sith Lord then cropped up again last week, this time in Fortnite, where players could chat with Darth Vader via Epic's online game.</p>
<p>The AI-generated voice used in Fortnite arrived with permission from Jones' family, who said they hoped the collaboration with Epic would "allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character". However, soon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-now-lets-you-chat-with-darth-vader-using-generative-ai-speech">players began using the technology to get Darth to cuss</a>, resulting in Epic swiftly issuing a hotfix to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>Now, American actors' union SAG-AFTRA - which represents 160,000 American media professionals, including voiceover artists - has filed an unfair labour practice charge with the NLRB against Llama Productions, which is wholly owned by Epic Games. The union stated the company "chose to replace the work of human performers with AI technologyâ€¦ without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-statement-fortnites-use-ai-darth-vader-voice-and-ulp-filing">statement shared last night</a>, SAG-AFTRA said it "[celebrates] the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas", and that it welcomes " the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles".</p>
<p>However, the organisation believes it must still protect its "right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members". It noted this includes actors who have also worked to replicate "Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games".</p>
<p>In its filing - <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf">which you can read here</a> - SAG-AFTRA said Llama Productions via Epic "failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union", and it did this by "making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilising AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work" for Fortnite.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Epic for comment on SAG-AFTRA's filing.</p>

<p>Actors from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA have been on strike since July</a>, as the union negotiates with various video game companies on the Interactive Media Agreement. AI has been one of the biggest sticking points of the strikes.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> voice actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Jennifer Hale spoke to Eurogamer about why the strike remains ongoing</a>.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she said. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has received a big new update, Heart of Democracy, that sees the fight move to the streets of Super Earth.</p>
<p>Until now, the game's battles against bugs and robots alike have taken place on alien planets. But now Super Earth itself has been invaded by the squid-like Illuminate, towering over skyscrapers and crowded city streets.</p>
<p>Players will need to activate the Planetary Defense Cannons on Super Earth alongside SEAF troops, but must simultaneously protect civilians on the streets - friendly fire will be punished.</p>

<p>"The worst nightmare of all those who fight for Managed Democracy has been made a grim reality," reads a notice on the Helldivers 2 Discord.</p>
<p>"Despite the valiant efforts of our <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> to push back the fleet, the Illuminate have reached Super Earth. Now they are swarming our cities, terrorizing citizens, and destroying our infrastructure. It's time to rise up and take arms and fight for the precious foundations and soil of Democracy manifest. Helldivers, return to our planet and defend what is rightfully ours."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-illuminate-faction-unleashes-deadly-new-enemy-terrors-as-latest-update-lands">invasion was pre-empted last week with an update</a> that saw the Illuminate setting a course for Super Earth, with new enemies to fight.</p>
<p>The update also added weapon customisation, which allows new attachments to be unlocked as weapons level up.</p>
<p>"Last week, we released a powerful primary weapon customisation system and expanded surplus options to fight against the Illuminate as they emerged from the singularity," reads a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/20/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-live-brings-the-fight-to-the-streets-of-super-earth/">PlayStation Blog post</a> about the update. "Now that you have learned the tactics of these new squid troops - like the Crescent Overseer and the hulking Fleshmob - you must master these tools to continue the fight on Super Earth. Use every available resource, divers, and decimate their forces!"</p>
<p>On <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#6m">Steam</a> at least, these latest updates have seen player numbers rise to their highest since December 2024, when the Omens of Tyranny update was released.</p>
<p>Back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-creative-director-takes-sabbatical-promises-to-start-arrowheads-next-game-on-return">Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt said he would be taking a sabbatical</a> and will begin development of Arrowhead's next game on his return.</p>
<p>Then, at the Game Developer Conference, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales">he discussed the state of the industry</a>, calling industry layoffs "unnecessarily brutal" while "chasing after the battle royales".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has partnered with Samsung to increase production of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> chips.</p>
<p>The partnership could mean Nintendo has enough stock to sell 20m consoles by March 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/nintendo-turns-to-samsung-to-make-chips-ramp-up-switch-2-output">Bloomberg</a> has reported.</p>
<p>That's higher than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo forecast in its latest financial report</a> - it expects to sell 15m consoles in the first year.</p>

<p>Samsung is aiming to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in producing chips across the world, and this partnership with Nintendo will certainly boost business.</p>
<p>Still, with increased chip supply, production will depend on the capacity of hardware assemblers such as Foxconn Technology Group.</p>
<p>Further, Samsung is reportedly pushing for OLED panels in a potential Switch 2 hardware refresh. The Korean firm already supplies flash memory and OLED screens for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Despite following its original Switch with an OLED model, Nintendo has opted for LCD for its bigger Switch 2 screen. While some have criticised the decision, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-experience">quality of the LCD screen is excellent</a> - and leaves the door open for new hardware in future.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A following its latest financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">Nintendo was criticised by investors for its conservative forecast</a> of 15m units. The console is expected to be incredibly popular - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Japan alone demand for the console "far exceeds expectations"</a>, the company said.</p>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated the company's sales forecast was not influenced by production capacity or US tariffs. However, he admitted that should US tariffs change, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-considering-switch-2-post-launch-price-rise-if-tariff-situation-worsens">company will consider price adjustments accordingly</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
