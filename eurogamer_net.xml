While the gaming world waits for Nintendo to finally reveal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, the rumours continue to swirl. And a reliable leaker has now claimed Microsoft will be a "very big supporter" of the console, bringing two major Xbox series to Switch 2 this year, including Halo.
</p>
<p>
That's according to podcaster NateTheHate (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-is-reportedly-getting-two-major-xbox-games-including-halo/">VGC</a>), who notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">broke the news</a> Microsoft was planning to make some of its first-party titles multiplatform early last year. That, of course, proved to be true; <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, Grounded, and Pentiment are now available on PS5, with the latter two also on Switch.
</p>
<p>
NateTheHate now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">reports</a> Microsoft's multiplatform strategy will expand to Switch 2, and that the company will be a "very big supporter", releasing two Xbox titles on the platform - Flight Simulator and Halo: The Masterchief Collection - in 2025. It's also claimed both will launch for PS5, joining the other Xbox first-party games - namely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 - already confirmed for Sony's machine.

<p>
NateTheHate adds Microsoft will additionally be "porting and patching [its] current Switch line-up" for Switch 2, introducing the likes of 4K support, and that he "wouldn't be surprised if Sea of Thieves, maybe Hi-fi Rush, also find their way over." Last year, it was claimed Hi-Fi Rush would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-will-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-report">skip the current version of Switch in favour of Switch 2</a>, although that was before Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">closure of developer Tango Gameworks</a> and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">subsquent purchase</a> by Krafton.
</p><p>
As for other, non-Microsoft Switch 2 releases, NateTheHate says Square Enix is bringing Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth to Nintendo's machine as well as Xbox Series X/S, with Remake reportedly arriving this year and Rebirth in 2026. That's not especially surprising to hear, of course, given Square Enix last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">confirmed it was "aggressively pursuing" a new multiplatform strategy</a> amid reports that Rebirth underperformed on PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, before all this can happen, Nintendo needs to formally unveil Switch 2 - although by the time it finally does so, there might not be a whole lot left we don't already know. Numerous Switch 2 reports and leaks have surfaced in recent weeks, purportedly showing off everything from the machine's form factor to its logo. And while Nintendo did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">briefly break its silence</a> earlier today amid the swirl of reports, all we know for certain is that Switch 2 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">officially unveiled before 31st March</a>, when the company's current financial year comes to a close.
