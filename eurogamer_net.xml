Playdead, the developer behind indie darlings <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/limbo">Limbo</a> and Inside, has responded amidst an increasingly ugly spat between the company's co-founders.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a rift between Playdead's Dino Patti and Arnt Jensen are nothing new, and first circulated around the time Patti left Playdead following the launch of Inside in 2016. 
</p>
<p>
This month, however, the friction between the two men has become public - following a claim by Patti that he was the subject of "bullying", and that Jensen had "repeatedly" sent legal threats to him since his departure from the company. 
</p>
<p>
The latest of these legal claims, Patti says, involves a now-deleted LinkedIn post in which he discussed Limbo's development and shared a photo of an "unauthorised" photo taken by Jensen. Patti says he has now been asked to cough up the equivalent of Â£56k in compensation.
</p>
<p>
In response to Patti's claim being made public, Playdead has issued a statement confirming it has "submitted demands" based on a claim of "infringement and unauthorised use of Playdead's trademarks and copyrighted works in a commercial and marketing context" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playdead-co-founder-dino-patti-claims-fellow-co-founder-keeps-legally-threatening-him">Game Developer</a>).
</p>
<p>
"We have found it necessary to take this action to protect our trademarks and copyrights," the company said, "which are essential to Playdead's business and reputation".
</p>
<p>
In a legal document shared by Patti, Playdead wrote that "by providing recipients with core insights to the process of developing Limbo, you are falsely giving the impression that you played a significant role, including a creative role, in the development of the game".
</p>
<p>
Sharing the document online, Patti said he was a "significant part of building Playdead from the ground up" and that without him, "Playdead wouldn't have existed". 
</p>
<p>
"Arnt, please stop the bullying," Patti concluded. "I will not stop being who I am. I will never erase my own history. You can't rewrite the past just because of a bad breakup." 
</p>
<p>
Playdead is currently working on its third game, which it began teasing in 2017. In 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-announces-publishing-deal-with-control-inside-and-the-last-guardian-devs">Epic Games confirmed it would handle publishing duties on the game</a>.
</p>
<p>
Patti launched Somerville, his first game at new studio Jumpship, in 2022. An adventure platform game with physics-based puzzles, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/somerville-review-a-tasteful-apocalypse-with-a-little-light-puzzling">received decent reviews, amidst comparisons to Playdead's work</a>.

            <p>Videos showing off New Vegas sets created for the second season of Fallout have started making the rounds online.</p>
<p>Please note <strong>there may be minor spoilers for Amazon's Fallout adaptation below</strong>.</p>

<p>At the end of the first season, we all saw disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour, fleeing towards the post-apocalyptic locale.</p>
<p>Soon after this episode aired, showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">confirmed the next season will head to New Vegas</a>, and said its now-ruined state was designed to show the audience that "things have happened" to the location since the events of New Vegas the game. The duo then added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunners-confirm-new-vegas-character-involved-with-season-two">New Vegas' enigmatic leader Mr House will be "involved in season two"</a>, although they held back from telling us any more. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-fallout-set-photo-teases-a-familiar-new-vegas-face-of-jurassic-proportions">Dinky will be around for season two, as well</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we have a pretty decent look at the Fallout show's take on New Vegas, thanks to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onzo1313/video/7479259030754495787">TikTok user Onzo1313</a>. Onzo1313 has shared several videos showing off the set, including the iconic strip along with - of course - a Lucky 38 casino sign. Lucky 38 is Mr House's citadel from which he reigns over the New Vegas Strip and its various casinos.</p>
<p>One particular video showing off the strip is shaky, but the location itself seems to be in relatively good condition, leading to some speculation this area will feature as part of a flashback sequence.</p>

</span></p><p>Another video, meanwhile, offers a look at New Vegas boards that are showing signs of age and rust, clearly from the 'present'.</p>
<p>There is also a sign for Micheal Angelo's shown off in this video. Michael Angelo's workshop is a location in New Vegas, which is found on the strip.</p>

</span></p><p>Earlier this year, Fallout's Ghoul Walton Goggins provided us all with a little update on the upcoming season, promising that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">while season one was certainly good, the next one is going to be even better</a>.</p>
<p>"This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story," the actor said in February. "It's really gonna be something. I can't wait for people to see it."</p>
<p>New cast members reported to be joining Goggins for Fallout season two include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-reportedly-adds-marvel-actor-kumail-nanjiani-to-its-cast">Kumail Nanjiani as "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel"</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Macaulay Culkin as "a crazy genius-type character"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
