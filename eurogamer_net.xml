            <p>Nintendo has released a new trailer for its cosy Pokémon spin-off Pokopia, revealing new forms for series icons Pikachu and Snorlax.</p>
<p>Shown at the very end, Pikachu appears to be in ghost form, while Snorlax is made of stone with a flower on its head. Beyond outfits and Gigantamax variants, this is the first time either of these two Pokémon has had a new form.</p>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed these are Peakychu, a "pale Pikachu with drooping ears whose fur is a mysterious colour", and Mosslax, covered in moss of course. There's also a new Smeargle called Smearguru, who uses its tail as a brush.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the trailer goes into detail on Pokopia's life-sim gameplay that bears resemblance to both Animal Crossing and Minecraft.</p>
<p>You'll play as a Ditto who transforms into the image of a young girl, though the trailer later confirms you'll be able to customise the character to your liking.</p>
<p>Ditto is introduced to Professor Tangrowth, who appears as a sort of mentor figure. The professor explains the island used to be home to many humans, but now it's deserted. It's Ditto's job to regenerate the island, using the power of Pokémon of course.</p>

<p>Firstly you'll need to create habitats to attract Pokémon to the island. That might be as simple as planting tall grass to attract the likes of Charmander, Timburr, or Eevee, while a punching bag will attract Hitmonchan, and a fishing rod will attract a Magikarp.</p><p>Ditto can then learn signature moves from Pokémon to further spruce up the island. Yes, you can learn Squirtles Water Gun move to vom up a load of water from Ditto's mouth to help plants grow. Other moves include Scyther's Cut and Bulbasaur's Vine Whip.</p>

</figure>
<p>Certain Pokémon will also have special moves allowing Ditto to transform. Lapras, for instance, will allow Ditto to swim to new islands, or with Dragonite you can fly.</p>
<p>Ditto can then craft items at a workbench using materials found on the island, like logs and straw beds to make Pokémon more comfortable. And yes, Ditto appears to vomit these items up too.</p>
<p>Appeasing Pokémon requests provides mini quests too, and Ditto can also use the power of Pokémon to help out around the island - Pichu's electric abilities can light up lamps, for instance.</p>
<p>What's more, Pokopia can be played with up to four players co-operatively, and uses Game Share to share with friends without the game across either Switch or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-spin-off-pokemon-pokopia-gets-release-date-but-its-another-controversial-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Pokémon Pokopia will be out on 5th March</a>, as revealed earlier this week. However, it will also be a Game-Key Card, Nintendo's controversial physical media.</p>

            <p>The first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> community event, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">which asks players to contribute resources to unlock a new explorable area of the game</a>, has been made substantially harder mere hours after launch as the playerbase was completing it too quickly.</p>
<p>Community manager Ossen addressed the sudden change on the official Arc Raiders Discord server, writing: "You have been progressing the unlock event much faster than we anticipated. We had no idea all of you would be so altruistic for the Stella Montis cause, and you are donating so much more than we could imagine. We want this event to be experienced by Raiders all over the world and therefore we are raising the bar to unlock Stella Montis expecting you to surprise us again."</p>
<p>Eurogamer can confirm the change was substantial, seeing firsthand the progress bar had reached at least 8 percent completion this morning before it shot all the way back down to around 1 percent. So, you may have to wait a little longer to play on the new map: Stella Montis.</p>

<p>If you were wondering why the progress bar was completed so quickly, there are a few explanations. The first is the simplest: the game is incredibly popular and Embark didn't expect people to be so keen to throw resources at this event.</p><p>It could also be down to the resources required. The community event requires players to contribute basic resources, like fabric and plastic. These aren't hard resources to gather, in fact Nugget (the resource gathering chicken in your raider hideout) gathers them for free in large quantities. As such, dedicated players have accrued hundreds of these resources. Personally speaking, I had over 600 of each basic resource this morning, and was easily able to contribute plenty to the effort.</p>
<p>This all begs the question: when will the community event conclude? Well, it's safe to assume players will have at least a few days to log in and contribute to the community event. The rewards for doing so are a mystery right now, but if you contribute a relatively small amount you can earn merit points that'll be redeemable when the event concludes. So get to it!</p>
<p>If this sounds exciting to you, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders review</a> to figure out if it's the game for you! In it, reviewer Rick Lane describes it as: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>
