<p>The PlayStation Plus games for July are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diablo 4 (PS5, PS4) - available 1st July</li>
<li>Jusant (PS5) - available 1st July</li>
<li>King of Fighters 15 (PS5, PS4) - available 1st July</li>

<p>In addition, the following activities will be available throughout July, until early August:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trial version of WWE 2K25 will be available to PS Plus Premium members (available 25th June)</li>
<li>A trial version of Monster Hunter: Wilds (available 30th June)</li>
<li>Discounts on select games like Sniper Elite: Resistance, Sid Meier's Civilization 7 and Star Wars Outlaws (running during the weekend starting 27th June)</li>
<li>Free Valorant pack for all PlayStation Plus members, including: two Prelude to Chaos Gun Buddies, a Kohaku and Matsuba Player Card, an Imperium Spray, a Chronovoid Spray, and ten Radianite Points.</li>
<li>Special PlayStation Plus PlayStation tournaments for EA Sports FC, NBA 2K, UFC, Madden NFL, College Football, Tekken 8, and more (available 28th June) </li>
<li>A 15 percent discount on Sony Pictures Core for all PlayStation Plus subscribers (available 25th June until 12th August)</li>
<li>A free multiplayer weekend, where those without PlayStation Plus memberships can play online for free (available 28th June)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's wild to think PlayStation Plus is 15-years-old! The service, alongside Xbox Game Pass, has absolutely changed the game development marketplace. Not only has it shifted the perceived value of games (arguably for the worse), but it's also offered another way for developers to survive in what has been a damn awful few years in the industry.</p>
<p>As for this line-up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-review-richness-luxury-and-compromise">Diablo 4 is clearly the star of the show</a>. A massive, ambitious sequel to a gaming giant, the game went back to its violent horror roots in a powerful and moreish way.</p>
<p>That's not to say the other two games are stinkers! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-review">Jusant is by all accounts a lovely game to spend your evenings playing</a>, while King of Fighters 15 is a superb fighter filled with equal parts style and quality design.</p>
<p>Those 15th anniversary events are a nice touch too! <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">Monster Hunter: Wilds has been in a better place sure</a>, but if you were ever curious to see what all the noise was about now is as good a time as any to try it out. Those PlayStation tournaments are rad too, a good chance to battle it out online in your favourite competitive game.</p>
<p>Full details on this month's PS Plus offerings can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/25/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-july-a-big-thank-you-to-players-for-15-wonderful-years/">PlayStation Blog</a>. </p>
<p>All in all, a solid offering this month! Meanwhile, you'll find more details on what else is on offer via the service in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">our full PlayStation Plus guide here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-games-for-july]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Spoilers for<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2"> Death Stranding 2</a> are flooding social media and YouTube, posted by those who bought the digital deluxe edition of the game.</p>
<p>This digital deluxe edition, which provides a 48-hour early access window to those who buy it, released on the 24th June. For owners of the regular version, the game becomes available tomorrow on the 26th June.</p>
<p>Those who have been able to play early have been keen to share their experiences online, but given how narratively rich Death Stranding 2 is (and the whole catalogue of Kojima's works), this has led to a deluge of early game story moments and equipment popping up on the internet.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2, a game which takes between 35-50 hours to beat, is a chunky experience, especially for completionists. However, given the fact deluxe edition owners will obviously continue to play and post their screenshots and videos online as they proceed into the game's later moments, it's best to stay away from such platforms if you're looking to go in fresh.</p>
<p>It's been a rough few days for the spoiler-averse. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-death-stranding-2s-full-opening-hour-has-leaked-online">the opening hour of the game leaked online</a>, giving away all the twists and turns the game throws at you in the game's opening scenes.</p>
<p>One could argue plenty of story moments have already been revealed ahead of launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-releases-hype-trailer">due to a release trailer for the game</a> which featured plenty of cinematics from throughout the game's runtime. Still, it's nice to go in without knowing the surprises that await you. Except for some of the spoiler-free technical stuff maybe, like the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-instantaneous-loading-times-truly-prove-the-power-of-the-ps5">Death Stranding 2 benefits from super fast load times</a>. Cool!</p>
<p>If you want a spoiler-free impression of what the game is like, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Eurogamer's Death Stranding 2 review</a>! In it, the game is described as: "A busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim." No spoilers necessary!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-spoilers]]></content:encoded>
