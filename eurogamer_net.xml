            <p>Both seasons of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off Arcane cost a total of approximately $250m USD to create and promote, making it the most expensive animated series of all time.</p>
<p>That's according to a new report by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/">Variety</a>, with sources telling the publication the $250m figure covered production and promotion costs for Arcane's two seasons, comprised of 18 episodes in total. The show's first nine episodes are said to have seen a production cost "north of $80m", while the second set of nine episodes - which will make up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">the show's final season</a> - reportedly had a production cost "approaching" the $100m mark.</p>
<p>Variety claims development costs were pushed up due to "a labour-intensive approach and frequent cost overruns triggered by delayed script deliveries after the second season was put into production with only a fraction of the season written".</p>

<p>In addition, League of Legends developer Riot reportedly spent $60m promoting the first season of the animated spin-off, which released on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> in 2021. Variety says this figure is more than other studios would ordinarily spend to promote a show they weren't distributing.</p><p>When the publication asked Riot about Arcane's price tag, Riot co-founder and chief product officer Marc Merrill said, "We're more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players' time." Merrill refrained from confirming or denying whether the reported $250m figure was accurate.</p>
<p>The Riot exec added the company's "ambitions in entertainment haven't changed" since Arcane's release. "We were never intending to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines," Merrill said. "What <em>did</em> change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realised that getting it right takes a lot more time than we'd originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals and teams with that in mind."</p>
<p>Arcane's second season is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-arcane-season-two-will-launch-in-november-2024">set to air on Netflix, starting 9th November</a>. As for season one, our Chris called it "a thrill, full of welcome colour and life" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-act-1-review-riots-glossy-animated-netflix-series-opens-with-a-striking-if-familiar-bang">Eurogamer's review</a> (which was based on the first four episodes), although he still had a few reservations. Following its debut, Arcane subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-league-of-legends-animated-show-arcane-wins-an-emmy-for-outstanding-animated-program">won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has shed further insight on its approach to mergers and acquisitions.</p>
<p>In today's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo stated that while it would "not rule out the possibility of further mergers and acquisitions", its current "priority is to organically expand the organisation". This is so "new staff members are able to fully learn and understand our creative culture" at Nintendo.</p>
<p>The Mario maker seldom partakes in acquisitions, only making a handful in recent years. In May, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-acquisition-since-2022-and-its-from-embracer">company acquired Shiver Entertainment</a> from Embracer. Shiver is a studio responsible for porting the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> onto Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>This particular deal marked Nintedo's first acquisition since 2022, when it purchased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-animation-studio-it-will-rename-nintendo-pictures">Dynamo Pictures</a> (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-launches-its-nintendo-pictures-animation-studio">subsequently became Nintendo Pictures</a>) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-acquiring-long-time-development-partner-srd">SRD</a>. In 2021, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-luigis-mansion-3-developer-next-level-games">Nintendo purchased Next Level Games</a>, the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-3">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>.</p>
<p>That same year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/05/nintendos_ready_for_acquisitions_when_the_time_is_right">said</a> any acquisitions it makes would be determined by the company's need to keep pace with "rapidly advancing technological innovation". The following year, Nintendo president <a href="https://x.com/6d6f636869/status/1489149335203815431">Shuntaro Furukawa</a> stated: "Our brand was built upon products crafted with dedication by our employees, and having a large number of people who donâ€™t possess Nintendo DNA in our group would not be a plus to the company."</p>
<p>Then, last year, Furukawa <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nikkei-shuntaro-furukawa-interview-switch-support-until-early-march-2025-increase-in-in-house-developers-and-thought-process-behind-acquisitions.770663/">explained</a> Nintendo does not "reject the use of M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions)", adding "if an organisation that does not understand Nintendo's creative approach is brought into the fold, it may not produce the expected results".</p>
<p>Furukawa closed: "On the other hand, for companies with a similar development approach, we can form various partnerships with them, not limited to M&amp;A."</p>

<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Nintendo confirmed its Switch successor will be backward compatible with Switch games</a>, adding that Nintendo Switch is now played by over 100 million people worldwide, with that number covering every age range from children to seniors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
