            <p>Atlus has teased the next game in its Persona series due for global release, ahead of a livestream later this week.</p>
<p>"Think you dropped this," reads an official social post, with an emoji of an owl.</p>
<p>While some have jumped to the conclusion of a Persona 6 announcement, this is actually news of a full release for mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a>, following its open beta.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-persona-5-spin-off-game-revealed">The Phantom X was revealed back in 2023</a> and comes courtesy of Chinese developer Perfect World. An open beta launched in China last year, with a full global release now anticipated - although all details have so far been in Japanese.</p>
<p>The game will feature familiar elements from the base game, but with gacha gameplay.</p>
<p>It follows two previous spin-off games from Persona 5 - hack and slash follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-strikers-review-an-impressive-sequel-that-inherits-some-of-the-originals-flaws">Persona 5 Strikers</a> and strategy game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-tactica-review-a-welcoming-spin-off-aimed-at-strategy-newcomers">Persona 5 Tactica</a>.</p>

            <p>
Fancy testing FBC: Firebreak this weekend? Control developer Remedy has now opened a sign-up process for its upcoming Control multiplayer spin-off to let you do just that.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak's first closed technical test will run from this Thursday, 15th May at 2pm UK time to next Monday, 19th May at 10pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
Remedy will be testing a pre-release version of the game across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S during this period, and you can register your interest now via the <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">developer's website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Set within Control's mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, and revisiting a number of familiar locations from that game, FBC: Firebreak is a three-player PVE shooter spin-off from Remedy set to launch on 17th June.
</p>
<p>
The past year has seen mixed results for other new shooters, with the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> but also the failure of Concord. During a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">recent Q&amp;A session attended by Eurogamer</a>, Remedy said it was confident its new offering would find a niche. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not that we are arrogant," said Remedy's Thomas Puha, "but since the inception of this game, we've very carefully thought [about] who the audience is, and that dictates everything from how we built it - such as how easy it should be to get into, how long the sessions are... we are not going to do a game that [feels like] another job."
</p>
<p>
When FBC: Firebreak does arrive, it'll be sold for the comparatively cheap price of £33/$40/€40 and also be available via both Xbox Game Pass (including PC Game Pass) and PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
</p>
<p>
Planning to give it a try?

            <p>
Nintendo has revealed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> firmware option that caps its battery charging at around 90 percent. 
</p>
<p>
The option is designed to ensure the device's battery lasts longer over time, at the expense of obviously leaving the device with slightly less juice.
</p>
<p>
The option can be found in the Switch 2's settings menu, under its System settings option. Here you can toggle on the "Stop Charging Around 90 Percent" option.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Nintendo detailed the feature today via its smartphone Nintendo Today app, and included a video (posted by others on social media, and embedded above) showing the option in action. 
</p>
<p>
The Switch 2's settings menu offers more detail on how the option works, stating that the feature "shortens the amount of time the system can be used while unplugged but can help reduce loss of battery capacity over time. 
</p>
<p>
"Even if turned on," Nintendo continues, "the system may charge to 100 percent to ensure accurate battery-level display".
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 isn't the first device to have this feature, but it is the first time a Nintendo console or handheld has provided such an option. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has said it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles during the current financial year, once the hotly-anticipated console arrives on 5th June. Speaking to investors last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo said this total would see Switch 2 selling at a faster rate than Switch 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">had not been constrained by production issues or the threat of higher prices from tariffs</a>.

            <p>
It's been an intriguing 24 hours in the Oblivion Remastered community, after the sighting of a mysterious ghost horse captured fans' imagination and began making headlines. But now, after some scrutiny and deduction, Oblivion players reckon they've figured out what's going on.
</p>
<p>
The story began over the weekend when - wiggly line flashback - user TaricIsNotSupport <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk6y0z/uhhhh_guys_is_this_new/">shared an eye-catching discovery on the Oblivion subreddit</a>, curious to know if it was new to the remaster or just something they'd missed before. "So I was crafting stupid spells in Frostcrag Spire [when] I noticed something suuuuuuper strange in the distance," they wrote. "I did as any of us of the right mind would do and B-lined it over there like a maniac. To my amazement [it] was this spectral horse with no name. I have played thousands of hours of the original Oblivion... yet this is the first I have ever seen this horse."
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk6y0z/uhhhh_guys_is_this_new/">Uhhhh, guys, is this new?</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TaricIsNotASupport/">u/TaricIsNotASupport</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
All this came with the assurance they were Oblivioning on PlayStation - and thus, it wasn't the result of a mod - and a video showing the aforementioned ghost horse swishing nonchalantly (and translucently) by the side of a cliff. With the community's interest piqued, TaricIsNotSupport <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk7rmg/to_the_people_asking_if_i_can_ride_or_interact/">returned with a second post</a>, this time showing their character riding the phantom equine atop snow-covered mountains. "He fast travels and even gets stabled!", they enthusiastically added. "By all accounts it's now my steed!"
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, TaricIsNotSupport's post was greeted with a mixture of skepticism - given the original Oblivion has been pretty well stripped of secrets in the 19 years since its release - and enthusiasm for a new mystery to solve. After all, the possibility developer Virtuos might have squeaked a couple of Easter eggs into its remaster couldn't entirely be dismissed. Some set to work poring over previously accumulated Oblivion knowledge, while others posited - given <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>' notoriously buggy releases - it was possibly a spell-based glitch.
</p>
<p>
Alas, it now appears the latter is true. After some experimentation, subredditor Famous-Escape-2491 shared the news they'd <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kl8s6h/spectral_horse_debunk/">managed to replicate the spectral horse effect</a> using a combination of spells. "Looks like it is due to the glitches where spell visual effects are lingering past their expiration," they wrote. "I was able to recreate the visual using 100 percent chameleon, and Command Creature." They also provided a video as proof.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kl8s6h/spectral_horse_debunk/">Spectral Horse Debunk</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Famous-Escape-2491/">u/Famous-Escape-2491</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>
Famous-Escape-2491 also cautioned against a witch-hunt, noting that rather than being a deliberate wind-up, there was every chance the original poster could "genuinely be unaware" how the spectral steed came to be. "Looking at his posts before that one," they added, "it looks like he plays around with spells - a lot. And considering the weird glitches I've seen, I can't rule out with 100 percent certainty that he may be truthful... I don't want to add to any negativity towards the guy, especially not knowing the specifics of how his scenario occurred."
</p>
<p>
So there you go; Oblivion Remastered's horse ghost is seemingly toast, debunked by community ingenuity and a scientific thirst for answers. If you're feeling a little deflated all this excitement was for nought, Bethesda is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-asks-the-elder-scrolls-fans-to-suggest-oblivion-remastered-improvements-with-difficulty-scaling-among-top-ideas">currently canvassing fans to suggest improvements</a> to its hugely-popular game. So maybe it'll add a real ghost horse if we ask nicely? And if it's <em>more</em> answers you want, you can always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-tips-tricks-and-guides">check out Eurogamer's Oblivion Remastered guide</a>.

<p>
I've asked Bethesda for comment on Oblivion Remastered's ghost horse mystery and will update this story if it replies with anything other than, "LOL".

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> production capacity and US tariffs didn't factor into sales predictions Nintendo said, as its forecasts were criticised by investors for being conservative.</p>
<p>Following its latest financial report where Nintendo predicted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Switch 2 sales would slightly outsell its predecessor</a>, multiple investors probed the company on why it hadn't estimated higher sales during a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf">Q&amp;A</a>.</p>
<p>"We are forecasting Nintendo Switch 2 hardware sales of 15m units for this fiscal year," said Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa. "We set this figure with the aim of reaching the same level of sales we achieved with Nintendo Switch in the roughly 10-month period between its launch in March 2017 and December that year."</p>

<p>The "limits of our hardware production capacity were not a factor" in setting the sales volume forecast, he continued, and "the tariff situation in the US or a possibility of a recession did not affect our sales volume forecast either".</p>
<p>"Our first goal is to get off to the same start we did with Nintendo Switch, and we are working to strengthen our production capacity so we can respond flexibly to demand," said Furukawa.</p>
<p>In a follow-up question, the president continued: "We recognise the positive feedback from the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events and the situation with applications for randomly selected drawings for pre-orders on My Nintendo Store in Japan. But the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware is priced relatively high compared to Nintendo Switch, so even if there is momentum around the launch, we know it will not be easy to keep that momentum going over the long term through the holiday season and beyond.</p>
<p>"We have been working to ramp up Nintendo Switch 2 hardware production since even before we held the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events and began My Nintendo Store applications. Our sales volume forecast was not determined based on any limit to production capacity."</p>
<p>Demand for the Switch 2 in Japan in particular has far exceeded expectations - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Furukawa previously warned of stock issues</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo predicted 45m sales of software in its financial report, but Furukawa noted this figure does not include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> units bundled with the console. Including these units, software sales are expected to surpass the 52m units sold for the original Switch. This is partly due to the "more robust lineup" at launch than the previous console.</p>
<p>Further, Furukawa stated the forecast was calculated maintaining current US tariff rates throughout the fiscal year. This has, however, resulted in a "negative impact of several tens of billions of yen at the profit level". The Switch 2 hardware also has a lower profit margin compared to the original Switch.</p>
<p>Should tariffs change, the company will consider price adjustments accordingly.</p>
<p>"Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognise them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price," said Furukawa. "However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware. Consequently, if the assumptions on tariffs change, we will consider what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate, taking into account various factors such as the market conditions."</p>
<p>Furukawa's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">echo those of Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser</a>, who admitted tariffs were "something we're going to have to address".</p>
<p>Later, Furukawa also commented on the increased price of hardware and software compared to the previous console.</p>
<p>"When determining hardware prices, we consider not only the manufacturing cost, but also various factors such as consumers' impression of the price, the vast differences in exchange rates compared to the Nintendo Switch launch, and the market conditions in each region," said Furukawa.</p>
<p>"For software, in addition to the same factors, we also take into account rises in costs, due to aspects such as increased game file size and extended development periods, when determining price.</p>
<p>"Going forward, we will continue to consider appropriate prices for each title when it comes to software prices. Hardware involves special factors such as tariffs, and we will take into account factors like those we have just described, while conducting careful and repeated deliberations when determining price."</p>
<p>Bowser previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">higher price tag for Mario Kart World was an example of "variable pricing"</a> and was not establishing a more expensive "benchmark".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
