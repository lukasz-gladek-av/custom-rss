To date, my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> experience has largely consisted of building an ungainly box and hanging from the ceiling in my underwear. But more driven players have already barrelled their way to the endgame, where its "extremely competitive" PvP focus has become something of a concern for PvE players. Enter developer Funcom, which reckons it might have found a solution.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening's endgame, if you're unfamiliar, is focused on the Deep Desert. This vast, ever-shifting landscape is where players can venture in search of valuable resources and endgame gear as they make a grasp for factional supremacy, and one that's reset every week by Coriolis storms. It's also PvP-focused - a design decision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">Funcom has previously stood firm on</a>, even as Ornithopters <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">rained down from above</a>. Now, though, Dune: Awakening creative director Joel Bylos has admitted the system isn't quite working in the way the team had hoped.
</p>
<p>
"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert," he explained in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">newly shared developer blog</a>. "The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe. Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert... The reality is that players are reporting being cut out of the endgame due to the extremely competitive nature of the Deep Desert.

<p>
This runs counter to the team's vision, according to Bylos. "We want PvE players to be able to play the endgame and have access to the content of the endgame. Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in."
</p>
<p>
As such, Funcom is introducing Partial Warfare (PvE) zones to the Deep Desert where players can explore testing stations and harvest T6 resources without being forced into conflict with other players. However, Landsraad control points, shipwrecks and the largest spice fields will remain War of Assassins (PvP) flagged. "The deepest parts of the Deep Desert," Bylos continued, "will remain as they currently are - high reward, high risk areas."
</p>
<p>
"The beauty of the Deep Desert design with weekly resets and renewals," he added, "is that we can iterate and experiment with different layouts and setups to really help us tune it. As we make changes we will send out surveys to help us capture your thoughts."
</p>
<p>
On top of that, Bylos acknowledged a variety of issues impacting PvP. Some of these relate to Ornithopters, which have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">dominated Dune: Awakening's endgame</a> ever since players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">realised they could drop them on other people's heads</a>. Scout Ornithopters will see a range of changes, which Funcom details in its blog, as will other mechanics the studio believes are being "abused", including respawn timers, vehicle storage tools, and hand scanners.
</p>
<p>
"The intended dynamic of Deep Desert PvP" Bylos noted, "is that - unless you really mess up - you always have the option to retreat in good order with whatever you've managed to claim so far. If you're smart and vigilant, you never <em>have to</em> fight if you don't want to. If you run, you'll have to call a halt to whatever task you were pursuing, but that should always be a choice. PvP should happen when both parties decide they want to fight over a location."
</p>
<p>
And finally, Bylos had a few words to say on Dune: Awakening's Landsraad design, admitting this endgame "framework" still has a number of "key flaws". Funcom is currently looking at addressing some of these, including the "inability to hand in items after a square is completed and the rapidity at which some squares are turned in", alongside stockpiling, which is currently being unintentionally rewarded. Additionally, the studio will be introducing Landsraad "micro rewards" for solo/small group players. 
</p>
<p>
"Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing," Bylos concluded. "We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. Bear with us â€“ our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and to make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy." And by all accounts, Dune: Awakening - which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">gave four stars in our review</a> - currently has a lot of everybodys, what with having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-worms-its-way-past-one-million-sales-funcoms-best-performing-game-to-date">already hurtled passed 1m sales</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, Sega accidentally leaked sales figures for a number of its key franchises, revealing - among others - the sales of its open zone game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>.</p>
<p>The numbers were accidentally included on the company's latest fiscal report and have since been swiftly removed, but not before fans shared the numbers on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sammy-fiscal-report-mishap-reveals-sales-numbers-for-a-dozen-titles-lad-iw-1-66m-p3r-2-07m-sonic-frontiers-4-57m-p5r-7-25m-and-more.1224501/">ResetEra</a>.</p>
<p>Total sales of Sonic Frontiers were 4.57m, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> was 2.43m, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> was 3.5m. Meanwhile, as officially revealed by the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> sold 2.3m units.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the leak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> has sold 7.25m units - as expected - while Persona 3 Reload just 2.07m units. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth sold 1.66m units, and Like A Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name just 960,000.</p>
<p>Sega also officially revealed Metaphor: ReFantazio sold 2m units.</p>
<p>The company critically had a great year in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> was well received by series fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was an outstanding new RPG, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> was one of the best-reviewed Sonic games in recent memory. But this reception seemingly hasn't translated to strong sales.</p>
<p>Still, the figure for Sonic Frontiers does stand out. Released back in 2022, it proves the game has had a long sales tail - even if that's been spurred on by discounts. And, as the pre-eminent 3D game in the series, its sales have continued alongside both the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 films.</p>
<p>Back in November 2022, Sonic Team head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">Takashi Iizuka stated Sonic Frontiers' open zone design was the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>. There will be high hopes, then, for its presumed sequel.</p>
<p>Sonic Frontiers established the "open zone" design (rather than open world), which emphasised exploration as well as speed and took advantage of current hardware technology (despite its egregious pop-in).</p>
<p>Sonic Superstars, released a year later, has just over half the sales of Sonic Frontiers. A 2D game, it perhaps didn't sit well with fans after the forward-thinking Frontiers.</p>
<p>As for Sonic X Shadow Generations, it has sold well since its release last year, spurred on by the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film. However, it's still a remake of an older game. And it seems, as much as Sega trades in nostalgia, it's the open zone advancement in design that fans have responded to with their wallets.</p>
<p>The fact Team Sonic Racing has outsold more traditional platformers also bodes well for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Team Sonic is heading in the right direction, and expectations will be high for the original game that follows Sonic Frontiers.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">discussed with Iizuka recently</a>, Sonic has gone from "fighting to survive" to a global megastar in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>"When I moved over from Tokyo to Los Angeles, it was like an â€˜oh my god' moment," Iizuka said. "Like, we need to save the brand, or this brand isn't going to be around for much longer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-leaked-sales-figures-show-sonics-new-frontier-is-heading-in-the-right-direction]]></content:encoded>
