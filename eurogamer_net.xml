            <p>Sony Santa Monica, the studio behind the God of War series, is working on a new game, but reportedly it won't be a new IP though "it might feel like one".</p>
<p>There's been plenty of speculation around what the studio may be working on next, in particular game director Cory Barlog. He was responsible for the God of War reboot in 2018, but on its sequel he was producer.</p>
<p>Now, Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier has addressed the speculation on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">ResetEra</a>, calling Barlog's game "Sony Santa Monica's next big thing" and that "it was going well" at least a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>In a later response, Schreier added it won't be a new IP and it certainly won't be a sci-fi game.</p>
<p>"I'll put it this way: it’s not a new IP but it might feel like one," Schreier said. "Maybe that's why people are confused. Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum. And that the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."</p>
<p>Rumours swirled in August last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">Sony Santa Monica was developing its first new IP in over 20 years</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear if the studio has multiple projects, or if indeed its next game will be part of an existing franchise. The obvious conclusion is a new game in the God of War series, likely with a new direction.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one]]></content:encoded>
