            <p>
Well you certainly can't accuse <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> of becoming predictable. Nine years after its launch, Hello Games' exploratory space sim is still somehow finding ways to surprise - and that continues with its new palaeontology themed Relics update, which is out today on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Relics sees Hello Games festooning its virtual universe with procedural prehistoric bones that budding palaeontologists can collect and trade in a sort of excavation-based 'gotta-catch-'em-all' frenzy. Bones can be acquired by digging deep beneath the earth, then assembled into skeletons based entirely on players' own whims. These in turn can be displayed back at base, meaning it's now essentially possible to create entire museums of baffling bone creations.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't stop there, however. Digs can also unearth fossils of varying rarities - some of immense value - and a new specialist has been introduced to space stations, giving players a way to barter for the missing pieces in their collection. Just be aware that digging isn't without risk; it's said dangerous new enemies can be found guarding the most valuable treasures, including Stone Ghosts, a colossal Stone Golem, and even a skeletal Titan Worm.

As is now tradition, Relics' arrival will be followed soon after by a new limited-time community expedition - this one focusing on palaeontology and challenging Travellers to compete for the rarest finds. "We think players will have a lot of fun digging into the new-found palaeontology of the universe," Hello Games adds in its announcement.

            <p>The introduction of Abby Anderson will be a bit different in HBO's The Last of Us TV series than it is in the game. </p>

<p>Just as with the first season, there will be some differences between the game and the TV show due to the nature of each medium, ensuring the story remains satisfying for each audience and spoilers are less likely to occur.</p>
<p>"In the game, you play as Abby, so you immediately form a path to connection with her, because you're surviving as her, you're running through the snow, you're fighting infected, and we can withhold certain things and make it a mystery that will be revealed later in the story," <a href="https://www.goldderby.com/article/2025/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-introduction/">The Last of Us' Neil Druckmann shared during a press conference</a>.</p>
<p>He noted the showrunners "couldn't do that" in the TV series because, obviously, viewers won't be able to actually play as Abby when season two airs. "So we need other tools, and that context gave us that shortcut," Druckmann explained.</p>
<p>The showrunners ultimately decided to tweak the game's timeline framing a notch, and instead The Last of Us series two will introduce Abby (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-teaser-gives-first-look-at-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby">played by Kaitly Dever</a>) and reveal her connection to Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie to the audience from the off.</p>
<p>"Where that revelation happens in the game, if we were to stick to a very similar timeline, viewers would have to wait a very, very long time to get that context," Druckmann reasoned.</p>
<p>"It would probably get spoiled to them between seasons, and we didn't want that, so it felt appropriate for those reasons to move that up and give the viewer that context right off the bat."</p>

            <p>CD Projekt Red doesn't plan to release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> by the end of 2026, perhaps hinting it could be a next generation game.</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY-Q-Wd3Hz4&amp;t=1175s">financial call</a>, the company discussed its profit forecast for the next few years up to 2028, for which it expects a significant increase.</p>
<p>"Even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026, we are still driven by this financial goal," the company said.</p>

<p>The Witcher 4 was first revealed at last year's The Game Awards, though no release window was provided leaving fans to speculate. Though 2025 was very unlikely, some had hoped for a 2026 release. Now we know it will be 2027 at the earliest.</p>
<p>This is also in-line with journalist Jason Schreier, who <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981">responded on ResetEra</a> that both The Witcher 4 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Intergalactic won't be out next year.</p>
<p>Does this mean The Witcher 4 will be a next generation game? Sony is no doubt already planning its PlayStation 6 console, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Xbox is reportedly targeting 2027 for its next console</a>.</p>
<p>Or perhaps the game could be a cross-generation release, though that didn't work out well for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer previously spoke with CDPR's vice president of technology, Charles Tremblay, about a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">potential PC-only launch for The Witcher 4</a>, with consoles following.</p>
<p>"It's something we discussed, actually," he said, "but we're not 100 percent sure. Maybe - so it's hard to say if we want to go this way at this stage. I would assume that as long as I understand, like, the strategy we want to do - I'm just trying not to say too much, bear with me - most likely, the launch, we will not have a PC-only launch, for example. I don't think this is a strategy we want to adopt right now. That being said, will it mean that we will have - let's say there were 20 platforms available - we'll have 20 at launch? Maybe not. But at least PC only, and then scattered, it's not necessarily the approach we want to go forward, for sure."</p>
<p>From the same financial call, joint CEO Michał Nowakowski discussed not using generative AI in The Witcher 4 due to the legalities of ownership.</p>
<p>"I think we mentioned before that last year, we set up a team that's investigating the potential use of AI solutions in our future products, including development of our own customised AI models," he said. "And we have several research projects underway. However, they are really not necessarily focusing on generative AI.</p>
<p>"Gen AI, to be honest, is quite tricky when it comes to legal IP ownership and so on, and many other aspects. So when it comes to implementation of any gen AI in the actual games, we really have nothing happening when it comes to Witcher 4 or any projects in the near future."</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">confirmed a partnership with Saudi-backed mobile developer Scopely</a> to create a game within one of CDPR's franchises.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
