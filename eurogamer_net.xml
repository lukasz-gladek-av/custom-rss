            <p>Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>The DLC will make its debut later this month, on 15th July, via Steam. Ark: Aquatica will submerge players under the waters, tasking them with "new survival mechanics, extreme environmental hazards, a huge explorable map area, and unique gameplay elements".</p>
<p>It will additionally introduce 21 new tameable creatures, as well as 74 new Engrams (including 7 tek Engrams), and "underwater survival thanks to things like air pockets and propulsion vehicles". </p>
<p>Perhaps feeling a sense of 'once bitten, twice shy' due to those AI slop accusations from earlier this year, the developer has released a really very, <em>very</em> brief release date teaser for the upcoming expansion, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Snail Games and Ark: Aquatica made headlines back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">when a trailer released during GDC was clearly AI-generated</a>.</p>
<p>The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured things like a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team. "They took our assets and then ran them through an AI to animate them. That was marketing," lead game designer Matt Kohl said in March.</p>
<p>At this time, Kohl stated: "There has been no AI use in development of Aquatica."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-accusations-of-ai-slop-ark-aquaticas-release-date-trailer-is-playing-it-very-safe]]></content:encoded>
