            <p>The soundtrack for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> includes only 10 tracks from the original two games, after Tony Hawk himself wanted to emphasise music discovery.</p>
<p>The full soundtrack was <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/uk/en/blog/2025/06/tony-hawk-pro-skater-three-four-full-soundtrack">revealed at the start of June</a> by publisher Activision, but ahead of the game's full release this week, reviews have criticised changes to the soundtrack and its lack of songs from the original games.</p>
<p>Out of the 69 songs across both Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4, only 10 from the original games have been included. Instead, in some instances, a different song from the same artist has been used - the remainder are new to the series.</p>

<p>Those 10 returning songs are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Faction - Skate &amp; Destroy</li>
<li>Gang Starr - Mass Appeal</li>
<li>JFA - Beach Blanket Bongout</li>
<li>RUN-D.M.C. - My Adidas</li>
<li>Motörhead - Ace of Spades</li>
<li>Del the Funky Homosapien - If You Must</li>
<li>AFI - The Boy Who Destroyed the World</li>
<li>Adolescents - Amoeba</li>
<li>CKY - 96 Quite Bitter Beings</li>
<li>Bodyjar - Not the Same</li>
</ol>
<p>One major reason for not including certain songs may be licensing issues.</p>
<p>However, in the same blog post revealing the soundtrack, Christopher Wilson, VP of production at Activision Publishing stated: "We wanted to keep the feel of the original games but also introduce new artists and songs."</p>
<p>He added: "Throughout the project, Tony added tracks and suggested using different songs from artists that were featured on the original games.</p>
<p>"The soundtrack is meant to be a love letter to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> franchise, skateboarding in general, and be an opportunity to showcase music that falls outside of the mainstream."</p>
<p>Wilson's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-was-tony-hawks-choice-to-pick-some-different-songs-by-the-same-artists-in-pro-skater-34-remake">mirror those of Hawk himself</a>, who previously stated on an Instagram post it was his choice "to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST".</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that discovery is half the fun, and a big reason that these soundtracks resonated in the first place," he said. "So listen and enjoy the ride."</p>
<p>Still, the soundtracks to all the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games are iconic, reflecting the musical tastes of the early 00s. The changes have left some fans disappointed, in response to reviews by critics.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">returning for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is skater Bam Margera</a>, after Hawk intervened.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released on 11th July across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, PS5, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft). It's available in early access now for those who pre-ordered.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4s-soundtrack-includes-only-10-tracks-from-original-games-as-focus-shifts-to-new-music]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is ready to stick a rusty knife into its distended fleshsack of horror IP collaborations yet again, this time resulting in The Walking Dead splattering wetly onto its gore-soaked floor. We already knew the collaboration was coming, of course, but with its public test build now live, developer Behaviour Interactive has finally detailed exactly what's involved.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration introduces two new survivors, bringing three new perks apiece: Rick Grimes - the man with more hat than personality (until he gave away his hat) - and formidable zombie slayer (plus pointy sword fan) Michonne Grimes.
</p>
<p>
Rick comes with the Apocalyptic Ingenuity perk, which enables him to turn broken pallets into fragile pallets after interacting with a certain number of chests, plus the Come and Get Me perk, which causes Rick to scream, alerting the killer to his aura, but prevents injured or dying survivors from leaving scratch marks or blood trails within a certain radius. Additionally, there's the Toughen Up teamwork perk, which reduces Rick's grunts of pain, scratch marks, and pools of blood when another survivor pallet-stuns or blinds the killer while he's injured.

<p>
As for Michonne, her Conviction perk lets her recover immediately after healing a survivor while downed, but Broken is then applied, downing her again after a certain length of time. Last Stand, meanwhile, is a once-per-trial perk that lets Michonne fast-vault and stun the killer after she's been in its terror radius for a set amount of time. As for her Throw Down teamwork perk, it gives Endurance to other survivors and lets them see the killer's aura briefly when she pallet-stun or blinds the killer. You'll find a few more specifics - alongside details of other updates and enhancements - in Behaviour Interactive's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/381210/view/538857783458533234?l=english">9.1.0 patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's The Walking Dead collaboration - which arrives sandwiched between its previously announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's and The Witcher collaborations</a> - can be played right now via the game's public test build on PC, but Behaviour notes Michonne Grimes won't be included due to "known technical issues". Expect these to be resolved, the studio says, in time for update 9.1.0's full release across all platforms on 29th July. <a href="https://youtu.be/Q9aM9Ch97U8">La jiggy jar jar doo</a>.
