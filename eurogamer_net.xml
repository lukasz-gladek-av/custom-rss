            <p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>'s third season, packing a "back to basics" balance adjustment and four new characters. Three of those characters, returning veterans from the series' history, were also revealed in the announcement.</p>
<p>This update comes following the second season, which proved controversial as it stayed true to the overly-aggressive direction established when the game first released. Mechanics like Heat Dash allowed players to sidestep (ironically) traditional thoughtful defensive play. Season 2 drew plenty of ire from series veterans, and there seems to be a sense of refreshement in the community on the back of this announcemnet.</p>
<p>This season 3 trailer, showing less-flashy combos, sidestepping actually <em>working</em>, appears to be returning to a more traditional Tekken approach.</p>

<p>As for those four characters present in Season 3 as DLC, we saw a brief in-engine appearance of Kunimitsu. She'll be coming in Spring 2026, while Bob is coming in Summer in his regular Robust form. Roger Jr, the (in)famous boxing Kangaroo, will be hopping into the roster come Autumn. The fourth DLC character, as well as a purchasable DLC stage, will be the final addition in 2026's Winter season. These have not yet been revelead, however. Will it be another legacy character, or a brand-new figher? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The season 3 pass will go on sale on the 10th February, which will come digitally packaged with the Aurora costume pack: a total of 44 in-game costumes for the whole cast including upcoming season 3 characters.</p>

            <p>The director and creator of Ashes of Creation, the MMORPG brought to life via the $3.2 million donated by almost 20,000 backers in 2017, has quit "in protest" against decisions his board was making that he could "not ethically agree with or carry out".</p>
<p>Following a slew of unhappy messages from numerous people posted online across Discord and LinkedIn (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGN</a>), it appears that director Steven Sharif's resignation triggered further resignations across "much of the senior leadership team" of Intrepid Studios, after which the Board "proceed[ed] with a mass layoff".</p>

<p>Things seemed to be coming to a head towards the end of January, when, on the 27th, a notice was posted on the official <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">website</a> promising to address several issues and informing players that the studio was moving its Development Update to 13th February. It was signed by "The Ashes of Creation team", and did not address the game's future.</p><p>"I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation," Sharif wrote on Discord a couple of days later. "Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue WARN Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.</p>
<p>"I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty that they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed at the situation."</p>
<p>Then, overnight (31st January), director of communications Margaret Krohn confirmed on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that their time at Intrepid Studios "has come to a close", writing: "As for how this all ended… I don't really have the words. It wasn't what I expected. But I'm holding onto the good because there was so much of it".</p>
<p>Players are now understandably concerned that the game they only purchased a couple of weeks ago - it released into early access on 11th December - could be in jeopardy, and the Steam page, and its subsequent reviews, is now filling up with concerns and complaints from players trying to get an answer on the game's fate. We've reached out to Intrepid Studios and will update should we get a response.</p><p>Asked by someone on LinkedIn if Ashes of Creation had indeed been cancelled, Krohn replied: "I don't work there anymore, so I can't answer that for you. Personally, I don't know how they would make it when the heart and soul of the product, the amazing dev team, was all laid off."</p>
