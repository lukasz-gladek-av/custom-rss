            <p>
Nintendo's Switch might be nipping at its heels, but PlayStation 2 continues to hold the record as the best-selling console of all time - with Sony now confirming the machine has shifted a whopping 160m units since launching all the way back in March 2000.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard that figure, of course; former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan casually claimed a total of 160m PlayStation 2s had been sold during a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/03/29/official-playstation-podcast-episode-481-heres-to-you-jim/">farewell edition of PlayStation Podcast</a> earlier this year, but Sony has now updated its <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/">PlayStation history page</a> to reflect that number, finally making it <em>officially</em> official.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation 2's last major sales milestone was trumpeted back in 2011, when Sony revealed the console had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-2-ships-over-150-million">surpassed 150m sales</a> - although it only took another year for that number to jump up by a further 5m. So while sales have undoubtedly slowed - not exactly surprising seeing as Sony hasn't produced a PS2 since January 2013 - the fact the console has successfully managed to shift another 5m units in the interim is still pretty wild.

<p>
To put that into some sort of perspective, PlayStation 5 is currently at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">65m lifetime sales</a>, while PS4 has sold 117m units, PS3 is at the 87m mark, and PS1 was snapped up by 102m Vib-Ribbon fans. Nintendo's DS handheld <em>almost</em> came close to matching PS2's previously announced figure, shifting 154m units, but it now trails someway behind. As for Switch (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">currently at 146m sales</a>), it could still reign victorious if <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> doesn't get in its way.
</p><p>
For all this competitive chatter, 160m PS2s sold is still an impressive achievement, and you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-the-insiders-story-article">read more about the console's success elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>. It's not Sony's only cause for celebration, of course, given the entire PlayStation brand is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-playstations-30th-anniversary-london-tube-carriage-looks">marking its 30th anniversary</a> in exactly one week's time. And all this because of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ultra-rare-nintendo-playstation-prototype-sells-at-auction-for-gbp230-000">falling out with Nintendo</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> studio Ubisoft Montreal is reportedly working on a new Animal Crossing-inspired social sim featuring Minecraft-like building elements, with former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> creative director Patrick Redding said to be at the reins.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/">Insider Gaming</a>, which claims the title - currently codenamed Alterra - has been in the works for around 18 months. Alterra is said to have risen from the ashes of an earlier Ubisoft Montreal project, canceled after four years of development, with the two games supposedly sharing a focus on voxel creation.
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming's source describes Alterra as an  "Animal Crossing-inspired social sim" in which players inhabit a home island populated by NPCs known as Matterlings. These Matterlings are "somewhat like Funko Pop figures", sporting large heads and designs blending fictional and real-world creatures, from polar bears to dragons.

<p>
Alterra's social aspect is reportedly combined with that aforementioned voxel creation element, featuring building mechanics "somewhat similar" to those seen in Minecraft, with players able to fashion items using resources found out in the world beyond their home.
</p>
<p>
Here, it's claimed they'll encounter different biomes containing specific resources and different Matterling types, as well as unique enemies, materials, and more - with one example given being an ice biome, inhabited by snow-ice Matterlings, where players can create objects from snow and ice. It'll apparently be possible to encounter other players out in the world too.
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming adds Ubisoft veteran Fabien Lhéraud is serving as lead producer on Alterra, and that the project's launch is "likely still a few years away".
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's release slate is, of course, a bit fuzzy beyond next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anno-117-pax-romana-is-taking-the-economic-city-builder-to-ancient-rome-next-year">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>, although the publisher <em>has</em> confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-new-rayman-project-currently-in-the-exploration-phase-following-reports-of-a-remake">new Rayman project</a> is currently in the "exploration phase". That's alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">very long in the works Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a> and Ubisoft's troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake, with the latter now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">targeting a 2026 release</a>. In more recent news, Ubisoft has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-first-ever-blockchain-game-with-nfts-costing-up-to-50k">launched its first-ever blockchain game</a>, featuring <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a> figurines costing up to £50k.
