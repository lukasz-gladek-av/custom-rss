            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will reportedly sell for around £17/$20/€20.</p>
<p>That's according to eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/">spotted</a> that the highly anticipated sequel was listed on <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">Gamestop</a> (link since deleted) for $20.</p>
<p>Initially, it was thought this <em>had</em> to be a placeholder price, as the game has long been the <a href="https://gaminganalytics.info/gbwish_last">most wishlisted title on the Steam platform</a>. When players tried to purchase the game but couldn't complete checkout, this only strengthened the feeling the listing had to have been incorrect.</p>

<p>However, since then, noted and usually reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n496oj/billbilkun_hollow_knight_silksong_price_is_1999/">Dealabs leaker</a> Billbil-Kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">all but confirmed the rumour</a>, revealing not just the Steam prices for Hollow Knight: Silksong, but also the price point on GOG.</p>
<p>According to the leaker's "recent research", Silksong will indeed retail for less than £20/$20/€20:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK: £16.75 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Europe: €19.50 (Steam) / €8.29 (GOG)</li>
<li>U.S.: $19.99 (Steam) / $19.99 (GOG)</li>
<li>Canada: $25.99 (Steam) / $27.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>Australia: $29.50 (Steam) / $30.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>New Zealand: $28.99 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Japan: (Steam Unknown) / ¥2939 (GOG)</li>
</ul>
<p>The price points for console and Switch versions remain unknown. Dealabs did, however, add weight to rumours that there is no physical version of the game planned at this time.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will release on Thursday, 4th September 2025 for PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. Yet contrary to what you may believe, Silksong hasn't been in development hell for that time, however – in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Team Cherry's developers say they were just having too much fun making it</a>.</p><p>The end of months of speculation has not been good news for all, of course; announcing the date so late in the game's development - a mere two weeks from release - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">meant a slew of games which already had early September release dates suddenly found themselves in a difficult position</a>.</p>

            <p>Just months after revealing there'd be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">no more Stardew Valley updates until Haunted Chocolatier released</a>, creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has confirmed that another update is coming to the fan-favourite farming sim.</p>
<p>Addressing fans at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-symphony-of-seasons-concert-tour-announced-coming-to-the-uk-in-2026">Stardew Valley Symphony of Seasons concert</a> in Seattle, Barone himself took to the stage and revealed a "secret" to the excited attendees.</p>

<p>As posted to TikTok by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jillbobagginz/video/7544281610573630734">jillbobagginz</a> (thanks, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-another-update-is-coming-symphony-of-seasons-concert/">FRVR</a>), Barone said: "After that [last 1.6] update, I was thinking, 'I don't know if I’m going to make another update'. But I wanted to share something with you tonight, it's kind of a secret… there's going to be another update."</p><p>We don't know any details yet, of course, let alone timescales, but it's great news to Stardew fans nonetheless, given Barone revealed in April that Stardew "pulls [him] away from devoting all [his] time to Haunted Chocolatier," the follow-up game he's also currently working on. Quite how this new update will impact the development of Haunted Chocolatier – if at all – remains to be seen, though.</p>
<p>Pixelated farming sim Stardew Valley first debuted almost a decade ago, and has since gone from strength to strength. Last year, Barone released Stardew Valley's bumper 1.6 update, which essentially boosted the game to an almost 2.0 status, introducing a vast number of features to the base game such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">new NPC dialogues, home renovations, and turtle pets</a>.</p>
<p>As of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales and though there's been a handful of crossovers with other games during that time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creator-of-stardew-valley-doesnt-charge-for-collabs-with-other-games-does-it-to-please-players">Barone recently revealed he's never made any money directly from in-game collaborations</a>.</p>
