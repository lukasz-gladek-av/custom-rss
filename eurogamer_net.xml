            <p>In just under a week, PlayStation users will be able to don the iconic fedora and whip of Indiana Jones, with the arrival of the Great Circle on PS5.</p>
<p>Ahead of this, the team has shared a few more details on what players can expect, both in terms of DualSense features and console performance.</p>

<p>On the DualSense side of things, players will notice their lightbar changes depending on what's going on in-game. When Indy enters combat, for example, the light around the touchpad will turn yellow. If NPCs are on the search for Indy, it will pulse yellow, and if his health gets low, it will pulse red.</p>
<p>Performance wise, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> "benefits from frictionless loading", Bethesda said, as well as "selective installation that prioritises your system language (other languages can be installed separately), and SSD optimisation, ensuring a seamless experience with faster streaming and loading".</p>
<p>The game will also come with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhanced label on its release, which will give users higher and more consistent framerates when playing. This Pro also promises image clarity thanks to its native 4K resolution and advanced ray tracing.</p>
<p>"Playing Indiana Jones and the Great Circle at a native 4K resolution really is the best way to appreciate the level of detail the team at MachineGames has poured into every corner of the world," production director John Jennings says. "You could spend hours just walking around the different environments admiring every little thing, from each artifact in Marshall College's impressive collection to the verdant beauty of Sukhothai's jungles."</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date-confirmed">make its PS5 debut on 17th April</a>.

<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm and a real eye for spectacle," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
