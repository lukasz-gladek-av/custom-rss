            <p>Amazon has announced more cast members joining its live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>Renowned actress, beloved Faithful and nervous farter from last year's Celebrity Traitors Celia Imrie has joined already announced Tomb Raider cast members Sophie Turner, Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver and Martin Bobb-Semple.</p>
<p>Other newly announced cast members include Jack Bannon, John Heffernan, Bill Paterson and August Wittgenstein, to name just four.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>So, who is playing who? Well, along with Turner as Lara Croft, the following cast are confirmed in canon roles from the Tomb Raider video games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Martin Bobb-Semple is <strong>Zip</strong>, Lara Croft's long-standing tech support and friend (many suspected this is who Bobb-Semple would be playing) </li>
<li>Jason Isaacs is <strong>Atlas DeMornay</strong>, Lara's uncle</li>
<li>Bill Paterson is <strong>Winston</strong>, the long-standing Croft family butler</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, the following roles are new to the Tomb Raider universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack Bannon is <strong>Gerry</strong>, Lara's personal pilot and snack collector</li>
<li>John Heffernan is <strong>David</strong>, an exhausted government official who finds himself tangled up in Lara's unusual world</li>
<li>Celia Imrie is <strong>Francine</strong>, the Head of Advancement at the British Museum, focused solely on raising funds and glasses of champagne</li>
<li>Paterson Joseph is <strong>Thomas Warner</strong>, a senior government official brought in to clean up an almighty mess</li>
<li>Sasha Luss is <strong>Sasha</strong>, a fierce, deeply competitive new adversary of Lara's</li>
<li>Juliette Motamed is <strong>Georgia</strong>, a devoted, by-the-books curator at the British Museum, dedicated to the "proper" preservation of history</li>
<li>Sigourney Weaver is <strong>Evelyn Wallis</strong>, a mysterious, high-flying woman who is keen to exploit Lara's talents</li>
<li>August Wittgenstein is <strong>Lukas</strong>, an illegal raider who shares history with Lara in more ways than one</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these descriptions, I am going to say Lukas is a love interest in a similar vein to Daniel Craig's Alex West from the first Angelina Jolie-fronted Tomb Raider film.</p>
<p>I am curious to see what Isaacs' Uncle Atlus will be like. The last time I remember hearing his name pop up was in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>: Blood Ties DLC, when he was trying to get Croft Manor from Lara. It didn't sound like he and Lara exactly saw eye to eye. Also, I hope we don't get too bogged down in any Daddy issues, as I am going to assume Lara is once again an orphan in the upcoming series.</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider has always been defined by bold storytelling and unforgettable characters, and these new cast members bring incredible depth and gravitas to the series,"  <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/tomb-raider-prime-video-phoebe-waller-bridge-sophie-turner">said Peter Friedlander</a>, head of Amazon MGM Studios. "With talents like Sigourney Weaver and Jason Isaacs joining the ensemble, we're elevating this world in exciting new ways, and can't wait for our global Prime Video audience to experience this next chapter of Tomb Raider."</p><p>Weaver previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>. Meanwhile, Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p>
<p>Filming for Tomb Raider is expected to kick off later this month, on 19th January.</p>

<p>As well as Amazon's show, the game side of the business is currently collaborating with Crystal Dynamics on an all-new Tomb Raider known as Catalyst. Revealed last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Tomb Raider: Catalyst sends Lara to Northern India</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">takes place some time after series entry Underworld</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-newest-lara-croft-is-frightened-about-losing-the-role-after-being-absolutely-blindsided-by-perfect-dark-cancellation">Alix Wilton Regan will portray Lara in both Catalyst and next year's Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>, which is a remake of the first game.</p>

            <p>Troy Baker, one of the most well known actors working in video games, believes generative AI could have a positive effect overall on performing arts. Baker thinks it'll cause a reaction whereby people will seek out "authentic" experiences more - live shows, live theatre - and turn away from "gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror".</p>
<p>"AI can create content but it cannot create art," <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we">Baker told The Game Business</a> in an interview. "And the reason why is because that invariably requires the human experience.</p>
<p>"There's a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it's that it requires artists. People go, 'look what AI can do.' It's like, 'yeah, okay. I see what it's capable of doing. It doesn't matter.' And we don't need to diminish it, we don't need to denigrate it, we don't need to demonise it. We need to just go, 'okay, it's there'.</p>
<p>"For the last 2,500 years since we first set foot out onto a stage, humans have been doing this. So maybe we trust that. Maybe we trust that this will be part of the process."</p>
<p>The fear comes from looking at AI from a business point of view, he said. From that perspective, yes, AI is threatening. "There is no doubt that AI can make content way better than humans," Baker said. "By far, it can crank it out no problem." But that's where the adverse reaction will come from.</p><p>"What I see happening is that this birth of AI, and this burgeoning industry of it, is actually going to drive people to the authentic. And we're going to see opportunities of, 'I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.' 'I want to see theater'. 'I want to read books'. 'I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror'.</p>
<p>"I think that it's a good thing. It's a revolution."</p>
<p>Troy Baker, whose performances in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> last year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> earned him award nominations, is no stranger to dabbling in controversial new tech. In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-voice-actor-troy-baker-is-now-promoting-nfts">Baker partnered with an NFT company</a> that was making what it claimed were the world's first voice <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> - voices you'd own to create content with. Baker's provocative marketing resulted in a fierce backlash and he backed off a bit, but the idea itself doesn't sound far removed from <a href="https://artlist.io/voice-over?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=21312164614&amp;utm_content=181685845406&amp;utm_term=elevenlabs&amp;keyword=elevenlabs&amp;ad=774546804639&amp;matchtype=e&amp;device=c&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21312164614&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACuwFJ3tEZLqB63gRxh9YtijrhqoX&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_EoMuf-EoB1zrFJuepfrM3VN8tZh-XFA7o1IZyYg_5eyStbfw5zRM8kaAtihEALw_wcB">companies like Elevenlabs that are training gen-AIs on actors' voices</a> now.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Troy Baker will also star in the vintage Disney noir shooter Mouse: PI for Hire, which is due this year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>

<p>So, what of those games? Well, I know our Ian was very taken with Atomfall, and he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-let-me-bash-a-mans-head-in-with-a-cricket-bat-while-he-was-having-a-wee-and-i-think-i-love-it">celebrated being able to bop a chap over the head with a cricket bat as the poor blighter was having a wee against a wall</a>.</p>
<p>"If you can get over a difficult start and fancy a lean take on the survival genre, Atomfall delivers an intriguing tale worth discovering," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-review">Eurogamer's Atomfall review</a>.</p>
<p>Another favourite, at least with me, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a>. "Capcom's follow-up to its first-person Resi reinvention is a fantastic horror romp - for its first half, at least." reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-review-an-entertaining-if-uneven-slice-of-horror">our Resident Evil Village review</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> was a bit hit and miss for many of us here at Eurogamer. I had a decent enough time with it, others not so much. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>.</p>

<p>Along with the requirements, the studio has announced a partnership with Nvidia for 007 First Light, saying the power of GeForce's latest RTX technologies will allow the team to "deliver a PC experience that matches the level of quality we believe the Bond franchise deserves".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/merry-christmas-james-bond-game-007-first-light-has-been-delayed">007 First Light is set to arrive on 27th May</a>. As well as PC, the game will also be available across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox ROG Ally X, Xbox ROG Ally and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At The Game Awards last month, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-unveils-lenny-kravitzs-villainous-side">announced that rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz will star in 007 First Light as black market dealer Bawma</a>.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>
