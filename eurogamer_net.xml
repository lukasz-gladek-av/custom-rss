            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has a distinctive French style from its Montpellier-based developer Sandfall Interactive, but originally it was very different.</p>
<p>Fans have uncovered a trailer from an early version of the game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RecordThisForFree/comments/g5a6e8/game_ambitious_aa_game_project_looking_for_3/">posted on reddit</a> by director Guillaume Broche in a bid to find voice actors. The post, from five years ago, describes the project as an "ambitious AA game" and "3D modern take on the JRPG genre with western style characters". It had a planned release on PC and "possibly" PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The post includes a link to a draft trailer that's since been shared elsewhere. The game was originally called We Lost, and shows a steampunk town, fantastical boss battles, and even a sci-fi section.</p>

<p>It's likely much of the trailer is using placeholder assets, but it at least gives a glimpse into the development process. What's more, turn-based battles seem to have always been part of the project, as do the names of characters Lune and Maelle.</p>
<p>Further, lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen has detailed how the game's setting was completely different in its early phases.</p>
<p>"The gameplay would have been similar," she told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-writer-reveals-game-almost-had-zombies/">The Gamer</a>, "but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things."</p>
<p>A call with potential investors inspired Broche to "think bigger", Svedberg-Yen added, which prompted a complete re-think of the narrative. It was ultimately inspired by a painting Broche admired and a short story Svedberg-Yen was working on, which revolved around an artist entering her own canvases.</p>

</span></p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 certainly succeeds in part due to its French authenticity - from its fashion sense, to its jokey references to baguettes and mimes. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">French President Macron has taken note</a>, calling the game a "shining example of French audacity".</p>
<p>"Outside the core plot, there's a wonderful silliness - and self-deprecation - to Clair Obscur that, together with its outstanding art direction and unique battle mechanics, ensure the game is distinct," I wrote in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed into next year.</p>
<p>This is the new Captain America and Black Panther game penned by Uncharted writer Amy Hennig, developed by Skydance Games.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media, the studio stated the game will now launch in early 2026 to polish the game further.</p>

<p>"Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision," Skydance Games wrote.</p>
<p>"We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon."</p>
<p>The game was originally set for this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-window-narrowed-down-by-black-panther-himself">Black Panther actor Khary Payton suggesting the studio was aiming for a Christmas release</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">story trailer for Marvel 1943</a> from March 2024 gave us a look at the game in action, as shown at the State of Unreal livestream. "Working with the MetaHuman process, we have been able to honour our amazing actors' performances and faithfully transform them into equally powerful digital performances," Hennig said at the time of the new technology.</p>
<p>Then fresh details emerged at the end of last year, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-details-and-first-look-at-wakanda-revealed-by-writer-amy-hennig">look at this game's version of Wakanda</a>.</p>
<p>"[The setting] led us to do a bunch of interesting things," said Hennig, "one of which was to not only tell a story with a young Steve Rogers who's still trying to find his feet, as opposed to the more seasoned guy that we've seen in a lot of the films. It also let us introduce a new Black Panther of 1943."</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra follows in the foosteps of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, which was recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">delayed from this year into next</a>. So far, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">Sony's Ghost of Yōtei</a> appears to be the biggest release at the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
