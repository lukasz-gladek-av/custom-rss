  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over 200 employees from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> have signed a letter to management, in which they have condemned the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">firing of their fellow staff members in a move seen by many as 'union busting'</a>.</p>
<p>In this letter, Rockstar North's employees demand their colleagues - all of whom were Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) Union members - be reinstated. This letter follows protests held in London and Edinburgh earlier this month, which were held in solidarity with the fired employees. Further protests are planned to take place in London, Edinburgh and Paris later this month.</p>
<p>The employees had been in the process of forming a union within the company. This union was known as The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> Workers Union, and aimed to push for better working conditions ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>.</p>
<p>PRIM</p>
<p>"It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account - during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss's door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said one fired employee, who withheld their name to protect anonymity.</p>
<p>"It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p>
<p>Rockstar itself has claimed the recent firings were due to misconduct, including leaking information in public channels. However, the IWGB has refuted this, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">yesterday announced it had issued a legal claim against the Grand Theft Auto developer</a>.</p>
<p>In a further statement today, IWGB organiser Fred Carter said: "By deciding to fire more than 30 union members, Rockstar have carried out an Amazon-style act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry. This is a company that benefits from more than £440m in UK tax relief, while displaying a callous and blatant disregard for both the livelihood of workers and the letter of the law."</p><p>Rockstar recently made further headlines after it made the decision to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop"> delay the release of GTA 6 from May of next year into November</a>. At this time, publisher Take-Two, the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve". It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

            <p>Dispatch writer Pierre Shorette regrets cutting sex scenes from AdHoc's episodic superhero workplace comedy.</p>
<p>The first series of Dispatch wrapped last night, with the release of episodes seven and eight. While much of our time in the game was spent - as you would surmise given its name - dispatching a ragtag team of antiheroes to calls about everything from stuck cats to bomb threats, over the last few weeks we have also watched the characters and their relationships grow thanks to a range of narrative based choices and cinematics.</p>
<p>However, there were some more romantic scenes cut from the final release, which Shorette says on reflection the team "shouldn't have". <strong>Please be aware of some Dispatch spoilers below. </strong></p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">Inverse</a>, Shorette acknowledged that many Dispatch fans were especially invested in the game's relationship and romance options, and despite there only being two to pursue, they became a "meaningful" part of the experience.</p>
<p>In Dispatch, players can choose to date either Blonde Blazer or Invisgal (who has a rather steamy dream about your character, Robert), though neither of these story lines is the main focus of the game. However, the team wasn't expecting the reception to Dispatch to be as "ravenous" as it has been, and that's "probably why we didn't plan for more romance options".</p><p>Shorette continued: "One of my secret shames is I think I default to romantic comedy in my writing and my whole life. I'm trying to pull out of that and make things more serious. Even in Wolf <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> or Tales From the Borderlands, there's some romance."</p>

<p>The writer said he doesn't "know that Dispatch is any one thing", adding that seeing streams of the game has allowed him to see what has worked. "So if we can have people freak out at seeing a wiener on screen, laugh at a fart joke, and then somehow cry at the end of all that. I'm happy it's working, but I also don't think we made a 'gooner game,' and people know that now if they've played up to Episode six," Shorette said. "It's interesting to see the community switch up real fast, and lock in."</p>
<p>And, well, we now all know that the romance parts of Dispatch definitely worked. But, alas, some of those moments didn't make the final release. "We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn't have," Shorette laughed, teasing we may yet "get to see those one day".</p>

<p>"There isn't anyone on the development team that wouldn't have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way," the writer closed. </p><p>"We're still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it's doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often with these games is branching too."</p>

<p>Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">the studio is now considering a second season</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie has also been playing Dispatch, and this has left him quite excited about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/critical-role-working-on-its-first-video-game-which-will-be-set-in-exandria">AdHoc's involvement with the upcoming Critical Role game</a>. "That Dispatch made me think over and over that 'this feels like a Critical Role animated show' is some of the highest praise I can heap upon it. That's not because Critical Role is the be-all and end-all of everything creative - it is brilliant, and it is endearingly wholesome - but it's because hitting those presentation heights is hard to do," he wrote in Eurogamer's feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-is-brilliant-which-is-great-news-for-critical-role-fans">Dispatch is brilliant, which is great news for Critical Role fans</a>.</p>
<p>"I didn't think a Telltale-like game was capable of it. But Dispatch has proved me wrong."</p>

            <p>Brendan Greene, the game designer better known by the alias PlayerUnknown, who helped create the battle royale genre - first in an Arma mod, then in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/h1z1">H1Z1</a>, then in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> (PUBG) - is planning a new and large-scale multiplayer shooter. The current plan is for the game to support 100 versus 100-player battles.</p>
<p>The shooter is to be the second game in Greene's three-game masterplan, which is underway at his newish studio PlayerUnknown Productions, he told me in a video call. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-creator-brendan-playerunknown-greene-is-about-to-release-his-next-game-and-its-not-what-youre-expecting-at-all">The first game in his plan, Prologue: Go Wayback, a wilderness survival and orienteering game</a>, is already close to release - it arrives in early access later this month, on 20th November.</p>

<p>But to understand the idea for the shooter you have to loosely understand the overarching idea for the three games Greene wants to make. They are significantly different experiences designed to test different parts of an ambitious and potentially industry-shaking new piece of game-making technology. I'm talking about world-generation on a planetary scale. I'm not exaggerating when I say Greene's goals are as ambitious as remaking the internet - but more about that in a separate article.</p><p>Game One, Prologue: Go Wayback, was initially created as a way to implement and test terrain-level planetary generation. Every time you play, the game generates a new 8x8km forested game world for you to survive and explore in. Game Two, meanwhile, will be about testing different systems like shooting and multiplayer.</p>
<p>"Game Two aims to test limited multiplayer, maybe up to 100 versus 100 players," Greene told me. "It's more of an FPS/RTS mix. This is in my head what it is. And the aim is to test terrains at a bigger scale. Therefore we can test FPS mechanics, we can test interaction between NPCs, we can try testing these networking protocols at scale. So Game Two is that.</p>
<p>"And then Game Three," he added, "is where we really go to big-scale multiplayer. And then we can take all the stuff we've learned from the previous two games of generating terrain, enabling players to create their own planets, and having a network that works for whatever you want to use it for, be that an FPS game or whatever you want to create in these worlds."</p>
<p>Big plans, and again, I'll discuss the overarching idea more in a separate article. But how much of Game Two has actually been made or committed to paper? How much of it exists outside Brendan Greene's head? Because remember, Prologue: Go Wayback isn't even available in early access yet, and there's still a year's worth of promised open development to do there, I'm told.</p>

<p>What exists of Game Two? "So far, general high-level plans," Greene said. "I have an idea in my head for the game and we're talking about what it would require from a team - what kind of timeline we expect to do that in. Because this would be using our own engine and not Unreal [as Prologue uses], so it requires Melba [the studio's proprietary engine] to be in a state that artists and designers can work with."</p>
<p>Incidentally, there's a playable demonstration of this world-generating engine, Melba, available on Steam. Look for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/">Preface: Undiscovered World</a> there.</p>
<p>"But because it's going to be an FPS-type game," Greene continued, "that requires it to be in a very different state to how we released Go Wayback!, for example, which was very much in the early stages. So it requires time."</p><p>How much time? "We have a general idea of how long it will take to get to Game Two," he said, "and then with Game Two we expect another two, three, four years, maybe longer. We have a 10-year plan, more or less, of getting to Game Three."</p>
<p>You can already play Prologue: Go Wayback ahead of its early access release, incidentally, in an open - and free - beta playtest. That's where I've had a ramble around, and I found it a very powerful experience. The forested world is detailed and immersive, and the weather systems are terrifying. Rushing from cabin to cabin as a blizzard breaks and your temperature drops is a tense and thrilling thing. Even inside, you might not be safe, as wind rattles and breaks the windows, and dislodges wooden-planked walls. You'd better make sure there's a fire in the hearth and you've a full belly and you've salvaged all the warm clothes you can find.</p>
