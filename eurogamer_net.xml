            <p>Call of Duty's original Verdansk map is set to return on 3rd April.</p>
<p>Activision shared the news on social media, adding "it's time to revisit a place of unforgettable memories".</p>
<p>The map return will coincide with Season 3 of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone, as a celebration of Warzone's fifth anniversary.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzones-classic-verdansk-map-returning-next-year">return of Verdansk was revealed last year</a> - it's the original map for the battle royale that's no longer available.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month">Activision announced a delay to Season 3 last week</a>, which was widely expected to include the Verdansk map. Now it's officially confirmed.</p>

<p>Verdansk's return follows a similar move from Epic with the return of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s classic OG map, which resulted in its highest-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours. It's now a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">permanent addition to Fortnite</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-is-doing-a-fortnite-and-bringing-back-its-original-island-map">PUBG also brought back its original map</a>, Erangel.</p>
<p>It's hoped this new season can turn around the fortunes of Call of Duty so far this year.</p>
<p>Ahead of the second season's launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bans-another-136000-cheaters">Activision stated it was dealing with rampant cheating</a>, acknowledging cheaters "are frustrating and severely impact the experience for our community".</p>
<p>Before that, the company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">accused of using "AI slop"</a> following artwork of a six-fingered zombie Santa. Then in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision admitted to using AI</a> in an update to the Call of Duty Steam page.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A concept album for the now-cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a> from the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> has been released by composer Lena Raine.</p>
<p>Back in January, Extremely OK Games cancelled its "2D explor-action" game, which would have followed up the widely celebrated platformer Celeste.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">first look at Earthblade</a> was shown in December 2022 at The Game Awards, but nothing has been shown since. As such, this new album from Raine provides a taste of what we could have expected.</p>

<p>Raine worked on the soundtracks of Minecraft, Celeste and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and Chicory: A Colorful Tale.</p>
<p>Earthblade - Across the Bounds of Fate is available to listen to on <a href="https://radicaldreamland.bandcamp.com/album/earthblade-across-the-bounds-of-fate">Bandcamp</a> and can be purchased in full for $7.</p>
<p>It's typical of Raine's style, particularly with the focus on striking melody and a mixture of electronic and real instruments. The beautiful track Verdant Mysteries includes a strange vocal too, while the eight-minute long Lineage is a mesmeric piano piece and the opening Accept Your Fate begins with Vangelis-esque chords before a mournful tone takes over.</p>
<p>"[Earthblade] was in development for a number of years, and over that period of time I wrote quite a few pieces - both conceptual, and implemented tracks - that began to depict the world of the game," wrote Raine in the album's description. "Because we'll never get a chance to tell that story in game form, I decided to cobble together every bit of music I'd written for the game to the point of its cancellation in order to tell my own version of it.</p>
<p>"Across the Bounds of Fate, more so than a soundtrack, is a concept album. The music I wrote for the game is highly dynamic, in the tradition of what I wrote for Celeste. I took it many steps beyond, in ways that temporally-constrained pieces of music can't really do justice. But I did my best to arrange them into the emotional arc of their progression, much like I would for any soundtrack release."</p>
<p>Raine's inspiration includes the aforementioned Vangelis (best known for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>), as well as Joe Hisaishi's score for Studio Ghibli's NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind, and Yoko Kanno's work on animes Cowboy Bebop and Ghost in the Shell.</p>
<p>Said Raine: "For now, tuck in and enjoy around 30 minutes of music that paint the picture of what I hoped Earthblade might be."</p>
<p>Extremely OK Games studio director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-studio-cancels-2d-explor-action-game-earthblade-nearly-four-years-after-its-announcement">Maddy Thorson called the cancellation of Earthblade</a> a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".</p>
<p>One factor leading to the cancellation was a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste between Thorson and Noel Berry on one side, and studio founding member Pedro Medeiros on the other.</p>
<p>However, Thorson stressed "Pedro isn't to blame", adding: "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."</p>
<p>Thorson and Berry are now prototyping again for a new project. In the meantime, we have Raine's score as a lasting reminder of what Earthblade could have been.</p>
<p>"Melody encompasses so much of how I relate to music that it's hard for me to just write a piece that sinks solely into texture and rhythm. I do it, obviously, but I'm always humming something on top," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-composer-lena-raine-on-her-musical-style-im-a-big-fan-of-musical-metaphor">Raine told Eurogamer in a discussion about her compositional style</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
