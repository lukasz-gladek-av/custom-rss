            <p>Nintendo's average annual salary may have dropped by 2.3 percent in 2024, but it's still the second-highest-paying company in western Japan.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-average-annual-salary-decreased-in-2024-but-ranked-second-highest-in-japanese-regional-ranking/">Automaton</a>, the business journal <a href="https://diamond.jp/articles/-/357677">Diamond Online</a> detailed salary information for firms based in Japan's Kansai region (sans Osaka), revealing Nintendo employees take home an average salary of ¥9.627m - that's around $61,500 or £50,800.</p>

<p>Nintendo took second place after semiconductor manufacturer Screen Holdings, which had an average salary of ¥10.248m ($65.5K / £53.7K).</p>
<p>Diamond Online hypothesises that Nintendo's average earnings have fallen due to the drop in net sales and operating profit - down 5.5 and 14.9 per cent, respectively - in 2023.</p>
<p>By the end of the 2024 fiscal year in March 2024, however, sales were up 4.4 percent, and operating profit had bounced back by 4.9 per cent, intimating the average salary will possibly increase for Nintendo employees by the end of this financial year.</p>
<p>Nintendo is the only video game company to have been included in the list.</p>
<p>In case you've been hiding under a rock for the last few days, Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting"><em>finally</em> revealed Switch 2 last week</a> after months of rumours, leaks and oodles of speculation.</p>

            <p>An unannounced Warhammer RPG was seemingly on the cards, however the project was cancelled towards the end of last year.</p>
<p>A report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/unannounced-warhammer-rpg-cancelled-games-workshop">MP1st</a> details posts by former employees of a developer known as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/thought-pennies/">Thought Pennies</a> - a "role-playing game studio creating games focused on social storytelling" - who had an unannounced Warhammer game listed on their LinkedIn profiles.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">many other companies over the years</a>, Thought Pennies has been affected by layoffs recently. Two months ago, Thought Pennies' CCO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-aidan-erickson_over-the-last-three-years-at-thought-pennies-activity-7264324075357941760-nQCJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Daniel Erickson posted</a>:</p>
<p>"Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals. Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding."</p><p>This change meant Thought Pennies was required to "shrink the size of the studio". While Erickson did not specify what the developer was working on prior to his post, others who previously worked with the company listed an "unannounced Warhammer" project being made in Unreal Engine 5 on their own pages, with one stating a "fantasy live service RPG" had been cancelled.</p>
<p>One post seen by MP1st described the game as a third person "Co-Op PvE Action RPG with a cast of unique heroes and playstyles", whcih would feature melee and ranged combat, as well as 'monstrous enemies set in a dark fantasy world'.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Thought Pennies for further information on its recent projects, and the reported cancellation of a Warhammer RPG game.</p>

<p>This week's report follows word earlier in the month that Games Workshop is looking to expand on the Warhammer series further, and is on the hunt for "the next one" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's success last year</a>.</p>
<p>"We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-company-looking-for-the-next-one-after-big-success-of-space-marine-2/1100-6528795/#:~:text=2024%27s%20Warhammer%3A%20Space%20Marine%202%20was%20a%20big,something%20the%20company%20says%20is%20%22not%20a%20given.%22">Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree said last week</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, in December, Games Workshop and Amazon Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-officially-coming-to-film-and-tv-screens-with-amazon-studios">officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Katsuhiro Harada, the boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>, has moved to reassure fans of the series who spotted him post on LinkedIn that he was now open to new job oppurtunities. 
</p>
<p>
Harada's LinkedIn page still lists him as executive game director, chief producer and general manager at Bandai Namco, where he has served for 30 years and become the face of the Tekken franchise.
</p>
<p>
But Harada has also set his profile to "open to work" status and in a short <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7286913589884465152/">post</a> wrote: "I would like to broaden my horizons by connecting with more people as I look toward the future. I'm interested in roles such as executive producer, executive game director, vice president, business development, business development executive, and marketing."

<p>
"Oh, don't worry about this," Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1881164805060567212">wrote</a> on X in response to fans questioning whether he was leaving Bandai Namco and the Tekken series behind. "I meet a lot of people on a regular basis (but I don't actually have that many friends in my private world LOL), I just want to meet more people and expand my horizons in the future. 
</p>
<p>
"I can talk to a lot of people when I turn this option on," he concluded. "Just that."
</p>
<p>
It's now been 12 months since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> launched for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January 2024. The game has since been kept updated with new characters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-clive-coming-to-tekken-8-as-first-seasons-final-dlc-character">including Final Fantasy 16's Clive</a>, with a second season pass announced for 2025.
</p>
<p>
"A marked improvement over <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> and a perfectly executed balancing act," Lewis Parker wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Eurogamer's Tekken 8 review</a>, "keeping older players happy while revealing its trademark freedom to newcomers".
</p>
<p>Late last year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-asked-kfc-to-let-colonel-sanders-join-the-games-roster">Harada had once asked KFC to let Colonel Sanders join the Tekken series' roster</a> - a suggestion that was turned down with a disapproving look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Team Cherry's Matthew 'Leth' Griffin, in charge of PR and marketing, has stated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is "real, progressing and will release".</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have been circulating about the game, sparked by co-creator William Pellen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">switching his social media profile picture to a cake</a>, which led to fans speculating about an ARG to lead towards a release date.</p>
<p>Sadly, this has now been debunked as a "nothingburger".</p>

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/the-hollow-knight-silksong-arg-turned-out-to-be-us-clutching-at-straws-but-dev-says-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release/">GamesRadar</a> reported, YouTuber <a href="https://x.com/fireb0rn/status/1880411907552911626">fireb0rn posted</a>: "Leth reached out to me to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie."</p>
<p>Griffin himself then followed up to confirm the game is still in development.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yes the game is real, progressing and will release. &lt;3</p>— Matthew Griffin (@griffinmatta) <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>So what was that supposed ARG? Last week, Pellen changed his social media handle and switched his profile picture to a slice of chocolate cake. Eager <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans reverse image searched the picture to discover it was from a recipe page posted on 2nd April 2024 - a year ahead of the newly announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>Coupled with Pellen's post ahead of last week's Switch 2 reveal - "something big is coming" - and fans were riled up with anticipation. It seems that was all for nothing, despite the game still being on the way.</p>
<p>Silksong is the hugely anticipated follow up to popular Metroidvania Hollow Knight. It was first announced in 2019 - and Eurogamer went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">hands-on with a Silksong demo</a> - but after multiple delays the game is still yet to be released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
