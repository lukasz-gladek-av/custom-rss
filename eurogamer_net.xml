            <p>Two former lead developers from Perfect Dark's The Initiative have joined 2K to launch a new studio under Rockstar owner Take-Two.</p>
<p>Darrell Gallagher, who previously served as The Initiative's studio head and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">working on the Perfect Dark reboot before it was cancelled by Microsoft</a>, announced the news last night.</p>

<p>"I'm excited to share that I will be joining 2K as SVP, Studio Head, where I'll be building a new studio and leading an ambitious opportunity unlike anything I've taken on before," Gallagher <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403902973464014848/?originTrackingId=x%2FyCRM50FXYKNFel5poliA%3D%3D">wrote on LinkedIn</a>. "I've spent my career believing in what's possible when great people come together with a bold vision. I can't wait to get started with the exceptional team at 2K!"</p>
<p>Gallagher also previously worked at Crystal Dynamics on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>, to name just one.</p>
<p>Joining Gallagher at 2K's new studio is Brian Horton, who was the creative director in charge of Perfect Dark's creative vision and execution at The Initiative. Horton's other work includes as creative director on Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man.</p>
<p>"Happy to announce I joined 2K as VP, head of creative at a new studio with Darrell Gallagher," Horton <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7403908881246318592/?originTrackingId=FDZjmkOp3OMe7yfwvoD13Q%3D%3D">wrote on LinkedIn</a> last night.</p>
<p>Neither developer revealed exactly what they will be working on at 2K, though many are hoping to see a revival of the Perfect Dark reboot. Back in September, it was reported the reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two.</p>

<p>Allegedly, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-almost-saved-by-rockstar-owner-take-two">plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">Perfect Dark reboot was initially announced back in 2020</a>, with The Initiative set to lead development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was then brought in to support</a> in 2021.</p>
