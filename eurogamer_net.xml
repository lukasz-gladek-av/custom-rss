            <p>
Activision has said it is conducting "hourly sweeps" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s Ranked Play mode and leaderboards, as work to try and combat the game's cheating problem continues. 
</p>
<p>
More than 19k bans have been slapped down by Activision's anti-cheat squad Team Ricochet since Ranked Play went live in Black Ops 6 last week, the publisher revealed in a social media <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1861241515798098184">post</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, in the background, Ricochet's AI systems "continue to ramp up with code optimisations to accelerate enforcements," the company wrote. "Thanks for your patience as our team continues to fight against cheaters."
</p>
<p>
Black Ops 6's ultra-competitive Ranked Play mode launched on 21st November to a mixed response, with criticism of how prevalent cheating seemed. 
</p>
<p>
"19k banned, 25k new accounts created," was the response of one fan to Activision's post. "Year four of hearing this," said another.
</p>
<p>
Activision said earlier this month it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-patch-notes-detail-changes-to-combat-disruptive-behaviour">tuned up Ricochet's detection systems ahead of Ranked Play's launch</a>, though those changes had been more focused around the "disruptive behaviour" of players going AFK to boost account levels, or using alternate accounts via VPNs.
</p><p>Activision last week boasted that Black Ops 6 had been the biggest launch for a Call of Duty ever, with the best total players, hours played and numer of matches played in the game's first 30 days. Adding it to Xbox Game Pass seems to have helped, then.</p>
<p>
"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review.</a>

            <p>
A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite">Sniper Elite</a> battle royale spin-off has reportedly been cancelled, after Chinese gaming giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> pulled funding.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sniper-elites-battle-royale-game-has-been-canceled-as-tencent-pulls-funding/">Insider Gaming</a>, which states that Project Archipelago: Sniper Battle Royale was recently scrapped following public playtests over the summer. 
</p>
<p>
That report claims Tencent got cold feet on the project after seeing the high-profile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">flop of PlayStation's recent live-service bid Concord</a>.

<p>
Sniper Elite developer Rebellion declined to comment on the report. Eurogamer has contacted it and Tencent for more.
</p>
<p>
British developer Rebellion announced "pre-alpha access" to Project Archipelago via a three-day playtest back in mid-August this year, though has been quiet on the game since. 
</p>
<p>
A trailer for the project showed squads of snipers picking off enemies from afar, in rusted, near-future environments that featured a mix of weathered contemporary buildings but also sci-fi-looking airships.
</p>
<p>
It's understood that there have been no job losses as a result of the cancellation, with developers moved over to the next main Sniper Elite game, Sniper Elite: Resistance, which is due to launch on 28th January 2025.
</p>
<p>"Currently, we are still in the process of learning," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">Sony boss Hiroki Totoki said this month of Concord's launch and sudden removal from sale</a>. "And basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As the above trailer reveals, on PC Star Wars: Hunters will have visually enhanced battlefields, featuring higher resolution textures and shadows, and higher rendering quality.</p>
<p>Keyboard, mouse, and wireless controller support will all be included.</p>
<p>"The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC," said Zynga's executive vice president of games Yaron Leyvan. "This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time."</p>
<p>Zynga is best known for its mobile and Facebook games, notably Farmville, CSR Racing, and Words with Friends.</p>
<p>The company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-publisher-take-two-completes-127bn-takeover-of-farmville-developer-zynga">taken over by GTA publisher Take-Two</a> back in 2022 for $12.7bn.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zyngas-star-wars-hunters-finally-arrives-in-june-after-years-of-delays">Star Wars: Hunters was released on Switch, iOS and Android</a> on 4th June following multiple delays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
