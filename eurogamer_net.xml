            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is getting a physical PS5 release next month: 12th December, to be precise.</p>
<p>The release marks the first time the fan-favourite action-RPG will be available on a physical PS5 disc, as the collector's edition merely included a download code.</p>

<p>"Mark your calendars! Black Myth: Wukong arrives in physical form on 12th December, 2024!" PM Studios posted to X/Twitter.</p>
<p>Asked if that date also applied to UK purchases, PM Studios simply replied: "Yep!", then <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854923502605783056">confirmed</a> the same release date for players in Europe.</p> <div>

<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if the physical edition will ship with any accompanying goodies, such as an instruction manual, but it has been confirmed that it includes the "deluxe edition upgrade" as well as the base game.</p>
<p>The deluxe edition includes the Bronzecloud Staff weapon, Wind Chimes curio, and the Folk Opera armour set. You'll also get a "selected" digital soundtrack.</p>
<p>Microsoft has again confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delay to the Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">not due to "platform limitations"</a>.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong was released in August on PC and PS5, but the Xbox version was delayed for an unknown reason. Speculation grew the developer was struggling to run the game on the Series S console, while other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">rumours suggested the game was, in fact, a PlayStation console exclusive</a>.</p>
<p>A representative from Microsoft has now confirmed the game is still on the way, though it won't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">Black Myth: Wukong had already sold 10m copies</a> after just three days on sale, even without an Xbox version.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is the third year the category has run at the Grammy awards. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/and-the-first-grammy-for-video-game-music-goes-to">secured the inaugural award in 2023</a>, whilst Star Wars Jedi: Survivor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-takes-home-best-gaming-score-at-grammy-awards">won last year</a>.</p>
<p>The 2025 Grammy Awards will be broadcast on 2nd February, 2025.</p>
<p>Of course, music isn't the only area when games are making an impact in major award shows. Earlier this year, Genvid's experimental choose-the-outcome, episodic Silent Hill series, Ascension, won the Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Innovation in Emerging Media Programming for Silent Hill: Ascension. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-wins-major-award">Genid boss Jacob Navok was a "testament to the dedication" of the team</a>.</p>
<p>Amazon's Fallout adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-is-now-an-emmy-winning-series">also now has two Emmy awards to its name</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
