            <p>
If you were thinking of slapping one of your old PlayStation 5 faceplates on your shiny new PS5 Pro when it launches on 7th November, Sony has some bad news for you; the company has now confirmed there's no compatibility between the two.
</p>
<p>
Word of a faceplate mismatch - not exactly unexpected given the PS5 Pro's slightly thinner form factor compared to the original PS5 - first surfaced earlier today when a Reddit user (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-plates-wont-work-on-ps5-pro-sony-says-updated-covers-will-be-available-in-the-future">IGN</a>) shared the news after having "an opportunity to try the plates on" the new machine.
</p>
<p>
"I had some Cobalt blue plates so I decided to try them out on the Pro," user Zrorro <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1gfr6ot/playstation_5_pro_does_not_work_with_the_slim/">wrote</a>, "and I can confirm the bottom plates match the Slim. However the top plates do not match because while they're physically the same size, the teeth that connect to the system are and slightly different places. So you can't connect the top part."

<p>
"I'm only telling you all this," they added, "so y'all know and don't bother ordering plates for the Slim to use on the Pro."
</p>
<p>
And now, Sony has confirmed the news, telling IGN, "PS5 console covers are not compatible with PS5 Pro." The company did note, however, that "players will be able to swap out different console covers for PS5 Pro when they become available in the future". So there you go; goodbye old, beloved faceplates, hello fresh selection of £45+ PS5 Pro-specific ones.
</p><p>
PlayStation 5 Pro will, of course, cost £699.99 when it launches on 7th November (so a reluctance to spend more on brand-new faceplates would be understandable), and if you're wondering whether it's worth it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it">Digital Foundry recently had a chance to go hands-on</a>.

            <p>
As if your games-to-movie adaptation plate wasn't already teetering dangerously with everything piled on it so far, Lionsgate has announced it's working on a film version of developer Red Barrels' survival horror series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast">Outlast</a>.
</p>
<p>
The original Outlast launched back in 2013, casting players as journalist Miles Upshur as he investigated the notorious Mount Massive Asylum. Its effectively terrifying (and often quite grim) blend of first-person night-vision exploration and frantic chase thrills quickly attracted fans, leading to a story expansion the following year and a full-blown sequel in 2017.
</p>
<p>
This second outing - which saw players investigating a murder in the Arizona desert - ramped up the violence and strenuous pursuit sequences to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outlast-2-review">slightly less positive reception</a>, but it still did well enough that Red Barrels was able to launch a third game, co-operative multplayer survival horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a>, into early access last year.

<p>
And now the series is heading to the big screen courtesy of Saw studio Lionsgate, with horror film producer Roy Lee (Strange Darling, Late Night with the Devil, Barbarian) leading the charge. The project has also drafted in J. T. Perry, who's served as writer for all Red Barrel's Outlast games, to work on the movie's script.
</p><p>
"When Outlast launched in 2012, it changed the landscape of horror gaming," Lee wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement, "setting a new standard for immersion in the genre. Its deep, emergent lore has provided a perfect foundation for creating a film that delves into the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and the series' dedicated fans."
</p>
<p>
Details on the project are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/outlast-movie-lionsgate-1236162233/#:~:text=Watch%20on%20Deadline,genre%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Roy%20Lee.">Deadline's sources describe the movie</a> as a "modestly produced feature in the spirit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> and Lionsgate's own The Strangers: Chapter 1 and Saw movies."
</p>
<p>
Red Barrel's most recent release, The Outlast Trials, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">earned itself three out of five stars</a> when Vikki Blake reviewed it for Eurogamer earlier this year. "While I screamed a lot," Vikki wrote, "The Outlast Trials isn't scary – at least, not in the way its predecessors were. Whereas it apes some aspects of its original premise courtesy of those oh-shit-he-saw-me cat-and-mouse chase sequences, the cloying atmosphere has gone."
