            <p>Sony has revealed the new games coming to its PlayStation Plus subscription this June and discounts on PS5 consoles, all part of this year's annual Days of Play promotion.</p>
<p>In addition to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> receiving its first discount, the company has revealed both the free monthly games available for all tiers, as well as the catalogue additions available for Extra and Premium subscribers.</p>
<p>The PS Plus monthly games for June are:</p>
<ul>
<li>NBA 2K25 | PS5, PS4 (available 3rd June)</li>
<li>Alone in the Dark (2024) | PS5 (available 3rd June)</li>
<li>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk | PS5, PS4 (available 3rd June)</li>
<li>Destiny 2: The Final Shape | PS5, PS4 (available 28th May)</li>
</ul>
<p>New games coming to the catalogue this month are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Another Crab’s Treasure | PS5 (available 29th May)</li>
<li>Skull and Bones | PS5 (available 2nd June)</li>
<li>Destiny 2: Legacy Collection | PS5, PS4 (available 4th June)</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto III | PS4, PS5 (available 10th June)</li>
</ul>
<p>The classics catalogue will also receive two games from 5th June: Myst and Riven, both on PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Lastly, two new game trials will be added from 28th May: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> (on PS5) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 (on PS4 and PS5).</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bomb-rush-cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> is a highlight in the monthly games, as a spiritual successor to Dreamcast classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>. We described it as a "gloriously haunted video game" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-review">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk review</a>.</p>
<p>Another Crab's Treasure is also a treat for anyone looking for a Dark Souls alternative, set under the sea with a litter-grabbing crab.</p>
<p>Sony has also announced discounts as part of its Days of Play 2025 celebration. New or upgraded PS Plus membership will have 33 percent off, so now's the time to renew your subscription.</p>
<p>Further, if you're yet to buy a PS5 console itself, both the digital and standard consoles will be on promotion on the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/">PlayStation Direct store</a> in Europe, starting at £339.99 / €399.99. That's a £90 reduction. Some accessories and games are also discounted.</p>
<p>Additionally, the PS5 Pro will be discounted by £45. That's the first time Sony's revised console has been discounted since its release last year.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/27/celebrate-days-of-play-2025-starting-on-may-28/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-games-leaving-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-in-june">six games are leaving PS Plus in June</a>: Monster Hunter Rise, Rogue Legacy 2, Inscription, After Us, Kayak VR: Mirage, and Avicii Invector.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
