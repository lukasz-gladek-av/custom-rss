If you're <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a> fan then the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMejSEspaog">latest Humble Games Showcase</a> might just be for you, with its tease of a brand-new airborne on-rails shooter from series veteran Miles Goddard. But there's more where that came from, including weather-controlling corgis and the re-emergence of long-gestating heist sequel Monaco 2. Intrigued? Then read on for the full rundown.

And here we are: the new game from Miles Goddard and Japanse studio Chuhai Labs. Wild Blue might not be Star Fox exactly - its set closer to earth rather than the depths of space - but the inspiration is clear. It sees a plucky band of animal pilots - Bowie Stray and the Blue Bombers - soaring through the skies on a mission to save the world from the evil Baron. That means on-rails adventuring and daring dog fights over oceans, deserts, and more. There's talk of boss fights, branching paths, and a mysterious rival squad - and if that appeals, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921490/Wild_Blue/">wishlist Wild Blue on Steam</a>.

We're hardly wanting for farm-based village life sims these days, but Towns of Zoz from Studio Pixanoh does look to have a few tracks up its sleeve. For starters, it's got a cookery focus as players take on the role of Ito, returning to his parents' farm to run the family restaurant. There's a magical calamity afoot, and players will ned to combine their combat skills and cooking creativity to save the town and its locals. Throw in local co-op and an attractive art style, and this one shows promise. Towns of Zoz doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748110/Town_of_Zoz/">confirmed for PC</a>.

You'd be entirely forgiven if you'd managed to forget about Monaco 2. This sequel to developer Pocketwatch Games' acclaimed 2013 heist caper was first announced almost exactly three years ago - although the studio has been regular providing updates on its progress, and even a demo, since then. The big change this time is the shift to 3D, with Monaco 2's procedurally generated isometric levels enabling a greater focus on verticality as players make their stealthy plans. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC in "April" and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3366190/Monaco_2_Demo/">demo's available on Steam</a>.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/surgeon-simulator">Surgeon Simulator</a> developer Bossa Studios' Lost Skies is an open-world PvE survival adventure in which up to 6 players can explore a world of airborne islands using their grapple hooks and fully customisable airships - and if that sounds familiar, yes, it owes a lot to the studio's earlier multiplayer sandbox game, Worlds Adrift, which shut down in 2019. Since its announcement back in 2023, Bossa has shared regular updates and even a few demos - and it's now emerged again with a new trailer ahead of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/">its PC release</a> later this year.

I think we can all agree there aren't nearly enough colourful 3D platformers these days, and I think we can all agree even more fervently that there aren't nearly enough musical ones. But here comes developer Giddy Goat Games' Billie Bust Up, in which a headstrong goat (that'll be Billie), his fox pal Oscar, and axolotl mentor Aristotle all team up to traverse a fantasy kingdom of feline smugglers, sentient puppets, and grinning ghosts. It promises all the prerequisite jumping you'd expect from the genre, but it's also a rhythm platformer, meaning timing is key as players bop along to music by Emmy nominated composer Daniel Ingram. There's no release date for Billie Bust Up yet, but it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1400830/Billie_Bust_Up/">confirmed for PC</a>.

Another one first unveiled back in 2023, developer Stormy Nights's Breeze in the Clouds is a 2D brawler starring a weather-controlling corgi named Breeze. As players venture across the weather-inspired biomes of Tropolis in search of a way home, they - and Breeze - become embroiled in a nefarious pollution plot that'll see them taking on animal enemies and bosses using fisticuffs and elemental powers. It's also promising an eclectic soundtrack featuring the likes of jazz, new jack, swing, and samba. Breeze in the Clouds is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823210/Breeze_in_the_Clouds/">due to launch on PC</a> later this year.

And finally for the upcomers, it's developer Riyo Games' Threads of Time - a 2.5D JRPG drawing inspiration from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. Its time-travelling yarn begins with turn-based battles against dinosaurs before whisking players along the timeline to encounter everything from a  fantastical past of airships and magical creatures to a dystopian cyberpunk city and an apocalyptic future. It's coming to Xbox and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2090210/Threads_of_Time/">Steam</a> at some point, and there's a new trailer above.
