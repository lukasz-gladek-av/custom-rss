            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2 is not being considered by FromSoftware, though the franchise will still continue.</p>
<p>Creator Hidetaki Miyazaki spoke to Japanese outlet <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1644616.html">Game Watch</a> after this year's PlayStation Awards, for which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree won the grand award.</p>
<p>When asked about the future of Elden Ring, Miyazaki stated the studio is not considering Elden Ring 2, but that doesn't mean the IP won't be developed further.</p>

<p>He added FromSoftware is working on multiple projects, though did not specify if some form of Elden Ring game is one of them.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, shortly after Elden Ring's release, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-described-as-start-of-a-new-franchise-following-enormous-12m-sales-milestone">phenomenal sales</a> were described as "a fantastic start for the new franchise".</p>
<p>However, despite the critical and commercial success of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, it seems a direct sequel won't be happening.</p>
<p>So what's next for FromSoftware? At present the studio's plans are underwraps, though now-deleted job listings earlier this year included mention of robot characters, leading to speculation of another Armored Core game.</p>
<p>The company's future is uncertain too, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">reports Sony is looking to acquire FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>. That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">takeover interest was acknowledged by Kadokawa</a>, lending it credence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-skyrockets-to-200m-in-first-month/">PocketGamer</a>, the mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly £164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>The report added Pokémon TCG Pocket's average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p>

<p>The game saw a boost on 22nd November, when it recorded $8.4m thanks to the start of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak event. A comparatively reserved $2.7m was spent in the game on its first day, 30th October, which remains its lowest level of player spending as its success has soared.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket reached its highest weekly earnings on its third week post launch, with $51.1m. This declined by three percent the following week, to $49.7m.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived at the end of October, and within its first four days reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">earned $12.1m</a>. That number of course soon swelled even more, and Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a> in its first three weeks.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> has begun testing Reward Road, a new in-game scheme to provide additional bonuses when players spend real-world money on virtual items.
</p>
<p>
The reward program is live now to some players in Australia and New Zealand while developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> gathers feedback. So far, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h54bog">reddit</a> report that the scheme offers 30 Points for this month's £5 "Eggs-pedition" event ticket. The top reward from the scheme requires 3000 Points, suggesting this will be unlocked when players spend an eye-popping £500.
</p>
<p>
So what are these rewards? Well, for 50 Points (so not quite enough from spending a fiver) you'll get one Premium Battle Pass. That's not terrible, but it's not great either.
</p>
<p>
Hit 750 Points and you'll also have claimed a couple of Incubators, plus a Lucky Egg, a Star Piece, a couple of incense and some stickers. This is all stuff that you could get in-game relatively easily (by winning a Showcase, for example) or purchase in a box with PokéCoins for a lot less than it would cost to hit the 750 Points mark with real-world money.
</p><p>
Reward Road only awards points when you spend cash - not PokéCoins which can be earned for free in-game, and also not if you buy tickets to real-world events like in-person Go Fests, presumably because Niantic uses its own web platform for those. Oh, and your points reset each month, so the race will always be on to spend more every 30 days.
</p>
<p>By the time you've hit 3000 Points, you'll have unlocked around 15 Battle Passes and 16 Incubators, as well as a smattering of other rewards. This might cost you around a tenner normally if buying in an in-game bundle. But is it worth spending more to hit £500? Nowhere close.</p>
<p>
It's hard to see anyone but Pokémon Go's true whales deliberately spending more money per month to unlock these rewards. But perhaps they are the target market here. It'll be interesting to see whether Reward Road is tweaked further and makes it out of testing to a wider release.
</p>

            <p>A number of titles will be leaving Xbox Game Pass in the coming weeks, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a>. </p>
<p>As was announced earlier in the year, developer Playground Games is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-4-to-be-delisted-on-xbox-and-pc">delisting Forza Horizon 4 from online stores</a> due to "licensing and agreements" with the game's partners.</p>

<p>In addition to the rather picturesque racing epic, some of the service's more unsettling titles are also going to be removed. I am talking about Supermassive's deadly night at a teen-filled camp, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a>, as well as survival horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/amnesia-the-bunker">Amnesia: The Bunker</a>.</p>
<p>We awarded Amnesia: The Bunker a rather impressive four out of five stars on its release.</p>
<p>"Sitting at the heart of Amnesia: The Bunker is a wickedly dark premise. And yes, it's scary - scary in that special kind of way that sees you gasp for breath because, until that very moment, you didn't realise you'd been holding it," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amnesia-the-bunker-review-survival-horror-thats-dark-in-all-the-right-ways">Eurogamer's Amnesia The Bunker review</a>, with Vikki stating it's "dark in all the right ways".</p>

            <p>
Arcane showrunner Christian Linke has responded to fan feedback on the beloved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> series' second season, and specifically the suggestion its final episodes speed through their story too quickly.
</p>
<p>
The excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off has now finished its run on Netflix after two highly-acclaimed seasons of eye-popping animation. (There are no spoilers here, if you haven't yet finished.)
</p>
<p>
But while still highly-regarded, a common theme among fan responses has been that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">Arcane's second and, sadly, final season</a> simply had an enormous amount of story to tell in order to finish up its various plotlines - and not always enough time to do it complete justice.
</p>
<p>
"Some theories here a bit too far out there," Linke said, writing on the Arcane <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/arcane/comments/1h0opv7/s2_act_3_spoilers_holy_shit_cocreator_christian/lzbvuwv/">reddit</a>. "No, we didn't ask Fortiche to produce a 1h30 final episode. It's quite the opposite, our scripts are always shorter than what Fortiche ends up proposing in the story board phase. We wanna let them get inspired and roam free so we can then reel it in while also allowing for the magical moments to find themselves. 
</p><p>
"It's a tight creative collaboration, not some sort of 'alright vendor company, do your work, achieve the impossible, but do it quickly!' I consider many of the people at Fortiche to be some of my closest friends. I find it disappointing that people suggest these things.
</p>
<p>
"No, we didn't get 'corporate greed' pressure or anything," Linke continued. "However, yes, there are always constraints, both in budget and time. That's part of our job as creatives, to work within those constraints. Constraints are NORMAL, and they were always generous, and I always had final say on anything creative. But they do exist. They also existed during Season 1."
</p>
<p>
Arcane has made headlines for reportedly being the most expensive animated TV series of all time in terms of how much money is spent on each 25-minute episode. Linke said he'd of course wanted more time still, but that his team and animation studio Fortiche had been extremely lucky as-is.
</p>
<p>
"It would have been great to have more time to work on this second season, or extra time to add to the episodes, but we didn't have it. For a number of reasons. Budget being one. We have been EXTREMELY lucky to get these absolutely insane budgets from Riot to produce Arcane. We all feel incredibly lucky. NOBODY ELSE gets these types of budgets. Please don't forget that.
</p><p>
"Time being the other constraint. There's a release window that a massive amount of people work towards, not just at Fortiche, but also at Riot on different games, at Netflix, brand partners. Even key talent that works on the show that, simply put, is getting tired cranking away at this incredibly long season and project over multiple years. Don't forget that at the end of the day, this is just a collective of human beings, of people.
</p>
<p>
"I would assume that there is no other TV show that has taken as long as Arcane to produce two seasons, without any pauses. Arcane is unrivaled in sheer scope of high fidelity animation. I don't wanna use any of these things as an excuse, but, yeah... this work demands a lot on a human level.
</p>
<p>
"Our Season 2 is amazing. We have made you feel more than you've ever felt when watching animated characters," he concluded. "It's not perfect. You don't take these types of hefty swings and expect that everything wraps up perfectly with a neat bow tie. It grows and evolves in its own way, and it becomes what it becomes."
</p>
<p>
With Arcane's story now concluded, the same team is now working to expand the show's world with three more stories set in other areas of the League of Legends universe. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-cinematic-universe-to-expand-with-three-more-league-of-legends-animated-series">Link confirmed these locations</a> would include Noxus, home to Arcane's Mel Meldarda, plus Demacia and Ionia. There's no word yet on when these stories might debut.
</p>
<p>"Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane season two review</a>. "This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo now seems unlikely to unveil <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> this year, but you can already buy carry cases and screen protectors for the company's unannounced console. 
</p>
<p>
Listings for Switch 2 accessories have now begun to appear on China's wholesale platform Alibaba (as spotted by <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-speculation-thread-st-this-is-furukawa-president-of-nintendo.7757/page-2257">Famiboards</a>), with products available to buy in bulk that claim to have been made based on the actual Switch 2 console.
</p>
<p>
Hardware companies regularly provide accessory manufacturers with moulds for unreleased devices to aid the production of add-ons. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">purported 3D-printed plans for the Switch 2</a> have been floating around online for several months, based on a leaked form factor that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">Digital Foundry dubbed as "almost certainly real"</a>.
</p>
<p>
One image of the Switch 2 accessories shows what looks to be a comparison shot of the new screen protector next to another for Switch 1. The difference in size backs up prior reporting that Switch 2's screen will be larger. There's also now no space for a light sensor.

As for the Switch case, its dimensions are 290mm in length, 135mm in height and 50mm in depth. It's tough to draw firm conclusions on the dimensions of Switch 2 from that, but all signs point to a longer and chunkier device overall.
</p><p>
For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">Nintendo has said it will unveil the Switch 2 properly</a> at some point before the end of the current financial year, on 31st March 2025. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">an analyst told Eurogamer the "ship had sailed" on Nintendo lifting the lid this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
When Switch 2 might actually go on sale is another matter, however. Eurogamer understands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Switch 2 will not launch before April 2025</a>, though should finally arrive before the end of next calendar year.
