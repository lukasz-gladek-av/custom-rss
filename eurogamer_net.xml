            <p>Larian Studios' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">new Divinity game</a> has been the talk of town since it was revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a>. Even the comments on potential gen-AI use, ensuing backlash, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">course-correction</a> haven't sunk the excitement around the next RPG from the developers behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. In fact, the 2023 CRPG and the studio's previous game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-original-sin-2-review">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, have seen a surge in popularity.</p>
<p>Though <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/#max">BG3's hold for the past couple of years</a> has been quite solid, users took to social media on 20th January to point out it was faring well even in the face of new releases and online giants like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">Arc Raiders</a>. Larian boss Swen Vincke, who's also leading development on the new Divinity, quickly added a quick comment on their previous two games' very enduring appeal:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p><p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time :) <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p></div>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>It must be noted Vincke talked about sales for both games, which aren't fully represented by the actual concurrent players activity we're seeing. Moreover, we only have access to data on Steam's numbers, but with Larian's catalogue seeing recent sales across all the available platforms and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/divinity-original-sin-2-official-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-series-xs-ps5-launch-trailer">Original Sin 2 getting a native Switch 2 port and current-gen upgrades</a>, it's not hard to believe many folks are finally jumping on the massive RPGs now.</p>
<p>The developer also stated the previous Divinity game has had its best month since its launch in 2017, which might be true if you look at the full picture (again, we'll have to believe Larian here), but doesn't fit <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/435150/charts/#max">SteamDB's all-time chart</a>, which you can also find below.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game's highest post-launch peak is found on March 2020, right as the Covid pandemic started, when it got to 30,882 concurrent players. This month, it reached its best numbers (27,409) since then though.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/#max">As for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, its best post-launch moments happened in January 2024 (297,492) and April 2025 (169, 267). Right now, it's sitting at (127,254) on Steam. Again, the total could be much higher across all platforms.</p>
<figure>

<p>As a side note, Larian has also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-will-certainly-consider-a-divinity-switch-2-release">the studio will consider a Nintendo Switch 2 port of Divinity</a> as well as look into supporting Steam Deck again after BG3's success on Valve's handheld PC.</p>

            <p>
Following last week's announcement that long-running MMO The Elder Scrolls Online would be moving away from traditional major expansions to focus on smaller seasonal updates, developer ZeniMax Online has insisted the big shake-up is in no way related to last year's sweeping layoffs at parent company Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report">heavily impacted</a> the studio.
</p>
<p>
Last July, in a year that saw Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella boast "record performance" and a revenue increase to $281.7bn, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">announced mass layoffs</a> affecting over 9000 employees across the company, marking its third round of significant job cuts since 2023. The move - which impacted numerous Xbox studios including Rare, Turn 10, The Initiative, and Raven Software - was accompanied by multiple project cancellations.

<p>
ZeniMax Online Studios' in-development sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird was one of the games impacted, and its cancellation coincided with nearly 200 job cuts at the studio. But following last week's announcement that <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69137">The Elder Scrolls Online would be shifting to smaller seasonal releases</a>, executive producer Susan Kath has insisted the two events are unrelated.
</p>
<p>
"Seasons is not in any way a response to [the layoffs]," Kath <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">recently told RockPaperShotgun</a>. "We kicked off the Season work at least 12 to 14 months ago. We started making the changes in the team to move in this direction, knowing that this was our intent."
</p><p>
Kath describes 2025 as a "hard year for the studio", but acknowledges Blackbird's cancellation could be seen as a positive for ESO. "Ultimately, we had a lot of people doing double duty on those projects, splitting their time between projects," she continued. "[They] are now devoted 100 percent to Elder Scrolls Online. So, in fact, in some capacities, we actually increased the number of folks available as we came out of that because they weren't managing two products anymore. They were only devoted to one title."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax first publicly discussed the idea of smaller updates for The Elder Scrolls Online shortly after the layoffs. In September, studio game director Rich Lambert <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> the MMO was in "a bit of a transition year", and that the team was now looking to get "smaller, more bite-sized things out quicker". The aim, he said, was to launch these smaller updates roughly every six to nine months, compared to the 12-15 month release schedule for traditional expansions. And last week, ZeniMax formalised its plans, announcing a move to smaller, quarterly - and free - seasons, starting 2nd April, which will also see many earlier paid expansions rolled into the base game. This change coincides with the introduction of a seasonal (but not time-limited) battle pass, featuring a free tier and two paid extensions.

<p>
In a press briefing attended by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">RPS</a> ahead of the announcement, Elder Scrolls Online game director Nick Giaomini insisted the shift would give the team the "flexibility to make our game more exciting and invest in addressing long standing pain points, add features and improvements players have been asking for, and update and iterate on the core game, rather than always just chasing something brand new."
</p><p>
"To say that [the layoffs] didn't impact us wouldn't be right," Giacomini added. "We're putting on a strong face. We're human. It absolutely impacted us. But, you know, the team rallied. We're excited about the future. We're excited that we're making all these big changes."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon</a> is celebrating its 30th anniversary on 27th February, and we're collectively dying to see what might be revealed about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">long-rumoured next mainline game</a> and other projects. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> aims to shake things up with a new take on town life sims in early March. In its beginnings, however, the series took a long time to figure out.</p>
<p>This is what The Pokémon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara said during a brief appearance at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HNNugGXKQ0">New York Game Awards</a> through a special video (hat tip to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/pokemons-game-boy-development-process-took-a-great-deal-of-trial-and-error">Nintendo Life</a>). The franchise as a whole <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-to-receive-prestigious-award-at-the-15th-annual-new-york-game-awards">received the Andrew Yoon Legend Award</a>, which celebrates a "sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p>
<p>Ishihara took this opportunity to reflect on the series' humble origins. The games were made with "limited resources" back then, and he underlined Red and Green took "a great deal of trial and error" to get right and to the finish line. He even revealed the entire process ended up lasting six years, which is shocking to learn about when you consider dev cycles back in the day were substantially shorter than nowadays. What now feels normal rarely happened back then.</p>
<p>We know it all paid off in the end, and much like us, Ishihara believes it was all about having a strong base-level idea the team was confident about: "Still, we all felt confident in the main gameplay elements that would become the foundation of the Pokémon video game series: catch, raise, trade, and battle." These elements were designed with nostalgic themes and warm feelings in mind, as it was all tied to "fundamental experiences" many players had as children who connected with nature.</p><p>That said, he was "uncertain at first" about its appeal outside Japan as many formative childhood experiences aren't shared. Needless to say, there was nothing to be scared of. After that initial hit, Pokémon's core themes of friendship and our (often very complicated) relationship with the world shaped the franchise's identity.</p>
<p>No comments on the next main game from Ishihara beyond continuing to use those tenets as a "major driving force," but that could change soon.</p>

            <p>One of the original Tomb Raider creators has shared some details on a previous request from a Japanese publisher, which asked the team to give Lara Croft an anime-style redesign to make her more widely appealing.</p>
<p>According to Paul Douglas - who in his own words "co-created Tomb Raider half a lifetime ago" - publisher Victor Interactive wanted the team to change up Lara's in-game look to "appeal more to a Japanese audience".</p>

<p>The Tomb Raider creator said this redesign request included ideas for Lara to have "huge eyes/head etc". Douglas added the publisher went so far as to send over a fax with some design suggestions late in Tomb Raider's development. However, fellow Tomb Raider developer Toby Gard "didn't really want to alter Lara", Douglas said on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cnhyv.bsky.social/post/3mcq3dxcwv22o">Bluesky account</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/CoreDesign_com">@CoreDesign_com</a>).</p>
<p>In order to keep both parties happy, a compromise was reached. This saw Tomb Raider's manual and guide feature more "manga-style" characters, though Douglas is "not sure who did that render or illustrations".</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/cnhyv/status/1362414841424728073">Back in 2021</a>, Douglas shared some images of these characters, with a few extra background notes. At this time, the Tomb Raider co-creator said he believed Victor "just assumed altering all the models would only take a few days of work".  However, this was "early days of 3D... 🙄", so would of course take considerable time.</p>
<p>"It started out as a request to change all the in-game and cutscene models.Then just in-game. Then just Lara. Then just Lara's head…"</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A top-to-bottom Atari-themed hotel is increasingly close to becoming a reality. A location has been found - in the centre of Phoenix, Arizona - and the company responsible, Intersection Development, says construction will begin late 2026 with a prospective opening date of late 2028.</p>
<p>The architectural company designing the building, Räkkhaus, revealed updated designs and features for the hotel. Renders show a large but not enormous building bearing the Atari logo and decked out with bright lighting everywhere. To me it looks like an arcade version of an Ibis.</p>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<p>But to borrow from the press release's much more poetic language: the Atari Hotel uses the "visual language" of Tron and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> to create a "glowing monolith of light and motion" (I bet the neighbours are pleased). The "fractured" design on the outside of the building is supposed to evoke pixel grids, and the streaks of light on the inside are supposed to remind us of arcade circuitry.</p><p>A defining feature will apparently be an LED-lit "breezeway" (pictured top) - a passage wrapped in programmable LEDs - which can be programmed to suit whatever event or season makes sense at the time. Räkkhaus reckons it'll feel like a portal from the outside world into the hotel.</p>

<p>The 90,000 sqft building will also feature a 20,000 sqft concert center, an esports venue, several restaurants, retail spaces and an "oversized pool designed for high-energy parties and gatherings". There will be 72 rooms in the building - a nod to Atari being founded in 1972 - as well as 19 suites and a "Baller Suite" penthouse with a private pool, spa and sun deck.</p><p>Räkkhaus creative director Zac Cohen called it: "A tower defined by motion, responsive surfaces, and a frame that glows with its own internal logic. This is placemaking at a new scale, a building that will be truly unique in the world."</p>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<p>However, there's still a slight question over the Atari Hotel securing the rest of the funding it needs in order to be built. Because although $14m has been raised in investment to get things going, the total budget is estimated at $124m, according to the <a href="https://www.atarihotels.com/">Atari Hotels website</a>.</p>
<p>Intersection hopes to make the money by asking the public to invest. For a minimum investment of $500, you can own a piece of the project - the land, the building and the Atari Hotel name, apparently - as well as receive various owner perks.</p><p>"You're helping turn an iconic gaming legacy into a real destination and you'll share in the success of the project along the way. Think of it as owning a piece of the experience, not just the idea," says the Atari Hotel website FAQ.</p>

<p>It's not clear what will happen if the money is not raised by the public, though, and whether the Atari Hotel will be constructed anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/">The Atari Hotels were first announced six years ago in 2020</a>, as part of a masterplan to build a chain of them around the US. The first were earmarked for Las Vegas, Nevada, and Phoenix, Arizona, but the Vegas plans have been dropped along the way. <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/">The Las Vegas Sun reported</a> that the company explored deals in the city but none came to fruition.</p>
<p>Originally an architectural company called Gensler was attached to the Atari Hotel project and shared concept images that were much grander, featuring taller buildings with far more elaborate structures and designs. These new designs are more mundane, but perhaps more realistic as a result. Phoenix also makes sense as a starting place with both Räkkhaus and Intersection having offices in the city.</p>
