            <p>Phasmophobia developer Kinetic Games has shared its 2026 roadmap, complete with hints of four seasonal events, two reworked maps, one completely new location, and a load of "major updates", including the player character overhaul, a Unity 6 update, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release, and, of course, that highly-anticipated 1.0 release.</p>
<p>And it all starts pretty soon, too. That player character overhaul - which some had hoped would release last year - should be out by March, complete with free cosmetics, new character models, and "fine-tuned animations".</p>

<p>"Brave ghost hunters will need to gear up for a host of new spooks and scares, with the pivotal 1.0 launch set to release across all platforms simultaneously this year," Kinetic teased. "Set to be one of the biggest moments since the game's launch, players can expect lots of surprises, as this will also include what was previously known as Horror 2.0."</p><p>Following on from the reworked farmhouse maps, Willow Street and Tanglewood are the next residential maps to get the decorators in. While Tanglewood's layout will remain "similar" (interestingly, the same is not said of Willow Street, which is my personal favourite), players can expect "a range of new interactions, a few small layout changes, and more."</p>

<p>"For those with a keen eye, there's also a mystery lurking in the shadows of 6 Tanglewood Drive waiting to be uncovered," the team added.</p>
<p>As for the new map? Kinetic is playing its cards very close to its chest on that one, but it did tease that along with the return of the usual seasonal events, a mysterious one-time event is also planned for later this year, too.</p><p>"This year is set to be a big one for Phasmophobia, and we are so excited for our 1.0 launch, which will be one of the biggest moments since we released the game," said Daniel Knight , Kinetic CEO and game director of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"We are constantly working on creating a truly immersive experience for ghost hunters, and have been developing the game with this in mind. Previous updates including Chronicle and our upcoming Player Character update have all been steps in fulfilling our vision, and we hope the 1.0 launch will feel as fresh and exciting as when the game first launched back in 2020."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026-will-be-one-of-the-biggest-years-in-the-history-of-co-op-ghosthunting-game-phasmophobia">"one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game</a>. In an update shared at the beginning of the year, the team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>

            <p>Wildlight has deployed another update to its live-service hero shooter, Highguard, introducing a 5v5 limited-time mode that will only be available this weekend.</p>
<p>As part of the most recent update you'll also find a brand new base, Soul Well, wherein "Wardens can now experiment with this dark relic from a lost age" in both the 3v3 and 5v5 rotations. You can find out more in the teaser below:</p>

<p>To accommodate the bigger fireteams, lobbies have been updated to permit parties of five, and raids are now 10 lives instead of six. You should also expect slightly longer respawns during raids "to allow generators to be planted/defused", and the Firing Range cannot support 5v5 at this time, so expect the option to be greyed out if your party has more than three players.</p>
<p>"As one of two major patches released during launch week, this update is emblematic of the Highguard team's dedication to creating a 'ready for live service' game, resulting in immediate action," the team said.</p>
<p>"Just this week, the team has squashed hundreds of bugs, improved performance across the board: yesterday’s update, Patch 1.0.4 introduced a variety of bug fixes, new video settings, and highly-requested features."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Here's the full patch notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We heard the feedback!</p>
<p>For the weekend, we are experimenting with a 5v5 Raid Mode. This is a separate playlist and not meant to replace 3’s. 3v3 Raids are still there for people who enjoy it!</p>
<p>The lobby has been updated to allow for parties of 5 while the mode is live. Grab 4 friends and jump into some hectic raids!</p>
<p>A few small tweaks for this mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raids are now 10 lives instead of 6</li>
<li>Respawns are slightly longer during raids to allow generators to be planted/defused</li>
</ul>
<p>Dev note: As most of you know, we are working on optimizations across the game. Many are in this patch and 3v3 should see good improvements! But… adding 4 more players to the game is not going to improve performance, right? Please keep that in mind as you try 5v5!</p>
<p>Dev note 2: Firing Range does not support 5v5 at this time, so the Play button will be grayed out if your party is over 3.</p>
<h2>New Base - Soul Well</h2>
<p>Soul Well is a dark relic from a lost age. The Iron Vigil has now prepared this base construct for use in the field where the dead still speak.</p>
<p>This new base will be added to the rotation in all modes.</p>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>This patch contains several optimizations that touch on animation performance, projectiles, draw submission times, and other gameplay systems. These optimizations benefit console and PC, but every PC is different, so the exact speedup to overall framerate is dependent on GPU, CPU, and other factors.</p>
<h2>Quality of Life</h2>
<p>Enabled these visual settings on PC and consoles</p>
<ul>
<li>Motion blur toggle for PC and consoles</li>
<li>Anisotropic materials toggle for consoles (PC has this already)</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one." Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-update-reduces-crashes-by-90-adds-crouch-toggle-option">Wildlight released an update</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer AdHoc Studio has issued a statement insisting it was not "trying to hide" a disclaimer about censored content on Switch, but did admit it had inadvertently put the notice in "the absolute worst spot" on the Nintendo eShop.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship would be implemented as standard</a>. As we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-comments-on-dispatchs-switch-censorship">reported at the time</a>, this meant black boxes would conceal explcit graphics, and sex noises would be toned down.</p>
<p>AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release". Nintendo's own statement said: "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines".</p>

<p>Now, acknowledging it has been "quiet for the last few days not because we don't want to address this stuff, but because we've been trying to make sure we're being good partners with Nintendo", the studio has issued a statement.</p><p>"As Nintendo states, any game that's going to be on the Nintendo platform needs to 'meet [Nintendo's] established content and platform guidelines'. This is the key point. Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That's what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms," AdHoc wrote.</p>
<p>"We initially assumed, like some of you, that because games like Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk are on the platform with similar types of uncensored mature content, Dispatch would be allowed to do the same. During the porting process it became clear that was not the case. So we asked that we include a disclaimer on the store page to inform customers that content would be different than on other platforms. We worked with Nintendo to get storefront language approved."</p>
<p>The statement adds that AdHoc "absolutely need[s] to take full ownership" of the placement of that disclaimer, and while it "didn't have complete control of the language" the disclaimer contained, it did have control of its placement.</p>
<p>"It was our intent to go out of our way to tell people looking to buy the game that the content was censored. Wires got crossed and we put the disclaimer in the field literally titled 'Disclaimer', instead of the 'About The Game' section. We didn't catch this until after the launch when we saw people saying we should have called out the changes on the store page, and we went to go make sure it was there. It technically has been the entire time, just in the absolute worst spot that makes it look like we were trying to hide it."</p><p>The team takes ownership of this, writing: "This is 100 percent our mistake and it was fixed in the Americas store pages a few hours after launch to give more visibility. We've also added a disclaimer before purchase. As of writing this, the other regions have either published this change or are in the process of review."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, AdHoc says it is "already working with Nintendo on a path forward", and while "can't make any specific promises just yet", it is "confident we'll be able to push an update to address at least some of the censored content", albeit in several weeks' time due to the console submission process.</p>
