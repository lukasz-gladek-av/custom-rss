            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> kicked off its early release for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition players yesterday, hitting a peak player count of almost 100k worm lovers.</p>
<p>This early launch, which requires people to drop at least £58.50 / $69.99 / €69.99 to hop in, immediately found itself a sandy society of 79,410. The following hours would see the figure slowly climb to a peak of 93,634 before tapering off for the night.</p>
<p>Prior to the release the game surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers">Steam Top Sellers page</a>, falling short of just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a>. Earlier this year the game held its final invite-only beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">which eventually opened to those who pre-ordered</a>. That beta hit a peak of 37,889, so there's a real sign of growth in terms of early adopters.</p>

<p>The launch was not without its technical stumbles, the eternal curse of MMO launches. A selection of players suffered from crashes and freezing issues, with Funcom urging those affected to update Nvidia drivers, limit in-game CPU usage, and disable Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling.</p>
<p>Server capacity issues were also a thorn in the player's side initially. Due to the number of players flooding in, Sietches (the game's name for server instances) were filling up fast. In response, Funcom pumped up the number of players that could populate each Sietche so playing with friends was more feasible.</p>
<p>But compared to the launches of the past, it's not too drastic a technical disaster! Which is good for these kinds of games, first impressions are crucial and nothing turns people away like a massive login queue or progress blockers. </p>
<p>As for what this means for Dune Awakening? Well, the fact that this pre-order release has hit a far larger peak than the previous beta indicates a real growth in interest for the game, and that a substantial number of players dropped a solid chunk of cash on the game to get in ASAP.</p>
<p>In addition, it may just be a canary in the coal mine for an even greater spike in popularity come June 10, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">when those who nab the standard version of Dune Awakening gain access</a>. Given you've got streamers diving in, plenty of buzz on social media, and a strong start reverberating around the MMO space right now, I'd imagine the Funcom devs are absolutely beaming right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The team over at CD Projekt may be busy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">working on a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but that doesn't mean it has finished with the first game. Last night, the developer announced that, yes, there is another update on the way for V and the rest of Night City.</p>
<p>The news was shared during a dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/t_SENc98vkI?t=3621s">Cyberpunk 2077 Switch 2 livestream</a>. Just around the time the developer was wrapping up its stream, the host drew attention to some of the questions viewers had been asking. Well, she drew attention to one particular question viewers had been asking: Is there going to be more DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>?</p>
<p>"I can tell you right now, we are planning another part for the game," senior community manager Alicja Kozera casually dropped. "The last one wasn't the last one."</p>

<p>This update will be known as 2.3, and will arrive later this month, on 26th June. Further details on what exactly will be included with this particular Cyberpunk 2077 update will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Sharing the news <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">again on social media</a>, CD Projekt's global community director Marcin Momot proclaimed: "We're not done yet!"</p>
<p>Momot again reiterated that the team would be "spilling the beans" closer to that 26th June release date, asking that fans wait patiently for more news and "let the team cook".</p>

<p>Rumours that Cyberpunk 2077 would be getting more content started making the rounds earlier this week, when a LinkedIn post from a developer at Virtuous was circulated online. This post said the developer was working on Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, something that hadn't been announced yet.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077, it is now available on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>. Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the Switch 2 already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> has finally received a release date for its long-expected Xbox version.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=189">revealed by developer Game Science</a>, the Xbox Series X/S version will launch on 20th August, with pre-orders starting on 18th June. Further, the game will be discounted on PlayStation and PC in June.</p>
<p>The Xbox release date is exactly a year after the game's initial release on PS5 and PC last year, seemingly lending credence to previous claims the Xbox version was missing due to PlayStation console exclusivity.</p>

<p>Ahead of its release last year, Game Science stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">Black Myth: Wukong wouldn't be available on Xbox at launch</a>.</p>
<p>What followed was months of speculation, with many suggesting the limitations of the Xbox Series S console were to blame. Game Science itself said it was optimising the game "to meet our quality standards".</p>
<p>However, reports suggested the real reason for the delay was an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">undisclosed exclusivity deal between Game Science and PlayStation</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">Microsoft itself later clarified the delay was not due to "platform limitations"</a> and a representative stated the company wouldn't comment "on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders".</p>
<p>Then, at the start of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-remains-over-black-myth-wukongs-xbox-delay-as-developer-blames-console-memory">Game Science CEO Feng Ji appeared to contradict Microsoft</a>, stating on Weibo: "But that 10G shared memory, I can't really get it without a few years of optimisation experience."</p>
<p>There's another theory: Game Science has regularly released trailers on 20th August each year as it's the day many celebrate the birthday of Wukong, the monkey king. Perhaps, then, the company has simply waited for this convenient date.</p>
<p>As for the <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194">official line</a>, Game Science has stated: "Bringing Black Myth: Wukong to Xbox Series X/S - and ensuring the experience met our internal quality standards - was no easy feat. Fortunately, we were able to complete this challenging task smoothly within the first year of the game's official release."</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong has been a huge success since its release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">selling 10m copies in just three days</a>. It's considered China's first AAA release and has helped shift the Chinese games industry towards PC and console gaming.</p>
<p>Indeed, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">success has changed the game for Chinese developers creating action-RPGs</a>, including the likes of Tides of Annihilation, Phantom Blade Zero, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With the weekend finally in sight (we just need to make it through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">this year's Summer Geoff Fest</a> first), it's all change on the Epic Games Store. A fresh set of freebies is now available to download and keep, and one of them is Arkane Studios' ultra stylish <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>.
</p>
<p>
Epic's latest free games - which replace <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-this-weeks-free-epic-games-store-games">last week's offerings of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands and Limbo</a> - can be claimed right now, and come in both PC and mobile flavours. You will, of course, need to be in the EU to access Epic's mobile store on iOS, but it's available worldwide via Android devices. But regardless of how you get there, here's what's free right now:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Deathloop (PC)</li>
<li>Ogu and the Secret Forest (mobile)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Deathloop, if you're unfamiliar, traps players on the 1960s-styled island of Blackreef, where they'll need to assassinate eight key targets before they can finally escape. The trouble is, the entire place is caught in a time loop, meaning everything needs to be done before the day resets. And worse, another assassin is on your trail. It's part exploratory immersive sim, part chaotic shooter and was good enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathloop-review">earn itself a Eurogamer Essential</a> back in the day.
</p>
<p>
As for Epic's other freebie this week, Ogu and the Secret Forest is a hand-drawn exploration adventure promising puzzles, mysteries, and more. "Befriend bouncy characters," explains the official blurb, "and defeat strange creatures to unravel the mystery of the charming world."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deathloop">Deathloop</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ogu-and-the-secret-forest-ffc421">Ogu and the Secret Forest</a> are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store now and will remain so until next Thursday, 12th June. After that, Two Point Studios' fantastic Theme Hospital spiritual successor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/two-point-hospital">Two Point Hospital</a> will take their place.

            <p>
June is here, which means Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings for another month, and - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-members-get-22-more-games-in-may">bumper-packed May</a> - it's a comparatively quiet one this time around.

<p>
Then, as June trundles onwards and summer vaguely threatens to emerge, members can look forward to the likes of Thief: Deadly Shadows, the third game in the classic stealth series, and minimalist railway puzzler Station to Station.
