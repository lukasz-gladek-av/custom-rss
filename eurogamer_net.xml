            <p>Kinetic Games has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s next content drop, Chronicle, will release on 24th June, and it'll be its "biggest update yet".</p>
<p>As well as introducing a "total overhaul" of how evidence is collected, the team said Chronicle will expand investigations with three new evidence types, a completely redesigned Journal, reworked levelling and progression, a refreshed Main Menu UI, and "many eerie surprises still lurking in the dark".</p>

<p>But at the "heart" of the Chronicle update is the debut of the all-new Sound evidence. An entirely new haunting paranormal proof type can be captured through the new Sound Recorder, bringing "a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams". Available in the customary three upgrade tiers, players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p>
<p>It's this new evidence type that's necessitated a Journal upgrade, too. The Photo tab will be rebranded as "Media", and keep all your photos, videos, and new sound recordings in one place. Importantly, you'll have to fill your journal with all these unique media types, including "EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms", to complete a "perfect" investigation.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>"Chronicle will also introduce a revamped media quality system," Kinetic teased. "The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as 'Unique', granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as 'Duplicates', offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts."</p>
<p>Don't forget that this year, Phasmophobia will also rework Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse's recent overhaul. Before then, though, we'll also get to see the new levelling and progression system and Main Menu UI when Chronicle arrives at the end of June.</p>

            <p>The Communications Workers of America (CWA) says it has reached a "historic tentative contract agreement" with ZeniMax Media staff at Microsoft.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft">statement</a>, the union calls the deal a "first for the video game industry", and revealed it had been negotiating for a first contract for "nearly two years".</p>
<p>"QA workers from across the country continue to lead the charge for industry-wide change," said Page Branson, Senior II QA Tester and ZeniMax Workers United-CWA bargaining committee member. "Going toe-to-toe with one of the largest corporations in the world isn’t a small feat. This is a monumental victory for all current video game workers and for those that come after."</p>

<p>The new contract is said to set "new standards for the industry" and includes "substantial across-the-board wage increases as well as new minimum salaries for workers". It also includes protections against arbitrary dismissal, grievance procedures, and a crediting policy that "clearly acknowledges the QA workers' contributions to the video games they help create", as well as a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/zenimax-workers-reach-agreement-microsoft-contractors-and-ai">previously announced agreement</a> on how artificial intelligence is introduced and implemented in the workplace.</p>
<p>"Workers in the video game industry are demonstrating once again that collective power works. This agreement shows what's possible when workers stand together and refuse to accept the status quo," added CWA President Claude Cummings Jr. "Whether it's having a say about the use of AI in the workplace, fighting for significant wage increases and fair crediting policies, or protecting workers from retaliation, our members have raised the bar. We're proud to support them every step of the way."</p>

<p>As game development becomes increasingly insecure all over the world, more and more developers and performers are organising collective bargaining. Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity stated it stood "in solidarity", but would not be authorising a strike</a>. It did, however, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-stages-baftas-protest-seeking-improved-conditions-for-performers">call on the games industry to improve conditions for performers</a>, and a protest took place outside BAFTA Games Awards as Equity members held placards reading "Union contracts in gaming now".</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928822575318126753">In a post on X/Twitter</a>, the developer said: "If you have difficulty matchmaking on PS4 &amp; PS5, please check your NAT type. NAT type 3 may affect matchmaking on PSN.</p>
<p>"Check your NAT type with the following steps: Home &gt; Settings &gt; Network &gt; Connection Status &gt; Check Connection Status.</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY: </strong> If you're jumping into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> this weekend and are struggling to find a Player 2 - and/or a Player 3 - you're not alone.</p>
<p>In a brief statement posted to official Elden Ring social media accounts about an hour ago (Saturday, 31st May), developer FromSoftware is recommending players "restart the matchmaking process" if they're struggling to find a co-op partner.</p>

<p>"Nightfarers. If you encounter issues finding other players when launching an expedition in<a href="https://x.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hashtag_click"> </a>Elden Ring Nightreign, please try restarting the matchmaking process," the brief message suggested.

<p>It may not quite fix the issue for all players, however; as one commenter asked in the replies: "How often am I supposed to restart it? Yesterday I spend [sic] several hours restarting it on PS5 to not even play one match…"</p>
<p>Finding a co-op partner is pretty important for Nightreign players. As Ed wrote yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">he wouldn't recommend Nightreign as a solo game</a> at this point as it's clearly not the intended way to play. However, it seems FromSoftware is aiming to respond to the current backlash to make solo play more feasible, with the studio previously stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">considering a two-player option post-launch</a>, acknowledging it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," Ed wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
