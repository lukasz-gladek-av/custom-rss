            <p>Dreamhaven has revealed a number of in-development projects at its showcase presented by The Game Awards, including the release date of its tabletop-inspired adventure Sunderfolk.</p>
<p>The company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-blizzard-boss-details-new-company-dreamhaven">set up by ex-Blizzard boss Mike Morhaime</a> in 2020, known for his work on World of Warcraft, and includes other former staff across its two studios.</p>
<p>The biggest announcement was the 23rd April 2025 release date for Sunderfolk, from studio Secret Door, across Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch.</p>

<p>While releasing across PC and console, players will use a mobile app instead of a controller to interact with the game. The aim is to replicate a tabletop experience but in a streamlined, approachable way.</p>
<p>"As longstanding tabletop gaming fans, we at Secret Door know all too well how difficult it can be to get new players together for a shared experience. Learning rules, perceived complexity, and setup times can create challenges for playing with our loved ones," said Chris Sigaty, studio head of Secret Door. "Our goal with Sunderfolk is to leverage modern technology to make game night something everyone can enjoy."</p>
<p>"At its core, Sunderfolk is about the joy of playing together - laughter, strategy, and making memories," added Morhaime. "Just like the tabletop games that inspired it, Sunderfolk creates lasting bonds between friends and family with each session."</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sunderfolk-from-former-world-of-warcraft-boss-is-streamlined-tabletop-dnd-by-way-of-final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles-and-some-is-hidden-on-your-mobile">hands-on with Sunderfolk at the Game Developers Conference</a> (GDC) and was impressed by its mix of public and private gameplay that rewards cooperation.</p>
<p>Dreamhaven's other studio, Moonshot Games, announced Wildgate, a crew-based first-person shooter set in space. With both games, Dreamhaven is ticking both the fantasy and sci-fi boxes and providing cooperative experiences.</p>
<p>As "Prospectors", players will explore space in search of ancient relics to extract, engaging in both tactical spaceship combat and on-foot firefights with a comedy tone. A preview playtest will take place from 10th-14th April ahead of a launch later in the year across Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"Wildgate rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realises Dreamhaven's goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories," said Morhaime. "Since every match of Wildgate plays differently, there's tonnes for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we're looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest."</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Dreamhaven is working with two other studios on support projects.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159570/Lynked_Banner_of_the_Spark/">Lynked: Banner of the Spark</a> with developer FuzzyBot. Available now in early access on Steam, the game fuses dungeon-crawling with Animal Crossing-style town management in a cute sci-fi world of robots and gadgets.</p>
<p>The game will receive a full 1.0 release across Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 22nd May, adding five chapters (totalling 40 new missions), five new bosses, a new biome, plus new weapon mods, skins, and more.</p>
<p>Lastly, Dreamhaven has announced a partnership with Game River to publish its auto-battler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/">Mechabellum</a>. The mech strategy game is already available on Steam, but a new premium edition will add exclusive skins, avatars and emotes.</p>
<p>The full showcase is available to watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Uwjr0raU7k">YouTube</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
