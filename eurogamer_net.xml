            <p>As we thunder forward through this sunny April (apologies for any undue excitement if your local area is currently sun-free), Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/09/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-april-hogwarts-legacy-blue-prince-the-second-episode-of-lost-records-bloom-rage-and-more/">revealed the latest titles joining its PlayStation Plus game catalogue</a> for Premium and Extra subscribers this month. And that includes stellar puzzler Blue Prince, if you're looking to have your noggin particularly meddled with.</p>
<p>Away from the Blue Prince (which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-prince-review">Eurogamer just slapped with five shimmering stars</a>, so it's well worth checking out), there's plenty more coming to PlayStation's Game Catalogue. From next Tuesday, 16th April, Premium and Extra members also gain access to the closing instalment of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> originator Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review">intriguing narrative mystery Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, EA Sports PGA Tour, and culinary co-op game PlateUp.</p>
<p>As for those Premium-exclusive additions, April brings a tally of two. You've got some classic survival horror action in the seminal Alone in the Dark 2 (which first released on PlayStation back in 1993), and 2003's War of the Monsters, which includes full trophy support as players grow big and smack around other huge beasties, kaijū-style.
</p>
<p>You'll find the full list of this month's titles below:</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Blue Prince (PS5)</li>
<li>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage – Tape 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (PS4, PS5)</li>

<li>EA Sports PGA Tour (PS5)</li>

</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>

<p>Back in January, Sony announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-shifting-focus-to-ps5-games-next-year-will-only-occasionally-include-ps4-titles">shift the focus of its PlayStation Plus monthly games and Game Catalog updates toward PS5 titles</a> starting early next year - after which PlayStation 4 games will only "occasionally" feature. "Many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles," it said at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
