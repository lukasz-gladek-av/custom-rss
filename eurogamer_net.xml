            <p>Limited Run Games has requested Nintendo temporarily remove its Gex Trilogy from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> eShop.</p>
<p>The Gex Trilogy, which bundles together the cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels, launched earlier this week across PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>But while things appear to have gone swimmingly across most platforms, the trilogy wasn't working as intended on Switch 2. A number of Limited Run Games titles which run on its Carbon Engine had compatibility issues with the new console, however a recent firmware update released by Nintendo last night resolved the majority of these. But, alas, the Gex Trilogy was not one of them.</p>
<p>Sharing an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpy5kw627">update on social media</a>, Limited Run Games said: "Since we do not have clarity on when Gex Trilogy on Switch 2 will be fixed in firmware, we submitted our own patch last week to correct the issue."</p>
<p>However, due to the Juneteenth holiday across the pond, this patch is still awaiting approval. While Limited Run Games hopes to issue the patch early next week, it has requested Nintendo for the time being removes the game from the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues," Limited Run Games wrote, before sharing a list of its games that are now Switch 2 compatible following that aforementioned firmware update.</p>
<p>This list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clock Tower: Rewind</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection</li>
<li>Tomba! Special Edition</li>
<li>River City Girls Zero</li>
<li>A Boy and his Blob Collection</li>
<li>Rocket Knight Adventures</li>
<li>Shantae</li>
<li>Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</li>
<li>Xtreme Sports</li>
<li>Trip World DX</li>
<li>Felix the Cat</li>
<li>Rendering Ranger R-2: Rewind</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gex Trilogy has otherwise been a successful launch for the team at Limited Run Games. Soon after its more modern debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gex-trilogy-celebrates-success-with-much-requested-feature-that-should-make-european-fans-happy">the publisher announced the PAL versions of Gex 2 and Gex 3</a> - which feature the vocal stylings of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules respectively - will be added in an update.</p>
<p>"We're excited for European Gex fans to relive these games the way they remember and for others to hear them for the first time," Limited Run Games said at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A controversial third-party plugin used by some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> players has been permanently shut down following a cease and desist notice.</p>
<p>A message on the PlayerScope discord (shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1lfgia4/playerscope_stalker_plugin_ceases_development_due/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>) details the web back-end has been taken offline and all stored data has been "permanently and irreversibly deleted", while the plugin files have been completely removed from GitHub and GitFlic. "There will be no further updates, support, or development from my side," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>While PlayerScope hasn't specified where the cease and desist notice has come from, back in January this year Final Fantasy 14 producer and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> shared news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-considering-legal-action-against-use-of-a-third-party-tool-in-final-fantasy-14-says-naoki-yoshida">Square Enix was considering taking legal action against the creator of a third-party tool</a>.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> for clarification.</p>
<p>Yoshida has long warned players against using third-party plugins, which are strictly prohibited in Final Fantasy 14. He's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-world-first-ultimate-raid-challengers-busted-for-cheating-thanks-to-single-pixel">repeatedly called out players for cheating during Ultimate Raid challenges</a>.</p>
<p>However, the PlayerScope tool in particular has been used for nefarious intentions.</p>
<p>The plugin would allow anyone to search for a Final Fantasy 14 character name to receive that player's account details, including information of all characters on that account. Player information was also uploaded to a central server combining all data. Essentially, this allowed for in-game harassment and stalking.</p>
<p>In short, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1hvv7k5/comment/m5w6qo1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user</a> put it, the plugin was a "stalker's wet dream".</p>
<p>"We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools," said Yoshida back in January.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515747-Letter-from-the-Producer-LIVE-Part-LXXXV-%2802-21-2025%29">Square Enix stated</a> it was making changes to how characters were blacklisted, although third-party tools were able to get around this - something the company admitted was "very problematic". While it had countermeasures in place, Square Enix did not disclose what those were.</p>
<p>Now, however, PlayerScope has been completely shut down. "This wasn't an easy decision, but it was necessary," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>Still, while players have mostly praised the decision, some have concerns the database of player information may still exist elsewhere.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Blood Message, a single player narrative action game, has just been revealed by Netease Games.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PC and consoles, though no release date has been announced.</p>
<p>Developed by 24 Entertainment, the studio responsible for melee battle royale Naraka: Bladepoint, the new trailer introduces the Dunhuang's Uprising as Blood Message's setting, where your character must make a 1,000 mile trek with a crucial message in hand.</p>

<p>The trailer - which you can watch above - is a visually impressive display, showcasing plenty of third-person action across various distinct locations. While 24 Entertainment does have action experience courtesy of Naraka, this looks to be a much slower, cinematic affair.</p>
<p>An accompanying press release states Blood Message will feature: "Visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics", as well as "expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia". In terms of gameplay comparisons, think something along the lines of The Last of Us, albeit with a close-quarters, historical focus.</p>
<p>"We are ushering players a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," said Zhipeng Hu, lead producer and NetEase executive vice president. "As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world."</p>
<p>We're seeing a lot of these big budget action games come from China as of late, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">the success of Black Myth: Wukong changed the game for the country's developers</a>. Prior to Blood Message, Phantom Blade Zero, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Lost Soul Aside, and Tides of Annihilation are just a handful of examples of interesting titles following the path Wukong first tread.</p>
<p>These examples have yet to release, and as such whether or not the financial and critical success of Wukong can be replicated by its contemporaries remains to be seen. Nonetheless, this wave of interesting looking games coming to the West from a historically under-represented part of the video game industry (at least as far as big budget AAA is concerned) certainly offers another avenue for exciting games to reach the hands of curious players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has received an update to make its Overture DLC easier to access and play.</p>
<p>The game's director, Jiwon Choi, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-will-have-difficulty-reduced-in-future-update">stated in a video last week</a> an update including "difficulty reduction" was on the way. Now it's here.</p>
<p>Specifically, the DLC can now be accessed from Chapter 5 instead of Chapter 9, as long as you're on your second playthrough.</p>

<p>Further, repeat playthroughs will have reduced monster difficulty, while on a first playthrough certain field monsters will have adjusted stats. I really hope it's those bastard kangaroos that have been nerfed.</p>
<p>This is great news for everybody, except me. It means that if you're on a second playthrough of the game (on NG+), you can now access the DLC earlier. I, however, have already had to do a NG+ speedrun up to the end of Chapter 9 prior to this update just to access the DLC. Sigh.</p>
<p>Still, alongside the DLC, an update for the full game has brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc">new easier difficulty options</a>. So even if the DLC's difficulty has put you off (or, like me, you just want to get through the base game quicker), it's easier to do so on a lower setting.</p>
<p>Alongside the balance adjustments, a number of bugs have been fixed, as per the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519716851054280776">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Lies of P has <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001716.000010988.html">now sold over 3m copies</a>, thanks to the release of the Overture DLC. Previously, publisher Neowiz revealed the game had reached 7 million players, but as it was initially released on Xbox Game Pass, these didn't count towards copies sold.</p>
<p>To celebrate, developer Round8 is (according to <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284">The Elec</a> - thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-devs-get-bonus-paid-holiday-and-switch-2-consoles-for-hitting-sales-milestone/">VGC</a>) rewarding its employees with a bonus payout, extra holiday, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> console each.
