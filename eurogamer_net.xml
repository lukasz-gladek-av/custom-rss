<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> players are reporting that some in-game children now have pregnant bellies, following the game's latest patch.
</p>
<p>
Several <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iyd8rp/umm_guys_my_kid_is_pregnant/">posts on The Sims' reddit</a> from over the past 24 hours report the issue and provide visual evidence, showing young Sims strutting about with a baby on board.
</p>
<p>
"Umm guys..." one player wrote. "My kid is pregnant..." <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/comments/1iy87lc/since_todays_patch_all_the_male_children_in_my/">Wrote another</a>: "Since today's patch all the male children in my game have pregnant bellies." 
</p>

It's unclear what new bug has caused the issue, or how widespread the appearance of pregnancy has spread.
</p>
<p>
The bright side here is that these young Sims are only appearing pregnant, rather than actually having their in-game status set to give birth. As far as players can work out, the issue is simply a visual one - though still, bizarre.
</p>
<p>
"I think the overall bug is that they're mixing up adult and child body presets somehow," one player suggested. "One in my save is very muscular suddenly and I saw another one with the classic beer belly and narrow shoulder combo. Really hope they fix it soon."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted The Sims publisher EA for more detail on what's gone wrong.
</p>
<p>This week's patch for The Sims 4 - the one that seems to have caused this issue - was meant to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">finally add the series' iconic burglar, after 11 years</a>. </p>
<p>Amidst some uncertainty surrounding The Sims' future, the franchise is currently celebrating its 25th anniversary with a range of events, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-and-2-patch-fixes-numerous-issues-following-farcical-re-release">somewhat wobbly remasters of The Sims and The Sims 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
