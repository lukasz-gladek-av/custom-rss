            <p>PUBG creator Brendan Greene has revealed his PlayerUnknown Productions studio is working on "an ambitious" three-game plan: Prologue: Go Wayback!, Preface: Undiscovered World, and Project Artemis.</p>
<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is a single-player open-world "emergent" survival game in which you'll use "classic" survival mechanics to explore machine learning-driven terrain generation, "challenging your limits".</p>

<p>Promising to engage with the community during development, Greene expects this project to release in early access in spring (Q2) 2025.</p>
<p>You won't have to wait so long to give Greene's second project, Preface: Undiscovered World, however. A demo is already available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/">Steam</a> to give players "an early look at the innovative technology that will power the subsequent titles in the series, and eventually project Artemis". It's not faring particularly well - early adopters have put it at a "mostly negative" rating - but it's free and available to try right now.</p>
<p>As Greene explains it, though, the world will become more populated and interesting the more people visit it.</p>
<p>"In Preface, users can witness an Earth-scale world generated in real-time by our machine learning agents directly on their GPU," Greene said. "This digital planet is still quite empty for now, but every person who enters it and shares their feedback, contributes to its future development."</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Project Artemis?</p>
<p>"My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up. After Prologue, two more games are planned for release in the coming years, each addressing critical technical challenges that will bring the studio closer to the final product. With Prologue, we aim to engage players and introduce them to the emergent mechanics and expansive worlds we're developing."</p>
<p>PUBG Studios, the studio behind - you guessed it - PUBG, recently unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-studio-unveils-top-down-pvp-shooter-project-arc-with-real-time-shared-line-of-sight">Project ARC</a>, a new 5v5 PvP shooter viewed from a top-down perspective and featuring "shared real-time line of sight".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda and MachineGames have shared a full breakdown of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s accessibility options.</p>
<p>While much of the options included are what you would expect as standard - things like the ability to change the subtitle font size and edit button layouts - the team has also included a welcomingly customisable action experience.</p>
<p>What this means is that players can tweak specific aspects of the game's combat and enemies, rather than just go for a blanket 'one size fits all' approach to the action's difficulty.</p>

<p>When players first boot up the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, they have the option to choose from three 'Action experience' options: Light, Moderate and Hard. However, once the game actually starts, players can then customise this Action experience further via the pause menu.</p>
<p>Here, there is the option to adjust things such as number of melee attackers, number of ranged attackers, enemy awareness speed and enemy damage.</p>

<p>There is also the option to customise Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's 'Adventure experience', which means tweaking puzzle difficulty and location markers.</p>

<p>We just awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle a shiny five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm and a real eye for spectacle," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We’ve just reached 1 million Early Access redemptions. The support you have all shown for Path of Exile 2 Early Access is far beyond anything we could have ever predicted.

<p>With sales still increasing, Rogers said that "whilst [the sales] is great news, it also comes with some downsides, too. There are probably going to be some queues during the launch weekend".</p>
<p>"Before our announcement, when we're ordering capacity, we really didn't expect to have more than a millions people online at the same time. We've already ordered way more cloud capacity and those servers will be coming online very soon. But I do have some concerns about issues with the backend.</p><p>"We quite frankly don't know what our backend services are going to be able to handle as we go above a million users. Now, we've added more database shards, scaling everything we have up as far as it'll go. But we're really not sure what kind of limits we might hit. We never expected things to go this big during [early access]," Rogers added.</p>
<p>"So I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you guys so much for believing in this project. If we do run into server issues at launch, just know that we're going to be working as hard as we can to solve them."</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 is now available in early access on PC and consoles. It was originally expected to release in November, but the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-delayed-by-three-weeks">had its early access release date pushed back</a> to today, 6th December, after some "server-side infrastructure work" necessitated additional work.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been almost 10 years since the release of the video game, which has spawned a couple of spin-off card games in The Witcher: Thronebreaker and mobile app Gwent, but only now is a physical reproduction of the game being created.</p>
<p>The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to replicate the full experience from The Witcher 3, and will have variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p>

<p>It will cost £44 and arrive in Q3 2025.</p>
<p>The set is being created by Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games, which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming - an Asterix set is also planned for next year.</p>
<p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said Rob Trounce, marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK.</p>
<p>"After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package - whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p>

            <p>NetEase Games' free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter Marvel Rivals has got off to a rather heroic start on Steam.</p>
<p>Following its debut earlier today, the game - which boasts a vast roster of characters from across the Marvel universe - has managed to already reach a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">Valve's platform</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are still 181,057 Marvel-ites (not sure that is actually a word, but let's go with it for now) still battling it out amongst each other. This number may well rise further again over the weekend, when we are free from the shackles of the work week.</p>

<p>It isn't all numbers and no praise. Marvel Rivals currently sits with a "mostly positive" review average on Steam.</p>
<p>"Marvel Rivals is proving that the competitive multiplayer space does indeed have room for new titles. Just gotta get the execution right," reads one positive review. "Finallyyyyyy, a game that's actually fun," adds another. "First off, the team is amazing, and the gameplay is fantastic - I just love it."</p><p>One area the game is receiving particular praise for, is its roster of characters. Prior to its launch, the team confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-next-five-characters-have-been-confirmed-heres-the-list">Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger, Iron Fist, Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine would all be joining the line up</a>. Other characters include Iron Man, Hulk and Scarlet Witch.</p>

<p>The game itself is described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", and one which on its announcement head of Marvel Games Jay Ong called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-is-a-free-to-play-pvp-shooter-where-heroes-and-villains-fight-together-and-against-each-other">one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects"</a>, and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
