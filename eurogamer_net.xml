            <p>
Ubisoft has closed two studios and cancelled six projects - including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake - as part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games.
</p>
<p>
The moves are part of what Ubisoft calls a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset" as it looks to respond to a "persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape". The restructuring will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", respectively focused on "scaling and extending" its biggest properties (including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six); on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences (The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell); on live experiences (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones); on immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes (Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil), and on casual and family games.
</p>
<p>
The first major impact of this significant organisational shift is the closure of Ubisoft's Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, with "restructuring" also confirmed for the publisher's Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive teams. It's unclear how many employees will lose their jobs as result of these changes, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">IGN reports</a> the move is also being accompanied by a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week, albeit with an annual allowance of remote-working days.
</p>
<p>
Amid this major shake-up, Ubisoft has confirmed the cancellation of six in-development games it says "do not meet the new enhanced quality [and] more selective portfolio prioritisation criteria". Four of these titles have never been announced (three being new IPs and one a mobile game), and the only cancelled title it has explicitly named is its embattled Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, and which has suffered multiple delays in the years since then. When last we heard of the remake, Ubisoft had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">narrowed its release window</a> down to between 1st January and 31st March 2026. As such, it cancellation is unexpected.
</p><p>
Alongside these cancellations, Ubisoft is delaying seven  unspecified games "to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met" and to "maximise long-term value creation". Notably, this includes the unannounced game widely believed to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">much-rumoured Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a> - which will now launch in Ubisoft's next financial year, starting April 2026, rather than the current one it was previously announced for. All this has lead Ubisoft to revise its guidance for the full financial year, saying it now expects net bookings of around €1.5bn - a reduction of €330m.
</p>
<p>
"These measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement. "The portfolio refocus will have a significant impact on the Group’s short term financial trajectory, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, but this reset will strengthen the Group and enable it to renew with sustainable growth and robust cash generation. Ubisoft is entering a new phase – one designed to reclaim creative leadership and build value for players and stakeholders over the long term."

            <p>2XKO is out properly on PC and consoles, bringing with it a slew of new features and Caitlyn as its 12th fighter. However, inquisitive players quickly found a fun easter egg tied to Caitlyn that significantly changes the character's appearance in game.</p>
<p>By holding down both special buttons during the loading screen before a match, players who have chosen Caitlyn as one of their two fighters will be able to remove the hat present on her default costume. With that, her iconic top hate is gone, replaced with absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>This is not the first time such an easter egg has been included in 2XKO. When the season 0 Arcane skins were added to the game last year, players discovered that very specific button combinations prior to a match could remove the mask from Ekko's Arcane skin, pull down Jinx's hood, or remove Vi's jacket.</p>

<p>This is a style of secret with a rich history in fighting games, with games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter V</a> offering similar easter eggs on specific costumes. What's great about Caitlyn's secret costume alteration is that, unlike the Arcane skins, you don't need to spend a dime to use it yourself.</p><p>If you're curious about 2XKO and want to learn more about it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">why not read Eurogamer's 2XKO review</a>! In it, the game is described as: "2XKO is a tag fighter like no other, with a bold aesthetic and superbly crafted core gameplay experience. Beloved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> characters are revitalised in a new light in a truly stunning free-to-play experience."</p>
