            <p>Blizzard bringing a new playable character to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a>: Resurrected - the first new character the game has had in 25 years - could be the start of an era of active development for the classic game, potentially seeing it evolve like a modern game does.</p>
<p>To recap quickly: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-announces-diablo-warlocks">Blizzard shadow-dropped the warlock for Diablo 2 last night</a> as part of a paid expansion release and a wider 30th anniversary celebration for the Diablo franchise. Not only was this unexpected but it's a 'testing the waters' moment; should the warlock go down well, Blizzard will take it as a green light to explore more of this kind of thing going forward.</p>
<p>"We are excited for the opportunity we have right now to see what the community says about what we're making," said Timothy Vasconcellos, lead designer on the Diablo Legacy team, during a Diablo 2 interview at Blizzard headquarters a couple of weeks ago, which I was a part of. "And if we're trusted with that legacy and if it's a positive reception and they say: no you guys actually did do this very intricate dance preserving the 1999 game, then maybe we can think about how we pursue those opportunities in the future. But we have to nail that otherwise we kill the game in trying to progress it forward."</p>

<p>"We still have millions of people who play Diablo 2 - millions of them," lead producer Matthew Cederquist added, with a heavy emphasis on the "millions". "We saw the 30th anniversary of the franchise itself as a really great opportunity to surprise and delight. I don't think anyone expects a new class and all these features in Diablo 2, and I think that's going to be a moment that's like, 'I'm sorry, what did you say? You did what?' People won't believe it until we put it in their faces. And I sure hope it's as epic to the players as we find it. But is it a declaration of something new [going forwards]? We're going to have to see what the players say."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa. We're not going to give her some sunglasses and a new hairdo"</em></blockquote>
<p>Understandably, bringing a new class to a treasured game like Diablo 2 was a nervy moment for the team. To my eyes, which aren't particularly accustomed to Diablo 2, the warlock feels at home in the game (I had a chance to play it for half-an-hour or so). Blizzard said a lot of effort went into making the class feel like it was designed in the year 1999, which I think it does. The team at Blizzard, more than anyone, perhaps, is aware of what's at stake if it messes around with the recipe too much.</p>
<p>"We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa," Cederquist said. "We're not going to give her some sunglasses and a new hairdo. But at the same time, does it feel weird [adding a new class]? No. Do we have to honour that legacy of what was created? Yes."</p>

<p>Incidentally, the versions of the warlock differ in the Diablo games it's coming to - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, Diablo 2, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>. Broadly, there's a lore-based thread running through them, with all three telling a connected story of the warlock appearing in the world of Sanctuary. This starts in D2 and runs through Diablo 4 and then Immortal. Diablo 2's warlock take also pulls on the game's more hardcore appeal, especially in the demon taming skill tree, which is unique to D2, whereby you can tame demons and have them fight with you as pets or consume them for bursts of power. It's fiddly but incredibly satisfying to do.</p><p>Should the community like the warlock, then, and want more, it will lead to a broader exploration of what Blizzard can do with Diablo 2. This might involve meaningful reworks of classes already in the game, for example, although were this to be the case, Blizzard wouldn't spring it on you like it did the warlock. "Let's say if we wanted to change Barbarian for some reason: I wouldn't want to surprise people with that," Cederquist said. "That is working with the community hand in hand, to listen to their feedback about the changes that we would make if we wanted to."</p>
<p>There's a bigger concern with this, though, and it's what happens to the preserved and restored Diablo 2 experience that millions of people clearly still enjoy? It's not a classic experience any more if it's changed. To this end, we've reached a divergence point. There are now, effectively, two versions of Diablo 2: Resurrected. There's a progressive version represented by Reign of the Warlock, which is the paid expansion the warlock is a part of, and there's the classic version known as Diablo 2: Resurrected.</p>
<p>"It's the reason why we separated out Reign of the Warlock and whatever future stuff we have, so that we do have the opportunity to change with feedback, but also preserve what people love in Resurrected, and all that data set is totally split," Cederquist explained. "Resurrected is going to time-stamp. If you don't want to play a warlock for whatever reason and you hate loot filters, you can still have Resurrected and it's going to stay there. If we make any future changes to any classes or whatever, it's going to happen in that Reign of Warlock space."</p>
<p>It's a big week for Diablo 2, not only with the addition of a new class, but also because it was released on Steam yesterday and on Game Pass (the Reign of the Warlock expansion is not included on Game Pass). There are already "millions" of people playing the game, as Cederquist said, and these releases potentially widen the game to millions more.</p>

            <p>Jason Momoa will star in the live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film adaptation from Sony Pictures and PlayStation Productions.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/">Deadline</a>, Momoa - who is no stranger to video game adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">with Minecraft</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jason-momoa-and-wrestler-roman-reigns-tapped-for-street-fighter-roles">Street Fighter already to his name</a> (there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aquaman-jason-momoa-set-to-star-in-just-cause-movie">even some Just Cause talk several years ago</a>) - will join Fast and Furious director Justin Lin on the film, which is based on Arrowhead's delightfully chaotic space-based shooter.</p>
<p>While further specifics on who Momoa will play in Helldivers remain unknown, it was confirmed the film will release next year, on 10th November.</p>
<p>The Helldivers film was initially announced back in January 2025, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">along with a Horizon Zero Dawn adaptation</a>. Soon after, Arrowhead's Johan Pilestedt confirmed the developer will be involved with the upcoming film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">but in a somewhat limited capacity</a>.</p>
<p>Lin's involvement was then confirmed in December. Some were disappointed to learn that Lin is not a gamer himself, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-announced-helldivers-movie-director-may-not-be-a-gamer-but-he-has-worked-on-multiple-fast-furious-films">the director actually used this to his advantage when pitching his take for the film</a>. Arrowhead went on to show its support of Lin, stating it trusts the Helldivers film director, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-trust-justin-arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-helldivers-2-community-asking-for-film-director-to-play-the-game">shutting down any comments suggesting the director should at least try the game before taking on the adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>As for Momoa, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2026s-street-fighter-movie-gets-first-look-trailer-and-it-includes-a-great-reference-to-the-series-most-famous-bonus-stage">he is playing Blanka in Street Fighter</a>, which is set to release on 16th October.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait for Sony's Helldivers film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-largest-fan-film-premieres-today-and-even-arrowhead-is-waiting-to-watch">there is a fan made release available to watch now</a>. Created by volunteers at YouTube channel Plot Coalition, the film is almost an hour in length, making it longer than any other Helldivers fan project made to date.</p>

            <p>Just weeks after release, an unspecified number of Wildlight's Highguard development team has been laid off.</p>
<p>The studio's live-service hero shooter will not be shut down, Wildlight has confirmed to Eurogamer, but instead be given to a "core group of developers" to keep the game going.</p>

<p>In the statement shared with Eurogamer this morning, Wildlight wrote: "Today we made an incredibly difficult decision to part ways with a number of our team members while keeping a core group of developers to continue innovating on and supporting the game."</p>
<p>The Highguard studio added it is "proud of the team, talent, and the product" it had created. "We're also grateful for players who gave the game a shot, and those who continue to be a part of our community," Wildlight concluded.</p><p>While Wildlight did not say how many members were affected by today's layoffs, posts on the likes of LinkedIn suggest it was the majority of the team. "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">level designer Alex Graner wrote</a>. "This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard."</p>
<p>Tech artist Josh Sobel was also impacted by the Wildlight layoffs. "It was the best team I've ever worked with, and I've never put so much of myself into a project before," <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2021732021127852097">Sobel wrote</a>. "I wouldn't trade the past 2.5+ yrs for anything."</p>
<p>In a follow up post, Sobel said they had "LOVED working at Wildlight", and it is now "hard to envision going up from here", likening today's news to the end of a romantic relationship. "You can't think about dating right after a breakup. It wasn't just a gig to me. 2.5yrs of working towards a promising, rose-tinted future, with the most passionate and efficient devs on the planet. We fucking MADE THAT SHIT! Fast."</p>

<p>"I don't think gamers really understand just how special this group of talented devs was. There were stumbles, as any new team would face, but our ability to execute on goals and pivot at a moment's notice was unmatched. I am devastated that this team as a complete unit can no longer be," Sobel continued.</p><p>"We accomplished a lot, and I couldn't be more proud. But it's hard to believe it's over. Hard to believe that this was the result of all our efforts. I wish the best of luck to everyone who remains at Wildlight.</p>
<p>"If the numbers climb, I'll be the first in line to apply again."</p>
<p>"I join my incredible Wildlight teammates in having been laid off," Highguard's social and community lead <a href="https://x.com/alex_frostwolf/status/2021745874435813748">Alex Frostwolf also shared</a>. "Highguard is the story of us: a group of talented, like-minded folks on an adventure into the unknown. Much like our Wardens who get back up after losing a fight, we too will rise again for our next adventures."</p>

<p>Highguard was announced back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards</a>. Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this year</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Since its slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>
