The recent deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> details will have left Nintendo "really mad" and prompted time-consuming investigations into where information has leaked from.
</p>
<p>
That's according to former Nintendo employees Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang, who worked at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> for more than a decade and experienced the company's processes when leaks erupted previously.
</p>
<p>
"This really does have a disruptive impact in what the company's trying to do now, which is to announce and launch a new console - which is hard enough as it is," Yang said on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRh5csh7mI&amp;ab_channel=Kit%26Krysta">Kit &amp; Krysta</a> podcast.

</figure>
<p>
"[Nintendo]'s been disrupted daily, for months, with these leaks, and I'm 100 percent sure they are really mad, to the most severe level. We joke around but... they are very, very, very upset by this."
</p>
<p>
While leaks of information from Nintendo's manufacturing supply chain - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-what-does-the-switch-2-motherboard-leak-say-about-system-performance">such as the Switch 2 motherboard</a> - may be dealt with overseas, the duo discussed information they felt may have trickled out from within Nintendo itself, from the team working on the Switch 2 launch. And when this sort of leak happens, Nintendo always investigates internally.
</p>
<p>
"They do have very good people that investigate these things," Ellis said. "They will eventually get to the bottom of it, but it takes time and it takes a lot of just talking to everybody involved. 
</p>
<p>
"This is hard work, this is a lot of work and the people working on this - and it's not the whole company, it's a small group of people, at this point, who are allowed to know this information - need to focus all of their efforts onto [Switch 2].
</p><p>
"But now... half of their day is going to be eaten up by [questions like] 'I have to talk to you about every step you have taken at this point, who have you talked to, where do you think this could have happened?' And, quite frankly, that's time they don't have."
</p>
<p>
Yang said the pair had been through similar processes during their time at the company, and that teams "basically have another full-time job of being part of the investigation into these leaks". 
</p>
<p>
"It's extremely disruptive, it's a high-stress situation as well because you really feel like you're in the hot seat," Yang concluded.
</p>
<p>
Leaks also limit Nintendo's desire to grow the teams working on under-wraps products, Ellis added, so as to avoid leaks spreading further. This then meant more work, as product launches neared, on a smaller circle of people.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 has been widely-tipped for an imminent reveal, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">reports the console could be unveiled later today</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The expectation is that Nintendo will first show off its long-awaited Switch 2 successor via a brief introductory video focused on the console hardware itself, before a longer look at a later date showcasing Switch 2 games.

            <p>It has been many years since we last heard anything about a new Bloodborne game, despite there clearly being demand for one. And I am not just talking about a brand new game under the Bloodborne banner. There hasn't even been word of a remaster, despite several other PlayStation games such as The Last of Us and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review-the-upgrades-are-worthwhile">Horizon Zero Dawn receiving a console refresh in the last few years</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> and God of War (including sequel Ragnar√∂k) have also seen a PC release, following their time as a PlayStation exclusive. But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-wants-to-know-what-your-favourite-playstation-game-is-as-long-as-it-isnt-bloodborne">the same can not be said for poor old Bloodborne</a>, even though this is many a hunter's dream.</p>
<p>So, why is that? Well, former Sony Interactive Entertainment exec and PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida has a theory.</p>
<figure>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<figcaption>The Death of Console Exclusives Is Inevitable and I Don't Know How I Feel About It. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipoW24t90fw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes">Kinda Funny Games</a>, Yoshida was asked if we will ever see Bloodborne again, and with a nervous chuckle, Yoshida acknowledged this was a hot topic.</p>
<p>"Bloodborne is one of the most popular asks on my Twitter/X," he replied. "And the people wonder why we haven't really done anything... it should be easy, right?" He joked some fans have become "frustrated" by how many games PlayStation has remastered, and yet Bloodborne has not been one of them.</p><p>Yoshida then continued to state he thinks a very key factor in Bloodborne's lack of a remaster or similar comes down to one quite simple thing - the game's creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> is "so busy", it has just not been possible.</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it," Yoshida reasoned.</p>
<p>Yoshida therefore believes the PlayStation team is simply respecting Miyazaki's wish, and doing just that - not touching it.</p>
<p>Yoshida stressed again this was just his own personal theory as to why news regarding anything Bloodborne-flavoured has been non-existent, but it certainly seems a reasonable assumption. Miyazaki has, after all, been rather tied up with the phenomenon that is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and its DLC <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> in recent years.</p>

</figure>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Miyazaki spoke to Eurogamer about Bloodborne</a>, stating he was "very happy" to see so many passionate fans calling for a remake to happen.</p>
<p>"Put simply, it makes me very happy to see it's a title with a lot of specific memories, both for me and the staff who worked on it," he said. "And when we see those passionate voices in the community, of course it makes us feel thrilled, it makes us feel very fortunate to have that and to have those memories."</p>
<p>As for Yoshida, just yesterday it was revealed the former exec had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-lands-first-video-game-voice-role-in-promise-mascot-agency">landed his first voice acting job following his departure from PlayStation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Just weeks after publicly releasing the Liberty City Preservation Project - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - its developers have confirmed the project is being taken down following conversations with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Liberty City Preservation Project - which modding team World Travel has been working on since 2018 - generated significant interest when it launched earlier this month, giving GTA 5 players a chance to explore GTA 4 protagonist Niko Bellic's old stomping ground. It featured the entire Liberty City map -  complete with traffic, pedestrians, weather, and more - alongside improvements such as overhauled lighting, better textures, and new scenarios.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the mod's enthusiastic reception also set it on a collision course with Rockstar, and the Liberty City Preservation Project is now officially no more. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/">Insider Gaming</a>, lead modder nkjellman announced its end on Discord, writing, "Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation project."

<p>
"We appreciate all the support the project has received," nkjellman continued, "and we look forward to continuing to pursue our passion for modding the Grand Theft Auto series."
</p>
<p>
Nkjellman didn't specify what had drawn Rockstar's ire, but the studio has frowned on similar mods before. Back in 2017, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">called time on the 'Liberty City in GTA5' mod</a>, saying that while it "generally [would] not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties", it would not allow "use or importation of other IP", including its own. So it seems likely that's where the Liberty City Preservation Project has fallen foul of Rockstar's rules.
</p><p>
Perhaps notable, too, is the fact an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">official GTA 4 remaster</a> was reported to have been in the works back in 2022. At the time, the project was said to have been shelved due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">poor reception</a> of 2021's GTA: The Trilogy remasters - but the report also referenced a supposedly canned Red Dead Redemption remaster that did eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">show up in 2023</a>. It's possible Rockstar's rumoured GTA 4 remaster is also alive and well, which might have contributed to the Liberty City Preservation Project's swift slap-down. But regardless, 2025 is a massive year for the long-running series, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">currently expected to release this "autumn"</a>.

            <p>
As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> readies for the release of Season 2 on 28th January, developer Treyarch has shared initial details of Zombies mode's next map, The Tomb - which plunges players deep beneath the earth, down into ancient catacombs.
</p>
<p>
"As the rumours have it," Treyarch explains in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-115-day-announcement">post on the Call of Duty website</a>, "a British archeologist by the name of Sir Archibald Fotherington-Smythe conducted an excavation at the site back in 1908 with grand expectations. Although no one can say for sure what became of him, a handful of photographs from his doomed expedition have recently surfaced..."
</p>
<p>
Picking up after the events at Citadelle des Morts - Zombies mode's third Black Ops 6 map, introduced during Season 1 - The Tomb sees Weaver, Grey, Carver, and Maya following Gabriel Krafft's final words to a nearby excavation site as they continue their search for the Sentinel Artifact. From there, the only way is down - deep into long-undisturbed catacombs built on an ancient burial ground, and perhaps even deeper still.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Treyarch says The Tomb has been designed to offer a similar experience to Zombies mode's Liberty Falls map, featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability. It's also promising "plenty" of Easter Eggs, and a reimagined Wonder Weapon inspired by the series' past. More specific gameplay details will be shared closer to The Tomb's release - but in the meantime, the studio has revealed a number of other additions coming to Zombies mode in Season 2.
</p><p>
These include a much-requested co-op pause feature which, as its name suggests, enables a party leader to pause the game during play, provided all participants are in the same party. That's on top of loadout recovery for players who rejoin a session after being kicked while AFK, plus a range of Challenge Tracker and Near Completion improvements, and the ability to set up separate HUD presets for Zombies and multiplayer modes.
</p>
<p>
According to Treyarch, Black Ops 6 players have now amassed 480m hours in Zombies mode since its launch last October, with Directed Mode - introduced a month later - having helped raise the average Main Quest completion rate from 3.38 percent to 8.23 percent. "This still means over 90 percent of people who've played Zombies haven't completed a Main Quest yet, so our mission continues," it notes, "but we're proud of these initial results, and excited to welcome so many new players into the fold with this new feature. Onward and upward!"
