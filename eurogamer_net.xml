            <p>
Mega Man! It turns out Capcom hasn't forgotten about the blue robo-dude with the 'tude - last seen in his own mainline game seven years ago - after all. The publisher has unveiled a brand-new entry in its beloved action-platformer series, but you'll need to be patient as it's still a while away from release.
</p>
<p>
Mega Man: Dual Override, as Capcom's newly revealed instalment is officially known, takes a similar 2.5D approach to 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mega-man-11">Mega Man 11</a>, marrying the series' classic side-scrolling action to a 3D (and very pastel) artstyle. All this is coming to Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox, and Steam.
</p>
<p>
If you were hoping for any additional information, however, you're out of luck. Capcom's reveal offered a few seconds of presumably early in-game footage and little else. According to the tiny bit of text accompanying its trailer, though, it'll see players "override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers".

<p>
Mega Man's return is, of course, long overdue, and the main downside to all this is the wait. Mega Man: Dual Override isn't set to release for PC and consoles until 2027 - just in time for the series' 40th birthday.

            <p>The Game Awards 2025 have come and gone, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">Clair Obscur coming away with the coveted GOTY accolade</a>. But, among the awards at the awards show, there was also a very generous smattering of trailers and reveals. And rounding out those trailers and reveals as part of Geoff's big finale was Highguard.</p>
<p>Highguard is a shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of a number of ex-Respawn developers who worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. It sees players using blasters and such while also riding on the backs of spectral beasts, which I found quite jarring at first I won't lie. But, unlike quite a few things we saw this evening (morning), Highguard did come as a surprise!</p>
<p>"From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Steam page's official description</a>. "Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter."</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for Highguard below.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Neon Giant, Swedish developer of cyberpunk shooter-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>, has unveiled its new game No Law at The Game Awards 2025. The game is in development for PC, PS5 and Xbox S/X, and will be published by South Korean company Krafton. There's currently no release date.</p>
<p>No Law takes the action first-person, whereas The Ascent was quasi-isometric, and creates an experience which looks superficially like CD Projekt Red's blockbuster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. However, as I discovered talking to the team before the TGA reveal, No Law will be a more condensed kind of experience, and one made by a much smaller team - there are 24 people working on the game there.</p>
<p>"We focus a lot more on making something that feels more deep and dense and layered," studio co-founder Tor Frick told me in an interview, "instead of making it very big. So the actual physical footprint on a map for Port Desire, where this takes place, is pretty small by open-world standards. We don't really have any open fields; we don't even have big parking lots. It's not about going to that mountain over there, it's about: there's an open window up there, or that rooftop looks interesting. It's more about that kind of scale and that kind of exploration."</p>
<p>Vengeance is the aim in No Law. You play as a retired military veteran called Grey Harker, who's living a quiet life, a bit like Jon Wick, when trouble finds him again. And how you go about exacting that vengeance is up to you. "The narrative is nonlinear," Arcade Berg, another studio co-founder, with possibly the coolest name ever, told me. "We encourage you to figure out how you want to solve everything yourself, and we will make sure that the game responds to that - responds to how you choose to play, be that playstyle or certain decisions you make."</p><p>A large part of No Law will feel familiar to people who play immersive sims such as those made by Arkane, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>, although without the time-looping mechanic of course. "It can be fairly similar to a lot of these games that you're thinking about," Berg told me, "especially when it comes to the gameplay. I am an immersive sim fan - basically everyone in the studio is. If you want to play it that way, you should. The game will be great. That is one way to play the game." But, he added, there is also a story-led way to enjoy the game if you prefer a more linear shooter experience.</p>
<p>No Law will have dialogue choices and character ability customisation and development. There will also be varying ways you can approach combat, be it via stealth, hacking, or kicking the front door down and charging head-first in. "We will give the player all the tools," said Frick. "We will never tell you when to use them or not use them. It's completely up to the player how to tackle each scenario."</p>
<p>Neon Giant's previous game The Ascent was released in 2021 to middling reviews. "The Ascent's arcology setting is splendid, if heavily derivative - shame that all you can do here is gun and grind," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-ascent-review">wrote Edwin in Eurogamer's The Ascent review</a>.</p>

<p>One of those nominations was Charlie Cox as Best Performance, but he claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-charlie-cox-thrilled-by-game-awards-nomination-but-says-gustaves-mocap-actor-deserves-the-credit">mocap actor Maxence Cazorla deserved the credit instead</a>.</p>
