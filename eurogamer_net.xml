            <p>
Fireproof Games - the studio behind eerie puzzle box adventure The Room and its equally stellar sequels - has announced a launch date for its paranormal VR mystery Ghost Town. It's coming to Meta Quest on 24th April, with a PCVR/PSVR2 release due later this year.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town, if you're unfamiliar, whisks players back to 1983, where they'll take on the role of ghost hunter Edith Penrose. Edith runs a successful paranormal detective agency in London with her flatmate and, as Fireproof puts it, "she's almost up-to-date with her rent and the ghosts in her bathroom mirror have been less demanding than usual."
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Edith's world is turned upside down when her brother goes missing - and so begins a quest to locate his whereabouts, first taking her to a remote Scottish island in search of a gifted clairvoyant, and later through the supernatural underbelly of London.

<p>
All this unfolds across "large navigable environments" where players will interact with fully motion-captured characters, both alive and dead. "Explore a variety of atmospheric locations with a controller in each hand and a torch to light your way," Fireproof explains. "Use the dexterity of your hands to overcome tactile puzzles, cast spells and even summon troubled spirits to move them on to the next world."
</p>
<p>
Fireproof's The Room series was an absolute pleasure, blending cleverly tactile head scratchers with some deliciously sinister atmospherics - and the studio's most recent game, 2020's The Room VR: A Dark Matter, was a particular highlight. So I'm genuinely excited to see how Ghost Town plays out. And with a <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/ghost-town/9531494193591052/">24th April release on Meta Quest</a> now confirmed (and PSVR2/<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">PCVR</a> to follow), there isn't much longer to wait. Oh, and if you're looking for more goggle-based entertainment, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-world-of-assassination-gameplay-leads-flurry-of-vr-updates-and-reveals">everything announced in this week's VR Games Showcase</a>.

            <p>
It's been almost a year since Saber Interactive last shared an update on its long-in-the-works and reportedly troubled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> remake. But despite the ensuing radio silence, it's now insisting, "Everything that we have talked about is still in development."
</p>
<p>
A Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announced-for-ps5">first announced for PlayStation 5 and PC</a> back in 2021, with developer Aspyr at the helm. Since then, however, the project has been dogged by rumours of difficulties behind-the-scenes, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-in-serious-trouble-and-delayed-indefinitely">report in 2022 claiming it was "in serious trouble"</a> and "delayed indefinitely".
</p>
<p>
Shortly after that report, it was confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-aaa-project-has-switched-studios-following-report-of-kotor-trouble">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine developer Saber Interactive had taken over development duties</a>, but still nothing has been seen of the project since its initial unveiling. More <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-reportedly-not-in-active-development">reports of its apparent demise</a> surfaced in 2023 - although those were quickly rebuffed - and the project's future was called into question again last year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-to-sell-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-developer-saber">Saber Interactive split with parent company Embracer Group</a>.

<figcaption>Here's how the KOTOR remake was announced back in 2021.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p82vauAdgv8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Saber's most recent comments on KOTOR came last April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kotor-remake-alive-and-well-says-saber-interactive-ceo">company boss Matthew Karch insisted the remake was "alive and well"</a> - but with almost a year of radio silence now past since then, doubts have begun spreading through the fan community again. All of which brings us to the present, and Saber's latest tacit assurances the KOTOR remake remains in development.
</p>
<p>
Following this week's news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-already-in-the-works-and-its-promising-an-even-more-immersive-experience">Saber is now starting up development on Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 3</a>, studio chief creative officer Tim Willits <a href="https://x.com/TimWillits/status/1900374508113961250">took to social media to reassure fans</a> that it's other announced games remain unaffected. "Saber Interactive is one of the largest independent developers in the world," Willits wrote. "We are working on numerous games across many different genres. Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share."
</p>
<p>
That, then, bodes well for the ever-elusive KOTOR remake, but it's far from the only game previously confirmed to be in development at Saber. The studio is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-is-a-co-op-fps-with-80s-vibes-action-humour-and-horror">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-park-survival-will-revisit-locations-from-1993-film-but-also-introduce-new-ones">Jurassic Park Survival</a>, both scheduled to launch this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-turok-game">new Turok</a> and Avatar: The Last Airbender games also on the way.
</p>
<p>
And as for the newly announced Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 3, that sounds like it's still some considerable way out. The studio has said it still plans to support Space Marine 2 "in the coming years" while it continues work on its "even more immersive" sequel.
