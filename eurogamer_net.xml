        <p>Project recently 'failed internal review'.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> 4 developer Cloud Chamber is reportedly laying off an "unspecified" number of employees. The news comes as former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson joins as new studio head following claims of development "turmoil".
</p>
<p>
Word that BioShock 4's development had running into difficulties first emerged earlier this month when Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive">project had failed an internal review at 2K Games</a>, with particular criticism being levied at its narrative. Soon after, studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted and staff were warned the team needed to "become more agile and efficient", leading to concerns layoffs were imminent. And now Schreier <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwr7jxitg22z">reports</a> job cuts affecting an "unspecified number of staff" at Cloud Chamber have begun. 
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson has now been revealed as Cloud Chamber's new studio head. Fergusson most recently served as general manager of the Diablo franchise at Blizzard, having joined the company in February 2020, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-boss-rod-fergusson-leaves-blizzard">confirmed to be "stepping away" from his position</a> earlier this month. Notably, Fergusson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rod-fergusson-the-closer-who-helped-get-bioshock-infinite-out-the-door-is-leaving-irrational">played a key role in the release of the third BioShock title</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, joining Irrational Games to help the project over the finish line after its own difficult development.
</p>
<p>
Confirming his new role at Cloud Chamber <a href="https://x.com/RodFergusson/status/1957824815018213692">on social media</a>, Fergusson wrote, "Some of you guessed it, I'm returning to 2K to lead a series that means a lot to me as the new Head of the BioShock Franchise. I'll be heading up Cloud Chamber and overseeing development of the next BioShock game, along with franchise extensions like the in-development Netflix movie.
</p><p>
"While I'm excited to get started in the coming weeks, I recognise the studio restructuring is a difficult time for the team. I'm deeply grateful for the work done so far, and I'm committed to building a BioShock game we'll be proud of and that our players will love."
</p>
<p>
BioShock 4 was confirmed to be in development in 2019, with its release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-in-development-at-new-2k-studio-cloud-chamber">said to be "several" years away</a> at the time. 2K Games has, however, been attempting to get a sequel off the ground for over a decade - back in 2014, the publisher <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-2k-marin-now-responsible-for-bioshock-franchise">announced its now-defunct 2K Marin studio would be responsible for the future of BioShock</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-steps-away-from-bioshock-to-create-something-new">series creator Ken Levine departed Irrational Games</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-reveals-new-studio-ghost-story">found Ghost Story Games</a>. Little has been heard of the project since its shift to Cloud Chamber, but in 2021 it was reported BioShock 4 would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshocks-setting-and-time-period-detailed-in-new-report">take place in a fictional Antarctic city set sometime during the 1960s</a>, roughly concurrent with the events of BioShock 1 and 2.
</p>
<p>
As for Levine and Ghost Story Games, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">studio's next project, Judas</a>, is still without a release date - but it seems likely the BioShock-style shooter will emerge well before 2K's next official BioShock game.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> PC players are finally set to receive proper optimisation for the game's performance issues, but Capcom has stated it won't arrive until this winter. That's almost a year after the game was released.</p>
<p>"To our hunters playing #MHWilds on PC, we're committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game," said Capcom in a post on social media. "Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimisations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards."</p>
<p>The PC version of the game has been heavily criticised since the game's release for its poor performance, but waiting so long for improvements is ironic when the game has sold incredibly well and Capcom itself has noted how important the PC platform is. Will the improvements coming in winter be too little too late?</p>

<p>"Yeah, there are more players than ever playing on PC, including in Japan," said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-producer-acknowledges-importance-of-pc-platform-and-crossplay">producer Ryozo Tsujimoto back in February</a> ahead of the game's release, "so we definitely see room for the series to capture new players who haven't tried it before if that's their chosen platform." That's partly why Capcom released a PC benchmark tool too, to help satisfy PC players.</p><p>It's a sentiment mirrored across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has noted the importance of the PC platform</a>, teasing a release for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sees-game-sales-drop-but-multiplatform-strategy-continues-in-earnest">Square Enix is pursuing a multiplatform strategy</a> that's seen sales of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> boosted. And just look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">PC success for Shift Up's Stellar Blade</a>, which sold a million copies on Steam in just three days.</p> <div>

<p>So when Capcom released Monster Hunter Wilds across PC and console in February, it's no wonder sales skyrocketed after the success of both World and Rise. It became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">company's fastest-selling game</a>, with over 8m units sold in just three days. It even helped propel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-series-helps-capcom-achieve-12th-consecutive-year-of-increased-profit">Capcom to its 12th consecutive year of increased profit</a>. According to Capcom's recently updated <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html">Platinum Titles list</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 10.5m copies across all platforms and is the eighth best-selling Capcom game of all time.</p>
<p>And on PC the game got off to a spectacular start. On Steam, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak</a> before hitting over a million concurrent players. Shortly afterwards, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam hit a new player peak across the platform</a>. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5telk2p">Analyst Mat Piscatella</a> stated in March Monster Hunter Wilds was the best-selling game of February, with Steam accounting for over half the game's sales.</p>
<p>Yet quickly that success was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">marred by performance complaints</a>, specifically on PC. Capcom acknowledged these issues, but has failed so far to fully rectify them. Even now, the game sits with a mostly negative rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Sales and player counts have tumbled as a result. Last quarter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">Monster Hunter Wilds was outsold by Devil May Cry 5</a>, albeit through sales and its new anime series raising interest levels. Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477k copies, which was only just higher than the four-year-old <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. At the time of writing, the game has a Steam 24-hour peak of just under 46k - that's a 97 percent drop from its all-time peak of 1.38 million players. Concurrent players don't tell the whole picture of a game's success, but the drop here is monumental however you look at it.</p><p>Capcom has released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-finally-fixes-the-games-inexcusable-performance-woes-on-pc">multiple patches to address performance issues on PC</a>, but problems remain. What's more, the forthcoming patch doesn't appear to be all-encompassing as a "second stage of mitigation measures" will follow, suggesting this will be a major overhaul as issues run deep. If that's required to fix problems, it'll be worth the wait to get the game back on track.</p>
<p>But that long wait is a huge disappointment for players, with responses on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1mtq9f2/capcom_is_working_on_mh_wilds_pc_optimization/">reddit</a> ranging from apathy to frustration at how long it's taking.  As <a href="https://x.com/W33ab00Jones/status/1957534736441561510">one response</a> on social media reads: "You guys waited too long and lost me. Sorry, not sorry."</p>
<p>While the initial sales of Monster Hunter Wilds has proven the success of the series, its massive drop-off ever since just shows how quickly the audience has moved on. The lack of a comprehensive fix on PC is a core reason for this, but so is the endgame.</p>
<p>Capcom has today released a statement acknowledging the demand for increased replayability of endgame content. As such, Appraise Talismans will now be available in top level quests, allowing for deeper customisation. A new Melding Pot feature will also allow for unwanted Appraised Talismans to be used to create new items.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>🛡 Guild Report 23 🛡</p><p>The team has heard the requests regarding end-game content, and implemented improvements in Ver 1.021, released on August 13.</p><p>Request:<br>Increase replayability in endgame content.</p><p>Improvement:<br>You will now be able to obtain Appraised Talismans in 9★ quests… <a href="https://t.co/Krjt46PmsI">pic.twitter.com/Krjt46PmsI</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1957719118154477785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Still, the additional monsters and challenging hunts <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/letter-2508/">coming later this year</a> feel like minimal extras. Presumably, Monster Hunter Wilds will receive a major expansion just like Iceborne for World and Sunbreak for Rise. Typically these extend the lifespan of Monster Hunter games considerably, with extra story and more monsters to hunt. Until then, it's frustrating to see Capcom continue to stumble on a fundamental level.</p>
