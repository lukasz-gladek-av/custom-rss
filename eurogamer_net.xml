            <p>Gearbox's Borderlands 4 got its release date moved up yesterday, but this wasn't because of anything to do with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. Oh no, sir.</p>
<p>As announced yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Borderlands 4 will now release on 12th September</a>, which is just over a week earlier than originally planned. Many surmised this was a tactic to make sure that the launches of Borderlands 4 and GTA 6 - both franchises under the Take-Two umbrella - were spaced further apart.</p>
<p>However, this <em>honestly </em>isn't the case, so says Gearbox's Randy Pitchford.</p>

<p>According to the Gearbox head, this date shift is "100 percent" down to the studio's "confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates".</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966">Writing on social media</a>, Pitchford said: "Our decision is literally zero percent about any other product's actual or theoretical launch date."</p>
<p>So, that clears that up, then.</p>
<p>We will learn more about the next series entry later today, when PlayStation hosts its dedicated Borderlands 4 State of Play. Things are kicking off at 10pm UK time, and Eurogamer will of course cover the news as and when.</p>
<p>On its release, Borderlands 4 will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">Steam and the Epic Games Store at the same time</a>). It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">introduce four new Vault Hunters</a> on its release, alongside a new horde known as the Rippers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To celebrate its fourth anniversary, Housemarque has released a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch for sci-fi shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>.</p>
<p>The patch, out now, promises up to 2.5x the pixels on the more powerful console for a higher resolution experience. Presumably that's aiming for native 4K rather than the upscale solution employed on the base console, though that hasn't been specified.</p>
<p>It's unknown if the patch makes any other tweaks. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-returnals-pc-port-is-good-but-it-could-be-great">PC version of the game</a>, released in 2023, already boosts performance over PS5.</p>

<p>Returnal was released in 2021 and is generally considered one of the best and most unique games on Sony's PS5. The roguelite shooter sees protagonist Selene trapped in an endless cycle on a hostile, alien planet.</p>
<p>A year after its release, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-wins-big-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">won big at the 2022 BAFTA Game Awards</a>, winning the Best Game award and a performance award for Jane Perry.</p> <div>

<p>Following Returnal's release, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">Housemarque was acquired by Sony</a> as part of its PlayStation Studios first-party operation.</p>
<p>At Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play in February</a>, the developer revealed its next project: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">Saros</a>.</p>
<p>It's once again set on a "hostile, shape-shifting planet" and features British actor Rahul Kohli in the lead role. PS5 Pro enhancements for the new game have been promised, so this update to Returnal bodes well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
