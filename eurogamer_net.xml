            <p>
Dauntless and Fae Farm developer Phoenix Labs has announced another round of layoffs - its fourth since May 2023 - this time affecting the "majority" of staff at the studio.
</p>
<p>
Phoenix Labs enjoyed early success with its first game, free-to-play Monster-Hunter-like Dauntless, and the studio released its second title, Fae Farm, in 2023. However, the developer has faced multiple rounds of layoffs since its acquisition by blockchain company Forte Labs in 2023, starting with job cuts impacting 9 percent of its workforce in May that year. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-34-staff">further 34 layoffs followed seven months later</a>, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-projects-in-significant-restructure">additional 140 jobs being cut</a> last May. And, unfortunately for employees, layoffs have continued into 2025.
</p>
<p>"Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs," the developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phoenix-labs_activity-7289705935696969728-PaIL">wrote in a message posted to LinkedIn</a> on Monday. "We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations."

<p>
We recognise and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted," it continued. "Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games... To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals - they are some of the best in the business."
</p>
<p>
As for Dauntless and Fae Farm, the studio says it'll share more on their fate "in the coming weeks", but notes its current focus is on "supporting those affected through this transition."
</p>
<p>
Phoenix Labs' announcement follows a devastating 2024 for the games industry - in which around 13000 employees are believed to have lost their jobs - and continues a January dogged by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">further layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-weeks-into-2025-three-studios-are-already-closing-down">studio closures</a>. Ubisoft, for instance, announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">cutting 185 jobs</a> this week, while Jar of Sparks - the studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook - confirmed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">laid off "all" its team</a> earlier this month. Last year, Chris Dring shared his thoughts with Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">why these layoffs are happening</a>.

            <p>
In just eight days time, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> turns 25 - and EA is reportedly poised to re-release The Sims 1 &amp; 2 this week as part of the series' quarter-century celebrations. 
</p>
<p>
The Sims 1 &amp; 2 have, of course, long been unavailable in an official capacity, with the 25-year-old original never getting a digital release and its sequel's short-lived Ultimate Collection being yanked from Origin in 2018. That could be about to change, however. Kotaku, citing a "source familiar" with EA's plans, <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-1-2-remaster-pc-buy-ea-maxis-steam-1851748658">reports</a> re-releases of The Sims 1 &amp; 2 will launch on PC later this week, with all their original expansions included. It's "unclear" if a console release is also coming.
</p>
<p>
Lending further credence to Kotaku's report are the handful of conspicuous teases EA has been sharing to coincide with the start of The Sims' Nostalgia Now week, which runs from 27th-31st January. The series' official website, for instance, now <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims">features</a> a character from the original The Sims surrounded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a>'s radial menu.

<p>
Similarly, the publisher has <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1879218365430182064">posted</a> a short animation - accompanied by the phrase "BRB" - on social media. It features The Sims' iconic spinning Plumbob - initially surrounded by The Sims 2's radial menu, then superimposed on coloured squares reminiscent of The Sims 1's box art. 
</p><p>
Interestingly, the video then transitions to a scene resembling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>'s loading screen. Kotaku's report doesn't mention the series' third outing, but fans were slightly stunned earlier this month when, with zero explanation or fanfare, it received its first (still mysterious) update in 15 years. If this means EA has been quietly tinkering under the hood to implement some much-needed stability and compatibility fixes, there'll be a lot of happy Sims players.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say it could be an  exciting few days for The Sims fans, and that's before EA's big birthday blowout next week. Things kick off with a 25-hour livestream celebration of the series next Tuesday, 4th April, coinciding with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">release a "huge" free 25th anniversary update for The Sims 4</a>, adding 70+ new items, a new limited-time event, and more.
