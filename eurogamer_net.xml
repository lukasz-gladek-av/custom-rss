            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has responded to Sony's Horizon lawsuit, claiming its action adventure game Light of Motiram uses "time-honoured" genre tropes.</p>
<p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a> claiming its newly-revealed game was a "slavish clone" of the Horizon games, owing to its red-headed heroine, post-apocalyptic world, and robotic enemies.</p>
<p>Tencent has now filed its response in a motion to dismiss, stating Sony "seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions" (thanks <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">The GamePost</a>). It reads as something of an attack against Guerrilla's games, stating Sony's claims of Horizon's originality are "startling".</p>

<p>"Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies - and ten unnamed defendants - about the unreleased video game Light of Motiram, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony's game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and its spinoffs," said Tencent.</p>
<p>"At bottom, Sony's effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain."</p>
<p>Sony previously claimed Horizon Zero Dawn was "like no fictional world created before [or] since". In response, Tencent claimed this is "flatly contradicted" by Guerrilla itself, pointing to a behind-the-scenes documentary where art director Jan-Bart Van Beek admitted the game's central premise has been done before - specifically in 2013 game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.</p>
<p>"That claim is startling, because it is flatly contradicted by Sonyâ€™s own developers, not to mention the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolise through this lawsuit," said Tencent.</p>
<p>"Sony's Complaint tellingly ignores these facts. Instead, it tries to transform ubiquitous genre ingredients into proprietary assets."</p>
<p>It continued: "By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honoured tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon - like Enslaved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, Far Cry: Primal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-new-dawn">Far Cry: New Dawn</a>, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more - Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Tencent's response also addressed a meeting at GDC in March 2024 where Tencent representatives pitched a licensed Horizon mobile game that Sony ultimately turned down. The Chinese company stated no executives or employees were at the meeting, so nothing at the meeting "is alleged to be an act of copyright or trademark infringement".</p>
<p>What's more, Tencent has claimed Sony is attempting to sue the wrong company, so wants the case thrown out on legal grounds.</p>
<p>While Sony's lawsuit is against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., and Tencent Holdings, Light of Motiram - according to Tencent's response - is being developed and published by Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios, a developer operating under Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd, and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd, a company in Singapore "doing business as '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent-games">Tencent Games</a>' and/or 'Level Infinite'".</p><p>"None of the served defendants develop and market the Light of Motiram video game that Sony alleges infringes its intellectual property in the Horizon franchise," said Tencent. It stated Tencent Holdings Ltd. is simply a parent company and has no involvement in Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>"Sony's threadbare, conclusory allegations improperly lump these Defendants together with the foreign companies alleged to be responsible for the core conduct at issue. Sony's vague allegations against 'Tencent' or 'Defendants' generally cannot substantiate the claims it brings against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., or Tencent Holdings specifically."</p>
<p>Lastly, Light of Motiram won't release until the end of 2027, meaning Sony's lawsuit is built on what the game "might" look like before it's even out, said Tencent.</p>
<p>Still, shortly after Sony began suing Tencent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">Light of Motiram's Steam page was quietly altered</a> to remove, edit, and/or replace key art, as well as rewrite the description.</p>

            <p>
Two Namco classic Game Boy Advance games are joining the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue.
</p>
<p>
First up is Mr. Driller 2, the iconic puzzle game that started life as an arcade game before being ported to the GBA for the Japanese launch. It was later released worldwide, and was previously re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console.
</p>
<p>
The second is Klonoa: Empire of Dreams, a 2D platformer spin-off of the console games that began on the PS1. By comparison, it has more puzzle-like gameplay and introduced a new realm to the ongoing series.

<p>
Both games will be available from 25th September for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers with the Expansion Pack.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Nintendo added an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-switch-nintendo-classics-app-just-got-a-cool-hidden-game-boy-advance-easter-egg">Easter egg to the Game Boy Advance app</a>, which adds the classic bootup sequence if you twiddle the analogue stick.
</p>
<p>
And at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-nintendos-latest-direct">last week's Nintendo Direct</a>, the company announced Virtual Boy games will be coming to Switch Online too, along with a dedicated accessory to play them in 3D - it comes in both plastic and cardboard varieties.

            <p>Dark Math Games, a new studio of former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> developers, have announced a change to their forthcoming debut project, which will now be a third-person RPG.</p>
<p>The studio is one of many that have risen from the shattering of Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">years of legal threats</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">accusations of toxic behaviour</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>While ZA/UM still exists and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zero-parades-is-the-next-game-by-disco-elysium-dev-zaum-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live">working on a new project</a>, other rival studios have formed to create their own spiritual successor to the isometric detective RPG.</p>

<p>Perhaps that's why Dark Math Games has now shifted perspective. Formerly XXXNightshift, the studio's forthcoming project is now known as Tangerine Antarctic and will be a third-person RPG instead of isometric.</p>
<p>"Set at the World's End ski village at Mount Hope, British Antarctica, Tangerine Antarctic is the name of the in-game hotel, designed by renowned Estonian architect Kaur StÅ‘Å‘r, where most of the games' action takes place," explained Timo Albert, founder and art director of Dark Math Games (formerly at ZA/UM).</p>
<p>"This is where you are stuck because of the blizzard and must solve the mysterious murders. And Tangerine Antarctic is one of the important characters of this true detective's RPG."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">Dark Math Games first revealed its formation and project in October</a> last year. Simultaneously, other former developers announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">formation of their studio Longdue</a>, while others still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">announced Summer Eternal</a>.</p>
<p>There's plenty of rivalry going on, then, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-staff-say-rival-projects-from-former-colleagues-are-friendly-competition">ZA/UM told Eurogamer earlier this year it's all "friendly competition"</a>.</p>
<p>"For us, always we think it's friendly competition," said principal writer Siim (Kosmos) SinamÃ¤e. "We're not going to really think about what the other writers are doing, or the studios... how can I be better at my own craft? We're competing essentially against ourselves in this way of can we take it further? Do we have to make any compromises? I think it absolutely sets us apart."</p>
