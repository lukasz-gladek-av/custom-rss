            <p>Fairgames has reportedly been delayed as Haven Studios founder Jade Raymond has departed the studio.</p>
<p>The live-service shooter, published by Sony, is still in development, but a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> has confirmed Raymond's departure, although a reason hasn't been given.</p>
<p>The report also states an external test of the game took place recently, but some developers were concerned about how Fairgames will be received. The game has reportedly now been delayed from this autumn to spring 2026 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">just like GTA 6</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-shooter-fairgame-has-been-delayed-to-next-year-insider-suggests">Rumours of Fairgames' delay</a> into next year emerged back in February. The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jade-raymonds-studio-haven-announces-heist-shooter-fairgame">first announced in May 2023 at the PlayStation Showcase</a>, but little has been seen of the game since.</p>
<p>Raymond previously saw success at Ubisoft as producer of Assassin's Creed and executive producer of Assassin's Creed 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-bloodlines">Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a>. She then left the company to found EA's Motive Studio in 2015, and then moved to Google Stadia in 2018.</p>
<p>When Google closed its internal game studios in 2021, Raymond launched Haven Studios as one of five co-founders. In 2022 Sony acquired the studio.</p>
<p>Raymond's departure from Haven means this will be at least the third game in a row she's worked on but not shipped.</p>
<p>"Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios," a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg. "We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added PlayStation is "committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey". New co-studio heads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski will take Raymond's place.</p>
<p>The news of Raymond's departure and the delay to Fairgames is yet another hit to Sony's live-service output. Despite the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> last year, which became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">Sony's plan for releasing over 10 new live service games</a> is rapidly failing.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Concord shut down</a> after just two weeks and Firewalk Studio was closed as a result. Then, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Sony cancelled two further live-service games</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and Bluepoint.</p>
<p>Next from Sony will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Bungie's Marathon</a>, the studio's first new game since being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquired by Sony in 2022 for $3.6bn</a>. It's set for release on 23rd September this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Hey everyone,
</p>
<p>
15 years ago, I went for a job interview at a small office in Brighton and quickly discovered I was the only one wearing a suit. After years running a Nintendo fansite, I was keen to join a larger team and learn from the very best in the business, whose footsteps I hoped to follow.
</p>
<p>
My first job on Eurogamer was one that no longer exists - it largely involved returning preview discs at the local post office - and I distinctly remember then-Eurogamer editor Tom Bramwell reminding me during my interview that I wouldn't actually be writing on the website. I nodded along, and thought, well, let's see.
</p>
<p>
I've always believed in, and will always be proud of, Eurogamer's mission and place in the increasingly-turbulent world of video games - one that has held fast due to its firm foundations of trustworthy reporting, definitive reviews, and quality critical opinion. It's these values which drew me to Eurogamer back then, and which I know will continue long after I log off for a final time today.
</p>
<p>
It has been the honour of a lifetime to serve as Eurogamer's Editor-in-Chief <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hello-from-eurogamers-new-editor-in-chief">for the last two years</a> and carry this mission forward - in particular, to lead the site through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-25">its 25th anniversary</a>, where the affection and respect for what our team does was felt from readers and the wider industry alike.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
15 years leaves me with too many people to thank, and too many wonderful colleagues past and present to highlight across Eurogamer's editorial teams, video team, tech team, sales, HR, management and everyone else that running a website requires just to get words on a page. I am phenomenally grateful to everyone I have worked with for their insight, patience, and for believing in what we do - and for letting me fill this site with oranges, Birdos and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
All of that said, please do let me specifically thank three people from over the years: Tom Bramwell for giving me that job and giving in to me writing on the website sooner than I'd expected, Wesley Yin-Poole for his continued belief and guidance, and lastly to Bertie Purchese - Eurogamer's longest-serving staff member - for those days working by the broom cupboard, and for being the heart of Eurogamer ever since.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future, it's now my turn to pass the baton on. While I am headed elsewhere in the world of games journalism, I shall always continue to be a Eurogamer fan. I'm excited to see what the team does next in the safe hands of Tom Orry, with whom I leave the site knowing he understands the mission and how to ensure its success in the years to come. Look out for more from him very soon.
</p>
<p>
Until then, and for one last time from me, thank you so much for reading. 
</p>
<p>
Tom

        <p>"And I supported... that approach."</p>

            <p>
Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has talked a little more about the publisher's recent decision to delay the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> into May next year, saying the game was pushed back to ensure developer Rockstar could 'achieve its creative vision with no limitations'.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6's release was narrowed down to "fall" 2025 last May, and Take-Two was still <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">publicly sticking to that target as recently as February</a> this year, despite persistent rumblings of a delay. However, all things changed earlier this month when Rockstar announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">shifting GTA 6's release to 26th May next year</a>, saying it needed "this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."
</p>
<p>
A few weeks on and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has now shared his own perspective on the delay decision. "As we get closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations">told IGN</a>, "the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear. In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach."

<p>
"And while of course, delays pain me - how could they not?," Zelnick added, "the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection." As to the possibility of a further delay for Grand Theft Auto 6, Zelnick implied that was unlikely to happen when asked. "I think historically when we set a specific date," he noted, "generally speaking, we've been very good about reaching it."
</p>
<p>
While GTA 6's delay is perhaps not the absolute ideal for Take-Two, the company still has a busy release slate heading into the new financial year, with the likes of Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, and new NBA 2K and WWE 2K instalments on the way. Fans, meanwhile, have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">new trailer to pore over</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-trailer-2-analysed">there's a lot packed in there</a>.
