            <p>Some neat news for mobile gamers, with both Enter the Gungeon and Exit the Gungeon arriving on mobile devices (Android and iOS) today. For those not in the know, Enter the Gungeon is a bullet-hell dungeon crawler rougelike, originally released back in 2016. The spin-off, Exit the Dungeon, is more of a dungeon climbing game, and first hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> back in September 2019.</p>

<li>Even the odds by joining forces with other Gungeoneers, even if they aren’t in the same room as you, with the long-requested addition of online co-op multiplayer</li>
<li>A brand new playable character: The Lamb! Take on the Gungeon as Cult of the Lamb’s fleecy hero, with new abilities inspired by the hit cult simulator</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is back for its second weekend beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dice-announces-battlefield-6-open-beta-week-2-playlist-options-and-changes">coming with new game modes to mess around with</a>. Unfortunately, it's also bringing along some substantial matchmaking issues for a significant chunk of the playerbase across PC and console.</p>
<p>First reported by users online via social media and Reddit, complaints started dropping in minutes following the second weekend beta going live earlier today. Issues such as an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpxp9e/not_able_to_load_into_game_with_party_member/">inability to load into the game with party members</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpwudj/battlefield_6_cant_queue_newsletter_stuck/">being unable to queue into matches once the game is booted</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpvyy0/battlefield_6_beta_2_keeps_crashing/">consistent crashing</a> for those <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpwkfc/help_i_keep_crashing_2_min_after_logging_in/">who avoided such issues</a> in the first weekend beta. Matchmaking problems appear to be multifaceted and relatively common.</p>
<p>As for official statements on the matter, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mputdc/bfcomms_ongoing_matchmaking_issues_1408/">a post from the official Battlefield Reddit account</a> stated the Battlefield 6 team is aware of ongoing matchmaking issues and a fix is in the works. In the meantime, they recommend players check to see if they have the most recent EA client update.</p>

<p>The same Battlefield account would also address an issue with DLSS / DLAA, which is currently not working in the Battlefield beta. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpuak3/comment/n8mg54u/?context=3">They stated</a>: "The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS / DLAA active once again within the Battlefield Open Beta. We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly."</p><p>The game has already struck players with a few technical quirks. For one, the game requires <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bios-shock-getting-past-battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-error-was-the-faffiest-thing-a-pc-game-has-ever-required-of-me">Secure Boot which has led folks to dive into their BIOS</a> in order to play on PC. This is needed for the game's anti-cheat, which has also started clashing with<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-cant-play-battlefield-6-and-valorant-at-the-same-time-heres-why"> Riot Games' own kernel-level anti-cheat while both games are present on your computer</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the betas have proven exceptionally successful for EA, as an eyewatering number of people dive in to check the game out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">EA stated it was the series' biggest open beta ever</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year">with industry figures predicting it will stomp Call of Duty this year</a>. The anti-cheat we mentioned earlier has also been hard at work banning folks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls">with over 330,000 cheaters banned during the first beta period</a>.</p>
<p>Here's hoping the current matchmaking issues are fixed soon, so the second wave of Battlefield-heads can hop in without inconvenience.</p>

            <p>We all wanted a Jurassic Park game that was closely tied to the original movie and also leant on the survival-action elements that make sense for a video game. We are getting that in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park: Survival</a>, but we're still waiting to see it in proper action. Today, Saber Interactive has at least given us a look at how the game is being made in collaboration with NBCUniversal, and included a smattering of pre-alpha gameplay.</p>

<p>The game will give players a fully recreated Isla Nublar to explore, with the action taking place directly after the events of the original (and best) film. Rather than stepping into the shoes of one of the movie's main characters, Jurassic Park: Survival focuses on Dr. Maya Joshi (played by Payal Mistry), an InGen scientist who was left behind on Isla Nublar.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>About Jurassic Park: Survival</strong></p>
<p>Players will experience an intense mix of first-person stealth and action gameplay in thrilling encounters with the island's unique dinosaurs, brought to life with special attention to capturing their authentic look, movement, and behavior from the film.</p>
<p><strong>Key Game Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explore Isla Nublar – Venture through a fully realized Isla Nublar filled with reactive wildlife, dinosaurs, and other surprising threats. From the iconic towering park gates to the Visitor Center and beyond, Jurassic Park comes alive like never before.</li>
<li>Evade Prehistoric Predators – Outsmart, escape, and engage with the film’s iconic dinosaurs. Use distraction, stealth, and ingenuity to overcome intense and unforgettable encounters against some of the deadliest creatures to ever walk the earth.</li>
<li>Survive the Island – Players will be challenged to navigate the park's many varied locations and dangers. Use all the resources at your disposal and find intelligent solutions to endure the wide range of threats lurking on Isla Nublar.</li>
