            <p>
There's a lot of buzz around Inzoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton - partly because it's a promising new contender in a genre that's so far been dominated by a single series, and partly because it's a bit of a looker. And if you were wondering exactly what sort of PC you'll be needing in order to crank Inzoi up to the max, those details have now been revealed - alongside a video showing how the game'll look at different tiers.
</p>
<p>
Inzoi (or InZOI as Krafton would have it) is described as "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will". It promises to give players the tools to "alter any aspect of their world to create unique stories and experiences", alongside the likes of jobs and "deep relationships through interactions". It's also leaning hard on the customisation side of things, showcasing remarkably detailed characters and elaborate homes.
</p>
<p>
Inevitably, its Unreal Engine 5 powered reality - which takes a far more photorealistic approach compared to something like The Sims - isn't going to run on any old potato. And Krafton has now revealed exactly what hardware players will need to have stuffed inside their gaming PCs if they want to play Inzoi at either Minimum, Medium, Recommended, or High settings without risking the chance of a weird small and/or small house fire.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
In fact, Krafton's gone a little further than that, <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8303">providing eight different preset options</a> giving players an easy way to choose between better graphics or better performance across its four hardware requirement tiers. Even more handily, all this is accompanied by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFzk45yOjkY">video demonstrating the impact these various setting will have on the game</a>. And while the differences are certainly evident, Inzoi still looks to put on a decent show on lower-end hardware.

Inzoi initially comes to PC as an early access release - it'll be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">available on Steam from 28th March</a> - and Krafton says it'll "continue working on optimisations to improve performance while finding ways to lower system requirements without compromising overall quality." 
</p>
<p>
"Our team is committed to enhancing the Inzoi experience for creators," it concludes. "We truly appreciate your patience and continued support, and we look forward to seeing you in early access."

If you're <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a> fan then the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMejSEspaog">latest Humble Games Showcase</a> might just be for you, with its tease of a brand-new airborne on-rails shooter from Star Fox veteran Giles Goddard. But there's more where that came from, including weather-controlling corgis and the re-emergence of long-gestating heist sequel Monaco 2. Intrigued? Then read on for the full rundown.

And here we are: the new game from Giles Goddard - programmer on the likes Star Fox, Stunt Race FX, and 1080Â° Snowboarding - and Japanse studio Chuhai Labs. Wild Blue might not be Star Fox <em>exactly</em> - it's set closer to earth than the depths of space - but the inspiration is clear. It sees a plucky band of animal pilots - Bowie Stray and the Blue Bombers - soaring through the skies on a mission to save the world from the evil Baron. It promises on-rails adventuring and daring dogfights over oceans, deserts, and more, with talk of boss battles, branching paths, and even a mysterious rival squad. If that appeals, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1921490/Wild_Blue/">wishlist Wild Blue on Steam</a>.

<p>
We're hardly wanting for farm-based village life sims these days, but Towns of Zoz from Studio Pixanoh looks to have a few tricks up its sleeve. For starters, it's got a cookery focus as players take on the role of Ito, returning to his parents' farm to run the family restaurant. There's a magical calamity afoot, and players will need to combine their combat skills and cooking creativity to save the town and its locals. Throw in local co-op and an attractive art style, and this one shows promise. Towns of Zoz doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1748110/Town_of_Zoz/">confirmed for PC</a>.

<p>
You'd be entirely forgiven if Monaco 2's existence had slipped your mind. This sequel to developer Pocketwatch Games' acclaimed 2013 heist caper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monaco-whats-yours-is-mine">Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine</a> was first announced almost exactly three years ago - although the studio has been regularly providing updates on its progress since then. The big change this time is the shift to 3D, with Monaco 2's procedurally generated isometric levels enabling a greater focus on verticality as players formulate then execute their stealthy plans. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC in April and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3366190/Monaco_2_Demo/">demo's available on Steam</a>.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/surgeon-simulator">Surgeon Simulator</a> developer Bossa Studios' Lost Skies is an open-world PvE survival adventure in which up to 6 players can explore a world of airborne islands using their grapple hooks and fully customisable airships - and if that sounds familiar, yes, it owes a lot to the studio's earlier multiplayer sandbox game, Worlds Adrift, which shut down in 2019. Since Lost Skies' announcement back in 2023, Bossa has shared regular updates and even a few demos - and it's now emerged again with a new trailer ahead of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/">its PC release</a> later this year.

I think we can all agree there aren't nearly enough colourful 3D platformers these days, and I think we can all agree <em>even more fervently</em> there aren't nearly enough musical ones. But here comes developer Giddy Goat Games' Billie Bust Up, in which a headstrong goat (that'll be Billie), his fox pal Oscar, and their axolotl mentor Aristotle all team up to traverse a fantasy kingdom of feline smugglers, sentient puppets, and grinning ghosts. It promises all the prerequisite jumping you'd expect from the genre, but it's also a rhythm platformer, meaning timing is key as players bop along to music by Emmy nominated composer Daniel Ingram. There's no release date for Billie Bust Up yet, but it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1400830/Billie_Bust_Up/">confirmed for PC</a>.

Another one first unveiled back in 2023, developer Stormy Nights' Breeze in the Clouds is a cheery 2D brawler starring a weather-controlling corgi named Breeze. As players venture across the weather-inspired biomes of Tropolis in search of a way home, they find themselves embroiled in a nefarious pollution plot that'll see them taking on animal enemies and bosses using fisticuffs and elemental powers. Stormy Nights is also promising an eclectic soundtrack featuring the likes of jazz, new jack, swing, and samba - which could be a treat if the trailer's any indication. Breeze in the Clouds is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1823210/Breeze_in_the_Clouds/">due to launch on PC</a> later this year.

And finally for the upcomers, it's Riyo Games' Threads of Time - a 2.5D RPG inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. Its turn-based, time-travelling yarn begins with battles against dinosaurs before whisking players back and forth to encounter everything from a  fantastical past of airships and magical creatures to a dystopian cyberpunk city and an apocalyptic future. It's coming to Xbox and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2090210/Threads_of_Time/">Steam</a> at some later point, and there's a new trailer above.
