            <p>Ubisoft has responded to a lawsuit over the shutdown of its racing game The Crew, stating players purchased a "limited license to access the game" as opposed to "unfettered ownership".</p>
<p>The game was taken offline in March last year, becoming unplayable due to its online requirements. Despite being 10 years old and essentially replaced by a successor, the decision sparked concern over both consumer rights and game preservation.</p>
<p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sued-over-controversial-the-crew-shutdown">fans filed a lawsuit in California against Ubisoft</a>, stating players were unaware they owned only a licence to the game. Ubisoft responded in February, in a filing seen by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/555469/ubisoft-holds-firm-in-the-crew-lawsuit-you-dont-own-your-video-games">Polygon</a>, to dismiss the case.</p>

<p>The filing, from Ubisoft's lawyers, states the company "allegedly misled purchasers of its video game The Crew into believing they were purchasing unfettered ownership rights in the game, rather than a limited license to access the game".</p>
<p>"But the reality is that consumers received the benefit of their bargain and were explicitly notified, at the time of purchase, that they were purchasing a license," it reads.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's lawyers claim plaintiffs have applied a "kitchen sink approach on behalf of a putative class of nationwide customers" and alleged eight causes of action including false advertising and unfair competition. In response, they believe there has been no real "cognisable injury".</p>
<p>Plaintiffs then responded in March with an amended complaint and an additional accusation around gift certificates. Sales of the game's currency, they argued, could be considered a gift certificate and in California, gift certificates can't expire - yet with the game shut down, the in-game currency has expired.</p>
<p>Further, photos of the packaging from the plaintiffs reveal the activation code for the game doesn't expire until 2099, which they claim is how Ubisoft "implied that [The Crew] would remain playable during this time and long thereafter". As such, they believe the statute of limitations has not expired.</p>
<p>Ubisoft now has until 29th April to respond once again.</p>
<p>After shutting down the game's servers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft retroactively added offline modes to other games in the series</a>.</p>
<p>One group of modders, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">recreated the server-side software needed to play The Crew online once again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Behold, your irregular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> funding update is here, with the news Cloud Imperium Games' controversial space sim has now raised over $800m - despite there still being no hint of a version 1.0 release date some 12 years after its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cig/star-citizen">original Kickstarter campaign</a>.
</p>
<p>
Star Citizen's previous major milestone arrived last May, when <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals">Cloud Imperium's funding tracker</a> - which aggregates money raised from likes of paid alpha access and those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizens-latest-dlc-pack-costs-over-45000">eye-wateringly expensive ship packs</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">ticked over the $700m mark</a>. That does, of course, mean the game - as far as it can currently be described as such - has raised a further $100m in just 11 months.
</p>
<p>
All this and there's still no sign of a 1.0 release date for Star Citizen, although its paid public alpha continues to evolve with regular updates. The space sim, you might recall, was originally targeting a 2014 launch, but sailed right past that (and just kept going) as Cloud Imperium Games' plans grew ever-more ambitious and the project fell into a vortex of feature creep.

<p>
The closest Cloud Imperium has come to suggesting an end is in sight in recent times came last March when CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-is-finally-pushing-towards-the-finish-line">wrote that the "team [was] hard at work, heads down, driving towards the finish line."</a> But while the massively multiplayer, persistent universe portion of Star Citizen is potentially still some significant way off, its story driven, single-player spin-off - known as Squadron 42 - is supposedly much closer on the horizon.
</p>
<p>
Cloud Imperium last year said it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-spin-off-squadron-42-will-release-in-2026-heres-an-hour-long-gameplay-teaser">targeting a 2026 launch for Squadron 42</a>, whose <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-hires-hefty-hollywood-cast-for-squadron-42">star-studded cast</a> includes the likes of Gary Oldan, Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, and Andy Serkis. But given the number of times the project has already slipped back (it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/11-years-later-star-citizen-dev-says-squadron-42-is-feature-complete">described as "feature complete" in 2023</a>), it remains to be seen whether that 2026 release window holds true.
