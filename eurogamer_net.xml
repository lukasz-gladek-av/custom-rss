            <p>EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union have issued a statement against the proposed private acquisition of the company, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">acquisition of EA by a group of private investors</a> was announced at the end of September. The deal, for $55bn, includes investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, the company of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, there's been plenty of speculation around the future of EA and its multiple owned studios, split between EA Sports and EA Entertainment. Now, members of the United Videogame Workers union and the CWA have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">issued a formal response</a> alongside a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">petition for regulators to scrutinise the deal</a>.</p>
<p>"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world."</p>
<p>This success has been driven by company workers, the union stated. "Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardised as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed."</p>
<p>Citing the number of layoffs across the industry since 2022, workers fear for "the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p>
<p>"If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets - not to strengthen the company," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," it continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinise this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."</p>
<p>As such, workers have launched a petition in a "fight to make video games better for workers and players - not billionaires".</p>
<p>The statement concludes: "The value of video games is in their workers. As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted the Federal Trade Commission following news of the proposed acquisition of EA, but it refused to comment "on pending mergers or acquisitions".</p>
<p>A report from The Financial Times suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">deal won't face much opposition</a>. As one source said: "What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition</a>. "We have found that the public investment fund has contributed to, and is responsible for, human rights abuses," said researcher Joey Shea on the involvement of Saudi Arabia's government. "This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We've found it's been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country.</p><p>"We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country's human rights abuses [...] MBS himself wields enormous power over what is effectively public funds, and he wields this power in a highly arbitrary and personalised manner, rather than the benefit of the Saudi people more broadly. Effectively, Saudi Arabia's vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is controlled by one person, which isn't good for human rights, or business either."</p>

            <p>
It's still a little hard to believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> is a thing that exists and is finally here - but here it most definitely is, and developer Team Cherry continues to finesse the experience, with its fourth patch now officially in public beta.
</p>
<p>
Chief among Patch 4's additions is what Team Cherry is calling a "basic implementation" of Silksong's new Simplified Chinese translation - the first step in its efforts to remedy the original translation, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-being-review-bombed-in-china">heavily criticised in a wave of negative Steam reviews</a> back in September.
</p>
<p>
That arrives alongside localisation improvements across a range of languages, further improvements to controller support, and various fixes for a number of highly specific scenarios. Which is to say, you're out of luck if you were hoping Team Cherry might finally look upon you - and your struggles against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-picking-it-up-a-lot-faster-hollow-knight-newcomers-and-veterans-respond-to-the-first-few-hours-of-silksong">Silksong's sometimes punishing difficulty</a> - with benevolent eyes.

<p>
Silksong's public beta patch is available on Steam by selecting Properties &gt; Betas, then opting into the public-beta branch under Beta Participation. Patch notes are below, but Team Cherry says development remains "very much in progress", so expect more fixes ahead of its final release to all players:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Simplified Chinese translation with a new script for public testing. This is a basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback.</li>
<li>Various localisation fixes implemented across all languages.</li>
<li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support. This includes rumble features now working for various controllers, and additional controllers being recognised. Some issues may remain. For a full list of supported controllers and features, please visit: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.14/manual/SupportedDevices.html </li>
<li>Fixed Styx not giving rosaries when delivering the Queen's Egg.</li>
<li>Fixed Druid's Eyes sometimes not equipping correctly when first acquired.</li>
<li>Fixed some down attack colliders getting stuck on in rare instances.</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of Hornet's plasmified state clearing when not intended (eg Bellway travel).</li>
<li>Fixed issues entering the plasmified state when killing a Winged Lifeseed, rather than using the Plasmium Phial.</li>
<li>Reduced unintentionally long bind time when using Multibinder with the Shaman crest.</li>
<li>Updated Multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots, per community comments.</li>
<li>Various smaller tweaks and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to Silksong's upcoming fourth patch, Version 1.0.28891 received its full release earlier this week, primarily bringing improved controller support. PlayStation's DualSense Edge controllers are now compatible with Silksong, for instance, and Mac users can expect better compatibility across a range of controllers too. Additionally, the game now automatically pauses if your controller disconnects, meaning you're less likely to spiral into a pit of enraged despair if your batteries suddenly run out in the middle of a boss fight.
</p>
<p>
Full Version 1.0.28891 patch notes for Silksong - which Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">awarded five gleaming stars in our review</a> earlier this year - can be found below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Dualsense Edge controllers.</li>
<li>Improved support for various controllers on Mac.</li>
<li>Game now pauses when the controller disconnects.</li>
<li>Fixed various smaller controller issues (more fixes to come in future).</li>
<li>Fixed remaining instance of certain players getting stuck cursed while in the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw not reacting to Hunter down-stab.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of being able to air dash and double jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed several out of bounds situations.</li>
<li>Fixed Pharlid Divers sometimes sliding on roofs after ambushing in certain scenes.</li>
<li>Fixed Eva Hunter Crest upgrades unintentionally clearing tool equips.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of Harpoon sometimes granting 2 Silk instead of 1.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies sometimes appearing from odd locations after scene transition and, in rare cases, having their active quantity reduced by 1.</li>
<li>Fixed Crafting Kits not increasing the damage of offensive blue tools (eg Sawtooth Circlet).</li>
<li>Slight increase to Sharp Dart and Cross Stitch damage.</li>
<li>Updated damage scaling on Rune Rage to match other Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Slight decrease to Thread Storm damage at higher needle levels.</li>
<li>Fixed Surgeon enemies sometimes pulling the hero out of bounds.</li>
<li>Fixed instances of some Spool Fragments being permanently missable if a player immediately quit after collecting the item.</li>
<li>Fixed Crust King Khann sometimes falling out of bounds during entry, when fought on low-end systems.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instance of Second Sentinel becoming rotated when defeated.</li>
<li>Fixed additional case of Seth sometimes getting out of bounds and not returning.</li>
<li>Fixed Seth sometimes remaining invincible for a moment at the start of a refight.</li>
<li>Fixed Vaults slide blocks incorrectly responding to damage sources other than the needle.</li>
<li>Changed Fine Pins wish drops from 50% chance to 100%, but raised required quantity.</li>
<li>Fixed issues when consuming a Silkeater while in water.</li>
<li>Fixed Scuttlebrace sometimes allowing a wall jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed a soft-lock during the Grand Gate opening sequence, if the Citadel had been visited and some bellshrines remained inactive.</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>

            <p>Sonic Rumble will finally be released next month, following a number of delays.</p>
<p>The mobile and PC party game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> maker Rovio was originally intended for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-rumble-segas-mobile-party-game-from-angry-birds-studio-delayed-into-spring">release last winter</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-mobile-party-game-sonic-rumble-lands-release-date">delayed until May</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/angry-birds-maker-and-sega-delay-sonic-rumble-release-once-again">delayed once more</a> without a launch date.</p>
<p>Now it's finally due in November and it's "seriously evolved" over the last few months following various playtests. "This extra development time allowed us to roll out several, player-focused updates that refined the core game from the ground up," the developer said in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000209/">new blog post</a>. "The goal? A super smooth, intense, and incredibly fun game right from the jump."</p>

<p>Specifically, Rovio has updated the game in three key areas.</p>
<p>Firstly, the core of the game has been made deeper and more dynamic with iconic skills, new stages, and new game modes. Secondly, the player onboarding journey has been revamped and the UI has been drastically improved.</p>
<p>Lastly, the cosmetic and character progression systems have been updated and simplified to ensure "every unlock feels meaningful and impactful". The rewards and shop systems have also been fine-tuned.</p>
<p>"These adjustments were key in making Sonic Rumble awesome for the long haul," said the developer. "Even as we get ready for launch, our commitment continues and there will be plenty more to come!"</p>
<p>While the blog post doesn't provide a specific date, the iOS App store lists 30th November as the expected release. It's available to <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/special/register/en/?referrer=singular_click_id%3D2aecdffa-3ac6-4708-b5e2-a8d8d0794317">pre-register now</a> and will be coming to iOS, Google Play, and Steam.</p>
<p>As the new trailer (above) shows, Sonic Rumble is a battle royale party game for up to 32 players online competing in minigames and platforming challenges for rings. Think <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> with a blue blur twist - I think it could be a lot of fun!</p>
<p>This will also be the first new game from Rovio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-buys-angry-birds-maker-rovio-for-625m">since it was acquired by Sega</a> back in 2023 for £625m.</p>
