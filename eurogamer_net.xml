            <p>Peak developer Aggro Crab has hit back at "friendslop" haters, insisting there's a place for co-op games that "deliver a specific experience", especially as they can be "very cost-effective for indie production".</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/peak-lead-knows-youre-a-friendslop-hater-but-remember-these-games-arent-trying-to-be-game-of-the-year-these-are-games-that-emphasize-teamwork/">GamesRadar+</a>, studio head Nick Kaman said that while these games may "forego traditional quality markers", some players just want to hang out with their friends and have fun – and that's what "friendslop games put [...] at the front and centre of the experience".</p>

<p>"There's backlash because sometimes these games forego traditional quality markers like polished graphics or story, but these games aren't trying to be Game of the Year, they focus on delivering a specific experience and that can make it very cost-effective for indie production," Kaman said.</p><p>While he acknowledges that "like with any hot genre, you get a lot of fast-follows and low-quality attempts flooding the storefronts", he reckons "it's mainly just fun to be a hater, especially when a term like 'friendslop' is so juicy".</p>
<p>"There's a real desire to connect and hang out in online worlds, and friendslop games put that at the front and centre of the experience," Kaman added. "These are games that emphasise teamwork and communication, as opposed to just testing your individual skill in a group setting."</p>
<p>Peak – which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds – is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p>
<p>It's been so successful, in fact, that it has spawned so many clones, the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smash-hit-co-op-climber-peak-sells-another-million-as-studio-outlines-future-update-plans">indie hit </a>would rather its community <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop">pirate its own game than play a "microtransaction-riddled" ripoff</a>.</p>

            <p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD Projekt, has acquired 100 percent ownership of GOG, the DRM-free digital games store.</p>
<p>Although GOG was co-founded by Kiciński in 2008 and was already part of CD Projekt via Sp.z.o.o., the acquisition sees Kiciński take full ownership, although he insists the game platform will continue to "operate independently, supporting gamers and developers through its DRM-free philosophy".</p>
<p>"The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever," the company said.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>GOG is entering a new chapter.</p><p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD PROJEKT and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p><p>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever.</p><p>Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library…</p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership. I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering - making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much," Kiciński said.</p><p>"As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026."</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, added: "With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move. For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it's going into very good hands - we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG's co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes."</p>
<p>As part of the deal, GOG has signed a distribution agreement with CD Projekt, including a plan to release all CD Projekt Red's upcoming games on GOG.</p>
<p>GOG is, of course, one of few digital distributors that permitted Santa Ragione's controversial horror, Horses, to go on sale. Following Valve and Epic Game Stores' decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-responds-with-additional-context-following-horses-steam-ban-controversy">ban developer Santa Ragione's narrative horror game Horses</a>, rival storefront GOG weighed in, saying it wanted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them-steam-rival-gog-weighs-in-amid-horses-ban-controversy">"to give players the freedom to choose what they play, and [give creators] the space to bring their artistic work to them</a>."</p><p>GOG also fights to preserve games. Announcing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">Preservation Program</a> in November last year, the company said it wants to maintain the compatibility of games with modern and future systems. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">GOG also joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects</a> (EFGAMP) as it continues to push for game preservation.</p>
