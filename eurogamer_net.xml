<p>A leaked set photo (below) has revealed Dinky the T-Rex will be popping up in Fallout's second season. For those unaware, Dinky the T-Rex is a roadside attraction found within Novac, a location in the Mojave Wasteland in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_Official_Game_Guide">Fallout: New Vegas Official Game Guide</a> has to say about Novac and our dinosaur pal:</p>
<p>"Novac is little more than a lonely desert highway motel with multiple buildings that have been fortified for the post-apocalyptic protection of its inhabitable. Watching over them is the landmark of the area: a giant fabricated Tyrannosaurus rex biting off the top of 'The World's 2nd Largest Thermometer'.</p><p>"The interior of 'Dinky' also serves as the city center (a converted gift shop from pre-war times, with a sniper's nest in Dinky's mouth). Dinky is the 'attraction' that drew in tourists. Some of the locals are friendly folk, though most aren't trusting of outsiders."</p>

            <p>
Unreleased details of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' story and characters have leaked out via an adult cartoon website. 
</p>
<p>
Over the weekend, scans of the game's currently-unreleased art book were posted on a hentai site, before being vigorously pulled offline by publisher Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the internet took notice - and you can now find the art book's 230-plus pages hosted elsewhere on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ig5byz/assassins_creed_shadows_art_book_leaked_on_hentai/">reddit</a> and social media if you so choose.

</figure>
<p>
Included in the art book - images of which we won't include here - are details of the game's major locations, items and characters. 
</p>
<p>
There's detail on what appears to be the game's Templar antagonists that Ubisoft has so far decided to keep schtum about - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">even after last month's Assassin's Creed Shadows hands-on previews</a>.
</p>
<p>
Also included are descriptions of the game's legendary creatures, which I fully hope and expect to be able to tame and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-turned-my-assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-into-a-personal-cat-and-tanuki-sanctuary-human-allies-be-damned">keep in the game's new customisable base</a> alongside my garden variety cats and tanuki. 
</p>
<p>
These are not the same as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>'s mythological fights - such as against Medusa and the Minotaur. Indeed, there's little in the art book that draws heavily on fantasy. Likewise, there's nothing in there on the game's modern day storyline - which is now being told separetely, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animus-hub-revealed-ubisofts-new-assassins-creed-start-screen-and-modern-day-story-wrapper-thats-definitely-not-just-another-launcher">by the series' new Animus Hub</a>.
</p><p>
After its most recent delay, Assassin's Creed Shadows is now set to arrive on 20th March - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">its success may hold a pivotal role in the future of Ubisoft as a whole</a>. Last month, Ubisoft told us exactly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-changed-and-what-didnt-during-assassins-creed-shadows-four-month-delay">what has - and hasn't - changed over the past few months after Shadow's initial delay</a>.

            <p>It looks like Pokémon TCG Pocket will offer all players a guaranteed rare card for the franchise's annual Pokémon Day.</p>
<p>Though not formally confirmed as yet, it's expected that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-looks-set-for-next-month">Pokémon Presents 2025 livestream will debut on or around 27th February</a> (the anniversary of Pokémon Red and Green's Japanese launch), and with it comes a few gifts for players, including three "special booster packs from Genetic Apex" - a Mewtwo pack, Charizard pack, and Pikachu pack.</p>

<p>Whilst these packs broadly contain the same cards as usual, a new datamine suggests the fifth card is guaranteed to be of at least four diamonds or higher rarity, including one star or higher cards.</p>
<p>Again, whilst not confirmed just yet, it's thought the promotion will kick off on Pokémon Day, with players getting until 30th April to claim their freebies (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-pokemon-tcg-pocket-pokemon-presents-gift-guaranteed-hit/">TheGamer</a>).</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>' game director has reflected on last week's announcement that the free-to-play brawler's fifth season will be its last.</p>
<p>On Friday, developer Player First Games confirmed Season 5 will end on 30th May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-fighter-multiversus-makes-a-return-in-may">roughly a year after its post-beta rerelease</a>. At this time, the studio said the game will be playable offline "for the foreseeable future", but it would be pulled from Epic Games Store, Steam, and both the PlayStation and Microsoft stores.</p>
<p>Following a few days of silence following this news - and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iew7s0/the_development_of_multiversus_was_problematic/">rumours mismanagement was a key factor in the game's shutdown</a> -  MultiVersus' director Tony Huynh has now shared his own thoughts on the situation, stating he is in "deep mourning for the game", and "nobody wanted this outcome".</p>

</figure>
<p>Writing on social media platform X, Huynh said he was "sad about the outcome", but remains "grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner  Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams". The director additionally thanked all those who had lent their IP to the game, which included an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-characters-roster-unlock-free-rotation-9024">eclectic roster of playable characters from DC to Game of Thrones</a>.</p><p>"We hope we made the characters true to themselves and felt authentic to your fans," Huynh wrote. "I couldn't be prouder of the work the [Player First Games] team did. Their endless creativity and passion never ceased to inspire and amaze me. And of course I wanted to thank every player who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. Delighting and serving players is Player First Games' objective."</p>
<p>Huynh went on to apologise for not addressing MultiVersus' ending sooner, stating his focus has been on the game and the team. He then appeared to address claims it was his fault MultiVersus is getting shut down.</p>
<p>"I don't have the power some [of] you think I do," he wrote, adding the studio is "a highly collaborative team" and "ideas are encouraged and can come from anyone and we promote delivering value to players".</p>
<p>Huynh continued: "I also hope that the community notices that we try to listen and act. Like any developer we're limited by time and resources.</p>
<p>"I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you're entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it's crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realise that this is an extremely sad time for the team. I am in deep mourning for the game.</p>
<p>"Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn't from lack of caring or effort."</p>

            <p>
Sony is set to hold its next PlayStation State of Play broadcast next week, according to a new report.
</p>
<p>
The tip comes from NateTheHate, a leaker with a long track record who accurately reported last month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal date</a> ahead of time. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, the leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877">teased</a> Sony's upcoming broadcast is currently expected to arrive around Valentine's Day - which is the end of next week.

<p>
Sony has streamed a State of Play broadcast each year in February since 2021, and typically uses the show to lay out its list of big first-party and third-party exclusives for the year.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-sonys-playstation-state-of-play-2">Last year's big show</a> (held on 31st January, before a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>-specific State of Play aired in early February) highlighted <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, Foamstars, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>, Judas, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, Rise of the Ronin, Until Dawn and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, among others. The biggest surprise of the show was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">Hideo Kojima popping in to announce Physint</a>, a fresh game that's set to hark back to the creator's Metal Gear Solid action-espionage roots.
</p><p>
So, what do we expect from State of Play this year? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">PlayStation is set to launch its samurai sequel Ghost of Yotei this year</a> - and could do well to announce some kind of launch window to space it out from Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p>
<p>
We're also expecting to hear more about Bungie's shooter reboot Marathon, and potentially Haven's live-service Fairgame$. Kojima may pop in to chat more about Death Stranding 2, which is out this year. And then there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">Marvel's Wolverine - will it make 2025?</a>
</p>
<p>PlayStation's livestream will follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-the-xbox-developer-direct-2025">last month's Xbox Developer Direct</a>, which gave us a look at South of Midnight, Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - the last four of which will all arrive on PS5.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/roll7">Roll7</a>'s award-winning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> have been mysteriously delisted on Steam.</p>
<p>Whilst there's been no formal word on why the critically acclaimed skating games have been pulled from sale on Steam, both games had been published on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s indie publishing label, Private Division, before it was sold to an unknown buyer, thought to be Haveli Investments, towards the end of last year.</p>

<p>Neither game shows up if you search on Steam, whilst using the direct URL informs you that the games are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294420/Rollerdrome/">"no longer available on the Steam store"</a>, despite Roll7's previous games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/olliolli">OlliOlli</a> and OlliOlli 2: Welcome to OlliWood are still listed.</p><p>Curiously, both Rollerdrome and OlliOlli World are, for now at least, still available on the PlayStation Store. Whilst they still list Private Division as the publisher on those pages, the defunct Steam pages - which were quietly amended last week - have been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1294420/history/">updated</a> to replace the publisher Private Division with 2K.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if this is just an oversight, a licensing issue, or a signal that Roll7's portfolio did not transfer to the anonymous buyer and remains with 2K.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">announced the sale of its indie-focused publishing label Private Division in November 2024</a>. Additionally, the company also confirmed the closure of OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2's Intercept Games, six months after CEO Strauss Zelnick insisted, "We didn't shutter those studios".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">Within days of launching a controversial new update that added the ability to trade cards</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has acknowledged the community's backlash, saying it was "actively investigating" ways to improve.</p>
<p>A statement posted to social media stopped short of apologising to unhappy players, but admitted some of the new feature's restrictions were actively "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" the card game.</p>

<p>"Since releasing the first iteration of the trading feature a few days ago, we have received a large number of comments. Thank you all for sharing your feedback," the statement from Creatures Inc began.</p>
<p>"The item requirements and restrictions implemented for the trading feature were designed to prevent abuse from bots and other prohibited actions using multiple accounts."</p> <div>

<p>As trading requires players use up valuable resources and adhere to a lengthy list of restrictions in order to acquire cards they don't already have, some players felt as though trading was actively discouraged, especially as its limited to players on your friends list, and only one trade can be conducted at a time. Currently, only cards of One, Two, Three or Four Diamond rarity can be offered for trade, alongside One Star rarity.</p>
<p>Now, however, the team says that the goal had only been to "balance" the game whilst "maintaining a fair environment for all players", adding "preserving the fun of collecting cards[...] is core to the Pokémon TCG Pocket experience".</p>
<p>"However, thanks to your feedback, we understand that some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature as intended," the team concluded.</p>
<p>"We are actively investigating ways to improve the feature to address these concerns. Going forward, we also plan to offer multiple ways to obtain trade tokens including through event distributions.</p>
<p>"As always, thank you for being part of the Pokémon TCG Pocket community."</p>
