            <p>The movie adaptation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> is not only back on track, but the first draft of the script is "done".</p>
<p>That's according to Marvel star Simu Liu, who revealed via a tweet last night that the "Sleeping Dogs script draft" was finished up, celebrating with a picture of his own sleeping dog. Aw.</p>
<p>The Sleeping Dogs film adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sleeping-dogs-film-adaptation-canned-says-star-wars-donnie-yen">was reportedly canned back in January</a>, when Star Wars actor Donnie Yen revealed he'd "spent a lot of time and even invested some of [his] own money" only for the project to stall. Just weeks later it seemed all was back on track, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-star-randomly-reveals-plan-to-revive-sleeping-dogs-movie-project">with Liu revealing his involvement</a>.</p>

<p>When asked if he'd "worked things out" with publisher and IP-holder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, Liu <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/1979666037391147276">told</a> a commenter: "They’re absolutely great, it’s the [Hollywood] studios that don’t seem to understand how important this IP is BUT we will get them there."</p> <div>

<p>Liu carefully concealed who the story had been written by and did not reveal who else was involved with the movie, but it'll be good news nonetheless to fans of the cult classic game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-donnie-yen-says-sleeping-dogs-movie-in-production">Yen confirmed the film was in development in February 2018</a>, but we'd heard very little else about the production until he confirmed the cancellation earlier this year.</p>
<p>Released in August 2012, Square Enix's Hong Kong open world game Sleeping Dogs was an enjoyable mix of martial arts combat and mob drama. Developer United Front Games tried to get a sequel off the ground, and then a multiplayer follow-up, Triad Wars, before shutting down in 2016.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s taking you out to Nell's Diner on 11th November.</p>
<p>Announced this weekend during Phasmophobia's fifth anniversary panel at TwitchCon, the retro diner will be the ghost bustin' game's fourteenth map, promising "surprises" for all those who dare stop by there when it launches next month.</p>

<p>The team said it recognised that Phasmophobia's smaller maps tend to be more popular, as they allow for "quicker but intense investigations full of memorable moments", and Nell's Diner will accommodate that, complete with a classic food counter, iconic red leather stools and booths, a kitchen, storage rooms, and "plenty of hauntings to decipher". According to the developer, Nell's Diner will be a tad larger than Tanglewood Drive.</p><p>As the team at Kinetic Games has grown over the last five years and now creates all its own art assets, don't forget that we can also expect some environmental story telling with this map when it goes live, too.</p>
<p>"So far, we've added some really classic horror locations to Phasmophobia - an abandoned asylum, creepy farmhouses, and our more linear lighthouse map, Point Hope. We always thought a diner would fit perfectly, so Nell's was born, and it's been such a fun challenge bringing it to life," said Dan "Dknighter" Knight, director of Kinetic Games and lead developer of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"Alongside the farmhouse reworks from this year, Nell's is an example of how we want all the maps in Phasmophobia to feel going forward. It's unique, and has been meticulously designed to tell more of a story to our players - beyond the immediate ghost they're hunting. We can't wait for everyone to get their hands on it next month."</p>
<p>Bertie recently chatted with creator Knight about Phasmophobia, where he was told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">how The Witcher 3 inadvertently saved the ghost-hunting game</a>. He also got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-will-begin-seeding-lore-to-build-story-for-the-film">a few more details on the recently announced film</a>, and how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-years-phasmophobia-overhaul-will-be-so-significant-it-will-feel-like-playing-a-new-game">next year's Phasmophobia overhaul will be so significant it will feel "like playing a new game"</a>.</p>

            <p>Streamer Emiru has disputed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s claim that it "responded to the incident" when she was assaulted during her TwitchCon Meet &amp; Greet, calling the claim "a blatant lie".</p>
<p>In a swift media statement, Twitch said "the safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority", and called the behaviour of the man who pushed past the queue to grab Emiru and kiss her "completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting". It then revealed it had "blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events".</p>

<p>"Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at TwitchCon and even in front of another creator's meet and greet to grab me and my face and try to kiss me. Fortunately he wasn't able to, but a lot of people have pointed out it could have been a lot worse!" she wrote.</p>
<p>"I'm obviously shaken up by what happened and it's not the first time I've dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact."</p>
<p>She adds that "there were at least three or four" TwitchCon security staff "in the area" who "did not react and let the guy walk away, as you can see in the clip since they don't even appear in the frame".</p>
<p>"None of the Twitchcon staff came to ask what happened or if I was okay," she adds.</p>
<p>"My friend who was present told me Twitch security were also behind the booth afterwards joking about how they didn't even see what happened and immediately laughing and moving on to talking about something else. So if no one was checking if I was okay or if I needed anything and they let the guy run away initially, I have no idea what anyone hired to keep the event safe was doing."</p><p>"Twitch's statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained, I'm sorry but that is a blatant lie," Emiru continues. "He was allowed to walk away from my meet and greet and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal."</p>
<p>She finished on confirming that this would be her final TwitchCon, writing: "it saddens me to say as a 10 year off and on attendee of TwitchCon, I think other creators should seriously consider not attending in the future. I did not feel cared for or protected, even bringing my own security and staff. I can't imagine how creators without those options would feel."</p> <div>

<p>Twitch's own statement reads: "The safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority. The behaviour displayed by the individual involved in the incident yesterday involving a high profile streamer was completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting.</p>
<p>"In line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident. We immediately blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events. We are coordinating with the impacted creator’s team and, per our standard protocols, continue to cooperate with any law enforcement investigations.</p><p>"We have increased security at the Meet &amp; Greet attendee check-in point and will have additional security personnel surrounding participating streamers. If you’ve RSVPed for a Meet &amp; Greet, please note that we are unable to accommodate +1s for the remainder of the event," it concluded. "Twitch has zero tolerance for harassment or acts that inhibit the safety and security of our community."</p>
<p>Twitch has not commented specifically on Emiru's claims, and the above statement has been slapped with a community note on Twitter/X claiming "Twitch allowed the assailant to walk originally and was only pressed to apprehend him until Emiru's manager pushed for it".</p>
