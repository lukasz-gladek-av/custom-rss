            <p>Sony has quietly expanded the cloud streaming feature on its PS Portal handheld to include a number of games from its Classics Catalogue.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">streaming feature launched back in November</a> last year and allows PS Plus Premium subscribers to stream games directly to the handheld without the need for a PS5 console.</p>
<p>Since then, Sony has been quietly adding to the service, which now includes almost every PS1 and PSP game from the Classics Catalogue in the streaming library (thanks <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps-portal-ps-plus-premium-streaming-update-march-2025">TrueTrophies</a>).</p>
<p>At its launch, the beta allowed players to access "select PS5 games", with over 120 games included. Now players can dive into the likes of Ape Escape, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>, Legend of Dragoon and more.</p>
<p>As it remains in beta, the cloud streaming service is only available in 30 countries, though that does include the UK.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the service can be accessed in: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.</p>
<p>It's unclear when the service will arrive in full globally, but for now it's clear Sony is keen to add to the catalogue of games - even if it's not including news in its regular PS Plus updates.</p>
<p>If you own a PS Portal, instructions on accessing the beta can be found on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/subscriptions/psportal-cloud-game-streaming/">PlayStation Support website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">PS Portal</a> was released in November 2023 - it's impressive hardware but does require a strong internet connection to function well. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-already-sold-out-as-scalpers-take-advantage">quickly sold out after release</a>, though scalpers took advantage of demand.</p>
<p>The device is also included in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-uk-ps5-rental-scheme-from-11month">Sony's new PlayStation rental service</a>, priced at Â£6.50 per month. Separately, you can rent PS5 consoles each month, or a PS VR2 too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sony announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-march-revealed">PS Plus Premium and Extra lineup for this month</a>, including the excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> and a number of classic Armored Core games from FromSoftware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Spectre Divide developer Mountaintop is taking the game offline, and the studio will be "closing its doors" at the end of this week.</p>
<p>The first season of the free-to-play tactical shooter, in which players control two bodies, only began two weeks ago. However, despite optimism during the first week, the developer hasn't "seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio", and Mountaintop is now out of funding.</p>
<p>"We expect to take Spectre offline within the next 30 days, but we plan on disabling new purchases and refunding money spent since Season 1 [launched] via the platforms," Mountaintop's CEO Nate Mitchell wrote, in a <a href="https://playspectre.com/news/letter-to-spectre-fans">post announcing the studio's closure</a>.</p>

<p>"We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and/or an acquisition. In the end, we weren't able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now," the CEO said, calling this a "painful update" to share with the Spectre Divide community.</p>
<p>"This has always been a passion project for us, born out of love for this genre. An indie team of insanely talented individuals who came together from around the world to build a game we believed in," Mitchell continued.</p>
<p>"We wanted to deliver something innovative and original in a crowded genre that would bring friends together around unforgettable moments. We shook up the format, created a fresh art style and universe, and partnered with some of our heroes. All of us knew from the beginning that the odds were against us, but that's what we signed up for.</p>
<p>"It was never a surefire bet. We did it anyway."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-years-of-complaints-from-rural-pokemon-go-fans-theres-a-new-challenge-that-city-dwellers-may-now-struggle-with<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a fact: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">PokÃ©mon Go</a> is much easier to play in a city or large town. There are more gyms and PokÃ©Stop locations to interact with, more PokÃ©mon that spawn, more fellow players to battle alongside.
</p>
<p>
For years, rural players have complained the game is harder for them in comparison. Now, finally, it's the turn of those who live in busier areas to complain. 
</p>
<p>
The latest set of challenges to obtain an ultra-rare Shiny Meloetta in PokÃ©mon Go include the requirement to hold a bronze Showcase Star medal, something that means a player needs to have placed first in a PokÃ©Stop Showcase. 
</p>
<p>
This is an easy task in remote areas - where essentially you can enter a PokÃ©mon into a Showcase tournament, and be the only person to do so, automatically winning. But in built-up areas, Showcases can attract hundreds of entrants, making your chances of winning much harder.
</p>
<p>
For some players who've already bought the Shiny Meloetta ticket (sold for Â£4.99 earlier this month), it's proved an unexpected sticking point in their progress. For others, who live in the countryside, it's provided an easy step forward.
</p>
<p>
"Bronze medal only requires one win," wrote a fan on <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/eurogamer-net/content-article/new/news/?tab=compose">PokÃ©mon Go reddit TheSilphRoad</a>, "yet some people struggle cause cities like Singapore are so dense and popular with PoGo that Showcases fill up very fast and you can't even enter it."
</p>
<p>
"Well so much for that," wrote another fan. "I have tried for over a year and never won a single showcase."
</p>
<p>
"Just let us rural players have this one win and don't be a sook," said a third. "Literally every other aspect of the game is better in the city."
</p>
<p>
The solution? Over the 21 days it'll take to complete the other steps in this next set of challenges, fans say those wishing to push forward should consider a day trip to somewhere a bit quieter to get that Showcase victory sorted.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">Niantic confirmed it was selling PokÃ©mon Go to Monopoly Go giant Scopely in a deal worth $3.5bn</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">move has sparked concern from fans over the game's future</a>, something the game's development team has attempted to assuage.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Balatro developer Locathunk has responded to a debate on AI art, stating "I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds".</p>
<p>The debate raged on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7nz5q/opinion_from_localthunk_on_ai_art/">Balatro subreddit</a> after one of its moderators posted that AI art would not be banned in the community. Many fans believed both Localthunk and the game's publisher Playstack supported AI art.</p>
<p>As such, Localthunk took to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/localthunk.bsky.social/post/3ljygv23un22v">social media</a> first to respond. "I learned about this a little bit earlier - this is not how I feel about AI 'art'," he wrote. "I normally wouldn't say something about the r/balatro community but this doesn't represent my beliefs nor do I believe it represents how Playstack feels about AI-generated imagery. I don't condone AI generated 'art'."</p>

<p>Then, the developer took to reddit to address the situation once again.</p>
<p>"A mod recently changed the flair in this subreddit for AI generated art making it seem like Playstack condones AI art," he wrote. "This was not due to a direct order from Playstack (a Playstack representative told me this) but from an interpretation of a message about enforcing the rules of the subreddit.</p>
<p>"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds. The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic."</p>
<p>Localthunk confirmed the moderator has been removed from the team and that AI-generated images will not be allowed on the subreddit.</p>
<p>"Please remember to be excellent to each other - this mod doesn't deserve hatred. Please leave them alone," he concluded.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/regarding_ai_art/">Regarding AI art</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/localthunk/">u/localthunk</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/">balatro</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>A statement from Playstack followed.</p>
<p>"As LocalThunk points out, we do not support the use of AI art, but perhaps the rules around this should have been clearer so it could not be interpreted as 'acceptable'," wrote communications director Wout van Halderen, confirming the mod team will tighten the rules and FAQ on the topic.</p>
<p>AI art is increasingly being used in game development, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">Square Enix using the technology for Foamstars</a>, to more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision acknowledging the use of generative AI in Call of Duty</a> (which likely resulted in that six-fingered zombie Santa).</p>

<p>Localthunk previously commented on PEGI's perceived mishandling of the game's rating. A year after release, Balatro has been recategorised as suitable for players aged 12 and up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Parents shouldn't let their children play Roblox if they are worried about their kids' safety in-game, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki has said.
</p>
<p>
Roblox, the gaming and social platform with 80 million daily users, has frequently been criticised for its lax player safety - particularly as the bulk of its audience is under 18. 
</p>
<p>
"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox," <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yrjkl7dd6o">Baszucki told BBC News in a new interview</a>. "That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox made a flurry of changes in late 2024 designed to improve child safety</a> with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">the addition of basic parental control features</a>, such as the ability to set playtime limits, remotely manage a child's account and view a child's friend list.
</p>
<p>
Parental access is now required for children to access some in-game chat features, and children under 13 have been blocked from social hangout games due to "user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk". 
</p>
<p>
The changes came a month after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">a damning report was published detailing the ongoing safety issues for children in-game</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">had been regularly highlighted for years</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We do in the company take the attitude that any bad, even one bad incident, is one too many," Baszucki told BBC News today. 
</p>
<p>
"We watch for bullying, we watch for harassment, we filter all of those kinds of things, and I would say behind the scenes, the analysis goes on all the way to, if necessary, reaching out to law enforcement."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">In 2013, Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation to US authorities</a>, and responded to over 1300 requests from authorities for detail on predatory players. Over the last six years, at least two dozen people have been arrested in the US for abusing victims met via Roblox.
</p>
<p>
During the interview, BBC News showed Baszucki evidence of how easy it was to still set up accounts to chat between a user who was a minor and adults, as well as the titles of Roblox experiences recommended to an account of an 11-year-old, including "Late Night Boys And Girls Club RP" and "Special Forces Simulator".
</p>
<p>
"One thing that's really important for the way we do things here, is it's not just on the title of the experience, it's literally on the content of the experience as well," Baszucki said in response.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-shares-drop-by-20-as-platform-misses-target-active-users">Roblox shares dropped by 20 percent</a> after the platform's reported daily active users fell short of expectations, something the company blamed on a recent ban of the platform in TÃ¼rkiye over child safety concerns.

<p>Conroy - who along with his animated and film work is also beloved for his role as Batman in Rocksteady's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham games</a> and NetherRealm's superhero fighter Injustice - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-voice-actor-kevin-conroy-dies-aged-66">passed away in 2022</a> aged 66 following a battle with cancer.</p>
<p>Sharing the news of Conroy's inclusion in Devil May Cry, series showrunner Adi Shankar said that the actor's lines were "recorded before he passed", and no AI was used.</p>
<p>"Mr Conroy gave it [an] amazingly nuanced performance," <a href="https://x.com/adishankarbrand/status/1900003119448416578">Shankar wrote on social media</a>. "It was both a pleasure and an honour to work with him."</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/johnnyyongbosch/status/1900016202606674063">Actor Johnny Yong Bosch</a> - who will voice Dante in the Netflix series - added it was an "honour" to work with Conroy on Devil May Cry, calling his castmate a "true legend".</p>
<p>"Batman: The Animated Series redefined cartoons for me. For those wondering, our recording sessions took place a few years ago - animation takes quite some time to complete."</p>

Ubisoft has some good news for Steam Deck owners looking to sink into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> later this month: after previously saying the game wouldn't be compatible with Valve's gaming handheld, it's now done a bit of a U-turn.
</p>
<p>
Back in February, as part of a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">lengthy tech Q&amp;A</a>, Ubisoft revealed Assassin's Creed Shadows would "not be compatible with Steam Deck [at launch], due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC." That, then, suggested it wasn't just a case of Shadows failing to tick some boxes to pass Valve's verification process, but rather that it simply wouldn't run well at all.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, with Assassin's Creed Shadows' release just weeks away, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j9og39/assassins_creed_shadows_we_are_happy_to_say_that/">shared an update for Steam Deck users</a> - confirming Valve's device will, in fact, be supported at launch. The publisher didn't explain what had led to the change, but presumably - hopefully - it's managed to eke out a few performance gains in the time since its original announcement.

<p>
Ubisoft adds it's still awaiting the results of Valve's verification process, so doesn't currently know which of Steam Deck's compatibility classifications Assassin's Creed Shadows will receive (Valve <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified">grades games</a> as either Verified, Playable, Unsupported, or Unknown on the device) . "More info to come soon," its message concludes.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (including Steam Deck!) on 20th March, and will also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-ps5-pro-enhancements-including-extended-raytracing">receive a range of PS5 Pro enhancements</a>. And if you're looking for more granular release information, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">global launch times have also been revealed.</a> As for the game itself, it's "shaping up to be one of the most promising [series entries] so far", as Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">wrote earlier this year</a>.
