            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> currently has close to 250,000 players waiting in queue for access, ahead of the today's early access beta period.</p>
<p>The game, which is set to release on the 10th October, is giving folks a chance to hop in starting later today, as well as this weekend and the next. Everyone who requested access to Battlefield 6's Labs tests has been given access to these weekend tests, which - it turns out - is a lot of people.</p>
<p>On Steam alone, the game has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">reached a player count of 296,500 as of writing</a>. That's almost 300,000 people sat in a queue.</p>

<p>Eurogamer's very own Ian Higton was in the queue around the 195,000 mark, but backed out to test how large the queue actually was. The result, a newfound spot at 227,240. Ouch. This does indicate there's no disconnection protection for the queue, so be sure you don't lose your internet connection while you wait, or you could find yourself in for an even longer queueing experience.</p>
<p>Battlefield 6 has been a hotly anticipated game for a good while now, but ever since the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGEMfyAQtI&amp;rco=1">Multiplayer reveal late last month</a> folks have been especially eager to hop in and try it out. The game will feature all the military FPS goodies you'd expect like large tank battles and squad-based combat, as well as the environmental destruction the series is known for.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-multiplayer-takes-a-bold-risky-new-direction">In our own preview of Battlefield 6's multiplayer</a>, we came away especially optimistic, writing:</p>
<blockquote>"I think the building blocks for a truly fantastic Battlefield game are here with Battlefield 6 - perhaps even an all-time great - but I need to see a little more, need to play a little more. I need to see where the dice fall, whether the gamble of bold gameplay changes land well - where the hivemind of Battlefield's playerbase find new strategies beyond the this-beats-that approach of old, say - or whether they simply muddy an otherwise potentially brilliant experience."</blockquote>
<p>If you're still keen to trial the Battlefield 6 beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-you-can-still-get-a-battlefield-6-multiplayer-early-access-code">you may be lucky enough to get a code via some avenues that are still open</a>. Just be aware of the queues if you get one.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony has announced in its latest quarterly financial report that the PS5 has sold 80.3m units since its release in November 2020.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">which can be read here</a>, covers the full scope of Sony as a business. On page 12 details on the PlayStation 5's performance - as well as software and peripherals on the platform - are revealed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-5">PS5</a> sold 2.5m units in Q1 2025, a slight rise from the Q1 2024 figure of 2.4m. Software sales across PS5 and PS4 is up significantly however, with 65.9m copies sold compared to 53.6m at the same time last year.</p>

<p>Monthly active users of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus</a> are also up. 123m were recorded in Q1 2025, compared to 116m in Q1 2024. Add-on content (DLC) also saw a slight increase, bringing in 292,609m yen in Q1 2025 compared to 290,846 in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's a lot of numbers, but what does it mean? Well, it means there's continued growth across pretty much all aspects of the PS5 business. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation">PlayStation</a> revenue from games, game DLC, and hardware is up. Plus, there are more people playing online on the PS5 than before.</p>
<p>The console passing 80.3m units sold throughout its life so far also puts it around about the same pace in terms of sales as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-4">PS4</a>, give or take a million or so. Given the rougher economic climate we're in right now, and the fact that there were serious supply issues at the start of the PS5's release, that's not too bad.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-5-has-sold-803-million-units-as-it-closes-on-in-on-fifth-anniversary]]></content:encoded>
