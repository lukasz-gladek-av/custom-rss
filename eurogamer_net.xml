            <p>Microsoft is no longer selling or renting movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>The change came about abruptly earlier this week, with a FAQ update on both the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/apps-help/troubleshoot-movies-and-tv-on-xbox-one">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/watch-movies-and-tv-shows-on-the-microsoft-movies-tv-app-59328422-053f-30b3-843a-f8774567a85e">Windows</a> pages confirming that as of 18th July, "Microsoft has stopped selling new movie and TV content".</p>
<p>"Existing customers can continue to access their previously purchased content on Windows and Xbox devices," the FAQ explains, "[and] players can continue to play personal videos on Xbox devices. Windows customers can continue to have access to playback and the download functionality."</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/microsoft-abruptly-stops-selling-movies-and-tv-shows-on-pc-and-xbox-but-past-purchases-will-remain-available/">PC Gamer</a> points out, this isn't unique to Microsoft - in fact, both Apple and Google have effectively done the same thing, only earlier - and it appears the megacorp is committed to permitting existing customers access their paid-for content (at least, for the time being).</p>
<p>As per Microsoft's terms of sale, there's no way to get a refund, nor can you switch your purchased content to another service. For anyone who used the service regularly, Microsoft suggests you use "other entertainment services that offer the latest home entertainment releases", such as "Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and Fandango at Home, among others".</p>

            <p>The director behind ICO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> believes the days of creating new and innovative gameplay mechanics "has already passed".</p>
<p>In an interview with To a T and Karamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi earlier this year, Fumito Ueda praised To a T, commending Takahashi for "not relying on unique gameplay mechanics".</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a">Denfaminicogamer</a>, Ueda said he called up Takahashi when To a T was revealed, wanting to know if the unusual game involved any new or complicated mechanics to play. When Takahashi revealed it did not, he responded with a simple: "That's great!"</p>

<figcaption>TO A T | Reveal Trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nD9H6__29A" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reminded of this exchange during his interview with Takahashi, Ueda joked "ah, these are the words of a professional", but then expanded on the comment, explaining that what he meant was that contemporary games felt over-concerned with gameplay (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director-praises-katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-for-not-being-mechanics-based-the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"While I don’t know why I replied with 'that's great' back then, I was most likely thinking – the age of gameplay mechanics had already passed," Ueda said. "I guess this is not the age to release new devices or offer new mechanics with each and every new game.</p>
<p>"Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork, he added. "Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is – I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition."</p>
<p>Ueda believes this is why he enjoyed To a T so much; rather than innovating or inventing complex control schemes and mechanics, it instead concentrated on its visuals and story to tell a tale about what it's like to live with a disability.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our Donlan took away a different take. "Over the five or six hours it takes to play To a T, I’ve had a series of revelations that in turn built to one giant revelation: I have had the wrong idea about pretty much everything here," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is">Donlan wrote when he gave To a T a try</a>.</p>
<p>"As a result, I've never played a game where I spent so much of the time simply trying to work out what it’s doing. What's the intent, To a T? What do you want to be? It turns out I wouldn't truly understand any of this until the final credits had rolled. In fact, I'm still thinking about a lot of it."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed-says-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ready or Not, the violent and controversial shooter from Void Interactive, has topped one million sales on console in just four days.</p>
<p>Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7352240956261216257/">LinkedIn</a>, Void's CEO Julio Rodriguez said he was "incredibly proud of the team and what we've accomplished together", saying he didn't take the milestone "for granted".</p>

<p>"When we launched Ready or Not on PC, it took about 36 days to reach one million units sold. On console, it took about 3.6 days," Rodriguez wrote. "I’m incredibly proud of the team and what we've accomplished together. It’s a huge moment - and one we don’t take for granted.</p>
<p>"Game reviews are holding strong as we head into our first weekend, and the team is already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience.</p>
<p>"To our players, partners, and everyone who believed in the project - thank you."</p>
<p>It's not been a trouble-free rollout, however. When Void Interactive confirmed earlier this month that the console port needed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release">changes "as absolutely required by our first party partners",</a> including tweaks to dismemberment/gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence", some in the game's community hit back with a review-bomb campaign which has seen its "mostly positive" rating fall to "mostly negative".</p>
<p>The negative Steam reviews cited "content censorship", despite Void Interactive's attempts to to quell these concerns, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-developer-seeks-to-alleviate-censorship-concerns-following-community-outcry">stating it had seen "misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes"</a>.</p>
<p>The shooter is currently sitting on a 4 out of 5 score on the Xbox storefront, an average 4.69 on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after it confirmed the game would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access, but in a statement on Twitter shortly after its debut, Void <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was also briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-hits-1m-console-sales-in-4-days-despite-censorship-claims-from-its-pc-players]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Although Ubisoft has yet to formally confirm a new Ghost Recon game is on the way, in a recent shareholder Q&amp;A, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot and CFO Frederick Duguet talked openly about the upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisofts-ceo-has-let-slip-that-a-new-ghost-recon-is-coming/">VGC</a>, Dugent revealed that the recent investment from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">subsidiary for which will be lead by Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot as co-CEOs</a> - will be used to develop "other major brand names", with Ghost Recon being "just one example for our first-person-shooter-type games".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the meeting, CEO Guillemot said: "In addition to the [Rainbow Six] game that I just mentioned, our objective is to also make strong progress in the growing market, generally speaking, by continuing to enhance our current experiences that we offer – and capitalising on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon."</p>
<p>Given we haven't had a Ghost Recon game since 2019 (I had a bad time with the last one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint-review-a-limp-and-lifeless-spin-on-the-ubisoft-formula">slapping it with Avoid</a>, calling it "a limp and lifeless spin on the Ubisoft formula"), for Guillemot to use the words "current experiences" and "upcoming launches" in relation to a franchise that hasn't seen a new game for six years suggests a new Ghost Recon installment is on the way.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> is getting The Devil's Triade update this fall, adding two the devil frame Uriel, a new quest, and two new protoframes. Yes, you can romance them.
</p>
<p>The update is a side story that's coming alongside the next major update: The Old Peace. The protoframes you'll be meeting are Harrow and Wisp, a sign that new protoframes will still be coming even as the game leaves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-motorbiking-pal-romancing-boyband-battling-1999-expansion-finally-has-a-release-date">the Warframe 1999 setting</a>.
</p>
<p>Uriel, the devil-themed warframe coming alongside The Devil's Triade, was confirmed by Soulframe's creative director Geoff Crookes in a pre-Tennocon Q&amp;A as the last design by Michael “Mynki” James Brennan, who passed away last year.

<p>In that same pre-Tennocon Q&amp;A, Warframe community manager Megan Everett confirmed that those who choose to romance these new Protoframes as part of The Devil's Triade side story will not have to worry about pre-existing relationships in the Warframe 1999 setting. The reason being that Warframe 1999 is The Drifter's story, whereas this upcoming update focuses on The Operator.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of reveals of Tennocon this year. Earlier today, Soulframe got a new trailer and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026">opened the floodgates for anyone who signs up</a>. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> fans won't need to be reminded it's a big weekend for developer Digital Extremes and its long-running sci-fi shooter. Thanks to this year's TennoCon live event, which is traditionally the time for the studio to dazzle its community with all sorts of things to come, we've now got a pretty good idea of what Warframe's next twelve months look like.
</p>
<p>
Top of the list for this year's big updates is The Old Peace, Warframe's next major quest and narrative chapter. It's basically the prelude to next year's big Tau update (which we'll get to in a bit) and comes packaged with a new side story called The Devil's Triad.
</p>
<p>
Focusing on The Old Peace's quest bit first, it whisks players back to the Tau of the past, where - to paraphrase the official description - they'll ecnounter a childhood Sentient friend named Adis, and experience the conflict between the Orokin, their creations, and a coalition of Dax Anarch Warriors upon the Perita moon. And as for that Devil's Triad side story, it'll serve as the introduction to three new characters: Father Lyon Allard (the Protoframe of Harrow), Marie Leroux (the Protoframe of Wisp), and new devil-themed Warframe Uriel.

Alongside all <em>that</em>, you've got a new enemy faction, a Focus expansion introducing a new Operator ability, and - on that subject - a full graphical remaster for Warframe's Operators, which includes new character models and cosmetic assets, new facial animations, and more.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for The Old Peace yet besides its vague "2025" window, but you can at least keep your Tenno spirits up in the immediate terms with the tuneful Lullaby of the Manifold, which is leaping out of Digital Extremes' Old Peace reveal trailer and onto "most" major music streaming platforms on 21st July. Valkyrie gets some new premium in-game cosmetic options when her Heirloom Collection arrives on the same day, and - as summer departs in its annual seasonal strop - there's still more to come. 
</p>
<p>
In October, Digital Extremes is teaming up with tabletop RPG creator Paizo to bring Warframe to tabletops in both physical and digital forms, while other autumnal treats include the launch of Warframe's closed beta on Android (you can <a href="http://warframe.com/android">sign up for that here</a>), and another big update currently known only as "untitled". It might not have a name yet, but it'll still be one to watch, and it's introducing a very much-requested - and much-needed - tutorial quest teaching players how to use Warframe's complicated upgrade system, Mods. Digital Extremes has sought outside help for this one, and the resulting quest, appropriately known as The Teacher, has been developed in collaboration with Sumo Digital.

On top of all that, "untitled" brings an  Oberon rework, a new Lavos deluxe skin, plus various quality-of-life improvements, which you can learn more about in a livestream this September. And one more thing to add under 'relatively imminent': Caliban Prime Access arrives "soon".
</p>
<p>
And finally for your Warframe calendars, should that be a thing you own, there's the aforementioned Tau. It's described as a "monumental" new narrative chapter that follows on from the events of this year's The Old Peace, and it's launching in 2026. And if Digital Extremes' wish comes true, Warframe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-studio-would-love-to-do-a-proper-switch-2-version-but-its-still-waiting-on-a-dev-kit-so-if-you-know-anyone">might even be available on Switch 2</a> by then.
