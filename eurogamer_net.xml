            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy has delayed its previously announced Hitman mission, as it continues to issue fixes to the game.</p>
<p>In a new post, Build A Rocket Boy apologised that its Hitman crossover mission with publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> would no longer be releasing in July as once planned. Rather, the studio has moved this release back to an unspecified date down the line. "We look forward to delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right and will provide further updates as soon as we're able," it wrote.</p>
<p>What Build A Rocket Boy does have planned for the coming months, though, is two more updates promising yet more performance improvements. In August, the studio will also introduce skippable cutscenes.</p>

<p>"It's been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we're grateful for your support and detailed feedback," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">the team wrote on reddit</a>. "Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game."</p>
<p>Since this post has gone live, many on the game's Discord are now lamenting the lack of a clear roadmap for MindsEye and content in general.</p>
<p>"Confirmation that Hitman is delayed is good and all, but there's no substantial content or really anything to bring people back until after September," a user wrote. "What's the point of the premium pass or getting a deluxe edition if we don't get the promised content," one user added (to which another replied with simply: "Cash grabbing punks.")</p>
<p>Another commenter on the MindsEye Discord wrote: "Of course, we do want the game to get fixed. But what we also need is content, or else there is literally no point continuing to try and fix stuff." Someone even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">suggested Build A Rocket Boy take a leaf out of Splitgate 2's book</a>, and rerelease MindsEye in an 'early access' state.</p>
<p>"As a console player, there is literally no reason to return to this game," yet another user on the MindsEye Discord wrote.</p>
<p>These sentiments are echoed on the MindsEye reddit. "I want more MindsEye  missions to be added. Community and developer made ones as promised. As well as the essential fixes needed for free roam. Different playable characters, driveable vehicles, time of day, etc," reads one reply to Build A Rocket Boy's latest update.</p>
<p>Others are just annoyed that in its update post, the studio hasn't really said anything of any real importance. "This update doesn't say anything meaningful at all, are you kidding?" reads a reply.</p>

<p>MindsEye released earlier this year, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though MindsEye's publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane said: "Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat." We awarded it one star.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseyes-hitman-crossover-mission-delayed-leaving-its-community-starving-for-content]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s promised duo mode is finally on the way, and will be added to the game next week.</p>
<p>From 30th July, a two-player mode will be available in patch 1.02, alongside some UI improvements and more Relics filtering options.</p>
<p>The mode was announced in a new trailer, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite being primarily a three-player co-operative game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off has been criticised by players - in part because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">included solo play was too tough</a>, and in part because a two-player option wasn't included.</p>
<p>Previous patches have re-balanced the solo mode, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">two-player mode was promised at the start of June</a>. Now it's finally on the way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">FromSoftware announced Elden Ring Nightreign has sold over 5m copies</a> since its release at the end of May.</p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has sold 10m copies, meaning around a third of players have dived into the expansion.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has continued to update Nightreign with the rotating Everdark Sovereigns.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish.1253265/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>With just a month to go before the game's planned release, the Dying Light: The Beast team has announced a delay.</p>
<p>"It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we've ever released," <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moves">Techland wrote in an update</a>, stating that to "honour" this promise it would be delaying the release until 19th September. This will allow the team to add some extra polish before the zombie shooter gets released into the wild.</p>
<p>"We've been carefully listening to what you've been saying - whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments," the Dying Light: The Beast developer continued. "With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great."</p>
<p>This extra time will see Techland making some adjustments to cutscene and player animations, as well as finetuning the balance of gameplay elements. It also aims to make the game's UI clearer.</p>
<p>"We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand," Techaland said "Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we've learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is."</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">first look at Dying Light: The Beast during Gamescom last year</a>, when Techland revealed this release initially started out as DLC. "But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience," the studio wrote at the time. "To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a> Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC."</p>
<p>Then, last month, the studio announced an August release date (which has obviously now changed). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Techland also released a new trailer</a>, featuring new gameplay, along with a variety of chases and parkour - a key feature in Dying Light games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions">it was reported Techland had cancelled two in-development games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish]]></content:encoded>

            <p>He plays Mister Fantastic in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, but can Pedro Pascal actually <em>play </em>Mister Fantastic? Well, when it comes to Marvel Rivals, no not really.</p>
<p>The cast of Fantastic Four: First Steps recently got to take their Marvel Rival's counterparts out for a spin. Joining Pascal was Vanessa Kirby (Sue Storm/Invisible Woman), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm/The Thing) and Joseph Quinn (Human Torch), who all played NetEase's shooter with YouTuber LoserFruit.</p>
<p>It is fair to say though, that none of the actors were especially skilled when it came to negotiating the controls, with Pascal looking very much out of his depth (at one point he asks if there are "console classes" people could take part in).</p>

<p>But, one moment from this entire Marvel Rival's experience that has particularly captured attention, though, is the cast's reaction to Invisible Woman's Malice skin, which leaves very little to the imagination. "Thank you," Kirby immediately reacts with a snap of the fingers. "This is my favourite bit of her as well." She then makes allusions to a yet-to-be-greenlit sequel.</p>
<p>Her three companions, though, well they all looked rather surprised by the scantily clad image presented to them on the screen, which sees Sue dressed in what looks like quite a skimpy bikini bottom complete with a spikely-adorned top half. 

Pascal soon regained some composure, and simply said: "Costume designer, take note."

</p><p>This clip was shared by the Marvel Rivals social media account, and the cast's reaction has since gone somewhat viral. So, what do you think about Pascal and co's gaming endeavours?</p> <div>

<p>Back in February, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">Marvel Rivals had amassed over 40 million players since its launch</a>. Despite this success, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Following this, the Marvel Rivals publisher said the layoffs were a "difficult decision" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game</a>.</p>
