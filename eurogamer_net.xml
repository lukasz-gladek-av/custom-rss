            <p>Funselektor, the developer behind art of rally, has revealed a co-op off-road exploration game titled: over the hill.</p>
<p>"Explore the world in the golden age of offroading. Drive iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s by yourself or with friends through challenging trails and beautiful scenery," reads the official blurb. </p>
<p>Tow ropes may be required to get your fellow car enthusiasts out of a tight spot, if the announcement trailer (below) is anything to go by. It all looks a bit like a cosy take on a Top Gear challenges of old, obviously with a lot less yelling of "Poweeeer!" by the hosts, mixed with some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> elements.</p>

<p>The game's biomes have all been inspired by real locations, and while they can be explored with your friends by your side, you can also take to the road (or track) on your own if you just fancy a quiet drive to clear your head. Weather will change around you as the sun sets and night comes, with the developer promising a "dynamic, immersive experience" on over the hill's release. There will also be hidden objectives and challenges dotted around, so something to keep an eye out for.</p>
<p>"After  having developed several games about motorsport, we wanted to go off-track by offering players a vast world to lose themselves at a slower pace," said Funselektor founder Dune Casu.</p>
<p>"In a way, this game is similar to the experience  I've had journeying across North America in my trusty camper van. There's something special  about being in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere, from the peace, the sounds of nature and  less distraction from the civilized world. I hope this game can really drive that feeling home."</p>
<p>If this all sounds like your thing, you can add over the hill to your wishlist on Steam.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for Funselektor's previous game art of rally, we called it a "blast" on its release in 2020.</p>
<p>"It's as graceful and poised as Michèle Mouton holding a Quattro S2 at an impossible angle, and as stylish as any driving game I've played. There might be more complex takes than art of rally on the discipline out there, but none of them is as quick to get to the appeal of off-roading as this," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/art-of-rally-review-a-slight-yet-stylish-take-on-off-road-driving">Eurogamer's art of rally review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft's Xbox portfolio of games is under the spotlight this evening as it airs a new Developer Direct at 6pm UK time. We'll be covering everything live as it happens, right here, as well as talking with you about the things that do. Why not join us? Crack some jokes! We like jokes.</p>
<p>But what is going to happen? We know a few things. We know the tasty-looking Doom: The Dark Ages will be a central focus and that we're probably going to get a release date for it - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-spotted-ahead-of-xbox-developer-direct">reportedly 15th May</a> - and we know we're getting a better look at Southern American folklore action adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, which I think looks great. A release date more specific than 2025 would be welcome.</p>
<p>The other named game on the slate for tonight is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">promising turn-based role-playing game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which Ed has been keeping a close - and interested - eye on, and which again, we could use a more specific release date for. Those are the named games. But we're also promised a look at a fourth game that's, as yet, a bit of a mystery. Could it be a game like Avowed or Fable, or are we going to see something completely new? Maybe it's time to wheel out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">the Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake that's been speculated about</a>.</p>
<p>That's the general shape of things but there could be other surprises too. Join us just before 6pm UK time as we prepare to find out.</p><figure>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will launch a major new expansion later this month named Space-Time Smackdown, featuring Legendary Pokémon fan-favourites Dialga and Palkia.
</p>
<p>
Space-Time Smackdown is set to launch within the hit smartphone game at the end of the month, after the app's card trading feature launches on 28th January.
</p>
<p>
Somewhat confusingly, a social media <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1882413987804934654">post</a> states the expansion will arrive on 30th January, though an attached trailer states it will launch on 29th January.

<p>
As you might expect, the expansion looks like it'll feature snazzy 3D cards for both Dialga and Palkia - both look to be hanging out on Spear Pillar, from Pokémon Diamond and Pearl and the more recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-arceus-walkthrough-guide-missions-objectives-8039">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>. After previous nods to the main-series Pokémon games, it's a nice touch.

<p>
Dialga and Palkia-branded card packs will add the Sinnoh region's Starter Pokémon Turtwig, Chimchar and Piplup, plus Lucario, Pachirisu, Leafeon, Honchkrow, Gible, Cresselia, and a Supporter card for Cynthia.
</p>
<p>If you fancy customising your game further, there will be new binder and display board covers featuring Dialga and Palkia plus the Mythical Pokémon Darkrai.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-later-this-month-but-rules-will-limit-what-you-can-swap">Pokémon TCG Pocket announced it was adding the ability to trade in-game cards, though a list of rules will limit what you can swap</a>.</p>
<p>Launched late last year, the app has been hugely successful and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reportedly-surpassed-200m-in-first-month">raked in over $200m during its first month of launch</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a> Group has announced a new name and look for the company, which will now be known as everplay group.
</p>
<p>
But the Team17 name will live on, as the company's Team17 development and publishing arm will remain as Team17 Digital.
</p>
<p>
In effect, little will change the next time you load up a new Team17 game. What has changed is that the parent company, formerly Team17 Group, now has a different moniker to reflect the fact it has had - for some time - owned a couple of other brands.
</p>
<p>
The newly-renamed everplay group has three main prongs: Team17, simulation game developer and publisher Astragon Entertainment - bought in 2022, plus educational app maker StoryToys - acquired in 2021.
</p>
<p>
"[everplay] continues to focus on the wealth of opportunities in the indie, children's games and working simulation markets by launching exceptional new games," the company said in a statement today. 
</p>
<p>
"At the same time, everplay focuses on driving back catalogue sales by prioritising our portfolio and evergreen franchises, while adopting innovative publishing and marketing models to maximise discoverability and appeal in the marketplace."
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The newly-rebranded everplay group logo. | <span>Image credit: <cite>everplay</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Team17 and its parent company have changed significantly over the past decade, since the business was floated on the London Stock Exchange and the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-reported-at-worms-maker-team17">has focused increasingly on third-party publishing</a>. During that time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/significant-job-losses-likely-at-worms-publisher-team17-sources">numerous jobs were lost</a> within the company's development-focused arm, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-extent-of-team17-cuts-threaten-third-of-the-company-sources">up to a third of the company was at risk of redundancy in 2023</a>.
</p><p>
Founded in 1990, Team17's early years saw it become best known for developing games such as Worms and Alien Breed. The past decade has seen its publishing arm launch third-party indie hits such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>, Moving Out and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I am excited to be unveiling our new Group brand today, which we believe better represents our business which has evolved greatly since the IPO and reflects our DNA to never stop playing," said everplay group chief executive officer Steve Bell. 
</p>
<p>
"This rebrand not only creates an ideal backdrop to foster greater cross-collaboration internally but also reflects our aspirations to expand our reach across complementary sectors within the broader indie market."

            <p>After the reported flop of Resident Evil 7 on iPhone last year, we wondered whether Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a> would face a similar fate - and it seems this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>Data from mobile app tracking service Appmagic, shared by <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/resident-evil-2-struggles-to-100k-as-triple-a-flops-continue/">Mobilegamer.biz</a>, estimates that the mobile port of Capcom's remake has only just managed to pass $100k in in-app purchase earnings.</p>

</figure>
<p>Resident Evil 2 Remake's mobile port - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-2-remake-heading-to-iphone-and-mac-in-december">which was released in December</a> - allows users to play a short portion of the game for free, but to get the full experience they need to pay. During the first few weeks of its release, this was discounted to $10. According to estimates, Capcom made $95k during this discount period, meaning roughly 9500 users purchased the full game after getting to the paywall.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/IMG_4832-(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>Since 9th January - when the game was then boosted up to its full retail price of $40 (£31.99 here in the UK) - Capcom has made an additional $7k from the mobile release, so that's roughly 175 more users opting to pay to play.</p>
<p>This isn't the only one of Capcom's mobile ports to underwhelm, but at least Resident Evil 2 Remake has done better than Resi 7's efforts. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">report from July of last year suggested Resident Evil 7 had been bought by under 2000 people</a> in its first couple of weeks on the store, with only a scant 2.4 percent of players converting from the free opening to paid version.</p><p>As for what is next for Capcom's franchise, last year Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">the studio was developing a new series entry</a>. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said at the time. "But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
