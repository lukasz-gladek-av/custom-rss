            <p>
WiFi Wars, a live comedy game show spin-off from telly programme Go 8 Bit, is soon coming to a venue that's probably quite near you. 
</p>
<p>
Hosted by Go 8 Bit's Steve McNeil, the interactive show uses clever tech to let the audience play along via mini-games, challenges and quizzes streamed to their smartphones.
</p>
<p>
The format was previously part of the Royal Institution's Summer Programme and the BBC Christmas Lectures, and has also popped up at the equally-eclectic venues of the Edinburgh Fringe and EGX. Intrigued? There's a video with more of what it's all about just below.

<p>
If you fancy popping along, there's a two-week run coming up in London over Easter, sandwiched between dates in March, April and June elsewhere in the UK. The tour is set to visit Bolton, Bristol, Norwich, Wrexham, Mchynlleth, Aylesbury, Cambridge and more. Also, both Southampton and Northampton.
</p>
<p>
The full list of dates are over on the <a href="https://www.wifiwars.co.uk/dates/">WiFi Wars website</a>, and tickets go for around Â£16 depending on location - in the country, and within the venue of your seat.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daves-video-game-tv-show-dara-o-briains-go-8-bit-canned-after-three-series">Go 8 Bit finished up a three-season run on comedy channel Dave back in 2018</a>. Hosted by Dara O Briain, it featured a selection of celebs battling through rounds of video game-based challenges to various levels of success. Famous faces on the show included Jonathan Ross, Sonia from Eastenders, and the wonderful Ellie Gibson - formerly of this website, and now a successful standup comedian and podcaster.

            <p>After the success of Marvel Rivals, NetEase is publishing another shooter due for release this week: FragPunk. At least, it's releasing on PC, as its console launch has been delayed without a new release date.</p>
<p>The online shooter was first revealed at last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>, showing off its unique card mechanic that alters gameplay and the environments with wacky effects.</p>
<p>FragPunk releases on PC tomorrow, 6th March, but a message from the official social media account states the Xbox and PlayStation releases need more time due to "unexpected technical challenges".</p>

<p>"Since the announcement of the game, your excitement has been truly inspiring, and we know how much you've been looking forward to launching into battle on both Xbox and PlayStation," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"However, we want to be fully transparent with you: during the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimisation and adaptation.</p>
<p>"Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p>
<p>It's unknown when the console versions will now be released.</p>
<p>However, the developer will compensate players on Xbox and PlayStation by providing all rewards up front, including in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience, and more once the game is out.</p>
<p>Any console pre-orders will be cancelled, but those players will receive in-game currency worth $10 when these versions eventually launch.</p>
<p>"This delay was not an easy decision, but we are committed to delivering the best possible experience for our players, and this additional time will allow us to fully optimise and polish the console versions for launch," the statement continues.</p>

<p>The PC release of FragPunk will include 150+ Shard Cards, 13 playable heroes (called Lancers), and seven maps to battle on.</p>
<p>FragPunk promises an alternative to Valorant - like Riot's shooter it's a five-versus-five free-to-play shooter with teams taking turns to attack and defend.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunks-card-system-ensures-its-set-to-be-your-new-favourite-valorant-competitor">hands-on with FragPunk at last year's Gamescom</a> and was impressed by both the speed of gameplay and its intriguing card system that should help it stand out from other games of the genre.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Eagle-eyed Dungeons and Dragons fans have spotted a fresh reference to everyone's favourite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> vampire, hidden away in the game's new Monster Manual. 
</p>
<p>
Astarion is featured in the 2025 edition of the Monster Manual - or at least, a quote from him is - as spotted by Baldur's Gate 3 fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1j0wrn4/astarion_mentioned_in_the_new_monster_manual/">reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/the-baldurs-gate-3-arization-of-dungeons-and-dragons-continues-as-astarion-gets-2-official-mentions-in-the-new-source-books/">GamesRadar</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"Darling, you are simply delicious," Astarion says, atop the Monster Manual page detailing Vampire Spawn (medium or small Undead, Neutral Evil). And this isn't the first time Astarion has popped up in official D&amp;D lore either.
</p>
<p>
Astarion previously popped up in the official D&amp;D Player's Handbook (2024 edition) as seen in an eye-catching piece of artwork for the daylight spell. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/astarion-hed.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Here, Astarion can be spotted tucked away in the bottom right corner, unafflicted by the spell's effects which have begun to burn up all his vampire spawn brethren. (Astarion canonically is immune to sunlight, thanks to the handy plot device of having his illithid tadpole in his brain).
</p>
<p>
Last year's handbook did not specifically confirm it was Astarion in the artwork, but <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/astarion-from-baldurs-gate-3-appears-in-the-2024-players-handbook.706670/">ENWorld</a> later got acknowledgement from the illustration's artist that it was an official appearance by the character, the rights to which are owned by D&amp;D maker Wizards of the Coast.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has now wrapped up work on the game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">one final patch that added in Xbox Series S splitscreen support</a>. The studio has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">now begun work on its next game</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">it won't be Baldur's Gate 4 or anything at all to do with D&amp;D</a>. Still, it's highly likely we will see a new entry in the series launch at some point - even if it is from another developer.
