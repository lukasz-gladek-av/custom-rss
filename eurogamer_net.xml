            <p>Another day, another Nintendo <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leak - this time pertaining to images that purport to be of a Joy-Con for Nintendo's Switch successor.</p>
<p>As Tom reported a little while back, we've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.</p>

<p>Now we have brand-new images of what's reported to be the new generation of Joy-Con controllers with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Reportedly originating from China, the Joy-Con shows off its new magnetic attachment as well as revised colour palette which differs from existing Joy-Cons.</p> <div>

<p>If the images are authentic - and right now, there is no proof - it looks like we can also expect enlarged SL and SR buttons, too, and maybe even a mouse-like optical sensor. You can check the photos out yourself in the X post above or in the subreddit thread embedded below:</p>

            <p>As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs.</p>
<p>Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about "why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat" and discussed "whether or not games treat [violence] as the default".</p>

<p>Acknowledging he's had "pushback on similar answers in the past", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: "The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it".</p>
<p>"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games.</p>
<p>"This is <em>obvious</em>. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take <em>just</em> as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars," he added.</p>
<p>And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a "drop in the bucket", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, "those drops become a storm and companies will listen".</p>
<p>"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent," he added. "It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.</p><p>"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?" Cain said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-co-creator-tim-cain-says-violence-will-be-the-default-in-aaa-rpgs-as-long-as-we-keep-buying-it-companies-dont-make-them-because-they-feel-like-it-they-make-them-because-they-sell/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!"</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Amazon Fallout show? Last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins slipped back into his Ghoulish guise</a> to start filming the second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Runners up were Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers - described as a "beautifully synergistic and strategic deckbuilder", LocalThunk said "people mistakenly wrote this off as a Balatro clone, but this was announced before my game ever was" - Arco, Nova Drift, Ballionaire, and Wrong Organ's exceptional Mouthwashing.</p><p>"I didn't even know this was a horror game when I started playing it at 11pm one fateful night," the developer <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1875284685150142820">said</a>.

But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> fans think they've spotted a clue that the series' signature morality system may be making a comeback in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst developer BioWare has confirmed nothing either way - which means we can only take this with a healthy bucket of salt for now - fans like X user Kalaelizabeth believe they've spotted a sneaky nod to Mass Effect's Paragon/Renegade system hiding in plain sight.</p>

<p>Take the post embedded below, which includes an <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1722012172166025591">official promotional image</a> of the next Mass Effect game that, at first glance, may not be telling us very much at all.</p>
<p>Look a little closer, though, and you can see why fans are drawing the conclusions they are. Regardless of whether or not you believe the image is sneakily acknowledging the morality system is making a return, it's a curious image for BioWare to have shared, especially when super-imposed by the iconic Paragon symbol:</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The flames of speculation have been further fanned by the post Kalaelizabeth was quoting.  BioWare project director and executive producer Michael Gamble recently commented on the series' long-held morality mechanic, acknowledging that although more players opted to be a Paragon - that is, a "good" Shepard - in the original trilogy, how you play is "meaningless" unless the ability to be "bad" also exists.</p>
<p>"Regarding Renegade and Paragon - yes, it’s true that more people played Paragon. But, it would have been meaningless if Renegade had not existed. The ability to choose is stronger than the number of people playing any option, IMO," Gamble tweeted (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-5-paragon-renegade-options-return-not-confirmed/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Does all of this mean Paragon/Renegade is "absolutely returning" for Mass Effect 5? Absolutely not. But it's arguably one of the best interpretations we've had yet as to why BioWare teased such an interesting image...</p>
<p>As for the eagerly-anticipated Mass Effect TV show? An adaptation was first touted back in 2021, when former BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained various factors had contributed to the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-explains-why-the-mass-effect-movie-fell-by-the-wayside">shifting its initial vision of a movie adaptation toward something for the smaller screen</a>. Later that same year, reports surfaced claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">Amazon was "nearing a deal" for a Mass Effect TV series</a>, as part of its ongoing push into sci-fi and fantasy storytelling.</p><p>And now those reports have been confirmed. Variety revealed on the most recent N7 day - 7th November 2024 - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">a Mass Effect TV series is now officially in development at Amazon</a>, with 10 Cloverfield Lane and Fast &amp; Furious 9 (AKA F9: The Fast Saga) scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Markus "Notch" Persson has "basically announced" Minecraft 2.</p>
<p>In an X exchange over the New Year, Persson invited his millions of followers to indicate which project they'd like him to focus on in 2025 - a traditional roguelike mixed with a "tile-based first-person dungeon crawler" or a "spiritual successor" to Minecraft.</p>

<p>In the post asking for "honest and legitimate [...] feedback for once", Persson explained briefly what his dungeon crawler would entail, but then admitted, "but then I gots to thinking that maybe there are people who like my work but might not share my taste in retro nostalgia and would prefer for me to make a spiritual successor thing to Minecraft, and I mean sure, I'd take that cash".</p><div>

<p>At the time of writing, almost a quarter of a million of his followers have left a vote, 78 percent of which have, perhaps unsurprisingly, been in favour of a new Minecraft game, even though he'd asked people to "[please] vote potion. You can do this Zoomers, it's actually super cosy.</p>

<p>A few days later, responding to commenters who missed his original posting, Persson summarised what had happened, saying: "I basically announced Minecraft 2. I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</p>
<p>"I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</p><p>"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic," he added. "The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for.</p>
<p>"I intend for the money to the [sic] spent for good, but my God, have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed."</p>
<p>Persson <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532193227473093">added</a> that he had no non-compete clause in the sale of Minecraft to Microsoft - "there was a one-year period where I couldn't make a game with modifiable terrain or something like that, but I was off in the Maldives during all that, didn't affect any creative decisions" - but did acknowledge that using the Minecraft name "would be super illegal".</p>
<p>"Instead, I'd make a new original game of the same type as Minecraft and call it something else," he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874523772734390380">said</a>. "These are traditionally sometimes referred to as 'spiritual successors', but usually kinda mostly feel a bit flat.</p>
<p>"But, like, if that's actually what people want, I would LOVE to make that game. It'd be my Gremlins 2."</p>
<p>Persson also said that as "a man of [his] word", he intended "to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about".</p>
<p>"And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me," he added.</p>
<p>It's been a busy time for Minecraft. At the end of last year, the game finally received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-after-ps5s-launch-minecraft-finally-gets-a-native-version">PlayStation 5 native version</a>, announced it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ditching-psvr-support-minecraft-is-officially-abandoning-vr-on-pc-from-next-year">ditch PC VR support</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-attractions-set-to-open-in-uk-and-us-as-85m-deal-with-alton-towers-owner-signed">plans to launch Minecraft theme park areas in the US and UK</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
