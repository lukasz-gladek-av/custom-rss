            <p>Industrious Switch fans have started compiling a fan-made list that tracks which Switch 1 games have seen an improvement - or a decline - in performance when running on their new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Nintendo Switch 2</a> consoles.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l49teu/post_your_tested_games_compatibility_or/">over 350 games have been submitted and over 150 of them comprehensively categorised</a>, recording what performance changes players have identified, regardless of whether or not there has been a formal patch or update deployed by the publisher.</p>

<p>For instance, players who have played ARMS on their new Switch systems - for which Nintendo has deployed a free update for all players - believe they see an increased consistency in framerate, both docked and undocked, as well as dynamic resolution scaling in terms of resolution. However, they do not notice much difference in terms of loading times.</p>
<p>By comparison, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a>: Eternal Edition also shows increased consistency in framerates and improved loading times, but that hasn't been formally patched at all.</p>

</span></p><p>As the list owner admits, perceptions of what is or isn't an improvement can often be subjective, of course, and a handful of the hundreds of commenters have chimed in to say their experiences are different from those listed in the spreadsheet. However, the thread "isn't meant to decide whether a game is worth buying (now) for you", but is "purely informational".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> have set new concurrent user records on Steam over the weekend.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, which released 10th June for all, and Stellar Blade, which had its long-anticipated PC debut on 11th, both launched with comparatively few problems, and their success has been underlined by the number of players getting stuck in over the weekend. At the time of writing, Dune: Awakening has secured an all-time concurrent peak of 175.5K players, and Stellar Blade 192K.</p>

<p>That puts both games in the top ten of most-played games of the weekend, with just <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and Apex Legends attracting more players.</p>
<p>The PlayStation-published Stellar Blade made its way onto PC earlier this week and within hours of release, it was already the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">most successful PlayStation-published single-player game on the platform by concurrent count</a>.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>In comparison, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690. Only Helldivers 2 has attracted more players at once, but that's, of course, a multiplayer title.</p>
<p>Dune Awakening soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release, quickly surpassing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five-day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within hours of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players and currently has a concurrent record of 175K.</p>
<p>Not sure if either game is for you? In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review</a>, we noted it "has a fair bit of weirdness", but " its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced". Meanwhile, Connor's having a great time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Dune: Awakening thus far, writing in our review-in-progress</a>: "It's too early for a full review, but as of right now, I see little reason not to recommend giving Dune Awakening's unique offering a chance."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals update finally has a release date: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPWdMDZWM4Y">17th June</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-because-it-simply-wasnt-built-that-way">We've known for some time</a> that Mojang was planning on a visual overhaul for Minecraft, and yesterday (14th June), the studio released a new video not only reminding us just what Vibrant Visuals brings to the game, improving "visual elements such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, and more", but also how the team achieved it.</p>

<p>And the new feature really does elevate the world of Minecraft. As the developer explains, "every biome has their own atmosphere", so warmer biomes will look more orange and yellowish, while cooler ones will take on a crisper blue appearance.</p>
<p>"This is a visual enhancement - there are no changes to Minecraft's gameplay," Mojang said. "For example, visual shadows will not impact light levels in a game-mechanics sense, or affect where hostile mobs spawn. Vibrant Visuals will be easy to access and approachable for many more Minecraft players, as it will be available on many platforms as a simple menu toggle."</p>
<p>"This is a start on this journey of modernising the look and feel of Minecraft," explained Vibrant Visuals Lead, Dejan Dimic. "So we look forward to hearing more feedback from the players."</p>
<p>Vibrant Visuals is coming to supported devices for those running Minecraft Bedrock Edition, and if your device can run it, you can expect the new feature to be on by default once it updates. It still isn't yet available for Java, but Mojang insists it's "actively working" on it.</p>

<p>Did you catch the news that the roster of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is expanding outside of the Sonic universe to include other Sega characters and beyond</a>? As announced at last week's Summer Game Fest, joining the likes of Sonic, Tails and Knuckles, will be Joker from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>, Ichiban from the Like A Dragon games, Vocaloid artist Hatsune Miku, and - the reason why I'm making this seemingly nonsensical tangent - Steve from Minecraft, too.</p>
<p>It is, of course, a flagship year for Minecraft, thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-jockeys-past-550m-at-the-box-office">unbridled popularity</a> of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">cinema-trashing</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">live-action movie adaptation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another day, another Red Dead rumour, but this one comes from John Marston himself - or, at least, the actor who brings him to life, Rob Wiethoff.</p>
<p>In his latest Red Dead Redemption livestream, as spotted by F4D3broboi on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean/">Reddit</a>, Wiethoff was very excited indeed about an upcoming announcement. And while he was coy about the details, he did stress that he was particularly excited playing "<em>this</em> game" - the original Red Dead Redemption - and even suggested we'll know by this time next week.</p>

By the end of this week, hopefully sooner, you're going to - not this week, I guess; probably not as soon as tomorrow, but definitely before Fridayâ€¦ Oh my goodness, the news that I have to share, and I won't be the only one sharing it.</p>

<p>This latest tease comes just days after we heard another rumour that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">Red Dead Redemption 2 may be getting a next-gen update alongside a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>. YouTuber Nate the Hate stated the cowboy classic will receive the update and a port to Nintendo's latest console release later this year.</p>
<p>The original Red Dead Redemption released way back in May 2010. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-review?page=3">We awarded it 8/10</a>, calling it "an exceptional Rockstar game, one that successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario".
