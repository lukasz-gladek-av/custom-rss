            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> team is gearing up for the first patch since its release earlier this year. Actually, it is working on two patches at the moment, with those who are part of the Steam Beta getting first dibs.</p>
<p>The first of these two patches will focus on "quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes," the developer said. Those on the Beta path will be able to experience these changes from today, 5th June. The rest of us will then follow next week, on 11th June.</p>
<p>A second patch will be released at a later date, though we don't know when just now, and this chap will be focused on Oblivion Remastered's performance.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> may be getting a next gen update alongside a port to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyhMv3N8UKk&amp;t=597s">Nate the Hate's Xbox Showcase Predictions video</a>, the leaker stated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' cowboy classic will receive the update and a port to Nintendo's latest console release later this year. It follows reports of a Switch 2 port from last month, adding to its veracity.</p>
<p>Nate the Hate previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">Switch 2 reveal would be imminent back in January of this year</a>, and also noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">Xbox would be bringing more of its third-party games to other platforms</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hi-fi-rush-on-ps5-and-the-xbox-multi-platform-story-so-far">Hi-Fi Rush's departure to the PS5</a>. There's a track record of accuracy there, though given these are still leaks take them with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>He elaborated this Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 would come "a few months" following the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, speculating a late summer / early autumn window. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Given that the Switch 2 is out today</a>, that means if this is true the timer starts… Now.</p>
<p>This comes following another report by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">GameReactor</a>, stating a Switch 2 port will be coming later this year. So this isn't a rumour out of the blue, there are multiple voices stating it'll happen in the near future.</p>
<p>Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-switch-2-as-take-two-boss-praises-nintendos-console">recently praised the Switch 2</a>, and the industry giant has multiple other games set to release on the platform including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nba-2k24">NBA 2K</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't had a chance to play it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-review-9">Red Dead Redemption 2 is a fantastic open world game</a> that absolutely earned its consumer and critical acclaim since releasing back in 2018. If it does come to the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">it'll join Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which could make the console a grand starting point for a dive into vast open worlds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Monolith Soft has officially announced the company helped with the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The developer, which previously assisted with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-2">Splatoon 2</a> <a href="https://x.com/MONOLITHSOFT/status/1930459571275084157">has stated on social media</a> it developed the "fields and character designs" for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> racing game.</p>
<p>The studio has a history of open world video game development, becoming something of an expert in that particular area given the time spent on recent Zelda titles as well as its own Xenoblade releases. As such it makes sense why Nintendo would bring Monolith Soft over for Mario Kart World given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">the games' shift to a non-linear format</a>.</p>

<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-now-fully-owns-xenoblade-studio-monolith-soft">Nintendo became the sole owner of Monolith Soft</a> after years of holding roughly 80 percent of the company since 2007. In 2011, Nintendo would increase its stake to 97 percent of the company, after which those working there contributed to popular Nintendo series like Animal Crossing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a>, and Zelda.</p>
<p>In recent years, Monolith Soft has largely been known for its ongoing Xenoblade series. In 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> was released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-a-jrpg-masterpiece">to high critical praise</a>, and would continue this trend in 2025 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>.</p>
<p>The original version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> was something of a technical marvel in the Wii U, and its Switch version brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-tech-review">that same quality packaged with various visual updates</a>, dynamic resolution scaling, and greater environment detail among other tweaks and improvements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, we got our first good look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s upcoming James Bond game, 007: First Light. While the developer has said that First Light - or as it was previously known, Project 007 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">will serve as an origin story for the spy</a>, and not be a "gamification" of any of the films that have come before, last night's trailer still had a fair few nods to Bonds of the past.</p>
<p>Please note, I will be talking about events from the James Bond series generally below, <strong>so please be aware of potential spoilers for the films and books if you haven't already enjoyed them for yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>First up, there is this Bond's facial scar. As you can see in the trailer above, this young Bond may be fresh faced when it comes to life as an agent, but he has clearly had a few scrapes already, earning himself a long thin scar down his cheek.</p>
<p>While the Bonds in the films have not boasted a scar like this, the book version of Bond did. Ian Flemming wrote that Bond had a three-inch long, thin vertical scar running down his right cheek. You can see some artwork of this book-based Bond below.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ian Fleming's image of James Bond; commissioned to aid the Daily Express comic strip artists</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, given his overall look in the game, many have surmised that the actor playing James Bond in First Light is Patrick Gibson from Dexter: Original Sin (I have asked IO if they can confirm this).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paramount</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to this physical trait, there are also multiple other nods to the James Bond book and film series scattered throughout First Light's trailer that hint to the story, such as Bond's parents dying in a climbing-related accident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the trailer says 009 is a "master manipulator", which made me think this was a little tease for him being a bit of a bad egg that fooled and betrayed his country a la Sean Bean's 006 from GoldenEye. A little number flip there from IO?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>On the cars and gadget side of things, because of course Bond is going to have cars and gadgets, First Light again is honouring the series that has come before.</p>
<p>In IO's trailer, Bond can be seen entering Q branch, where he selects one from a number of watches. This watch obviously does more than tell the time, and triggers a blast from a nearby motorbike, which again is in keeping with Bond's watches from the series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While in the Sean Connory era, Bond often sported a Rolex Submariner, in many of the later films he changed things up a bit, with the agent wearing watches such as a Pulsar LED digital and a Seiko 0674 LC at times. </p>
<p>In 2006's Casino Royale, which marked Daniel Craig's first outing as the MI6 agent, Vesper Lynd commented on Bond's watch: "Rolex?" she asks. "Omega," he replies. Bond's watches are a big deal, and in First Light, <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1930380893811610084">IO has partnered with Omega</a> once again.</p>

<p>Speaking of partnering with a known Bond-brand again, of course we will see the agent in an Aston Martin in First Light.</p>
<figure>

<p>This vehicle is slicker than Moore's bus from Live and Let Die, but it is the same as the actors' yellow Aston Martin DBS from The Persauders, so another little nod to the series' legacy.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can see IO's Bond chasing down a red sports car in the First Light trailer, which reminded me a bit of the playful chase between Pierce Brosnan's Bond and Xenia Onatopp in GoldenEye.</p>

<p>Setting the scene further, then, we also saw a chess game being played during last night's trailer. Now, we don't clearly see <em>who </em>is playing chess here, so it could be Bond flexing his prowess like he often does at cards. And is that a martini, shaken not stirred?</p>

<p>That said, in From Russia with Love, there is a scene where Bond baddy Kronsteen plays chess, so as soon as I saw this moment in the First Light trailer, I thought of that. Essentially, baddies play chess, right?</p>

<p>There is a clip towards the end of the trailer where a speed boat zips through some islands very much like those from The Man With the Golden Gun (Khao Phing Kan, but known also as James Bond Island, no less). This is one of my favourite James Bond locations, so I was pleased to see this pop up. </p>

<p>Also, the Junks in this scene are much like those of Scaramanger's.</p>

<p>Last up for this piece (I am sure I will be doing more, because guys, it's Bond!), the music played over the trailer was the theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. You can have a listen to it below. </p>

<p>007: First Light is set for release in 2026. Towards the end of last year, IO said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week">007: First Light will also feature again later this week during IO's own showcase</a>, which is scheduled for Friday, 6th June, at 6pm PDT. That's 2am on 7th June for those of us in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
