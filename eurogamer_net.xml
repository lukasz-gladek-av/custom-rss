Two years on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2025">FM25</a>'s initial announce, we finally have our first proper look at actual gameplay from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a>, the game that supplanted it after FM25's troubled and ultimately cancelled development.
</p>
<p>
It's only a brief tease for now: a one minute, 12 second trailer focusing on footage from the new match engine, developed in Unity for the first time. Here's that trailer for you to have a look:

<p>
An immediate stand-out is the level of visual detail. Stadiums and crowds are significantly improved, looking a bit like a FIFA game from the mid-00s. That might sound like an insult, or back-handed compliment at best, but the differences in what these two types of game are doing under the hood are stark - and Football Manager has to run on significantly less powerful hardware at the same time.
</p><p>
As for other changes, you can read much more in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-football-manager-interview-series-boss-miles-jacobson-on-what-went-wrong-with-fm25-and-what-to-expect-from-fm26">our massive Football Manager 25 and 26 interview</a> with series boss and Sports Interactive studio head Miles Jacobson from just a few days ago, where he details the anatomy of an annualised game cancellation in full - from exactly what happened with FM25, to telling Sega about the need to pull the plug, and then what to expect from FM26 itself. We've a little extra from that interview to come too, so keep your eyes on the site for more Football Manager goodness.

<p>"When adventurer Lara Croft discovers a trail of stolen African Orisha masks, she joins forces with her best friend Sam to retrieve the precious artifacts," reads the season two description. "Lara's thrilling new adventure takes her around the globe as she delves deeper into the hidden secrets of Orisha history, dodging the machinations of a dangerous and enigmatic billionaire who wants the masks for herself, while discovering these relics contain dark secrets and a power that defies logic. Power that may, in fact, be divine."</p>
<p>Hayley Atwell returns for the second season as the voice of Lara Croft, as does Earl Baylon as Jonah. Joining the cast this season is Karen Fukuhara, who is known for The Boys and Suicide Squad. Fukuhara will voice Sam, a character first introduced in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot.</p>
