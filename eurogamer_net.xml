            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, Sega accidentally leaked sales figures for a number of its key franchises, revealing - among others - the sales of its open zone game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>.</p>
<p>The numbers were accidentally included on the company's latest fiscal report and have since been swiftly removed, but not before fans shared the numbers on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sammy-fiscal-report-mishap-reveals-sales-numbers-for-a-dozen-titles-lad-iw-1-66m-p3r-2-07m-sonic-frontiers-4-57m-p5r-7-25m-and-more.1224501/">ResetEra</a>.</p>
<p>Total sales of Sonic Frontiers were 4.57m, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> was 2.43m, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> was 3.5m. Meanwhile, as officially revealed by the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> sold 2.3m units.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the leak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> has sold 7.25m units - as expected - while Persona 3 Reload just 2.07m units. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth sold 1.66m units, and Like A Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name just 960,000.</p>
<p>Sega also officially revealed Metaphor: ReFantazio sold 2m units.</p>
<p>The company critically had a great year in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> was well received by series fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was an outstanding new RPG, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> was one of the best-reviewed Sonic games in recent memory. But this reception seemingly hasn't translated to strong sales.</p>
<p>Still, the figure for Sonic Frontiers does stand out. Released back in 2022, it proves the game has had a long sales tail - even if that's been spurred on by discounts. And, as the pre-eminent 3D game in the series, its sales have continued alongside both the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 films.</p>
<p>Back in November 2022, Sonic Team head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">Takashi Iizuka stated Sonic Frontiers' open zone design was the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>. There will be high hopes, then, for its presumed sequel.</p>
<p>Sonic Frontiers established the "open zone" design (rather than open world), which emphasised exploration as well as speed and took advantage of current hardware technology (despite its egregious pop-in).</p>
<p>Sonic Superstars, released a year later, has just over half the sales of Sonic Frontiers. A 2D game, it perhaps didn't sit well with fans after the forward-thinking Frontiers.</p>
<p>As for Sonic X Shadow Generations, it has sold well since its release last year, spurred on by the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film. However, it's still a remake of an older game. And it seems, as much as Sega trades in nostalgia, it's the open zone advancement in design that fans have responded to with their wallets.</p>
<p>The fact Team Sonic Racing has outsold more traditional platformers also bodes well for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Team Sonic is heading in the right direction, and expectations will be high for the original game that follows Sonic Frontiers.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">discussed with Iizuka recently</a>, Sonic has gone from "fighting to survive" to a global megastar in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>"When I moved over from Tokyo to Los Angeles, it was like an â€˜oh my god' moment," Iizuka said. "Like, we need to save the brand, or this brand isn't going to be around for much longer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-leaked-sales-figures-show-sonics-new-frontier-is-heading-in-the-right-direction]]></content:encoded>
