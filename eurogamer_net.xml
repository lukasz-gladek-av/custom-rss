            <p>
Bethesda has finally lifted the lid on The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered, shown off its shiny new gameplay - and launched it to play now. 
</p>
<p>
In a video posted this afternoon, we've got our first official look at the new Oblivion after weeks of leaks, blurry screenshots and other teases of information. 
</p>
<p>
Oblivion has been remade by Paris-based port studio Virtuos in collaboration with Bethesda, and this new version is a ground-up remake built in Unreal Engine 5.

<figcaption>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake reveal video.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed_E2crglcw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oblivion Remake includes story expansions The Shivering Isles and The Knights of the Nine, as well as various other bits and pieces: the Fighter's Stronghold expansion, Spell Tome Treasures, Vile Lair, Mehrune's Razor, The Thieves Den, Wizard's Tower, Orrery, and Horse Pack Armour.</p>
<p>You can purchase it now via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqr437k7pqh?hl=en-gb&amp;gl=US">Microsoft Store</a>, where it costs £50, or £60 for a Deluxe Edition. It's also on Game Pass, and launches today too on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition includes "new quests for unique Akatosh and Mehrunes Dagon armour, weapons and horse armour sets", because of course, plus access to an artbook and soundtrack app.</p>
<p>Changes include a refreshed levelling system and more modern controls - including sprinting, which Bethesda says was something the team debated over adding, but ultimately decided was required in a modern game.</p>
<p>"Obviously we're working on the sixth chapter here," Bethesda boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> said in today's video, "but what's great about The Elder Scrolls is being able to look back at all of the chapters: Skyrim, Morrowind, Oblivion, Daggerfall, Arena. Each of them try to define role-playing games and open-world games for their generation.
</p>
<p>"Oblivion was a real defining moment in the series and how we make games as a studio."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

L-l-l-lava. Ch-ch-ch-chicken. Steve's Lava Chicken is tasty as hell. 
</p>
<p>
And with that, you've heard a good portion of the lyrics to A Minecraft Movie's latest viral sensation - Steve's Lava Chicken -  which has now entered the UK's official music chart.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, at 34 seconds long, the track is the shortest ever entry in the official UK top 40, according to the UK's <a href="https://x.com/ERALTD/status/1914607904235147588">Digital Entertainment and Retail Association</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steves-lava-chicken-from-a-minecraft-movie-the-shortest-song-ever-to-debut-on-uks-official-chart">IGN</a>).

The ditty, not suitable for vegetarians, explains what happens when you add lava to a chicken in Minecraft. In A Minecraft Movie, Jack Black's Steve sings the refrain as he cooks a chicken, to the nonplussed reactions of the rest of the cast.
</p>
<p>
In real life, well, this is Jack Black being wheeled out to perform another viral movie moment, just a couple of years after Jack Black's Bowser went viral for Peaches, his song in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. (At 95 seconds, you get more than double the Jack Black in that one.)

After another weekend in cinemas, A Minecraft Movie is edging closer to The Super Mario Bros. Movie's overall box office record, too. The film, which also stars Jason Momoa and Emma Myers, has now passed $720m (£538m) worldwide, with Mario's total of $1.3bn (£970m) in its sights.
</p>
<p>
A Minecraft Movie may not have impressed critics, but fans have flocked to the film to see its meme-worthy antics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">including its now-infamous Chicken Jockey scene</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">cinemas have asked kids to stop going feral</a> while watching.
</p>
<p>A sequel now seems assured, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">director Jared Hess has already discussed what he thinks A Minecraft Movie 2's focus will be</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bend Studio has announced "most" of the new accessibility features arriving with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> Remastered are coming to PC as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-definitive-edition-announced-for-pc-and-ps5">Days Gone Remastered is set to release on PS5 and PC</a> later this week, on 25th April. Along with souped-up visuals, there are fresh Permadeath and Speedrun modes all waiting for players to enjoy on the game's release.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has included some new accessibility features for the remastered version of Days Gone.</p>

<p>"One of the biggest accessibility expansions coming to Days Gone Remastered is a fully customisable High Contrast Mode," wrote Bend Studio's Kevin McAllister, with the developer stating this "pairs with our High Contrast HUD that was implemented in the original game to assist with easier navigation and visibility".</p>
<p>Players will be able to make the most of this feature from the off, with subtitles, High Contrast Mode and more options available via Days Gone Remastered's initial setup screen, which is another new addition.</p>
<p>Speaking of subtitles, the development team has added 11 colours for users to choose from. These can be mixed and matched for things like the speaker's name and the subtitle text. Subtitle backgrounds can also be changed, with Bend adding more options for users than before. "Now, you can select between default (transparent), darkened, light, and black,"  McAllister explained.</p>
<p>On the audio side of things, Bend has added UI Narration and Collectible Audio Cues for Days Gone Remastered.</p>

<p>"At Bend Studio, we strive to create experiences that leave a lasting impact on our players," McAllister closed. "The pursuit of allowing players of all abilities to share our joy of play together inspires our work every day. We hope you enjoy the definitive version of our open world epic, and we can't wait to see you hop on the Drifter bike and experience all Days Gone Remastered has to offer."</p>
<p>Those on PC who want to make the most of these new features will need to update their game to a version higher than Build ID 10034136 via Patch 1.08. The developer added that UI Narration is <em>not </em>supported for Broken Road DLC on PC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, users will need to make sure they have a compatible controller for things such as haptic feedback and customised controls.</p>

<p>Not played Days Gone for yourself yet? Our review from 2019 complimented its "frequently gorgeous" open world, however noted the game could often be "generic" and one that "runs out of steam well before its extended play-time is over".</p>
<p>"I wasn't expecting Days Gone to add anything new to the genre, but both in terms of its systems and its story it's uninspired, which is driven home by the fact that it's endlessly, needlessly long," Malindy Hetfeld wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-review-a-shallow-copy-of-many-better-open-world-action-games">Eurogamer's original Days Gone review</a>.</p>

            <p>OutRun is the next video game to be reportedly getting itself a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>As revealed by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">Deadline</a>, sources say Universal is planning to release a film based on Sega's arcade video game, with with Michael Bay - known for the likes of Bad Boys, The Rock ("Welcome to The Rock!") and the first five films in the Transformers film series - acting as director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Euphoria and The White Lotus actress Sydney Sweeney is attached to produce the film, with Jayson Rothwell on writing duties. Rothwell's previous credits include <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4139588/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Polar (2019)</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2347497/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Silent Night (2012)</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397753/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Zemanovaload (2005)</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, further details are fairly thin on the ground. In the words of Deadline, "plot details are vague". Given its source material, though, we can assume that it will have something to do with racing. Perhaps, more specifically, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-of-the-best-cars">racing in a Ferrari</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Martin Robinson wrote a feature dedicated to OutRun back in 2019.</p>
<p>"I've made OutRun's journey countless times over the years, whether that's in one of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>'s virtual Hong Kong arcades, via M2's phenomenal 3DS port or more recently its Switch effort," he wrote in his snappily titled article <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outrun-is-still-the-pinnacle-of-driving-games">OutRun is still the pinnacle of driving games</a>.</p>
<p>"Such platforms can only deliver a sliver of the full experience, though - playing OutRun on the deluxe cabinet is a revelation. It's an all-body experience, a kind of funky alternative to virtual reality that plays to all of your senses."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in video game to big screen news, earlier this month a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-teaser-for-five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-is-here">new teaser trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was revealed</a>. Additionally back in January, Sony announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers 2 were both being adapted into films</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
