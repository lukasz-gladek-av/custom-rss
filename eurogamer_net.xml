            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/botany-manor">Botany Manor</a> - the beautiful, bucolic country house puzzler from developer Balloon Studios - is finally PlayStation-bound, and will be planting itself on PS4 and PS5 from 17th December.
</p>
<p>
Botany Manor, which released for Xbox and PC earlier, whisks players to Somerset, England on an almost impossibly Mediterranean summer's day in 1890. Here, they'll embark on a wonderfully serene journey through the life of retired botanist Arabella Greene, which unfolds as they explore her sprawling, memorabilia-strewn home - the Botany Manor of the title - doing a sport of genteel first-person puzzling as they go.
</p>
<p>
Central to Botany Manor's puzzles is the Herbarium – a book of pressed plants for scientific study - which players gradually fill in by combining and cross-referencing clues found around Arabella's home, slowly uncovering how the fantastical flowers detailed within will bloom out in the wild. Its conundrums can only be fully completed, however, once freshly procured seeds have been teased to life by replicating the process in the book using artificial means.

<p>
It's soothing, quietly brilliant stuff, Botany Manor's puzzles gradually increasingly in complexity in a way that really encourages players to explore their beautiful surroundings and immerse themselves in Arabella's world. "Perhaps an afternoon in Botany Manor's company will inflame your own curiosity for nature," I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">wrote in my four star review</a> earlier this year, "or perhaps you'll simply be content to explore its sun-dabbled corners, solve its few clever puzzles, and enjoy the timeless pleasures of an enchanting summer's day stroll."
</p><p>
Botany Manor is a genuinely lovely thing, and - I imagine - a perfect summery escape for PlayStation owners who'll be firing it up as the icy embrace of winter draws near. And if that appeals, it'll cost £20.99/$24.99 USD when it launches for PS5 and PS4 on 17th December.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-coming-to-pc-in-2025-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, the well-received sci-fi action-adventure from developer Shift Up, is targeting a 2025 release on PC, and the studio says it expects sales to exceed those seen on console.
</p>
<p>
Stellar Blade, which tells the story of sword-wielding soldier Eve as she attempts to liberate Earth from a monstrous alien threat known as the Naytibas, released exclusively for PlayStation 5 back in April, going on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-totals-61m-units-sold-as-hardware-sales-continue-to-fall">sell 1m copies by the end of June</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now Shift Up has announced plans to follow that success with a PC version at some point next year. The news was shared in the developer's <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">Q3 2024 earnings report</a>, where it said a Stellar Blade PC release was "being considered within 2025". It then added that due to "Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles."

<p>
Black Myth: Wukong, for context, was a barnstorming success when it released in August, managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">sell 10m copies across PC and PS5 in just three days</a> and quickly becoming the most-viewed game on Chinese livestreaming platforms. And while Shift Up's targets for Stellar Blade on PC are likely to be considerably more modest, the developer still has positive expectations for the game's ongoing popularity.
</p><p>
"To enhance the IP value and maintain momentum, we have been consistently releasing content patches and updates, which has helped sustain the game's popularity," it noted of the PS5 version, adding that, "With the addition of the Nier: Automata DLC and ongoing marketing activities, we plan to maintain the IP's popularity until the platform expansion."
</p>
<p>
Stellar Blade's Nier: Automata DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-nier-automata-dlc-drops-later-this-month">launches for PS5 on 20th November</a>, and there's also a "no ponytail" hair option for Eve, plus a new photo mode, on the way.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's  Jessica Orr awarded Stellar Blade four stars when she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">reviewed it earlier this year</a>. "[There's] a fair bit of weirdness," she wrote, "but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."

            <p>
If you've been looking forward to your second dose of fungi-orientated misery, there's some good news: HBO has narrowed down the release date for season two of its highly acclaimed The Last of Us live-action adaptation, confirming it's now targeting "spring" 2025.
</p>
<p>
The inevitable second season of The Last of Us (inevitable given the original season was both a critical and commercial smash, managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">win eight Emmys</a> and attract an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">average of 32m viewers per episode</a> the US) was announced in January 2023, just two weeks after the first episode aired. Then, last December, HBO confirmed the show was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">targeting a "2025" release</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, HBO and Max content CEO and chairman Casey Bloys has narrowed that window down further, revealing - during a 2025 programming slate presentation (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/max-reveals-new-release-date-details-for-the-last-of-us-season-2-and-peacemaker-season-2">IGN</a>) - that The Last of US season two will launch in "spring" next year.

<p>
As to what The Last of Us' second season will entail, showrunner Craig Mazin has already confirmed it'll be delving into the events of developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us Part 2, albeit with the game's storyline being split across more than one season. 
</p><p>
"We don't think that we're going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we're taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too," Mazin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">explained</a> earlier this year. "We feel like it's almost assuredly going to be the case that - as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television - season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four."
</p>
<p>
HBO also previously confirmed season two will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">feature a slightly shorter episode count</a>, coming it at seven episodes compared to season one's nine. "The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster," Mazin said in an interview at the time. "When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the [natural] breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes."
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two sees the return of Bella Ramsey as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel, with currently announced newcomers including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, Isabela Merced as Dina, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, and Catherine O'Hara in an unannounced role. Oh, and fans can also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">expect</a> "a lot more infected", according to Mazin.
</p>
<p>
HBO released a new trailer for The Last of Us' second season back in September, and you can read series aficionado Victoria Kennedy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">thorough breakdown of its shots</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer. If nothing else, it'll tide you over until spring next year.
