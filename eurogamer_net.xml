            <p>MachineGames' most recent release may be the brilliant Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but the studio is of course also known for its Wolfenstein games. And, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-doesnt-sound-like-weve-heard-the-last-from-machinegames-wolfenstein-series">following an earlier hint that the studio wasn't finished with its nazi-busting series</a>, we now have more concrete word on the fate of MachineGames' Wolfenstein trilogy.</p>

<p>This word comes from studio director Jerk Gustafsson, who was chatting with Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry</a> about MachineGames' 15 year legacy. During this conversation, Gustafsson admitted that because of the time it takes to make a video game in this day and age, he may only have a few more projects left in him before the end of his career.</p>
<p>"There's so many things that I would like to do, but I'm also getting a bit older, so I don't have that many games left in me," he said. "It takes a long time to make a game now, and let's say that we release one every four years, then maybe two more, maybe three if I'm lucky."</p>
<p>So, could one of these hypothetical projects be Wolfenstein 3? While Gustafsson was careful with his answer, he did say this:</p>
<p>"Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein. We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say."</p>

<p>As for the more immediate future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">MachineGames is set to release Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on Switch 2 later this year</a>. Like I have said, this game is brilliant, and I loved being able to whip crack my way across the globe with Indy.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">original five star Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv">Wolfenstein TV series in the works</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Bethesda's Todd Howard is staying tight-lipped on how things are progressing</a>.</p>

            <p>A new report has claimed that Gears of War E-Day is eyeing a release window in the second half of 2026, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> tentatively targeting a launch some time this Summer.</p>
<p>This report, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad">written by The Verge's Tom Warren</a>, claims that Microsoft wants both Gears of War E-Day and Fable to dodge the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, with Tom Warren writing: "I understand Microsoft has a good idea of when both should launch, but it's also keen to avoid being too close to Grand Theft Auto VI's November 19th date."</p>
<p>The report also touches on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> Remake, which The Verge reports is in "active development". The article also states that Bethesda wants the game to reach a similar bar of quality as the Oblivion Remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-in-the-shadow-of-skyrims-mountains-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-still-matters">which was well-received in part due to its faithfulness and level of polish</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, The Verge reports that Double Fine's The Kiln is aiming for an April release, and new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> content is due for a reveal soon. All of this comes with a caveat, with Warren sensibly writing: "Don't be surprised if any of these game dates slip or change -- such is the reality of video game development."</p><p>If these release windows are accurate, which they may very well be (The Verge has a solid track record with this stuff), then Microsoft certainly has a packed 2026. Fable, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">which we already know is due to launch some time this Autumn</a>, recently got a dedicated showcase in an Xbox Developer Direct. There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, set in Japan and landing on the 19th May.</p>
<p>If these dates and release windows are accurate, what do you reckon of Xbox line-up this year? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <p>
Craig Mazin, showrunner on HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-wins-series-another-emmy">award-winning The Last of Us adaptation</a>, has confirmed he's giving <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> the TV treatment next, with the new show set to continue the story of the acclaimed fantasy RPG - although developer Larian seemingly won't be directly involved.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/baldurs-gate-hbo-craig-mazin-1236654094/">Variety</a>, HBO is developing the Baldur's Gate 3 TV adaptation, hot of the success of its live-action The Last of Us series, with Mazin serving as both as showrunner and executive producer on the new project.
</p>
<p>
In a statement accompanying the news, Mazin claimed he'd put "nearly 1000 hours" into the video game version of Baldur's Gate 3. "It is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created," he said. "I am a devoted fan of D&amp;D and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can't wait to help bring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can."
</p>
<p>
Francesca Orsi, HBO's executive vice president and head of drama, added that Mazin's "deep and long-standing passion for the source material paired with his remarkable talent for building immersive worlds filled with rich, compelling characters promises groundbreaking results."
</p>
<p>
After news of the adaptation broken, The Games Awards' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2019563522339082576?s=20">took to social media</a>, claiming Larian had told him directly the studio - which officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-bids-final-farewell-for-real-this-time">wrapped up work</a> on Baldur's Gate 3 last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">moving away from D&amp;D</a> - has "no involvement in the series." Larian boss Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019648134645957061?s=20">later confirmed</a> no Larian writers were consulting on the adaptation 'to his knowledge', but did note Mazin had reached out "to ask if he could come over to the studio to speak with us. From the conversation we had, I think he truly is a big fan which gives me hope."
</p><p>
"We worked incredibly hard on making Baldur's Gate 3 worthy of its legacy," Vincke wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2019646146587525143?s=20">separate social media post</a>. "Its characters and narratives are the result of many teams working together and I think I can speak for them all in saying that they'll think this is cool and hope that what comes next will enjoy the same level of passion."
</p>
<p>
"The endings of BG3 were created so they could serve as narrative soil for new adventure," he continued. "There's plenty of directions they could go. I'm eager to find out which ones Craig and his team will pick. He's reached out for a chat so we'll have the opportunity to tell him our thoughts."
</p>
<p>
Larian director of publishing Michael Douse also <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2019572415878070680?s=20">shared his thoughts</a>, writing, "I've spent the last eight to 10 years of my life with the writers and creators of Baldur's Gate 3 and they're the most incredible storytellers and creators in the space. Only hope is that they get both the credit deserved and the characters are represented at the same level as the game.
</p>
<p>
"Our stories are built by fierce comeraderie and resolve," Douse added. "I have watched them write and write and write and through respect for audience and material come up with some of the finest shit I have ever played. I hope TV allows for the same thoroughness."
</p><p>
There's no word on when HBO might be looking to bring its Baldur's Gate 3 adaptation to air, but Mazin will be tied up with his The Last of Us show for a little while longer at least. While Mazin had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">previously confirmed a four-season plan</a> for his post-apocalyptic series, insisting there was "no way" its story could be wrapped up sooner, HBO boss Casey Bloys <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">recently indicated season three will be its last</a>. "It certainly seems that way," he told Deadline, "but on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners."
