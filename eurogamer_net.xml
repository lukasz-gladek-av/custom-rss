A message posted by the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> development team has thanked fans of the franchise for "the sheer amount of love and positivity" received since the game's long-awaited launch last week, which, the team said, had been "incredibly heartwarming".
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows had a particularly rocky road to release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">beset by delays</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">numerous online controversies</a>, and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">uncertain future for publisher Ubisoft in general</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">four days and two million players later</a> - the end result appears to be a game the Assassin's Creed fanbase has taken to warmly, with numerous positive threads on the Assassin's Creed reddit, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">Very Positive user rating on Steam</a> from those who have played.

"This weekend, many of us on the Dev Team spent time reading your reactions across the Assassin's Creed subreddit - and we just want to say thank you," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ji1c9q/thank_you_a_message_from_the_assassins_creed/">message from the Ubisoft Quebec development team</a> stated. "The sheer amount of love and positivity we've received has been incredibly heartwarming."
</p>
<p>
The team's message comes in response to a popular thread on the Assassin's Creed subreddit over the weekend with over 2.3k upvotes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1jhpbax/thank_you_to_the_assassins_creed_shadows_team/">sending thanks to the Shadows team for a job well done</a>, with particular praise for the game's visuals, combat and exploration mechanics.
</p>
<p>
"We came across this post in particular," the team continued, referencing that fan thread, "and it really moved us. Seeing your excitement, your thoughtful reactions, and your joy has meant the world to us. After years of hard work, there's nothing more rewarding than watching the community connect with what we've created.
</p>
<p>
"While we don't reply directly, please know we're listening. The entire Dev Team has been reading your posts - the celebrations, the feedback, the theories - and it's been inspiring. It fuels us. And it helps us keep improving."
</p>
<p>
The Assassin's Creed Shadows team closed with a nod to the future, and the game continuing to change and grow over the coming months through future patches and expansions - the first of which comes free to anyone who pre-ordered the game.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you for being part of this journey with us. This is just the beginning for Shadows, and we're thrilled to see the game evolve with you by our side.
</p>
<p>
"'Where other men blindly follow the truth, remember... nothing is true.'"
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.

            <p>In the words of Lady Gaga, baby I was born this way. Errr, excuse me, what does that have to do with Minecraft, Victoria? OK, I admit opening like this may be a bit tenuous, but it's the song that got stuck in my head after I read a recent interview with Minecraft developer Mojang, so I am going with it.</p>
<p>While some developers have made the switch to free-to-play, such as Blizzard with the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, Mojang won't be doing the same with Minecraft. Why? Because it wasn't born that way! (Oooh, I get it now.)</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world">IGN</a>, executive producer Ingela Garneij said Mojang's game wasn't made to be a free-to-play release. "Yeah, it doesn't really work with the way we built it," Garneij explained.</p>

<p>When the topic of a hypothetical free-to-play Minecraft came up, the executive producer said the studio "built the game for a different purpose" and therefore, "monetisation doesn't work in that way for us".</p>
<p>Said Garneij: "It's a purchase of the game and then that's it. For us it's important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that's a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>"It's the best deal in the world."</p>

<p>As as this little nugget of information, this weekend we also got a sizable list of announcements thanks to Minecraft Live 2025.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of everything announced in a handy list:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First game drop of the year</strong>: Mojang's Agnes Larsson introduced the next game drop, Spring to Life, which launches on 25th March 2025 and features the following:</li>
<li>New mob variants for the pig, cow, and chicken: Besides the original pig, cow, and chicken, <strong>warm and cold pigs/cows/chickens</strong> can be found in sandy biomes and chilly biomes respectively.</li>
<li><strong>Sheep spawning</strong>: Sheep have adapted to the climate and most brown sheep now spawn in sandy biomes, black sheep in chilly biomes, and white sheep in green biomes. The famously rare pink sheep are unchanged and can still be found in all climates.</li>
<li><strong>New wolf variant sounds</strong>: When a wolf spawns, it will now get one of seven personalities, unrelated to their variant or biome. From cute to grumpy, each wolf will now bark, growl, pant, whine, and express themselves in their own unique way.</li>
<li><strong>Ambient desert sounds</strong> - Howling wind, chirping crickets, or whispers of sand can be heard coming from terracotta blocks, sand blocks, and the dead bush.</li>
<li><strong>Falling leaves</strong> - Matching the color of the trees they fall from, these particles will make strolls (or chases) under the trees even more ambient.</li>
<li><strong>Leaf litter (including ambient sounds)</strong> - Leaf litter can be used to decorate blocks and makes a rustling sound when players walk through it. Explore forests, dark forests, and wooded badlands to find different colored leaf litter, or craft it by placing leaves in a furnace.</li>
<li><strong>Wildflowers</strong> - These white and yellow flowers can be crafted into dye and placed at different angles up to four times on the same block. Wildflowers can be found in meadows, birch forests, and old growth birch forests or grow more using bone meal.</li>
<li><strong>Dry grass</strong> - Two types of dry grass now grow in deserts and badlands. Use bone meal on short dry grass and it'll grow tall, or on tall dry grass to grow another short dry grass plant. Sheep will also regrow their wool once they eat either variant of dry grass.</li>
<li><strong>Cactus flower</strong> - The new cactus flower is pink, grows on our prickliest plant block, and can be crafted into dye. Place this desert flower in builds for a pop of color and to attract bees.</li>
<li><strong>Firefly bush (plant block)</strong> - Growing in swamps and near water, this new plant block spawns moving firefly particles that glow in the dark. Bury the firefly bush below blocks to make builds sparkle and use bone meal to grow more firefly bushes.</li>
<li><strong>Bush</strong> - Find this tuft of greenery sprouting in forests, birch forests, plains, windswept hills, and other green biomes, or grow more bushes by using bone meal.</li>
<li><strong>Lodestone (updated recipe)</strong> - Only an iron ingot is needed with chiseled bricks to craft a lodestone. By using a compass on a lodestone placed in players' bases, the compass will always point home, which means players can dare venture even farther!</li>
<li><strong>New maps for cartographers</strong> - Instead of hoping to stumble upon a certain biome or village, maps leading to them are now purchaseable from cartographers. Each cartographer has their own selection of maps, so the more village types are explored, the more maps can be found!</li>
<li><strong>Updates to the wandering traders</strong> - Our llama-leading traders have changed their business strategy: not only are they selling and buying more things, but at lower prices too! A great way for new players especially to stock up before a journey.</li>
<li><strong>Spawn egg textures (Creative mode)</strong> - Spawn eggs in Creative mode now look like the mob type it spawns. With their different colors, sizes, and distinct characteristics like horns, snouts, or wings, it'll be easier to find the right spawn egg in players' inventories.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Second game drop of 2025</strong>: Mojang's Agnes Larsson introduced some of the features coming to our next game drop, including the exciting ability to fly across the Overworld on the back of a happy ghast! Find a dried ghast (can be found in the Nether or crafted from ghast tears and a bone block). Then, players will need to revive the dried ghast with water to spawn a ghastling! Only once a ghastling has grown into a full-sized happy ghast will they be able to equip a dyeable ghast harness and fly. Multiple players can also fly together atop the same ghast! These features will be coming into testing soon after Minecraft LIVE, so that players can test these new blocks, meet the ghastling and happy ghast, test flight in Minecraft, and provide feedback. New features for this drop announced at Minecraft LIVE include:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>New block: dried ghast</strong> - The dried ghast is a new block that holds the secret for unlocking a flying mount in Minecraft. Found in the Nether or crafted with ghast tears and a bone block, this unassuming little block will spawn a ghastling when submerged in water!</li>
<li><strong>New mob variant: ghastling</strong> - Meet the ghastling - a baby version of the happy ghast with adorable gills and an appetite for snowballs. Spawned by waterlogging a dried ghast block, ghastlings love to follow players around. They grow into a happy ghast, which lets players soar across the skies!</li>
<li><strong>New mob variant: happy ghast</strong> - The happy ghast is a new mob that thrives in the Overworld - and lets players fly alone or with friends! Once raised from a dried ghast block to a ghastling to a fully grown happy ghast, equip it with a dyeable ghast harness and take to the skies!</li>
<li><strong>Ghast harness</strong> - Saddle up your happy ghast with the ghast harness and get ready to fly! Crafted from leather, glass, and wool, this unique harness can be customised with dye.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vibrant Visuals:</strong> Mojang's Jens Bergensten introduced a visual graphics upgrade that will transform the way players experience Minecraft. Initially releasing for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, it is our developers' vision for what Minecraft looks like with improved visual elements such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, and more. This is a visual enhancement - there are no changes to Minecraft's gameplay. For example, visual shadows will not impact light levels in a game-mechanics sense, or affect where hostile mobs spawn. Vibrant Visuals will be easy to access and approachable for many more Minecraft players, as it will be available on many platforms as a simple menu toggle. While Vibrant Visuals will initially release on compatible Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices, this is just the first step, and we plan to bring Vibrant Visuals to Minecraft: Java Edition in the future.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Minecraft Movie Updates: </strong>A Minecraft Movie cast member, Emma Myers, revealed an exclusive clip from the upcoming movie, as well as announced the A Minecraft Movie Live Event, an evolving multiplayer event where players will defend Midport Village in three mini games. Completing the five challenges for the event will give players the Yearn cape.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for that Minecraft film, it will be released on 4th April, with Jack Black as Steve and Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Last week, we learned that Black wasn't always going to play Steve, though. Believe it or not, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-jack-black-was-initially-going-to-play-a-talking-pig">originally going to portray a talking pig</a> in the upcoming film.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> director Nicolas Doucet has discussed how the game succeeded based on smart AA-sized ambition and that, in this year especially following industry layoffs, it's "OK to make a small game".</p>
<p>Doucet gave a "making of" talk on the celebrated PS5 exclusive at this year's Game Developer Conference (GDC), which also took home two prizes at the conference's awards: Best Audio and Best Technology.</p>
<p>During the talk he discussed the game's scope, why the team didn't name the cameo bots properly, and how originally the game had a different ending the developers found too upsetting.</p>

<figcaption>Astro Bot's launch trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unYFdcEjV9k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"From the start, we were in the mindset that it's OK to make a compact game, and I think it's really important - especially going into this year - it's OK to make a small game," said Doucet.</p>
<p>"In order to exist in this very busy world, I think it's sometimes better to settle for a good spot in the second week rather than a bad spot in the first week," he continued later. "A lot of choices we made with Astro Bot could be labelled as AA... like the size of the team, the size of the game, there's no voice, it's not open world, but that doesn't really matter. We could still make something that gets people really happy."</p>
<p>For instance, the team cut more openly-designed levels as it was much more difficult for them to control the game's tempo. This was a key factor during development, which impacted elements like the lack of text (there are only 4292 words in the entire game!), the simplified controls, the movement in loading screens and lack of cutscenes to not interrupt play time, and of course the "catchy video game music" soundtrack that's "an integral part of game design".</p>
<p>Doucet even described the level design in musical terms, with the placement of enemies, platforms, and bots all aimed at creating a certain melodic rhythm for players to maintain that fast-paced tempo and keep them engaged throughout.</p>
<p>The smaller scope also allowed the team to focus on polish and detail. Around a third of development time was spent prototyping, with everyone from programmers to the audio team testing out small, focused ideas in two-week cycles. Afterwards, the team could then focus on adding finer details to give the game its personality as "a toy for players to experiment with".</p>
<p>This polish led to inanimate objects becoming characterful, wildlife stories as cute critters react to players and enemies, exaggerated reactions of vegetation, and the multiple photo chances strewn across levels. "These touches really made a big difference to the game," said Doucet. "When you have hundreds of them, suddenly your game is transformed."</p>

</figure>
<p>Speaking about the ending (<strong>spoiler warning</strong>!), Doucet stated: "So at the end of the game, Astro sacrificed himself for the team, and as the credits rolled we wanted to make a very grieving moment of rebuilding Astro.</p>
<p>"The first version of this prototype included a completely dismembered Astro, so you gain the torso without the head. That meant some people were really upset in the team - and for good reasons."</p>
<p>Doucet showed the prototype, which had players piecing Astro's limbs onto his body, finishing with his head. The final version ended up similar, but with Astro's head always fully attached.</p>
<p>After many "emotional conversations", the team "opted for a lighter approach with humour where the player will replace all the parts and it still conveys the right emotions - and the head is always on Astro's body."</p>
<p>As for not properly naming the cameo bots Astro rescues on his quest, Team Asobi explored the idea of adding detailed descriptions and real names but found the approach "too formal". Instead, it chose to maintain the "playful vibe" by letting players guess the characters. "It was almost like a little game we were playing with the fans," said Doucet, "and in doing so, we were able to keep a lighthearted tone, which also fit the younger audience."</p>
<p>Indeed, Astro Bot acts as a "generational breach" between players who grew up with PlayStation and their children discovering classic characters. Yet the team had to establish the correct ratio of cameo bots to collect. As such, around 50 percent of the bots are easy to see but challenging to rescue, 20 percent had no challenge but were funny to watch, and 30 percent were well hidden. The easier the bot was to rescue, the more popular the character, to ensure casual players recognised the bots and hardcore players were rewarded for their efforts.</p>
<p>We described the game as a "wildly generous delight" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot review</a>. Team Asobi has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-free-update-adds-new-levels-bots-and-a-ps5-pro-boost">continued to update the game</a>, with a host of new speed-running levels and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> boost.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
