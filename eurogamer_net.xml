            <p>
Two years after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/akka-arrh-review-llamasoft-returns-with-intrigue-and-delight">reimagining Atari's unreleased 80s arcade prototype Akka Arrh</a>, design legend Jeff Minter is back with another psychedelic spin on an arcade game from yesteryeat - this time a "reality-defying reinvention" of 1984 Atari shooter I, Robot that's launching this "spring".
</p>
<p>
In I, Robot's original guise, players helped a self-aware robot (officially named "Unhappy Interface Robot #1984") destroy the all-seeing eye of Big Brother. This involved navigating each stage's maze of platforms in order to reach special red blocks and unleash a powerful laser blast - the main wrinkle being that death was instant if the player jumped while the eye was open.
</p>
<p>
Minter's newly unveiled reimagining takes the same basic premise - complete with a maze of platforms and that jump-phobic all-seeing eye - but tweaks the core action so that players are required to flip all the tiles across each stage in order to escape. "If you make it across the tiles," Atari explains in its announcement, "you'll have to race down a tube and blast away any enemy shapes that move into your path and try to stop you."

<p>
All this unfolds across 55 levels plus bonus stages, with Atari also promising online leaderboards, procedural music, plus plenty of Minter's trademark visualiser-based psychedelia. Oh, and the robot has yak horns too. Additionally, there's an enemy free UNGAME mode, which lets players mess around with I, Robot's various sights and sounds at their leisure.
</p>
<p>
I, Robot doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2932910">Steam</a>, Switch, Xbox One, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/i-robot/9phf27sh4qc4">Xbox Series X/S</a>, PlayStation 4, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012198/">PS5</a>, and Atari VCS this "spring". And if all this leaves you eager to sample more of Minter's work, you could always check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/llamasoft-the-jeff-minter-story-review">last year's Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</a>, another wonderful interactive museum release from Digital Eclipse.

            <p>
Inkle - the studio behind Eurogamer favourites including Heaven's Vault, A Highland Story, and 80 Days - has unveiled its latest narrative-rich adventure: 1920s boarding school mystery Expelled!, which is coming to PC, Switch, and mobile on 12th March.
</p>
<p>
If Expelled rings a distant bell, that might be because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highland-song-studio-inkle-teasing-1920s-mystery-at-miss-mulligatawneys-school-for-promising-girls">it was originally teased last June</a>, under the name Miss Mulligatawney's School for Promising Girls. At the time, details were scant - its Steam description merely contained a flyer for the titular academy promising, "The best education the 1920s have to offer!" - but now all has been revealed.
</p>
<p>
Expelled is being pushed as a follow-up to Inkle's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/get-away-with-murder-in-inkles-surprise-new-game-overboard">well-received 2021 ocean liner whodunnit Overboard!</a>, and is described as a "next-gen visual novel with a wicked twist". It sees players attempting to clear their name following the fenestration-based attempted murder of a boarding school prefect, all by mounting their own investigation - which might also involve a spot of blackmail and betrayal, depending what they're willing to do to avoid expulsion.

<p>
All this sees players - in the role of scholarship student Verity Amersham, voiced by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler - navigating the simulated story world of a 1920s boarding school (in which students and staff move around independently in real-time, remembering everything they see and responding appropriately) in order to eke out truths and exploit secrets. Players have just one day to solve the mystery and escape punishment through subterfuge and cunning - perhaps even choosing to frame someone else if it'll save their bacon.
</p>
<p>
Inkle says one playthrough of Expelled should last no more than 45 minutes, but each run features new leads and opportunities making it "massively replayable". And it's not just a question of avoiding expulsion; players can also work toward other targets, such as rising to the position of head girl, or solving further mysteries - such as uncovering your best friend's dark secret. And all this is accompanied by a jazz soundtrack featuring music from the likes of George Gershwin, Paul Whiteman, Louis Armstrong, and Bessie Smith.
</p>
<p>
Expelled!: An Overboard! Game launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963890/Expelled/">Steam</a>, Switch, iOS, and Android on 12th March.
