            <p>
Worried the impending arrival of $80 games might price you out of your favourite hobby? Well if Borderlands 4 follows suit, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has suggested the community should just suck it up and deal with it. "If you're a real fan," he recently told a potential purchaser, "you'll find a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Pitchford made the proclamation on social media after a <a href="https://x.com/oldgoldsot/status/1922412081023783167">Borderlands fan opined</a>, "Randy, [Borderlands 4] better not be $80. Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay $80 and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag. You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher."
</p>
<p>
But Pitchford begged to differ. "Not my call," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">insisted</a>, before dismissing pricing concerns. "If you're a real fan, you'll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlour in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
The response from Borderlands fans on social media was, unsurprisingly, swift, strong, and overwhelmingly negative. "Thanks, now I won't buy the Game even if it costs $70", one person <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1924852589121687964">wrote</a>, while another <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1924850023625318758">added</a>, "That has to be one of the worst CEO replies from recent memory." Another <a href="https://x.com/RaistlinJustice/status/1924787599610122325">called</a> Pitchford's comment "elitist [and] out of touch"; "Rich person says just find the money," another <a href="https://x.com/Obey1Cannoli/status/1924818949494944151">wrote</a>, with plenty more using <a href="https://x.com/FergusMcburgs/status/1924823182374285777">considerably stronger language</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, none of this means Borderlands 4 <em>will</em> cost $80 dollars when it eventually arrives, but the industry certainly seems to be heading in that direction. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">got the ball rolling earlier this year</a>, when it announced a $79.99 USD price tag for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and Microsoft was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">quick to follow</a>, confirming some Xbox game prices would rise to $79.99 at the end of 2025 - presumably in time for this year's Call of Duty.
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two has relayed a more cautious approach to price increases, with CEO Strauss Zelnick recently reiterating the company's stance on variable, game-by-game pricing. While some analysts have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">speculated next year's GTA 6 might reach $100 territory</a>, one of the few confirmed prices on Take-Two's upcoming roster is Mafia: The Old Country, which costs $50. Borderlands 4 pricing details are yet to be shared.
</p>
<p>
But while customers might balk at the rising cost of games, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">recently suggested the move was inevitable</a>. "I think it was going to happen sooner or later," he explained in the wake of Mario Kart World's price reveal, "maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually. We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation."
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, that's set to launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 12th September after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Take-Two announced it was bringing its release forward</a>.

            <p>Lost in Cult is launching a new label to release premium physical games, beginning with three British games: Immortality, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow and Thank Goodness You're Here.</p>
<p>Known as Editions, the new line of physical games will be limited in quantity and include interview booklets, art cards and more for collectability and display, with a new game added each month on PS5 and Switch.</p>
<p>Editions will cost £59.99 and ship worldwide. Three games are available now at launch, with more planned every month from July into 2026.</p>

<p>A major reason for the label is game preservation, with Lost in Cult partnering with DoesItPlay? to ensure each game's playability for the future: every game is complete on disc or cart, is playable without the internet, and includes all primary content at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Plus, in addition to the limited edition versions, all releases will be available as a standard edition through online and brick-and-mortar stores. Museums and archive groups will also receive copies.</p>
<p>Lost in Cult is aiming for shipping within six months of the release of each Edition, though is hoping for within three months. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> are also in the works.</p>

<p>"We're being bold," said Lost in Cult's Ryan Brown. "I can unashamedly say we set out to create a new standard for physical games. And this is a multi-faceted mission. Our Editions are designed to preserve not just the game, but the story and artistry behind its creation. At the same time, our retail releases ensure no one is locked out of owning great games physically, giving everyone a chance to play their favourites for the decades to come, internet connection willing or not."</p>
<p>Said Sam Barlow, Immortality creator: "The most common request we've had since releasing Immortality has been for a physical edition, but we always knew that if we did do it, we'd need to do it right - and so, working with Lost In Cult on this amazing new series was a no brainer!"</p>
<p>Lost in Cult is known for its premium game packages, including its Design Works books and Lock-On gaming journals.</p>
<p>Each game in the Editions lineup will come with a slipcase and poster of custom artwork, an authenticity card with printed signature from the game's director, art cards, and a 40-page booklet from Edge Magazine alumni Chris Schilling.</p>

<p>The company is carefully curating its selection of games, focusing on those that have pushed the medium as an art form. The first three have all been recognised by BAFTA.</p>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here won Best British Game at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">this year's awards</a>. It will be available through Editions on PS5 (1500 copies) and Switch (3000 copies).</p>
<p>Immortality won Best Narrative in 2023 and was nominated for multiple other awards. It will be available on PS5 (1500 copies).</p>
<p>Lastly, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow was long-listed by BAFTA in 2023 for Samantha Béart's performance. It will be available on Switch (3000 copies).</p>
<p>You can check out more details on Editions on the <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">Lost in Cult website</a>.</p>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thank-goodness-youre-here-review">five star review from Eurogamer</a>: "Developer Coal Supper's relentlessly inventive absurdist comedy might, by necessity, keep a tight rein on players, but this is an impeccably constructed masterclass in gag-telling."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortality-review-an-ingenious-hollywood-mystery-made-less-profound-by-the-invitation-to-solve-it">Immortality</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review-an-adventure-game-with-depth">The Excavation of Hob's Barrow</a> were also very well-received.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
