            <p>Psychological RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is set to come to mobile devices courtesy of original studio ZA/UM in a "reimagined" form.</p>
<p>The aim of this adaptation is to make the game accessible for mobile devices and playable in short bursts.</p>
<p>"We intend to captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio, ultimately creating an all new, deeply engaging form of entertainment," said studio head Denis Havel, an original member of the Disco Elysium development team.</p>

<p>As you can see from the trailer above, the original's isometric gameplay has been adapted to fit a vertical phone screen, with players swiping through dialogue options. It looks more like a visual novel.</p>
<p>"With this adaptation, Disco Elysium becomes more accessible than ever. This reimagination is now structured to fit the way people play on mobile, making it effortless to enjoy in short bursts. It's what audiobooks wish they were," said narrative lead Chris Priestman.</p>
<p>Added Havel: "Mobile players deserve deep, story-rich experiences, like Disco Elysium. With profound respect for the original's artistry and meaning, we move forward as both custodians and creators, bringing this masterpiece to new and returning players alike. We want you to fall in love with Disco Elysium on your phone - all over again."</p>
<p>The game will launch in summer 2025 on Google Android devices, so it's not long to see how this adaptation will live up to the original. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZAUM.M0_stable">Pre-registration</a> is now open.</p>
<p>What's more, the first two chapters will be available for free, with the rest of the game unlocked with a single purchase for ad-free gameplay.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-zaums-new-rpg-c4-is-part-espionage-thriller-part-psychedelic-sci-fi">ZA/UM announced its follow-up to Disco Elysium</a> - a new RPG called C4 that's part espionage thriller and part psychedelic sci-fi.</p>
<p>However, following messy drama after the release of Disco Elysium and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">number of now-resolved lawsuits</a>, many of the original developers have dispersed.</p>
<p>There are now a number of different projects competing to become the foremost successor to the celebrated RPG.</p>
<p>That includes new studio Longude, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">also this week provided an update on its new game Hopetown</a> that includes key Disco Elysium alumni.</p>
<p>Other projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">XXX Nightshift from a new UK-based studio Dark Math Games</a> formed of a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium", as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">new studio Summer Eternal</a> from Disco Elysium worldbuilding co-creator Argo Tuulik.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
