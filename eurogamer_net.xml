            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-chasing-galar-birds-will-soon-get-to-pay-for-a-guaranteed-encounter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Three of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-rare-pokemon-list-chart">Pokémon Go's most highly sought-after creatures</a> will become available via a paid-for encounter in a forthcoming event. 
</p>
<p>
For $8 (about £6), players will get to choose one of the trio to encounter via a Timed Research ticket. Normally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/galarian-articuno-galarian-zapdos-galarian-moltres-pokemon-go-9004">these creatures are an ultra-rare spawn from Pokémon Go's Daily Adventure Incense</a>, which can only be activated for a limited time each day.
</p>
<p>
Galarian Articuno, Zapdos and Moltres have now been available in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> since July 2022, but many players are still to complete their set. The three birds are deliberately rare and extremely hard to catch - with most encounters ending in them fleeing. Because of this, they are frequently candidates for players to use their coveted Master Balls on. Alternatively, you'll be able to pay up and a catch is guaranteed (just be sure you have the Pokéballs to burn).
</p>
<p>
Even if you do have the full set, there's now the even rarer Shiny versions of each to collect. Players assume that the chance of seeing those is just 1/20 - the game's standard Legendary Shiny rate - on top of the odds of actually finding one in the first place.
</p>
<p>
If you're keen, you'll be able to purchase the Fleeting Legends Ticket next week, from 23rd to 29th June, timed with the upcoming Ancients Discovered event. 
</p>
<p>
Ancients Discovered will see the return of the Regi Legendary family to raids, including Special Backgrounds for the first time. The event will notably see a temporary boost - and then removal - of the game's newly-raised Remote Raid Cap, from a limit of 30 from 23rd to 26th June, and then to no limit over the weekend of the 27th to 29th June.

Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-weeks-after-sale-pokemon-go-will-soon-let-you-play-more-from-home-but-developers-say-monopoly-go-owner-isnt-behind-sweeping-changes">I spoke with Pokémon Go senior producer John Funtanilla on the game's changes to let you play more remotely</a> - which he revealed came from the game's development team, rather than Monopoly Go maker Scopely.
