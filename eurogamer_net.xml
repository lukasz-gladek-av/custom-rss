            <p>When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> arrives on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, owners of the original Switch will also be able to play thanks to the GameShare feature.</p>
<p>As previously announced, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Split Fiction on Switch 2 will support the Friend's Pass</a>, which allows owners to invite a friend to play with them for free. It will also have Cross Play, meaning a Switch 2 player can enjoy the co-op capers of Mio and Zoe with those on PC, Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>And welcomely, it will also be able to be enjoyed by those on the OG Switch, even though the game isn't launching on the platform.</p>

<p>This little nugget was casually tucked away in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/nintendo-switch-2-features">Split Fiction blog post</a> about Switch 2's features. "GameShare will enable Nintendo Switch 2 owners to invite another player to play together over a local wireless connection using just one copy of the game," the post reads.</p>
<p>"This 'other player' can be not only a Nintendo Switch 2 owner but a Nintendo Switch owner as well."</p>
<p>Well, I'll be, that is pretty neat! Perhaps it isn't a surprise to many, but I will admit I just assumed that Split Fiction would only be playable for those using an available release platform.</p>

<p>Nintendo gamers are really in for a treat, I have to say. Split Fiction is absolutely brilliant! And, I am far from the only one to think so. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will be released on Switch 2 on the console's launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">which is 5th June</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bethesda is still to announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but there's no denying the project is real and ready to launch.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots and details of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake were dug up from developer Virtuos' website</a>. Now, references to the project have been found on Bethesda's own website too - including code for a "Buy Now" button that has since been removed. 
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer previously reported, it's understood that Bethesda's current plans are to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But nothing has been officially announced - for now.

<p>
Still, Bethesda is clearly readying for next week behind the scenes, with some overly-eager website updating that - of course - caught the eye of fans. 
</p>
<p>
"I was digging through the source code of bethesda.net and found a reference to 'oblivion-remastered' in the Google Tag Manager setup," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5">fan posted on reddit</a>, showing a screenshot of the code in situ. 
</p>
<p>
"It points to this URL: https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion-remastered The page isn't live yet, but what's interesting is that I checked the Google Tag Manager container on the Wayback Machine, and this reference wasn't there as of April 10th. So it looks like it was added very recently!"
</p>
<p>
The code has now been removed - just as the screenshots from Virtuos' website were too. But, of course, copies are now all over the internet, and you can still see the original files in place via an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415122013/https://www.virtuosgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/">archived version of Virtuos' website</a>.
</p>
<p>After years of leaks and an even lengthier wait for a new entry in The Elder Scrolls series (don't look up how long ago Skyrim landed), fans don't have long to go now. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. Maybe that could come next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
