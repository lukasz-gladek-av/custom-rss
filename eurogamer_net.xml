            <p>
High-profile indie game publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> will lay out its forthcoming release slate during a new digital showcase event, to be broadcast next week.
</p>
<p>
The showcase will be the company's first since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">vast majority of Annapurna's staff quit last September in a mass exodus</a> - reportedly following internal squabbles over the leadership of the company.
</p>
<p>
In the past, Annapurna has been hailed as a beacon for the very best of indie game talent, and has helped publish hits such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains of Edith Finch</a>, Outer Wilds, Cocoon and Stray.
</p>
<p>
This new show, to be held at 5pm UK time next Monday, 24th February is designed to offer a look at what's next.

<p>
Annapurna says the event will last 30 minutes, and include looks at Wanderstop, Skin Deep, Wheel World, Faraway, Lushfoil, To a T, Morsels, and "a few more surprises" - all set to launch in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Many of these titles are games Annapurna has been working to publish for some time, such as Wanderstop, the next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator Davey Wreden.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">Wreden said that "nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon" despite the upheaval within Annapurna</a>, which he described as a "bump in the road".
</p>
<p>
At the time, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-mass-exodus-of-staff-a-baffler-says-company-spokesperson">Annapurna spokesperson described the loss of its staff as "a baffler"</a>, and pledged it would plod on.
</p>
<p>
"We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership," the company said. 
</p>
<p>
"If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. PS. We're hiring."
</p>
<p>
Staff members who previously worked at Annapurna have since reportedly reformed as a fresh team. Last month, Bloomberg stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">this group had taken on the games and franchises of Private Division</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">sold off by Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two Interactive</a> in November last year. These include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series, upcoming Lord of the Rings farming game Tales of the Shire, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-studio-game-freak-creating-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division">new action-adventure from Pok√©mon developer Game Freak</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>NetEase has released a statement following the shock Marvel Rivals layoffs last night.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals - the free-to-play shooter based on characters from within the Marvel universe - has been a huge success since its release in December. On its opening weekend just two months ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">the game welcomed an astonishing 10 million players to the fray</a>. Meanwhile, at this very moment in time there are still <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">121,646 heroes making their way in the game via Steam</a>. And Marvel Rivals hasn't just boasted high player numbers. A report in January estimated that <a href="https://80.lv/articles/first-month-revenue-of-marvel-rivals-is-estimated-at-over-usd130-million/">Marvel Rivals had made over $130m in revenue during its first month</a>.</p>
<p>However, despite this success, which is even more impressive when you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">consider how other online shooter games have struggled to get off the mark recently</a>, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">laid off an unspecified number of the Marvel Rivals development team last night</a>, including game director Thaddeus Sasser. The news was broken by Sasser himself, before other members of the development team went on to share word of their situation.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Marvel Rivals publisher has now broken its silence on the layoffs, calling them a "difficult decision" made to "optimise development efficiency" for the game.</p>
<p>"This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals," a NetEase spokesperson said in a statement shared with Eurogamer. "We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions."</p>
<p>It added that the "core" development team in China "remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience" for Marvel Rivals players.</p>
<p>"We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game," NetEase continued. "We're excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base."</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>As reported last night, the job cuts within Marvel Rivals' western-based development team follow a recent pattern by NetEase, which has made broader reconsiderations to its overseas investments and studios.</p>
<p>In November of last year, Mac Walters - the veteran writer and producer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for almost two decades - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">announced a "pause" in operations at his NetEase-backed AAA game studio</a>, Worlds Untold. Then, last month, Jar of Sparks - the Seattle-based "AAA" studio established by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook back in 2022 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">halted work its currently-unannounced first title as it searched for a new publishing partner</a>, stating it's looking to "find all of our team new homes" as a result.</p>
<p>More recently, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">NetEase-backed and Sweden-based developer Liquid Swords announced an unspecified number of layoffs</a>, before it had even released its first game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Limited Run Games has responded to a report that accused it of selling NES game cartridges that damaged consoles. In a statement, the company confirmed the reports of damage were accurate, and blamed the issue on a change in supplier. It's now offering refunds and re-manufactured games.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/02/this-cartridge-is-a-tiny-time-bomb-limited-run-accused-of-selling-carts-which-can-damage-your-nes">Time Extension</a> reported copies of Rugrats Adventures in Gameland and PioPow could damage players' consoles due to a mismatch in voltage between the cartridges and the original hardware. One user, speaking to Time Extension, described the cartridges as "a tiny time bomb for my electronics".</p>
<p>"Upon learning about this issue from our community, we immediately began investigating and can confirm that due to an issue with voltage regulation, there is a small chance that prolonged use of these titles could result in damage to either the cartridge or the console hardware," a Limited Run Games spokesperson said in a statement shared with Eurogamer reads.</p>

<p>"We have identified that these titles were not manufactured by our regular partner who we have worked with across 30+ titles and who we trust implicitly thanks to their impeccable manufacturing track record," it continues.</p>
<p>"The manufacturer who produced Rugrats and PioPow has only worked on a very small handful of titles for Limited Run Games and right now, we are going through our back catalogue of NES titles manufactured by this supplier and testing for possible issues. While we conduct further testing, our immediate pledge is to rectify the potential issue with Rugrats and PioPow and ensure that this will not happen again.</p>
<p>"We are committed to delivering high-quality products and never want to leave our customers with anything short of the best."</p>
<p>Limited Run Games has confirmed these two games are no longer available for purchase and while it promises to fulfil back orders, these will be re-manufactured via the company's "trusted manufacturing partner". This will result in a delay, for which it apologises.</p>
<p>Those who don't want to wait can receive a refund by contacting customer service.</p>
<p>For those who have already received a copy of these games, the company recommends not using the cartridge. Instead, a new copy will be sent out automatically once manufactured.</p>
<p>"We are extremely sorry for any inconvenience these issues have caused and moving forward, we will not be distributing any original cartridge sourced by this manufacturer," the statement concludes.</p>
<p>Rugrats was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/limited-run-games-announces-20-new-physical-releases-are-on-the-way">20 games announced by Limited Run Games</a> last summer as part of its LRG3 2024 showcase.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Niantic, the developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a>, is in talks to sell off its games for $3.5bn to the Saudi Arabia-owned Monopoly Go! publisher Scopely, a new report has stated.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit">Bloomberg</a> revealed the potential deal today, though stated the agreement was still yet to be finalised. Niantic and Scopely both declined to comment on the report.
</p>
<p>
If the deal went through, ownership of Niantic's smash hit Pok√©mon Go would transfer to Scopely, alongside the rest of the company's gaming portfolio.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Niantic also runs <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-now">Monster Hunter Now</a> in collaboration with Capcom, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin-bloom">Pikmin Bloom</a> in collaboration with Nintendo. Niantic's first game, Ingress, is also still operational. All are believed profitable - Pok√©mon Go still in particular - but Niantic has faced repeated layoffs in recent years as it has struggled to replicate Pok√©mon Go's lightning-in-a-bottle success, and the company has always been, at its heart, a technology firm fascinated by AR and mixed reality technology.
</p>
<p>
Scopely is best known as the company behind Monopoly Go!, the biggest mobile hit of 2023 that continues to dominate app store spending. Savvy Games Group, an arm of Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund (PIF), snapped up Scopely for $4.9bn in July 2023.
</p>
<p>
Savvy Games Group has notable stakes in a raft of other companies, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">EA</a>, Take-Two, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-acquires-stake-in-embracer-group">Embracer</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabia-reportedly-increases-nintendo-stake-for-second-time-in-a-month">Nintendo</a> - of which it currently owns 7.5 percent. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content">Ubisoft declined to comment that it was also working on a deal with the PIF</a>.
</p>
<p>The PIF is an initiative designed as a way to diversify the country's revenues via investment in foreign companies. It's chaired by Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the controversial ruler <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">blamed by the CIA for the assassination of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi</a>, and who has upheld the country's notoriously poor human rights record.</p>
<p>
In April last year, Savvy's boss Brian Ward told <a href="https://archive.is/o/ymwfH/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-19/saudi-arabia-s-savvy-to-put-more-into-mobile-after-monopoly-go">Bloomberg</a> that the company wanted to buy an unnamed "genre-leading" mobile game via Scopely as "the "tip of the spear" for its mobile investment. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/">Niantic and Savvy then publicly cosied up in August last year</a>, when the companies signed a memorandum of understanding designed to expand Pok√©mon Go within the Middle East.
</p>
<p>
Niantic declined to comment to Eurogamer this morning.
