            <p>Yesterday, as widely expected based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">earlier reports</a>, Microsoft began another sweeping round of layoffs - its fourth in just 18 months - this time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">affecting thousands of people across the company</a>. It's believed more than 9,000 employees have lost their jobs as a result of this most recent move, which Microsoft told Eurogamer were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."</p>
<p>Since the announcement, additional reports have surfaced painting a clearer picture of the devastation wrought by Microsoft's latest cost cutting measures, as well as the substantial impact on its Xbox division. Beyond the significant human cost of the move - which Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> insisted was necessary to ensure the "enduring success" of the company in a message to staff yesterday - further details on the specific studios and projects impacted have now begun to emerge.</p>
<p>Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild, first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">announced in 2019</a>, has reportedly been cancelled, for instance, leading to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">departure of studio veteran Gregg Mayles</a> after 35 years. Microsoft's troubled Perfect Dark reboot, unveiled in 2020, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">reportedly also ceased production</a> and its first party developer, The Initiative, closed. Microsoft is also said to have terminated its partnership with Crystal Dynamics, which was called in to help on the beleaguered project back in 2022, raising questions around how that team may also have been impacted by yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, an unannounced ZeniMax MMO has reportedly been cancelled, while 200 people are said to have lost their jobs at the Microsoft-owned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a> maker King, and nearly 50 percent of staff at Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 have reportedly been laid off. The full extent and impact of Microsoft's massive "organisational and workforce changes" are yet to become clear, with Microsoft only providing limited information to press. It has, however, moved swiftly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-microsoft-gaming-ceo-not-retiring-from-xbox-anytime-soon">deny rumours of Phil Spencer's imminent retirement</a>, insisting the Xbox boss won't be retiring from his position "anytime soon".</p>
<p>With fresh reports continuing to surface around yesterday's bombshell announcement and its impact on Xbox, we've set up this rolling news blog to sift through the confusion, and to collate breaking news and industry reactions as the story continues to evolve.</p><div data-live="true">

<p>We have fuller write-ups of these nearly ready to go, incidentally. I was never quite sure about Warcraft Rumble but it's sad to hear about Romero Games. It also sounds like it's put the small Irish studio in a very difficult position too.</p>

I actually had a dream with Phil Spencer in last night, I assume because I went to sleep thinking about this situation, and in the dream I had to interview him. We got as far as the interview starting and then I don't remember any more, so I have no breaking dream-news for you.
</p>
<p>
But I woke up feeling sad about the whole situation. Sad, obviously, for the people losing their jobs. Sad to see decorated developers like Matt Firor, the head of Elder Scrolls Online (and once the co-creator of Dark Age of Camelot, an MMO that means a lot to me) leaving his role after 18 years, after the cancellation of a new MMO he'd been working on. And sad to read about Gregg Mayles reportedly leaving Rare after 35 years there. It's such a shame. I had thought Rare resurgent in recent years, after the success of Sea of Thieves, and I'd greatly looked forward to Everwild, and now I'm left bewildered and wondering what will become of the studio that's there. I only hope the people losing their roles are being offered generous severance packages with it.
</p>
<p>There was also a feeling of losing belief in Microsoft and Xbox. When Microsoft started buying up studios a few years ago, I watched it all enthused. I was really excited at the prospect of studios like Obsidian Entertainment and inXile finally having the backing of a company with deep pockets and resources. I was excited to see Blizzard wrestled away from Kotick, and curious about where Microsoft would take Bethesda. I thought it was a good thing. But of late it's seemed to be more precarious being a part of Xbox than not.</p></div>

            <p>Where Winds Meet, the forthcoming action game from Chinese developer Everstone Studio, will be a PlayStation console exclusive on its launch.</p>
<p>A new CGI trailer for the game has been released, showcasing more of its Wuxia-inspired setting and story.</p>
<p>At its close, no release date is given beyond "2025", but the game is confirmed to be a console exclusive on PS5 alongside its PC and mobile release. "Not available on other consoles until at least six months after release date," the small print specifies.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is an open-world action-RPG set during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period of Chinese history. Its combat and aesthetics are inspired by classic Wuxia fantasy, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">developers aiming to bring the genre to the west</a>.</p>
<p>A final beta test for the game will take place later this month, on 25th July for players on PC (via Steam) and PS5 across the globe. <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/007fb7/paper.html">Registration for access</a> is now open.</p>
<p>The test will include regions from previous tests, as well as the urban region of Kaifeng (pictured above).</p>
<p>The success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">Black Myth: Wukong has surely impacted the Chinese games industry</a>, as development has shifted towards console game releases in recent years.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> won't be retiring from his position at Xbox "anytime soon".</p>
<p>Yesterday, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">swathes of layoffs across the entire company</a>, including its gaming division. The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark and a new Zenimax MMORPG</a> have been cancelled in the process.</p>
<p>However, Spencer - Microsoft Gaming CEO - will remain at the company for now. In a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring">The Verge</a>, head of Xbox communications Kari Perez said: "Phil is not retiring anytime soon."</p>
<p>The news followed a rumour on social media suggesting Spencer would be retiring after the launch of the next generation Xbox, with Xbox president Sarah Bond set to take over. This is now confirmed to be false.</p>
<p>Spencer has led Xbox since 2014, and was promoted to Microsoft Gaming CEO in 2022. As such, he's overseen the company from the Xbox One years, including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> and numerous rounds of layoffs.</p>
<p>"I recognise that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before," wrote Spencer in a statement confirming the layoffs yesterday.</p>
<p>"Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritise the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-hes-stopped-trying-to-move-all-players-over-to-xbox">Spencer discussed the decision to publish Xbox games on competitor systems</a>. "I'm not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore," he said at the time. "We're all so invested in where our games are, let's just allow more people to play. And yes, the 70 percent that we make on games on other platforms is helpful to us being able to build great portfolios, like we showed at Developer Direct, and I hope this will continue to show through the rest of the year."</p>
<p>Last year in an interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-made-some-of-the-worst-game-choice-decisions-says-xbox-boss-phil-spencer">Spencer joked he'd made "some of the worst game-choice decisions"</a>, in terms of turning down some successful projects such as Destiny and Guitar Hero.</p>
<p>"I'm not a regrets-type person," Spencer said. "Maybe that's a fault of mine, but I passed on so many games. I could look back and say-," he clenches his fist, "-but no, I try to look forward and be positive about the things that we are doing."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-microsoft-gaming-ceo-not-retiring-from-xbox-anytime-soon]]></content:encoded>
