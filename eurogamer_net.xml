            <p>Bandersnatch - the interactive special from the Black Mirror team with a video game theme - is leaving Netflix.</p>
<p>Bandersnatch is about a young programmer who starts to lose his grip on reality as he sets to work adapting a dark fantasy novel into a video game. Set in the 1980s, Bandersnatch is described as a "mind-bending tale", which features multiple endings depending on the viewer's decisions.</p>
<p>It is a pretty interesting form of media which can get quite meta, and one that I restarted just now to have on in the background as I write this article.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you too want to relive the Emmy-winning Bandersnatch, you best do it sooner rather than later, because - as reported by <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/leaving-soon/black-mirror-bandersnatch-and-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt-interactive-specials-leaving-netflix/">What's On Netflix</a> - removal notices have appeared on both Black Mirror: Bandersnatch and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend. These last remaining interactive specials are set to leave Netflix on 12th May.</p>
<p>In November of last year, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-removing-almost-all-of-its-interactive-specials-but-dont-worry-bandersnatch-is-safe">Netflix spokesperson confirmed to Eurogamer that "almost all" of its interactive titles would be leaving the service that December</a>. "Only four will remain: Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild," Netflix told us at the time.</p>
<p>According to What's On Netflix, the company is going to be rolling out a UI redesign across various devices in the near future. Reportedly this redesign, which is still in the testing phase, is the reason Netflix has been phasing out its interactive specials.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it is unclear whether or not Bandersnatch will return to the service in some sort of non-interactive form, like the previously removed Bear Grylls specials which were <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-re-releases-bear-grylls-interactive-specials-as-linear-specials/">re-released on Netflix with a linear format</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Netflix for further comment on Bandersnatch's upcoming removal from the service.</p>

<p>The seventh season of Black Mirror recently made its debut. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-now-canonically-in-black-mirror">Along with a nod to Balatro</a>, the latest season also has its own crossover moment in the form of Thronglets, a companion mobile game tied to the episode Plaything.</p>
<p>"Thronglets, to me, feels like the gaming future Netflix wants," our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-netflix-black-mirror-series-has-another-bandersnatch-like-gaming-crossover-moment-but-you-might-not-even-notice-it">Bertie wrote after having a go with Thronglets</a>. "It's a fine example of how an additive brand-related gaming experience can be done."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
