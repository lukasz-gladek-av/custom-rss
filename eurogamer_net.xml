            <p>Tencent has quietly removed, edited, and/or replaced key art on the Steam page of its upcoming adventure game, Light of Motiram, just days after Sony filed a copyright lawsuit.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent's development studio, Polaris Quest, revealed Light of Motiram</a>, a post-apocalyptic open-world survival crafting game featuring mechanised animal-like creatures that bore a remarkable resemblance to those in Guerrilla and PlayStation's Horizon series. </p>
<p>Fast-forward to July, and Sony announced it was suing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">allegedly ripping off PlayStation's Horizon video game franchise</a>, claiming Tencent had asked Sony for permission to license the IP, and pushed on with "slavish clone" Light of Motiram despite Sony's refusal.</p>

<p>While Tencent has not commented publicly on the lawsuit, however, changes recorded on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/history/">SteamDB</a> show Light of Motriam's Steam page has been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/history/">quietly updated</a>. Not only have a number of screenshots and trailers been removed - including the cover image, which used to feature this <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3319630/c8aeeb396b98aa8aa798c9e4b1ead91363c52f67/header.jpg">Aloy Alike image</a> but has since been updated to <a href="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3319630/18dd0467271a164c976e0ec01ee04976da3ae9d1/header.jpg">this instead</a> - but promotional images on the Steam store have also been swapped out (thanks, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">The Game Post</a>).</p>
<p>The game's description has similarly been updated, too. It used to read, "In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals."</p>
<p>Check the Steam page today, however, and it now states: "Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land."</p>

            <p>Rod Fergusson is "stepping away" from his leadership role at Blizzard.</p>
<p>In a brief statement on social media, Fergussion said "the teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead," adding he was "looking forward to what comes next for Diablo and for me".</p>

<p>Fergusson did not give a specific reason for leaving, and declined to comment further when asked by press. It's also unclear who will head the Diablo team going forward.</p>
<p>"After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it's time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what's next," he wrote.</p>
<p>"The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I'm incredibly proud of what we've built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me."</p> <div>

<p>Blizzard president Johanna Faries <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653">added</a>: "Guiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration. Thank you, Rod, for bringing all of those in spades. Sanctuary's future is brighter because of the impact you've had!"</p>
<p>Xbox boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> said Fergusson "brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming's most iconic franchises".</p>
<p>"Playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> with you was a blast – thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community," he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xboxp3.bsky.social/post/3lvvuhk4ags26">added</a>.</p>
<p>Fergusson joined Blizzard as the new head of Diablo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rod-fergusson-exist-gears-developer-to-become-diablo-boss-at-blizzard">back in February 2020</a>. Before that, he worked on the Gears of War franchise for 15 years, save for a stint at Irrational to close out the development of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>. He left Gears developer The Coalition after the launch of mobile spin-off Gears Pop!, mainline game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gears-5">Gears 5</a>, and ahead of the launch of strategy spin-off Gears Tactics.</p>
<p>Fergusson's departure comes just days after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-once-again-accusing-activision-blizzard-of-using-ai-generated-art-in-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-event-marketing-materials">fans accused Blizzard of using AI-generated "slop"</a> in its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> x Hearthstone crossover event.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft announced around 9000 employees would be laid off</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-boss-rod-fergusson-leaves-blizzard]]></content:encoded>
