            <p>
Ubisoft is continuing its talks with Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> over a possible buyout deal that would take the Assassin's Creed maker  private, a new report states.
</p>
<p>
The move - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">first mooted last month</a> - would see Ubisoft take back control of its company from shareholders. Today, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/">Reuters</a> reported that Ubisoft is seeking a deal which would see its French founders, the Guillemot family, retain control.
</p>
<p>
However, the same report states that Tencent - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.

<p>
Talks remain ongoing between the two companies on how to move forward. Ubisoft stock spiked 14 percent today as a result of the report.
</p>
<p>
"We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders" a spokesperson for Ubisoft told Eurogamer today. "In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options."
</p>
<p>The buyout talks come after a particularly rocky year for Ubisoft, which has suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, staff walkouts, and disappointing sales of key titles. </p>
<p>Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delayed its biggest upcoming launch Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until 14th February 2025, after seeing "softer than expected" sales for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the company announced the closure of several studios, with the loss of 277 employees, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulls the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
