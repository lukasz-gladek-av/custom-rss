            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> may soon be an Xbox Play Anywhere title, according to a presumed premature advert spotted on the Xbox Store.</p>
<p>I don't personally see the advert on the Xbox store, either on console or PC, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ohg4ay/baldurs_gate_3_xbox_play_anywhere/">an image was captured on Reddit</a> showing a Baldur's Gate 3 promo block with the words "Now Xbox Play Anywhere" on it. This could have been faked but the scruffy nature of it and the odd angle make it a convincing fake if so.</p>
<p>I asked Larian for clarification this morning but its position is "no comment" for now, which I think bodes well.</p>

<p>Xbox Play Anywhere games, as I'm sure you know, are games that you buy once and can play on PC and Xbox and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">the new handheld ROG Ally X</a>, all within the Xbox-branded ecosystem. So if you were to buy Baldur's Gate 3 as an Xbox Play Anywhere game, you'd be able to chop and change where you play.</p><p>I'm not sure how it works retroactively, and whether if you already own the game on Xbox you'd be able to go back and play on a different platform, but I presume that'll be the case. I don't see why you'd punish earlier adopters of the game.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 remains one of the finest role-playing games of this generation, and it's a game that's been heavily updated by Larian since it was released in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">The final BG3 patch, Patch 8</a>, released in the spring, brought cross-play, new subclasses, a photo mode, and the long-awaited addition of split-screen co-op on Xbox Series S. In short, if you haven't played it, do.</p>

            <p>Hide your wumpa fruit and reinforce all your wooden crates: Crash Bandicoot looks set for an animated return via a brand-new series set to debut on Netflix.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/crash-bandicoot-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix/">What’s on Netflix</a>, WildBrain Studios, the minds behind the well-received and very fun Sonic Prime, is making a Crash Bandicoot adaptation for the streaming giant.
</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-quick-look-at-sonic-prime-on-netflix">Sonic Prime</a> (you shouldn't be: anyone with a passing interest in the Blue Blur should check it out, because it's a really nice interpretation of the Sega mascot), perhaps you'll know some of the other projects the studio has worked on: Carmen Sandiego, Malory Towers, Camp Snoopy, or the Caillou reboot.</p>
<p>If you're trying to remember any other small-screen interpretations of Crash and coming up short, that's because the Sony mascot has never had a series to himself before. It looks like WildBrain has managed to snag an iconic debut here, and I'm pretty confident that the Canadian entertainment company has the chops to pull it off.</p><p>Let's hope this venture isn't as cursed as a previous attempt at bringing Crash to the small screen. Per leaks on Reddit, there were plans for a collaboration between Activision and Amazon to launch an animated Crash show in 2021, which was ultimately cancelled due to script disputes (or so legend has it, at least). We don't know much about the history of this project, all we know is that a (very cool-looking) animation test was uploaded to Youtube some four years ago. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVFJ49X11ck">Check it out here.</a>
</p>
<p>Crash has leant his big eyes and 90s energy to other media - including a Japan-only manga made by Coro Comics called <em>Crash Bandicoot—Dansu! de Jump! na Daibōken</em>, which followed the events of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back. He also appears in a series of web shorts that released in 2007 to promote Crash of the Titans.</p>
<p>As for Crash games, the status of the raving marsupial is a little in the air right now. The last few titles (N. Sane Trilogy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a>, Crash 4: It's About Time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a>) were handled by Toys for Bob, and as of February 2024, the developer has left Activision to go independent. On its departure, the studio did note that it was exploring "a possible partnership between our new studio and Microsoft," claiming that Microsoft and Activision were "extremely supportive" of the way things were shaking out. We don't yet know what Toys for Bob is working on, but there has been speculation it's a new Crash game. 
</p>
<p>Either way, a 2024 report suggested Crash Bandicoot 5 was cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-bandicoot-5-cancelled-in-favour-of-live-service-games-report-claims">in favour of live-service games</a>, noting that the title would have been a direct sequel to It's About Time.</p>

            <p>A fan-made Bully Online mod is not only real, it's entering Early Access starting this December to those who support the project on Ko-Fi.</p>
<p>The mod will not only provide access to multiplayer servers, but it'll also feature a mix between open sandbox gameplay and competitive mini-games. Players will be able to earn money which can be spent on items, housing, cars and more. There'll also be racing, with custom-made vehicles.</p>
<p>Those who support the mod on Ko-Fi will also earn behind the scenes content, a special blue player name tag, an in-game digital camera, priority when joining servers, and a special role in the mod's Discord server.</p>

<p>A new trailer and a breakdown of Bully Online features was uploaded to the SWEGTA channel, the face of the small development team that has been working on the mod for some time. In this video it's noted that public access to the mod will be coming "in due time", but for now the December Early Access is the only date set in stone.</p><p>Bully has gained a cult following ever since its release back in 2006, though somewhat recently there has been some sour news for this loyal fanbase. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-opens-up-on-bully-2-you-just-cant-do-all-the-projects-you-want">Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser stated back in September that: "you just can't do all the projects you want"</a> when talking about why there was never a sequel to the beloved schoolyard adventure game.</p>

            <p>
Stop Destroying Videogames - the European campaign inspired by the Stop Killing Games movement - says it's "confident" its petition will progress to the legislative phase now that 15 EU countries have successfully verified almost half of its 1.4m signatures between them.
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames is looking to convince the EU to pass regulations preventing "the remote disabling of video games by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said video games without the involvement from the side of the publisher." Its European Citizens' Initiative - an official EU mechanism designed to provide a way for citizens to propose a legal act to the European Commission - surpassed the required 1m signatures before the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/eci">petition</a> closed in July, meaning it can be presented to the EU for either a public hearing or full debate session at the European Parliament provided those signatures can be successfully verified.
</p>
<p>
Writing in September, Stop Destroying Videogames said it expected the verification process to take around three months, and it's now shared a progress report in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StopKillingGames/comments/1og0kb3/stop_killing_games_announcement/">new post to the Stop Killing Games campaign's subreddit</a>. "Out of 1,448,270 signatures, 689,035 are already verified, and 15 countries have met their thresholds," petition organisers explained. "We are still missing the two largest countries - Germany and France - but based on our current progress, we are confident we have surpassed the required thresholds." They added only about 3 percent of signatures have failed verification so far.
</p>
<p>
According to the update, Stop Destroying Videogames organisers have been engaged in "intense discussions" with Members of the European Parliament, national governments, political parties, and the European Commission throughout the verification process, ready for the legislative phase. It's also been working to secure expert backing from academics, explaining, "Having politicians, lobbyists, and developers in our ranks is invaluable, but we must credibly address the tough questions." Organisers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-stop-destroying-videogames-petition-verification-continues-in-eu-organisers-preparing-to-counter-misinformation-and-industry-lobbying">previously said</a> they were taking steps to counter "misinformation and industry lobbying".
</p><p>
"Our fight is not against a united CEO front," the update continues. "It's against a handful of companies holding our favourite games hostage... Let's not just talk about developers but with them, big and small, who are already resisting these awful practices. We can't undo past damage, but we can stop what's coming. If we allow these few bad actors to dictate the future, we will continue to lose ground on issues that should never have arisen."
</p>
<p>
Stop Destroying Videogames' update concludes with a call for EU citizens to reach out to their governments, local consumer protection groups, and favourite studios in order to spread the word. It also encourages developers to make their voices heard. "We are already in talks with many in the industry," it explains. "If we’ve missed you... please reach out to us... We are planning public events and want to bring some of you in front of parliament to demonstrate how things could be."
</p>
<p>In July, EU industry body Video Games Europe - whose members include Ubisoft, Take-Two, Warner Bros., Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Microsoft, and Nintendo - insisted the initiative's proposals <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">would make games "prohibitively expensive to create"</a>.</p>

            <p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery on social media has absolutely been a power-play to appeal to like-minded American gamers.</p>
<p>As if there were any doubt, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/exclusive-white-142217261?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link">White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told journalist Alyssa Mercante</a> overnight: "Yet another war ended under President Trump's watch - only one leader is fully committed to giving power to the players, and that leader is Donald J. Trump. That's why he's hugely popular with the American people and American Gamers."</p>
<p>Desai's comments were made in relation to <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1982819431894901043">an image tweeted by the Department of Homeland Security</a>, which showed a picture of a Halo ring world and two spartan soldiers in a Warthog jeep - one driving it and the other on top of it, operating the machine-gun turret. The soldiers appear below the words "Destroy the Flood" and a call to join the Immigration Customs Enforcement group, ICE.</p>
<p>The Flood are the primary antagonists in the Halo franchise - a parasitic lifeform which overran the galaxy. The reference here in the ICE promotional image, then, is depressingly clear: the Flood represents the immigrants ICE seeks to forcefully detain.</p>

</span></p><p>The US government's use of AI-generated Halo imagery started at the weekend, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Microsoft announced a remake of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> will be coming to PC, Xbox and - for the first time - PlayStation. In response, <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982213786221109263">US games retailer GameStop posted a memey statement declaring the console wars dead</a> - the inference being that now Halo, the series that epitomised the rivalry between Xbox and PlayStation, was heading to Sony's machine, the console wars were effectively over.</p><p>The White House X account responded to this <a href="https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1982638578913206632">with an AI-generated image of Donald Trump as Master Chief</a>, holding a blue energy sword and saluting in front of an American flag, which doesn't have the correct amount of state-stars on it. "Power to the Players," the tweet read.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1982654845166428607">GameStop replied with another AI-generated Halo image</a> showing Trump's face in Master Chief's helmet, and holographic AI companion Cortana as Vice President JD Vance nearby. GameStop hasn't tweeted since.</p>
<p>All eyes now are on Microsoft and whether it will do anything about the unsanctioned use of AI-generated Halo imagery to promote political causes such as this. Microsoft has not commented on the matter and I expect never will, though I've asked through official channels all the same.</p>
<p>However, we can find depressing precedent in the recent lack of action (or effect) by Nintendo's legal team to do anything about the US Department of Homeland Security using imagery and music from Pokémon to promote ICE causes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">The Pokémon Company even publicly confirmed it had not sanctioned the use of Pokémon  assets in this way</a>, further underlining its apparent powerlessness to change the situation.</p><p>That, then, is what I expect this latest Halo-related display is: another power-play. Another demonstration that as unsanctioned and abhorrent as the use of the Halo imagery is, and enormously powerful as Microsoft is, it probably won't be able to force the US government to take it down.</p>
