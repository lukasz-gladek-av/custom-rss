            <p>If you are one of the many who play Wordle every day (I still like to use it to flex the ol' mental muscles with my morning cup of tea), you may well be interested to discover the one word in 2024 that stumped so many of us, it broke a whopping 5.6m streaks.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/news/new-york-times-top-wordle-connections-2024-rcna185738">Today</a>, editorial director of NYT Games Everdeen Mason revealed that 11.1bn puzzles were solved via the New York Times in 2024. Of those, Wordle accounted for 5.3bn plays.</p>

<p>The most played day for the New York Times' Wordle puzzle was 23rd April, when the word was Rover. But the word that left the most players scratching their heads arrived later in the year, on 15th October. That word was Corer. Like I said, this chap caused 5.6m Wordle streaks to come to an end.</p><p>In addition to sharing these little titbits, Mason revealed 2.8 million of us are creatures of habit and routine, and use the same starting word every day. As Eurogamer reported previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-now-has-an-in-app-bot-to-analyse-how-good-your-guesses-are">the most popular starting word for Wordle is Adieu</a>, which is actually what my mother uses (for general interest, I always start with Ouija. My sister-in-law starts with Ocean).</p>
<p>I also learned a few weeks ago that Epona - Link's wonderful horse from the Legend of Zelda series - can not be used as a guess. I was quite upset by this, and took a screenshot to document this sad moment (and now, finally, I have somewhere to share it - so, hurrah!).</p>

<p>Along with Wordle, other New York Times puzzles also remain popular. In 2024, the Mini Crossword and Strands accounted for 2.1bn and 1.3bn plays respectively. I recently discovered Strands - which is a kind of themed word search - along with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-responds-to-only-connect-resemblance">Only Connect clone Connections</a>, and have added these to my daily puzzle time. Anyone else?</p>

            <p>The Sonic film franchise has now surpassed $1bn at the global box office, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> prior to Christmas.</p>
<p>The latest film earned over $187m in the US, for a worldwide total of $336.3m. It debuted globally with $211.5m in its first week.</p>
<p>The previous two films collectively grossed $725.2m globally, following releases in 2020 and 2022 respectively. In addition, they generated $181m in consumer spending on home rentals and purchases, while the Knuckles TV spin-off on Paramount+ was the number one Kids and Family series ever on the platform with 11m global hours watched in its first 28 days of streaming.</p>

<p>Sonic 3 has certainly been a success, then, earning franchise-best critics ratings, aided by the inclusion of Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>"We are so overjoyed with the amazing response to the Sonic the Hedgehog films from audiences and fans around the world and are proud to be part of the incredible, world-class filmmaking team that has come together to build this franchise," producers Neal H Moritz and Toby Ascher said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>"We make these movies for the fans; and their passion, support and love for these characters is what drives us every day to continue creating the fast, funny and action-packed stories that make up the ever-expanding Sonic Universe."</p> <div>

<p>Now we have brand-new images of what's reported to be the new generation of Joy-Con controllers with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Reportedly originating from China, the Joy-Con shows off its new magnetic attachment as well as revised colour palette which differs from existing Joy-Cons.</p> <div>

<p>If the images are authentic - and right now, there is no proof - it looks like we can also expect enlarged SL and SR buttons, too, and maybe even a mouse-like optical sensor. You can check the photos out yourself in the X post above or in the subreddit thread embedded below:</p>

</span></p><p>If the images are not fake and do indeed originate from a Chinese factory that's manufacturing the new machines (apparently, the Joy-Con has a system serial number that is allegedly validated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hua4lu/the_leaked_photo_of_the_switch_2_joycon_has_a/">Nintendo's Check Warranty page</a>), it seems increasingly unlikely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo will exceed its self-imposed deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor.</p>

            <p>As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs.</p>
<p>Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about "why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat" and discussed "whether or not games treat [violence] as the default".</p>

<p>Acknowledging he's had "pushback on similar answers in the past", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: "The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it".</p>
<p>"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games.</p>
<p>"This is <em>obvious</em>. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take <em>just</em> as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars," he added.</p>
<p>And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a "drop in the bucket", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, "those drops become a storm and companies will listen".</p>
<p>"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent," he added. "It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.</p><p>"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?" Cain said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-co-creator-tim-cain-says-violence-will-be-the-default-in-aaa-rpgs-as-long-as-we-keep-buying-it-companies-dont-make-them-because-they-feel-like-it-they-make-them-because-they-sell/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!"</p>
<p>As for that aforementioned Amazon Fallout show? Last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-starts-filming-with-walton-goggins-back-in-character">Walton Goggins slipped back into his Ghoulish guise</a> to start filming the second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
