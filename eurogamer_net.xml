            <p>The co-creator of the original Xbox console, Seamus Blackley, said VR still doesn't have a "killer app" yet and that's why the technology hasn't taken off.</p>
<p>Blackley spoke on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4z0BGj2zmTceUpoQ8WL2qr">VideoGamer Podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcguide.com/news/xbox-creator-claims-theres-still-no-killer-app-for-vr-yet/">PC Guide</a>) and had some strong words to say about VR and AR gaming.</p>
<p>"We've seen VR and AR not really take off, and if you're a big fan, I'm sorry, but it's just the fucking fact," he said. "There is no killer app and nobody can put their finger on what a killer app could be."</p>

<p>He continued: "Everybody has a different kind of personal fantasy and then, at least in my experience, when you are given the environment that you sort of fantasised about you're like 'OK' and you just want to take the headset off, because it's this hot, heavy thing. It's weird and disappointing."</p>
<p>Blackley said one of the key issues with VR "from a narrative standpoint" is that it offers "too much freedom", and that illusion of freedom is undermined by the need for developers to provide narrative control.</p>
<p>"When you lower the structure so much for the player that they are in the headset and they look around everywhere, in principle as an elevator pitch that sounds great," he said. "In practice, when we want to be entertained, we want a storyteller to control the narrative and to entertain us.</p>
<p>"To some extent you need [developers] to be able to control what you're looking at," he continued. "You need them to constrain you to the narrative which is not the thing you're going to do. And there's a small minority of guys who are going to scream and yell at them and want full control and that's great, super cool, fine, guys but they enjoy having that control because they're getting off on breaking that narrative control and they wouldn't be getting off on it if it wasn't there already, so it's paradoxical."</p>
<p>There have certainly been some great technical showcases for VR: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-a-visually-spectacular-introduction-to-the-psvr2">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> launched with Sony's PSVR2 to show off its capabilities, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-alyx-review-a-legend-returns-in-elegant-form">Valve's Half-Life Alyx</a> has been celebrated by the few who have played it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-a-pure-power-fantasy-that-epitomises-everything-great-about-virtual-reality">Synapse</a> is another great VR game that "epitomises everything great about virtual reality", as reads our review, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beat-saber-out-now-on-psvr2">Beat Saber</a> - available on almost every headset - is arguably VR's "killer app".</p>
<p>Yet Sony in particular is failing to support its PS VR2 headset - its recent PlayStation State of Play had no mention of the platform whatsoever. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> creative director Nicolas Doucet said last year there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-chance-of-astro-bot-coming-to-ps-vr2-says-creative-director">"no chance" of the game coming to PS VR2</a>, and as Eurogamer's Ian Higton wrote "it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">hard to stay excited about the PlayStation VR2</a> if even Astro Bot won't wear one", after starring in PS VR1 game Astro Bot: Rescue Mission.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Eternal Strands, the well-received action-RPG from Dragon Age boss Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has shared its latest roadmap, promising - among other things - free DLC created in collaboration with Final Fantasy concept artist Yusuki Mogi and, separately, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a> studio Grasshopper Manufacture.
</p>
<p>
Eternal Strands, if you're in need of a refresher, launched last month, inviting players to follow the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, it borrows bits from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, with a bit of Monster Hunter thrown in - a mix Christian Donlan reckoned made for a "combustible and hilarious sandbox" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-strands-review">four star Eurogamer review</a>.

<p>
And now, with Eternal Strands' first month of release almost behind it, Yellow Brick Games is ready to start discussing its post-launch plans. And that begins with a "Day 30 Patch" coming in March and promising a range of enhancements. There's talk of improved character movement to reduce its "slippery" sensation, for instance, as well as improved combat responsiveness, reduced Umbral Darter presence in certain areas, bug fixes, and more.
</p>
<p>
Then it's onto the fun stuff. Sometime this "spring", Eternal Strands will receive its first free DLC. This'll see Yellow Brick teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and XVI concept artist Yusuke Mogi to design and introduce a new in-game epic, a new armour set, and new weapon skins. Eternal Strands' spring update also promises a new map and magic power, a weapon and armour dying system, Oria's tips and tricks, plus further bug fixes.

<p>
That'll eventually lead into summer, when Eternal Strands' second free DLC update arrives. This is a collaboration with No More Heroes studio Grasshopper Manufacture, and is set to deliver currently unspecified "new content", among other things.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of March's first major patch release, Yellow Brick has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1491410/announcements/detail/506195909797741133">shared developer notes</a> outlining its key changes in more detail. Additionally, the studio is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalStrands/comments/1iuunkp/ama_with_the_devs_feb_27_11am_et/">set to hold an Eternal Strands Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> this Thursday, 27th February at 4pm GMT, where it'll be nattering about everything from the game's lore to the future features and content it has planned.
