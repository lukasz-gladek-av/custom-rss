            <p>The creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, has called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop.</p>
<p>Seventeen days ago, Brier shared a Bluesky post with a series of games titled Unpacking on the eShop, clearly inspired by Witch Beam's award-winning game and sharing the same trademarked name.</p>
<p>Specifically, Unpacking Universe Dreams from CGI Lab (and its DLC packs) was added to the store on 26th October, which invites players to "explore a whimsical world where each box holds new adventures" as they "unpack and arrange items in vibrant locations, each with its own unique atmosphere".</p>

<p>Earlier today, Brier posted on Bluesky once more, stating Nintendo has not responded to reports of these "egregious scams".</p>
<p>"It's been over two weeks and these are still on the eShop," wrote Brier. "Nintendo hasn't responded to any of our reports of these egregious scams which are using our trademarked game name and purposely tricking Nintendo customers into buying cheap fakes."</p>

</span></p><p>This isn't the first time the Unpacking developers have faced this type of scam. Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-rip-off-pulled-from-app-stores-but-only-after-topping-charts">another Unpacking imitator was removed</a> from the iOS and Google Play store after topping their most-downloaded charts.</p>
<p>"If you've happened to catch an ad for a suspiciously similar-looking game to Unpacking on mobile recently, please know that this is not our game," the official Unpacking account explained at the time. "They sure seem to want to give the impression that it is, though!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for further comment.</p>
<p>This also isn't the only game on the store from Moldovan studio CGI Lab. Two other games from the developer are currently listed: SCP-087 The Stairwell Horror and Abyss: Backrooms Pools Horror. However, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/no-indie-hit-unpacking-hasnt-unboxed-new-dlc-its-just-another-naff-eshop-clone">Nintendo Life</a> previously reported, the developer has released games such as Video Game Store: Supermarket Simulator, Car Parking Legends: Drive &amp; Park Adventure and Anime Puzzle Quest: The Magical Girls Adventure. These are all no longer on the store and the <a href="https://cgilabgames.com/">CGI Lab website</a> does not list its games.</p>
<p>The Switch eShop has long been scrutinised, in particular for a prevalence in hentai games. In 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-updated-eshop-rules-on-adult-content-publisher-says">Nintendo revised its eShop rules on adult content</a> as a result.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent came under fire for its Light of Motiram game</a> that's heavily inspired by Sony's Horizon games - or Horizon Zero Originality as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s game has been jokingly dubbed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2021-in-review-the-most-moving-game-of-the-year-was-about-moving">Unpacking was Eurogamer's game of the year</a> back in 2021 for its moving storytelling.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom is working on more revivals of its dormant series, the company said following the reveal of new Okami and Onimusha games at last week's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>"In addition to regularly releasing major new titles each year, Capcom is focusing on re-activating dormant IPs that haven’t had a new title launch recently," reads a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e241213.html">press release</a> to investors.</p>
<p>"The company is working to further enhance corporate value by leveraging its rich library of content, which includes reviving past IPs like [Okami and Onimusha], in order to continuously produce highly efficient, high-quality titles."</p>

<p>It's unclear what form these revivals will take, be it some form of remaster or remake, or a brand new game.</p>
<p>For instance, both the Okami and Onimusha games are new entries in their respective series. But Capcom has also seen great success with its Resident Evil remake games.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Okami sequel</a> will be developed by Hideki Kamiya's new Clovers studio, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> is set to launch in 2026.</p>
<p>The news of these revivals follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-success-boosts-capcoms-expected-profits">success of Dragon's Dogma 2</a> this year, which helped to boost Capcom's expected profits, as well as the recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-review">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-review">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</a>.</p>
<p>So what could be next? <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> is perhaps the most obvious, especially considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">fan interest in a new game acknowledged by Capcom in an official poll</a>.</p>
<p>The original Dino Crisis, a PS1 survival horror game, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dino-crisis-is-now-available-for-all-to-purchase-on-playstation">available for all to purchase on PlayStation</a>.</p>
<p>Could we also see a new Devil May Cry game soon, following the success of the fifth game? Could a new Mega Man game be on the way? Or could Capcom revive another RPG series: Breath of Fire?</p>
<p>Until then, Capcom is busy with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, due out on 28th February next year.</p>
<p>What series would you like to see Capcom tackle next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has stated if he'd continued working for Platinum Games his "artistic spirit [would] die".</p>
<p>The former Platinum vice-president has launched a new studio with another former Platinum employee, Kaneto Koyama, as discussed in a new interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2412133p">denfaminicogamer</a>.</p>
<p>The pair have set up Clovers, which will develop a sequel to the much-loved Okami, originally developed by Kamiya at Clover Studio.</p>

<p>"This is purely my personal opinion, but I thought, 'If I continue working here, my artistic spirit will die'," said Kamiya on his reasons for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-leaving-platinumgames">leaving Platinum last year</a> (via machine translation).</p>
<p>"I can understand the way PlatinumGames is as a company and its logic, and I was in the position of vice president myself, but as an individual named Hideki Kamiya, I was unable to embrace that way of thinking."</p>
<p>As vice president, Kamiya was "field-first" at Platinum Games - he described himself as the muscle and CEO Atsushi Inaba as the brains.</p>
<p>"The signals sent from the cerebrum are essential for muscles," Kamiya continued. "At the same time, those signals must be reliable for muscles. Until then, I had received those signals, trusted them, and worked to maximize my own strength...but with regards to the future direction of Platinum with Inaba at the helm, I was no longer able to place my trust in them and exert my strength as a muscle."</p>
<p>Kamiya has been quite vocal about his decision to leave Platinum Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">previously stating there were issues of "trust"</a>.</p>
<p>He then launched a YouTube channel where he discussed his next project. "I already have a clear idea in mind," he said. "I would like to translate this vision in my head into a full proposal as soon as I am able to do so. And of course, I also have an idea of what I can do to make the project a reality. But if you ask me specifically what kind of game it will be, all I can say at this stage is, 'It'll be a Hideki Kamiya game'."</p>
<p>It's unclear if that project is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">new Okami sequel</a>, announced as in-development at this year's The Game Awards last week.</p>

<p>In this new interview, Kamiya and Koyama explained the Clovers name of the new studio. It's been interpreted as "C lovers", with four Cs relating to the four leaves of a clover.</p>
<p>Only three Cs are set in stone though: challenge, creativity, and craftsmanship. The fourth C is for employees to decide upon themselves.</p>
<p>In a previous interview, Kamiya stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">Okami's sales were a "huge failure"</a> and that had the game been more successful Clover Studio probably would have continued.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji has posted a lengthy statement following the action game's apparent snub for the top prize at this year's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>"The games nominated this year were all exceptional, but honestly, I still can't figure out what the criteria were for Game of the Year. I feel like I came all the way here for nothing!" he wrote in a post on <a href="https://weibo.com/6603744955/5111567333196223">Weibo</a> (translated on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1he81dp/game_producer_of_black_myth_wukongs_post_after_tga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>).</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong did come away with the Best Action Game and Players' Voice awards, so he didn't leave empty handed.</p>

<p>"Since last night, I've seen a lot of strong dissatisfaction and frustration in players' comments - often expressed humorously or ironically, which made me laugh," the producer continued.</p>
<p>"I completely understand these feelings and share the frustration, because behind these emotions lies not pain or malice, but dignity and confidence."</p>
<p>Feng Ji even admitted he wrote his Game of the Year acceptance speech two years ago, "only to never get the chance to deliver it".</p>
<p>It's unclear how joking he has been in his statement, especially considering the machine translation, but some have read it as rather salty. Eurogamer has contacted Game Science for further comment.</p>
<p>The producer continued to express his confidence in the game and his hopes the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> is the beginning of a new wave of high-quality, engaging games from Chinese developers.</p>
<p>Former Sony Santa Monica writer Alanah Pearce shared in a stream she witnessed a person from the Game Science team crying in the audience when the game didn't win. "It clearly meant a lot to them, they did an amazing thing, but I did find that surprising," said Pearce.</p>
