            <p>Valve is testing the ability to permit Steam reviewers to include hardware specs in their reviews.</p>
<p>Though only available to participants in Steam's Client Beta for now, reviewers will be able to "attach hardware specs when writing or updating a Steam User Review on a game's store page".</p>
<p>If it rolls out to all, it'll help players identify if any performance issues are restricted to certain specs or configurations, and if anyone else with a similar rig is having the same problems.</p>
<p>The patch also fixes an issue wherein streaming could throttle downloads even after you've finished streaming, and adds the option to provide anonymised framerate data.</p>
<p>"When enabled Steam will collect gameplay framerate data, stored without connection to your Steam account but identified with the kind of hardware you are playing on," Valve explains in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/505101717860253962">beta client patch notes</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/steam-reviews-set-to-show-a-players-specs-so-its-easier-to-know-if-youll-share-their-experience-or-they-misread-the-minimum/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"This data will help us learn about game compatibility and improve Steam. This feature is currently in Beta with a focus on devices running SteamOS."</p>
<p>Here's the full patch note:</p>
<blockquote><p>General</p>

<p>Talking of Steam, a couple of weeks ago, the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled a £656m market rigging lawsuit filed against Valve by digital rights campaigners can proceed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/14m-steam-users-could-receive-compensation-after-uk-rules-valve-case-can-proceed">meaning 14m Steam users in the UK could receive compensation</a>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was originally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-being-sued-for-656m-in-uk-amid-accusations-of-market-rigging-through-steam">filed by digital rights activist Vicki Shotbolt in June 2024</a>, accusing Valve of rigging the PC games market and deliberately "shutting out" competition through Steam. Shotbolt had argued Valve imposed price parity clauses on publishers and developers, preventing them from selling titles at cheaper prices on rival platforms - limiting consumer choice and harming competition in turn.</p>
