            <p>
It's only been six months since Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2's well-received arrival, but developer Saber Interactive would already like you to know it's working on a sequel. Yup, Space Marine 3 is officially announced, but that's pretty much all we know so far.
</p>
<p>
Mainly, that's because it's extremely early days for Space Marine 3, with Saber confirming the game is only "now starting" development. The studio does, however, promise the next instalment of its third-person sci-fi shooter series will be an "even more immersive experience" and introduce "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular". And it seems safe to assume it'll once again follow the adventures of Ultramarines Captain Demetrian Titus, seeing as he pops up in Space Marine 3's single bit of promotional art. 
</p>
<p>
"Players can look forward to an immersive campaign, a multiplayer mode, and innovations that will redefine the standards of third-person action games," it says. "We will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third instalment."

<p>
As for Space Marine 2, it looks there's still plenty of life left in it. Saber confirms it'll "continue to support the game with exciting content and regular updates in the coming years" while it works on its newly announced sequel. And next up for Space Marine 2 is update 7.0, which is set to include the likes of private PvP lobbies, a new Operation and PvE weapon, plus reworks for class weapon loadouts and weapon perks balancing.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 enjoyed a strong critical and commercial reception when it launched last September. Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane called it a "spectacular and mostly thrilling follow-up" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">his four star review</a>, and it would go on to enjoy the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">Warhammer 40K series' most successful Steam launch yet</a>. Which bodes well for a Space Marine 3.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-soundtrack-details-rolled-out<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier this month and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">a few unintentional slips</a>, Activision officially announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4</a> are coming back, with the two games getting remade from the ground up.</p>
<p>If you are anything like me, one of the things you will recall fondly when thinking back to those hazy days of playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 on their initial release are the games' soundtracks. Grinding and flipping along to the likes of Alien Ant Farm and Sum 41. Ah, those were the days.</p>
<p>Anyway, with the upcoming combined remakes, players are probably interested in finding out what the soundtrack will include. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">On that initial announcement</a>, Activision promised the remakes will include songs from the original games such as Ace of Spades by Motörhead, as well as new tracks which "capture the spirit of modern skate culture". And now, we know more songs that will be included on the games' combined rerelease, thanks to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU4xkATYcbh7">Spotify</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-of-thps-3-4-remastereds-soundtrack-revealed-song-list-so-far">IGN</a>).</p>
