            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has announced a delay for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>'s release on PlayStation VR2.</p>
<p>The upcoming VR release, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-sonys-playstation-state-of-play">first announced back in September</a>, was initially slated for this December. It will now be released in March of next year.</p>
<p>IO's global marketing director Jonathan Lacaille said the decision to delay was "not made lightly", adding the studio understood there was "a lot of demand" for Hitman World of Assassination on PSVR2. However, the team wants to make sure it gets it right.</p>

<p>"Our priority will always remain to deliver an amazing experience that meets the high standards our players expect," Lacaille wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/hitman-world-of-assassination-launches-on-ps-vr2-march-27-2025/">PlayStation blog post</a>.</p>
<p>"The additional time will not only allow our team to polish the game, ensuring that every aspect is refined, immersive, and seamless, but also to add a few extras that we really wanted to include in this PS VR2 version, such as active reloading."</p><p>Hitman World of Assassination - which comprises the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-to-become-world-of-assassination-will-include-hitman-1-and-2">rebooted Hitman 1, 2 and 3 games</a> - will now release on 27th March. On its debut, it will feature all main levels from the trilogy, with dual-weilding support and other new controls and gameplay mechanics, such as "positional interactions". This, IO said, will transform how players experience the World of Assassination.</p>
<p>"Rather than simply pressing a button to trigger events, players are required to physically mimic actions, such as toggling a TV on or off by touching the screen, hacking CCTV footage by tapping on a keyboard, or poisoning a glass by holding and dropping a vial over it," Lacaille explained.</p>
<p>"This feature extends to opening doors, creating smoother and more natural interactions. Furthermore, quest items now remain physical and can be inspected in hand, allowing players to utilise them directly within set pieces - swiping a keycard or turning a lock in a door, for example."</p>

<p>This won't be Agent 47's first foray into the world of VR. Earlier this year, XR Games released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3-vr-reloaded">Hitman 3 VR Reloaded</a>. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-thought-hitman-3-vr-was-bad-on-pc-just-wait-until-you-see-hitman-3-vr-reloaded-in-action">it didn't have the best debut</a>, and soon after its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-vr-studio-will-lay-off-nearly-all-staff-employee-says">studio was the subject of layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>For more VR news, earlier today we got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps-vr2-exclusive-alien-rogue-incursion-lands-december-release-date">release date for Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure was released last month across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. The Switch version was created by Engine Software in association with developer Deck Nine Games.</p>
<p>It's a direct sequel to the first game in the series and follows original protagonist Max, though this has proven controversial with some fans due to the consequences of the original game's final choice.</p>
<p>Deck Nine is the studio responsible for various <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> prequels, follow-ups and remasters. The original game, however, was developed by Don't Nod.</p>
<p>That studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-director-hits-out-at-hateful-comments-about-life-is-strange-double-exposure">creative director Michel Koch hit back at "hateful" comments</a> against Deck Nine from disappointed fans.</p>
<p>"I didn't play the game yet, and I have no idea where they are taking the story. But what I know is that nothing justifies hating on people for how they wrote their game!" he wrote on Twitter/X.</p>
<p>"You can be disappointed, you can want other narratives for those characters you love, or different storiesâ€¦ but ultimately creation is hard and very subjective and if [Double Exposure's] story does not please you, it does not erase what you imagined."</p>
<p>"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-playstations-state-of-play-may-2024">brief tease earlier in the year</a>, Sony has now lifted the lid further on Alien: Rogue Incursion, with a new trailer and - importantly - a release date.</p>
<p>The upcoming game was once slated for launch on PSVR2 at some point this 'holiday' season, but today the team narrowed that tenuous date down. VR fans, get your headsets ready, Alien: Rogue Incursion is set to make its unsettling debut on 19th December for PSVR2 and PC VR.</p>
<p>In addition to this date, Survios' chief product officer <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/alien-rogue-incursion-new-story-trailer-gameplay-details/">TQ Jefferson</a> shared a new story trailer, which "delves deeper into Zulaâ€™s [the game's protagonist] story on LV-354, also known as Purdan". </p>
<p>Jefferson said this trailer was made with a three-act structure, culminating in a "big finish". I won't spoil that big finish for you here, because where is the fun in that? Instead, you can find out for yourself by checking out Alien: Rogue Incursion's new story trailer for yourself below.</p>

<p>Speaking on the trailer's third act, Jefferson stated: "Weâ€™ve established by this point that danger is truly everywhere, and now we want to show players that you have the means to fight back."</p>
<p>Zula will be able to do this with weapons such as the M41 Prototype Pulse Rifle and gear such as a Plasma Torch, with Jefferson saying all of this will allow players to experience the world of Alien "like you never have before".</p><p>"You will finally get to feel what itâ€™s like to step into the world of the films - Aliens in particular - and immerse yourself in an experience so visceral and real that it will change your perceptions forever," the developer proclaimed, adding the game has gone gold.</p>
<p>So, what did you think?</p>
