            <p>We already knew that Marvel Rivals has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch last month - 10 million players joined online at launch - but now it's smashed another milestone, topping 600K concurrent players this weekend on Steam.</p>
<p>As recorded by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">SteamDB</a>, the number of players jumping into NetEase's hero shooter has hit 644,269 on Valve's digital platform, making it one of the biggest games not just of the  weekend, but also one of the biggest games by concurrent numbers of all-time, too.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> publisher CI Games confirmed it would not "embed social or political agendas" in its games due to the "high risk it can present".</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/czaty-inwestorskie/20250108/ci-games-marek-tyminski">Strefa Inwestorów</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/lords-of-the-fallen-studio-embraces-the-dei-bugbear-says-it-will-not-include-any-social-or-political-agendas-in-its-games/">PC Gamer</a>), global marketing director Ryan Hill told investors the studio would focus on "excellent user experience with compelling thematics and characters created specifically for core and adjacent audiences" following perceptions "a number of high profile releases underperform[ed] commercially during the last year" due to what he believed to be "social or political agendas."</p>
<p>"We remain committed to producing player-first video games that prioritise an excellent user experience with compelling themes and characters created specifically for core and adjacent audiences," Hill said when asked for the studio's position on "DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion - more commonly known as EDI in the UK] in gaming".</p>
<p>"While some video games have recently taken the opportunity to embed social or political agendas within their experiences, it is clear that many players do not appreciate this, and as a result, we have seen a number of high profile releases underperforming commercially during the last year alone.</p>
<p>"Our games will always be developed to maximise player enjoyment and commercial success, and as such, we will not be integrating any social or political agencies into these experiences going forward having observed the high risk this can present."</p>
<p>Hill did not expand on his definition of "social or political agencies", nor defined what "high risk" meant to him and studio leadership. He also didn't exemplify what games he considered had "underperformed commercially" or, indeed, clarify what commercial success looked like to him.</p>
<p>CI Games declined to comment further on Hill's statement to investors.</p>
<p>The action-RPG is currently sitting on a "mixed" Steam user score, and received just two stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">Eurogamer's Lords of the Fallen review</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-sequel-now-in-full-development">A sequel is currently in development</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Devil May Cry is coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to Fortnite leakers Loolo_Wrld and Wensoing, both of whom say the long-running rumours of a Dante-flavoured crossover - which first bubbled up in 2023 - are indeed correct, and there is one in the works.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Whilst both are fairly established leakers in their own rights, their news was picked up and shared by noted Fortnite leaker ShiinaBR, adding credence - if not quite a cast-iron guarantee - to the claims.</p>
<p>When pressed for more information - such as well the collaboration may arrive - Loolo was coy, saying, "I can’t specify anything about that for now", appending the statement with a zipped-mouth emoji.</p>
<p>Wensoing similarly will only commit to "coming soon", but acknowledges that both leakers "have heard about [the Devil May Cry crossover] several times via [their] insiders".</p> <div>

<p>As for the details? Well, that's all still very much up for speculation. There's no doubting that Devil May Cry boasts several iconic outfits and weapons, though, so there's plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>ICYMI, Fortnite Festival, the concert-themed rhythm-action portion of Epic Games' free-to-play jack-of-all-trades juggernaut, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-festival-is-getting-local-co-op-support-rekindling-memories-of-rock-band">getting local co-op support next month</a> - conjuring nostalgic memories of countless evenings spent twanging away in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a> with pals.</p>
<p>As Matt reminded us yesterday, Fortnite Festival is the work of Rock Band developer Harmonix - which Epic Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-acquires-rock-band-developer-harmonix">acquired back in 2021</a> - and is extremely reminiscent of the studio's beloved earlier titles, right down to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-developer-harmonixs-new-fortnite-music-mode-will-support-instrument-controllers">support for guitar-shaped plastic peripherals</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
