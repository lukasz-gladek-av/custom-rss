            <p>
Blizzard's big convention BlizzCon is skipping 2025, but will return in full strength next year.
</p>
<p>
Fans had hoped BlizzCon would return for 2025 - the event's 20th anniversary - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzcon-is-cancelled-again-after-last-years-first-in-person-event-since-2019">after it also didn't run in 2024</a>. Indeed, the fact there won't be a 2025 convention too means BlizzCon will miss two years on the trot - the first time it has done so since its founding in 2005.
</p>
<p>
Still, plans are afoot for BlizzCon to return properly in 2026, with dates set for Saturday 12th and Sunday 13th September at the Anaheim Convention Center in California.
</p>
<p>
"BlizzCon has been a cornerstone of Blizzard's history since 2005, allowing us to connect with our community and our players directly," the company wrote in a statement today. "For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening
Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience.
</p>
<p>
"We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for our players' connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure."
</p>
<p>
No mention was made of why the event was skipping 2025, though we've asked Blizzard about any other plans for this year.

<p>Katamari Damacy Mobile 2 (2012), Tap My Katamari (2016), and Amazing Katamari Damacy (2017) were all released on iOS. They were followed by the remake <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy Reroll</a> on Switch and PC in 2018 (later released on PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia in 2020) as well as its sequel We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie in 2023 across PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The first game in the series, Katamari Damacy, was released in 2004 for the PS2 and was a surprise hit for its quirky gameplay where players roll a ball to collect elements from the world and gradually grow larger.</p>
