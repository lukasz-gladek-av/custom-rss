            <p>Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has hit out at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, saying he "should've never been banned in the first place" despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitting to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June 2024.</p>
<p>Responding to news Twitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating guidelines will now be subjected to varying limited-time bans</a>, Beahm issued a comment from his personal account X/Twitter, saying Twitch "should've never allowed a low-level employee to override the entire ban system".</p>

<p>"Although things have been 'settled', Twitch should do the right thing and correct their mistake of permanently banning the Doc by reinstating the channel," he wrote. "We should've never been banned in the first place.</p>
<p>"Twitch should've never allowed a low level employee to override the entire ban system, which had already determined we didn't do anything wrong, because of biased opinions of the Doc character.</p>
<p>"They could've reached out and had a quick five-minute call and realise these mutual jokes and bantering never had serious intentions. Pathetic."</p>
<p>Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, claimed an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm.</p>
<p>After a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in September in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel, which was eventually approved.</p>
<p>Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. By the end of January, four months after making "significant" layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-studio-midnight-society-announces-closure-four-months-after-significant-layoffs">Midnight Society announced it was permanently shutting its doors</a>.</p>
<p>Beahm has yet to publicly share the "mutual jokes and bantering" messages he sent to the minor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Brace yourself, Assassin's Creed fans - it looks like early copies of the upcoming instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, have broken the street date.</p>
<p>Unsubstantiated reports are beginning to circulate that not only have some fans been able to download the full game early from the PlayStation Store, physical copies have been prematurely sold, too.</p>
<p><strong>There may be light spoilers after this point</strong>, so only proceed if you're happy to be spoiled!</p>

<p>Perhaps most notably, Assassin's Creed YouTuber The Hidden One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cm-56xcxUo">recently revealed</a> that he knows someone playing the full game on PS5 "because the PlayStation Store made a mistake".</p>
<p>Admitting that he could neither prove it or compel anyone to believe him, The Hidden One then revealed that in the leaked footage, he saw that Animus anomalies are back - something not previously confirmed for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>"In the video [the friend with early access] showed me, the player encounters something Animus in the world," he said.</p>
<p>"A pop up appeared that read: 'Animus systems breached. Stabilise anomalies and gain data fragments to advance your active strand'."</p>
<p>The player was then prompted to "press touchpad to open the Animus menu".</p>

</span></p><p>Over on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit it goes even further, with reports that <a href="https://ibb.co/PvQX2f2g">physical copies have similarly been sold early</a>.</p>
<p>While, as yet, there doesn't seem to be early footage popping up on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> or YouTube, now may be a good time to mute key words on your favourite social media apps, just in case...</p>
<p>Last week, Ubisoft signalled its expectations for Assassin's Creed Shadows in its latest quarterly financial results, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">in which it describes pre-orders for the game as "solid"</a>.</p>
<p>While the company did not divulge exact pre-order numbers, it said they were "in line with those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, the second most succesful entry of the franchise".</p>
<p>Our Katharine said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a> during our recent hands-on time with the game, and praised its dual protagonist gameplay. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait," she wrote.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beyond games, Jason is perhaps best-known for his roles in Deadwood, 48 Hrs, and Prince of Darkness, although you'll also spot him in movies like Rio Lobo, Impulse, Brewster's Millions, They Live, and Alien Nation. He also guest starred on Murder, She Wrote, The Golden Girls, Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories, and Mad Men.</p>

<p>This means even streamers with multiple infringements merely have to wait for the violations to "drop off [their] account". Providing you don't reoffend in a set period, your account will be reset to "good standing", as though the original violation never happened.</p>

<p>Higher-severity violations - such as ones for hateful conduct - could remain on an account longer, such as a couple of years. But players caught cheating in games whilst streaming via Twitch are now deem "low severity" will only face a 24-hour suspension from the service.</p>
<p>"Starting today, most violations will expire and drop off of your account after a set amount of time," Twitch <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US">explained</a>. "You will be able to track when they expire in the Appeals Portal, and this information will also be in the enforcement emails that you receive.</p>
<p>"Most violations committed tend to be low severity (such as cheating in online games) and will expire in 90 days. However, higher-severity violations (such as hateful conduct) will remain on an account longer, and will expire in 1 or 2 years.</p>
<p>"The most severe harms will still result in immediate indefinite suspensions. If you are indefinitely suspended due to accumulating multiple violations within a short time period, you are able to apply for reinstatement after 6 months."</p>
<p>Twitch believes "escalating consequences" will "hold users accountable for repeated harmful behaviour", defining harm as "including actions that lead to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a community member, to Twitch, or to society".</p>
<p>If your account was previously indefinitely suspended it will remain so despite these changes, Twitch stressed, although in those instances, users can apply for reinstatement (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">Insider Gaming</a>).</p>
<p>In November, just ahead of the US elections, Twitch tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues". However, after a vocal backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streams-about-political-and-sensitive-issues-including-reproductive-and-lgbtq-rights-now-require-a-label">Twitch clarified that labels would not apply if a streamer is discussing their "lived experience"</a>, or if discussion of these topics isn't the "focus" of the stream.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The pace of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> US sales has "fallen behind" that of the PS4 Pro.</p>
<p>That's according to games industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who used Circana data to conclude that whilst the PS5 Pro enjoyed a solid start, January 2025's hardware spend in the US was 45 percent lower when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>

<p>In fact, Piscatella posits that there was "double-digit percentage declines" across all major console platforms compared to a year ago, with PS5 hardware spend dipping by 38 percent year-on-year, Xbox Series declining by 50 percent, and Switch 53 percent.</p>
<p>The latter, however, may be as a result of players holding off for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as part of its financial report to investors, Sony confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">sales of its PS5 console have reached 75m units</a>, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>

<p>However, Sony deviated from the norm and chose not to separate console sales in this report, so we're no longer able to disaggregate PS5 Pro sales from the base console. This makes it difficult to ascertain if the PS5 Pro's eye-watering cost of admission has put off players who would typically update their hardware mid-generation.</p>
<p>That said, PlayStation 5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month in terms of both units sold and dollars generated. Xbox Series was second in hardware spending, although the Nintendo Switch edged out Xbox Series in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no comparative sales data for PS5 in the UK or Europe.</p>
<p>Back in November, Sony said that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-price-has-not-had-a-negative-impact-on-sales-says-sony-boss">the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on PS5 Pro sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now, however, Kinetic said the feature is ready to go on both PS5 and Xbox consoles, enabling console players to try out the voice prompts for equipment like the Spirit Box and Ouija Board, as well as Monkey Paw.</p>
