            <p>Balatro, the indie roguelike inspired by poker, has generated almost $4.4m on mobile alone since its release in September.</p>
<p>That's according to data from AppMagic (thanks <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/balatro-nears-44m-on-mobile-amid-a-sudden-spending-surge/">PocketGamer.biz</a>), which reveals the mobile game made a million dollars in its first week across the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>Balatro was first released in February on PC and console, but its popularity has surged following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-out-on-mobile-later-this-month">release on mobile platforms</a>.</p>

<p>What's particularly interesting is its release as a premium game for an upfront £9.99, unlike so many free-to-play (with microtransactions) games on mobile.</p>
<p>Balatro is also part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>, meaning even more players have played the game through Apple's subscription, though it's unclear how much money its inclusion here has generated.</p>
<p>On launch day, Balatro made $162k and then peaked at $200k a week after launch on 29th September, resulting in that million dollar first week.</p>
<p>Since then sales have declined but its inclusion as a Game of the Year nominee (among others) at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">this year's The Game Awards</a> has caused a resurgence in sales in the last couple of weeks. This resulted in the game's second highest earning week to date, generating $727k.</p>
<p>Developer Localthunk confirmed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1fkp6m0/balatro_mobile_and_iap/">reddit</a> ahead of Balatro's mobile release it would not have microtransactions or "predatory monetisation".</p>
<p>The developer also spoke out, back in March, about the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama"> game's rating drama</a> after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'". Said Localthunk: "I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Three more classic Sega Mega Drive games have today joined Nintendo's Switch Online catalogue.</p>
<p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, Vectorman, and Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs are now available for Expansion Pack members.</p>
<p>The former two games are both platformers exclusive to the Mega Drive.</p>

<p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, released in 1993, followed the first ToeJam &amp; Earl game from 1991, continuing the adventures of its whacky alien protagonists. However, it's a straightforward side-scrolling platformer where the previous game was inspired by Rogue.</p>
<p>Vectorman, meanwhile, was released in 1995 and was notable for its pre-rendered 3D models, rivalling those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> on the SNES.</p>
<p>Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs, meanwhile, is an earlier game from the platform: a top-down shooter adapted by Sega from the Capcom arcade game.</p>

            <p>The next round of cards joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> have leaked ahead of December's events.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-events-revealed-in-datamine">datamines revealed multiple cards and events arriving in December</a> with gen one starter Bulbasaur and its evolutions as the focus.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a new update of the app, promo cards for the next Wonder Pick and Solo Battle events have leaked. And yes, Bulbasaur is included.</p>

<p>As shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1h01lva/new_app_update_confirms_new_promo_cards_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>, the following Pokémon will feature and all have new card artwork: Jigglypuff, Onix, Greninja, Haunter, Bulbasaur, and Magnemite.</p>
<p>The latter two are particularly important as they reportedly will be the focus of the forthcoming Wonder Pick event. That Onix artwork looks a little interesting though.</p>
<p>These cards will all feature in a Venusaur PvE event set to begin on 29th November and run until 13th December. Much like the Lapras Ex event, players will battle against AI in solo battles for the rewards.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has already proven incredibly popular since its launch last month - in its first three weeks it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget to also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-forget-to-spend-your-pokemon-tcg-pocket-pack-points">spend your pack points</a>: these are earned by opening booster packs and can be spent on specific cards, but they have an unknown expiry date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo's Switch might be nipping at its heels, but PlayStation 2 continues to hold the record as the best-selling console of all time - with Sony now confirming the machine has shifted a whopping 160m units since launching all the way back in March 2000.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time we've heard that figure, of course; former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan casually claimed a total of 160m PlayStation 2s had been sold during a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/03/29/official-playstation-podcast-episode-481-heres-to-you-jim/">farewell edition of PlayStation Podcast</a> earlier this year, but Sony has now updated its <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/">PlayStation history page</a> to reflect that number, finally making it <em>officially</em> official.
</p>
<p>
PlayStation 2's last major sales milestone was trumpeted back in 2011, when Sony revealed the console had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-2-ships-over-150-million">surpassed 150m sales</a> - although it only took another year for that number to jump up by a further 5m. So while sales have undoubtedly slowed - not exactly surprising seeing as Sony hasn't produced a PS2 since January 2013 - the fact the console has successfully managed to shift another 5m units in the interim is still pretty wild.

<figcaption>And now for something a bit more recent.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzdV8lR82N4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
To put that into some sort of perspective, PlayStation 5 is currently at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">65m lifetime sales</a>, while PS4 has sold 117m units, PS3 is at the 87m mark, and PS1 was snapped up by 102m Vib-Ribbon fans. Nintendo's DS handheld <em>almost</em> came close to matching PS2's previously announced figure, shifting 154m units, but it now trails someway behind. As for Switch (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">currently at 146m sales</a>), it could still reign victorious if <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> doesn't get in its way.
</p><p>
For all this competitive chatter, 160m PS2s sold is still an impressive achievement, and you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-the-insiders-story-article">read more about the console's success elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>. It's not Sony's only cause for celebration, of course, given the entire PlayStation brand is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-playstations-30th-anniversary-london-tube-carriage-looks">marking its 30th anniversary</a> in exactly one week's time. And all this because of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ultra-rare-nintendo-playstation-prototype-sells-at-auction-for-gbp230-000">falling out with Nintendo</a>.
