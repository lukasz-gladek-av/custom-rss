            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> said its brand identity is "evolving" now keeping first-party games exclusive to its own platform is no longer "a path for [Xbox]".</p>
<p>When asked by independent games journalist <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254">Dustin Legarie</a> if, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> would continue to have an "exclusivity window" on Xbox systems, Spencer replied with a strikingly simple: "No."</p>

<p>"There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," Spencer explained.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is to allow our games to be available.</p>
<p>"Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform, but to keep games off other platforms?" Spencer added."We don't think is the path… that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us."</p> <div>

<p>"What we're doing now we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world's best games. 'Cos the world's biggest games are available in multiple places, and more and more creators are asking us, how do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places, and we want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that.</p>
<p>"We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are single platform on single device, whether that's PC, whether that's mobile, whether it's a console.</p>
<p>And we want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on."</p>
<p>When pressed on whether Xbox's change in strategy means it may lose its identity, Spencer was firm about that, too.</p>
<p>"I hear them. I'm pretty active in our playerbase, and I'm active in the community. I listen. I think our identity will continue to evolve, which, frankly, it always has. But when I hear concerns, I hear concerns about is: my library of games safe. Am I still going to be able to play the games. And I think over the years, I'm proud of the commitment we've shown to respecting purchases on our platform through back compat, through cross entitlement, Xbox Play Anywhere, through crossplay. Things that we've done to enable people to continue to play, so I hear that.</p><p>"I see the investments we're making in platform and how we want Xbox to show up in multiple places, and your library to be available there. When I think about buy-to-stream - so when if I buy a game, I'll be able to stream it to devices - this is all about making sure that your library of games that you own on Xbox are playable in multiple places, so I'd say it's in evolution of our identity. But I believe it's an identity that this industry needs.</p>
<p>"When you think about where this industry is now and you see the challenges, the business challenges that are out there for many companies, I think us making games more accessible to more people has just gotta be front and centre for us as an industry so we continue to see great games that we've seen over the years."</p>
<p>The comments echo Spencer's position at the end of last year, when he said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">"no red lines" over any Xbox game coming to Nintendo Switch or PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Avowed will not only let you customise your character's appearance but also the background "that will shape how the world perceives and responds to you", too.</p>
<p>In a series of posts on X/Twitter, Obsidian let fans in for an early peek at the fantasy RPG's Character Creation menu, where players can choose between an Arcade Scholar, Court Augur, Vanguard Scout, War Hero, and Noble Scion, all of which determine what dialogue options and starting weapons you'll have available to you when you kick off your adventure.</p>

<p>"You hail from the Aedyran Empir, but who exactly are you, Envoy?" Obsidian teased on social media (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1882518769563512842">TheGamer</a>). "Stranger still, you have never learned which god touched your soul.</p>
<p>"In the Character Creation menu, you'll have the opportunity to customize your Godlike character and choose a background that will shape how the world perceives and responds to you."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>For Noble Scion, we got to see exactly what's special about this background, too.</p>
<p>"You were born to a noble house of great influence, middling wealth, and questionable morals," the description said. "When scandals and succession disputes saw your family cast down, you threw yourself on the emperor's mercy, and he shielded you.</p>
<p>"Canny yet refined, you have become a formidable force at court and an invaluable ally to the emperor."</p>
<p>Don't worry about the character creation locking out any equipment and abilities you find in-game, though - Obsidian reassures us that "all equipment and abilities are available to you regardless of your background.</p>
<p>Avowed will released next month, 18th February, on PC (Steam and Battle.net) and Xbox Series X/S, with day-one access for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Those who pay £90 (or $90) for the game's Premium Edition, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-selling-five-days-early-access-if-you-pay-90">can play five days early</a>.</p><p>"'Your worlds, your way' isn't just a motto for Obsidian - it's how they design quests, regions, combat, and more," Xbox teased after this week's Developer Direct. "Learn how player freedom is at the heart of Avowed, making it a quintessential 'Obsidian RPG'."</p> <div>

<p>"Avowed does a lot of things that I like, and I enjoyed my time with it, more than I ever enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-three-hours-avowed-still-shows-no-sign-of-a-killer-hook-to-call-its-own-but-this-fizzy-rpg-cocktail-is-plenty-enjoyable-all-the-same">Eurogamer's Avowed preview</a>. "That said, nothing I saw stood out as wildly original, or that Avowed could entirely call its own.</p>
<p>"That isn’t to say such an element doesn’t exist, or even that Avowed necessarily needs it. But for better or worse, there is still some mystery at the heart of Avowed. The question for when it launches is: will there be a solution?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Four studios are battling it out to once again reboot Capcom's Resident Evil movie franchise, only this time, PlayStation Productions is also on board.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Warners Bros. and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> are amongst a number of hopefuls looking to reboot Constantin Film's horror series alongside PlayStation's production company.</p>
<p>Writer and director of 2022's brilliant Barbarian, Zach Cregger, is attached to write and direct and is reportedly keen to keep his Resident Evil adaptation faithful to the games that spawned the multimillion-dollar - and multimedia - franchise.</p>

<p>Whilst little else is known about the project at this time, it's thought Shay Hatten (John Wick: Chapter 4, Army of the Dead) is on board to co-write the seventh major instalment of the horror movie series. The prior six movies all starred Milla Jovovich apart from the last attempted reboot which released in 2021.</p><p>There was also an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-resident-evil-show-has-already-been-cancelled">ill-fated Netflix show that was unceremoniously cancelled</a> within a month of its debut episode following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-new-resident-evil-series-is-going-down-badly-with-fans">disappointing reviews</a>, with one commenter stating: "Terrible; followed by more terrible; just when you lose all hope; it smacks you with even more terrible".</p>
<p>PlayStation Productions was established by Sony in 2019 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-opens-playstation-productions-to-develop-multiple-game-franchises-into-tv-and-movies">to convert its video game franchises into blockbuster films and television shows</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
