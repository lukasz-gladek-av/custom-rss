            <p>A mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been created that allows for unlimited character and palico edits, essentially bypassing Capcom's monetisation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">As we reported last week</a>, editing your character after the initial setup requires special vouchers that can be bought for Â£5.79, although Capcom does provide a voucher to change your characters once for free.</p>
<p>It's an egregious inclusion that nonetheless has been part of the games since Monster Hunter World. But thanks to modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/133?tab=description">Ridog8</a>, PC players can have unlimited character edits.</p>

<p>The mod still uses edit vouchers, but they're set to zero and will continue to work. Surely Capcom will find a way to patch this out?</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds only released a few days ago, but already there are plenty of mods available for PC players looking to improve the experience.</p>
<p>For instance, Monster Hunter Wilds includes an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-turn-on-arachnophobia-setting-monster-hunter-wilds">arachnophobia mode</a> in its accessibility settings, but frustratingly that only applies to the smaller eight-legged creatures that crawl around the wilds and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-arachnophobia-mode-turns-eight-legged-critters-into-amusing-blobs">turns them into blobs of goo instead</a>.</p>
<p>But there are larger monsters to hunt that are especially spider-like: the Lala Barina, for instance, with its spindly legs and scarlet webbing; or the Nerscylla that swings like Spider-Man over each battle arena.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/143?tab=description">Tea Common Shark</a> has created a mod that extends the arachnophobia mode to these larger monsters - they're not quite giant blobs, but at least their spider-like features are mostly disguised.</p>
<p>"I did this mainly because it's funny," the modder joked, "but it might also help those who can't bear to look at them."</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Other mods look to improve on some of the key criticisms of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/136">Furiante</a> has created a harder difficult mod that increases monster HP and damage, with multiple values available so hunters can customise the experience to their liking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/16?tab=description">GreenComfyTea</a> has created a mod that adds health bars to monsters, though I'd argue half the fun is not knowing the numbers and watching for that telltale limp instead.</p>
<p>Another complaint are the drab, somewhat washed out visuals of the game, but beyond playing with the game's brightness and saturation options, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/168">SchiggyCGN</a> has created a reshade that makes the game considerably more vibrant. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/94">Other modders</a> have done <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/97">similar work</a>.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Perhaps most ambitiously, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/88">Velasquez</a> has created a mod with new graphic presets in a bid to optimise the game's performance. Considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">poor performance of Monster Hunter Wilds on PC</a>, it's great to see modders getting to grips with optimisation before Capcom does.</p>

            <p>
Steam hit another new player record this weekend, with more than 40 million people online at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
Last Friday was, of course, the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> - which soared to a peak of more than 1.38 million concurrent players on Saturday night. That same total was then repeated on Sunday, when a peak of 1.37 million concurrent players jumped back into the game.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Monster Hunter Wilds is the second-most played game on Steam, behind evergreen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, but ahead of other stalwarts such as PUBG and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds has clearly been a huge hit</a>, with a Steam play count three times higher than any previous Monster Hunter game, let alone anything else publisher Capcom has ever launched, Resident Evil included.
</p>
<p>
It's not all been plain sailing for the game, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">User reviews for Monster Hunter Wilds remain "Mixed" on Steam</a>, with only 53 percent of players currently saying they'd recommend the game, and a fair amount of criticism for its technical performance on PC right now.

<p>
Digital Foundry echoed that on Friday, going as far as saying the team "can't recommend the PC version" as "substantial technical problems must be addressed".
</p>
<p>
"To sum up, lower-end graphics cards with lower VRAM allocations should avoid Monster Hunter Wilds until these issues are rectified," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia wrote</a>. "Higher-end hardware can brute-force the game's shortcomings to some degree, but it's still hard to recommend such a flawed technical outing - or even derive optimised settings."
</p>
<p>
Other criticism has surfaced for the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">need to pay if you want to keep changing your Monster Hunter Wilds character</a> - though you do get one edit for free.

<p>Towards the end of last month, a little game you may have heard of - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-balatro-has-shadow-dropped-on-game-pass">Balatro - became available via Xbox Game Pass</a>. We here at Eurogamer are rather fond of Balatro, naming it one of our favourite games of 2024. "It's a work of marvellous depth and winning simplicity, and rightly one of the best and most memorable games you'll play this year," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's round up of the 50 best games of 2024</a>.</p>

<p>"My new support worker knows I love board games, and he showed me I can play Cluedo online! Itâs part of my strategy now when I need a distraction, it feels really good to have plans to help me cope."</p>
<p>"The NSPCC is excited to announce the launch of the Game Safe Steam sale. The proceeds will help us to support children and young people through services, such as Childline," said Lewie Procter, head of gaming partnerships at the NSPCC.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled that popular games, such as Cluedo, Hypnospace Outlaw and Yes, Your Grace, are on sale, giving gaming fans a chance to make a difference.</p>
<p>"We want to thank Steam for partnering with us and to the developers and publishers for supporting this brilliant initiative. We are proud to work with them and look forward to continuing to raise awareness of online safety on gaming platforms."</p>

            <p>Subcult Joint's frantic 2D Metroidvania, Cookie Cutter, is finally coming to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As well as the base game, in which players "punch, stab, slice, and maul enemies as Cherry, a take-no-prisoners fembot trying to survive a twisted planet on the brink of destruction", the Switch Overkill Edition boasts three updates and upgrades, including fully voiced dialogue for every character, new map features, and brand-new special moves and upgrades for Cherry.</p>

<p>Other new features include new cinematics to "add more style and background to the story", "tons" of gameplay tweaks and progression balancing, and a handful of special Nintendo Switch-flavoured easter eggs, too.</p>
<p>There's also now a new feature that helps you "gauge completion status".</p>
<p>"Love turns to rage and chainsaws in Cookie Cutter, a bold new take on the Metroidvania sub-genre," teases the blurb. "Cookie Cutter features gorgeous hand-drawn animation, an enormous dystopian world to explore, epic boss fights, gruesome carnage, and so much more."</p>
<p>As yet there's no firm release date, but publisher Rogue Games hints it'll be "this spring"/Q2. Players on PC via Steam, PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X/S don't have to wait, of course - Cherry's already waiting for you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 developer and publisher Saber and Focus has acknowledged fans' "cold" response to recent changes, stressing to players they were "not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game".</p>
<p>After introducing a new way for players to unlock cosmetic items, the team acknowledged player "FOMO" but assured the community that the items would be available "for everyone" "later", expecting only "the most dedicated players" able to unlock items early.</p>

<p>"We have noted that the Community Events have received cold feedback since we introduced them as an additional way to unlock cosmetic items," the teams at Saber and Focus wrote in a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/166-february-community-update">joint update</a>.</p>
<p>"We saw that many of you mentioned FOMO generated by the events. Rest assured, we are not looking to transform Space Marine 2 into a full live service game. The items available through events WILL be available later, for everyone. We want Community Events to be a way to unlock the items in advance, for the most dedicated players, and not to be a source of frustration and stress for everyone.</p>
<p>"However, that means we must provide a smooth experience in unlocking said items, which has not been the case so far," the statement added. "We deeply apologise for the trouble, and are currently working on a simplified process to unlock the items, to make the experience less constraining."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the update, Focus confirmed there's still "a bit of a wait" for Patch 7, but 6.0 Datavault Update released earlier this month ushers in new free and season pass content, as well as new packs, maps, perks, and QoL improvements.</p>

            <p>Capcom is "investigating" an issue that's impeding progress for some players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>Players are reporting that in Main Mission: Chapter 5-2 A World Turned Upside Down, a key NPC is not spawning where they should, essentially blocking all further campaign progress.</p>

<p>"Hunters, we are currently investigating the following issue," the publisher/developer stated on social media.</p>
<p>"There may be cases where an NPC does not appear, disabling story progression in Main Mission: Chapter 5-2 A World Turned Upside Down. We are currently working on these issues and will provide further updates when we have them."</p> <div>

<p>As yet, there's no confirmation on when this may be addressed, but Capcom has been whack-a-mole-ing issues fairly swiftly over the weekend. For instance, <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1896084293438648676">a hot fix patch resolving issues with the Smithy and "Grill a Meal"</a> is already live, so make sure you apply any patches before you play to ensure you're using the latest version.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">smashed the 1m concurrent players barrier on Steam</a> and if you're one of the many players who likes to jump back into the character editor because you've given your hunter a beer gut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">you might appreciate knowing you can modify your character once for free</a>, but any further substantive changes to your gender or body shape requires before Capcom makes you cough up some cash.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt awarded it 4/5, saying: "Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades.</p>
<p>"And if it continues Monster Hunter's legacy of generous post-launch support - where the series has traditionally felt the freest to get daft and indulge in its more sadistic tendencies - it'll be fascinating to see how this beautiful new baseline for the series develops."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
