            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios has made sweeping changes to challenges today, reducing the required milestones for class assignments,  weapon assignments, gameplay and mastery assignments, and more.</p>
<p>This was revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1986065315906695229?t=hLk3LaaiyV47LOqtvFCxKQ&amp;s=19">Battlefield Community Update post</a>, which notes that over 90 challenges in total have been tweaked to be easier. The post states that this came following ongoing player feedback.</p>
<p>The post states: "As we continue to build on the improvements we mentioned previously, we are also delivering a major overhaul of Challenges and Assignments, guided by gameplay data and your feedback. Some of the adjustments in this update are substantial, and we wanted to share more context on how we arrived at them.</p>

</figure>
<p>"This update makes significant reductions to challenge requirements, cutting down on time investment while maintaining a focus on skill-driven progression that rewards consistent play. Challenges and Assignments are tuned around defined playtime targets, and these changes bring their requirements in line with those goals to make them more achievable within a reasonable session length."</p><p>Changes have gone live today, and progress across affected challenges have been retained post-update. That means that for many players, they'll boot up the game and find a suite of previously incomplete challenges have been mysteriously accomplished. There will, according to the post, be additional updates addressing challenges in the near future in which further adjustments to completion requirements will be made.</p>
<p>Challenges in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> <em>have</em> proven exceptionally grating for a subset of the playerbase since the game's release. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oms515/these_challenges_can_absolutely_suck_the_will_out/">Take this post by user AwkwardSoldier</a>, who posted a screenshot of support healing and LMG suppression challenges, titling the post: "These challenges can absolutely suck the will out of you". So players have been suffering big time trying to finish these, which is likely where the aforementioned feedback has come from.</p>
<p>It's yet another tweak to Battlefield 6 made following its release, following a nerf to aim assist as well as updates <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">addressing weapon bloom</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-makes-temporary-adjustments-to-xp-earned-in-strikepoint-mode-to-maintain-fair-and-consistent-progression">removing Strikepoint XP exploits</a>. Whether or not this will tame the increasingly loud Battlefield 6 community throughout Season 1 remains to be seen.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Today, Sony will officially push out one of the biggest PS Portal updates the peculiar little handheld has received since it was first released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">back in November 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This update, which has been in beta for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">about a year</a>, will allow anyone that owns the machine to use Cloud Streaming via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus Premium</a> - effectively meaning you can bypass needing a PS5 console <strong>at all</strong> in order to play the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, Ghost of Yōtei, Grand Theft Auto V, Resident Evil 4, and many more (thousands more, in fact, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/">per PlayStation itself</a>).</p>
<p>So, why is this a big deal? Since its launch in 2023, the £200 device (always sold as 'a PS5 peripheral' rather than a standalone, game-ready device) sold itself mainly on the fact you could stream from your home console directly to the smaller 1080p screen, with Sony pitching it as a way to share a living room TV or play PS5 games in another room of the house.</p>
<p>It's always felt a bit limited, or niche, especially for that costly outlay, but Sony's latest update makes good on its 2024 promise to let you play PS5 games without a central console acting as a hub. It's a little convoluted to set this up, but it can be done. </p>

<p>If you own a PS Portal, sign into the machine with your PS Plus account (you must have Premium in order to access Game Streaming). Go to the PS Portal settings, and find the option to turn on Game Streaming - currently, still, with the Beta label. Switch it on, and sign back in with your account. At the boot screen, you will be able to access your home PS5 or a separate streaming tab. This will work even if you don't have a PS5 attached to the PS Portal. 
</p><p>These titles act, to all intents and purposes like 'real' installed games: as of today's update, in-game purchases will be supported, and you can purchase add-on items and in-game currencies without leaving your game session, you will have access to 3D Audio, and you can play in online sessions (though you might want to be mindful of the slight lag).</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>The real purpose of game streaming. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As shown in the image above, I can play Tekken 3 on the PS Portal without having the game installed on my actual PS5. I could play this - or Astro Bot, or anything from my library or viable game via PlayStation Plus - in the same way. No matter how powerful the title.</p>
<p>Is this going to make me sell my PS5? No, of course not. But I'm going to get far more use out of my Portal, I can tell you that for free: this job has me travelling a fair amount, and sometimes when staying with family or one of my partners, I sometimes have a few hours of downtime. Relying on home and public WiFi connections in order to remote play has always been spotty, but if the Portal can stream effectively from, say, a coffee shop hotspot, the idea of playing Monster Hunter Wilds in a town centre is pretty compelling.</p><p>I'll do a proper test of this from a GP's office tomorrow morning - when the update for the full-fat version of game streaming is actually live - and report back. But, with this one update, suddenly the appeal (and price!) of a PS Portal starts to make sense.</p>
<p>A full list of compatible games via the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog<a href="http://playstation.com/ps5-game-cloud-streaming">is available here</a>. The full update goes live on 5th November at 6pm PT / 6th November at 2am GMT.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> saw a surge of players with the new Simpsons' themed season, which according to Epic Games hasn't been seen since the last holiday season.</p>
<p>The Simpsons season of Fortnite - which brought with it a new map, Simpsons' themed cosmetics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-getting-pets-at-last-including-a-banana-puppy-you-can-dance-with">as well as the Sidekicks</a> (little pets that follow you around) - was released on the 1st November. Since then, it seems as though an absurd amount of players have been keen to explore Springfield across both the Battle Royale and Delulu modes.</p>
<p>In addition, the first Fortnite x Simpsons short that was released on Disney + reached the number 1 spot on Disney Plus, which is certainly a feat. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-all-know-that-the-simpsons-has-come-to-fortnite-but-did-you-know-that-fornite-has-also-come-to-the-latest-episode-of-the-simpsons">The latest episode of The Simpsons also had the Fortnite characters present in its opening coach gag</a>, which I'm sure was a cool surprise for a number of viewers.</p>

<p>Look, we may be a little tired of multi-media crossovers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-hate-the-ready-player-one-ification-of-all-our-favourite-media-but-cant-resist-the-simpsons-in-fortnite">but it turns out this Simpsons crossover has proven a touch irresistible to </a><a href="http://many.it/">many</a>. It appears as though The Simpsons strikes some sort of Achilles’ heel among 30-something pop culture fiends. I, for one, cannot wait for the future Friends crossover that I'm sure will annihilate hordes of city-loving IPA lovers. Me. It'll take out me.</p>
