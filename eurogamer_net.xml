            <p>
If you've found yourself pondering the time-travel terrors teased in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-developer-bloober-reveals-next-game-original-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">Bloober Team's Cronos: The New Dawn reveal trailer last October</a>, you might be intrigued to hear the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> studio has now shared further details in a new developer diary. That's alongside the reveal of I Hate This Place - an open-world survival horror game it's publishing later this year.
</p>
<p>
Cronos: The New Dawn, as we previously learned, follows the adventures of the enigmatic Traveler as they journey between a monster-infested post-apocalyptic future - created after a cataclysmic event known as the Change - and 1980s Poland. Now, though, Bloober has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuSJpd2c7UY">talked a little more about its upcoming sci-fi horror</a> - which is said to draw inspiration from the likes of John Carpenter's The Thing, mind-pummelling German TV series Dark, 12 Monkeys, Dead Space, and even a touch of Dark Souls in terms of its challenge.
</p>
<p>
As for Cronos' enigmatic lead, the Traveler is just one of a group - described as 'divers in time' - sent to explore the ruins of human civilisation in search of time rifts. These enable them to extract people from the past who didn't survive the apocalypse. In Cronos' alternative timeline, the world ended in the '80s - thanks to the aforementioned Change - and the resulting wasteland is populated by monstrous creatures known as The Orphans.

<p>
These are the remnants of humanity, and can take different forms, each with distinctive abilities. What connects each variant, however, is the fact they're all still made of human tissue, introducing an element of body horror reminiscent of The Thing. Additionally (as per Bloober's not entirely serious closing Q&amp;A), players can expect walls of flesh, face-punching melee combat, "kinda" flamethrowers, dismemberment of sorts, and aliens ("maybe"). And ladders.
</p>
<p>
It's promising stuff (especially for ladder fans, apparently), but sadly we've still no clearer idea of when Cronos: The New Dawn will arrive - beyond its previously announced "2025" launch window on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, that is. What we do know, though, is that it isn't the only game on Bloober's 2025 release slate. The studio has also unveiled I Hate This Place, an isometric open-world survival horror currently due to arrive in "Q4" this year.
</p>
<p>
I Hate This Place is the work of developer Rock Square Thunder (Bloober is handling publishing duties under its new Broken Mirror Games label) and it's inspired by Kyle Starks and Artyom Topilin's comic book series of the same name. Players take on the role of Elena, who finds herself in a deadly fight for survival in a "harsh and unforgiving wilderness" after unwittingly awakening a malevolent force. It promises crafting, formidable foes, tense gunfights, and melee combat "that rewards ingenuity over brute force" - alongside a day and night cycle said to impact gameplay dynamics. Oh, and "avoid the Horned Man at all costs".

<p>
"Drenched in bold, vivid colours and retro '80s comic book aesthetics," adds Bloober, "each location is lovingly crafted to tell its own disturbing story through stylish visuals that blur the line between reality and nightmare in a world where everything wants you dead."
</p>
<p>
I Hate This Place launches via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store in "Q4" this year.

            <p>
Nightdive Studios' long-in-the-works <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> remaster finally has a release date, and it's coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 26th June.
</p>
<p>
Nightdive initially announced it would be remastering <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed - and hugely influential - 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1160740078685057025">back in 2019</a>. At the time, it was known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition">System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</a>, but it's since had a name change, and will now be arriving as System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster.
</p>
<p>
Following on from Nightdive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">extremely well-received System Shock 1 remake</a>, which launched back in 2023, its System Shock 2 remaster promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements. PC players can also expect mod support, up to 144fps, and ultra-widescreen compatibility.

<p>
At its heart, though, it's still the same acclaimed System Shock 2. That means another battle of wits against rogue AI SHODAN as players - choosing between one of three military branches - find themselves on he FTL ship Von Braun in the year 2114. "Hybrid mutants and deadly robots roam the halls while the cries from the remaining crew reverberate through the cold hull of the ship," explains Nightdive. "SHODAN... has taken over, and it's up to you to stop her."
</p>
<p>
And now, just managing to squeak into the 25th anniversary window with two months to spare, Nightdive's System Shock 2 remaster launches on 26th June. It's be available for Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-cb94d9">Epic</a>, and the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/agecheck/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster">Humble Store</a>. Additionally, anyone that pre-ordered Nightdive's original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake on Steam (or crowdfunded it at the $30 level or higher) will <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/4320315">get the System Shock 2 remaster for free</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It's the finest work that both Looking Glass and Irrational ever produced," Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-2-still-stands-as-irrationals-finest-work">wrote of System Shock 2 back in 2015</a> (beware spoilers!) "and if that doesn't give you a shout of being the best game in existence, I'm not sure what does."

            <p>FBC: Firebreak - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">Remedy's three-player co-op first person shooter</a> based within Control's Oldest House - is set to release this summer, and now the team has given us a fresh look at the upcoming game.</p>
<p>In FBC: Firebreak, players will take on the role of volunteer first responders, who are doing what they can to help sort out the Hiss that remain within the building - essentially, what happens when the Federal Bureau of Control actually loses control?</p>
<p>The studio shared a new trailer for FBC: Firebreak as part of this evening's Future Game Show presentation, giving us a look at how volatile office stationary can really be! I am talking about lacerating post-it note people - it's chaos!</p>

<p>These post-it note entities are part of FBC: Firebreak's aptly-titled "Paper Chase" job. Jobs are this game's version of missions, with each job being a "wrapper for a unique crisis" within the Oldest House, so if you have played Control, you will recognise locations.</p>
<p>In the case of FBC: Firebreak's Paper Chase job, it's set in the bureau's Executive Sector. "And, just like real world crises, like fires and floods, these things have a way of coming back - your work is important, but never ends," adds game director Mike Kayatta.</p>
<p>As to how FBC: Firebreak will all work, once players have selected a job to take on, they will then select a Threat level - that is to say, decide on the combat difficulty, as well as how many rewards players can earn - as well as a Clearance level. The Clearance Level determines the number of zones players can make their way through, as well as what type of rewards they can earn.</p>
<p>Then, there are FBC: Firebreak's loadouts, or to give them their Remedy name, Crisis Kits. These kits are each centred around a unique tool, and FBC: Firebreak players will have three saved kits to choose from: Jump Kit, Fix Kit and Splash Kit.</p>
<p>The Jump Kit is an electricity-focused Crisis Kit, complete with an Electro-Kinetic Charge Impactor. The Fix Kit comes with a chunky wrench (or, spanner for those of us in Blighty), while the Splash Kit is a water-focused kit with a Crank-Operated Fluidic Ejector.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are already thinking about FBC: Firebreak's post launch content, well Remedy is on it. The game itself will be a premium mid-price release on its debut, but any playable post-launch content will be free for all owners. There will also be some cosmetic items players can spend some additional money on, if they so choose.</p>

<p>The team at Remedy is, understandably, aware it is about to release a multiplayer shooter into the world during a period when multiplayer shooters are having a hard time standing out - but even so, it says it isn't nervous.</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A about FBC: Firebreak attended by Eurogamer, the developer said it wasn't concerned about the game finding its niche. "It's not that we are arrogant," said Remedy spokesperson Thomas Puha, "but since the inception of this game, we've very carefully thought [about] who the audience is, and that dictates everything from how we built it - such as how easy it should be to get into, how long the sessions are... we are not going to do a game that [feels like] another job."</p>
<p>Puha continued: "There are reasons why we [Remedy] have managed to survive for 30 years in this industry, which is so volatile. It's managing risks, which means 'let's be careful with the budget and make a game in a sensible budget and time frame'. But also, we are not naive. It's our first multiplayer game, so we are doing everything in our power to make sure things launch well."</p>
<p>Puha added Remedy intends to support FBC: Firebreak for "the longhaul", and the studio has "very concrete plans" on what the post-launch content should look like. "Let's get it out first, and we will take it from there," Puha said.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak will be making its debut this summer (a more specific date is TBA) across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It will also be available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC, as well as on PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
