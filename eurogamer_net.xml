            <p>EA has released the source code for classic strategy games in the Command &amp; Conquer series along with Steam Workshop support, opening the game to modders.</p>
<p>The games in question are Command &amp; Conquer (aka, Tiberian Dawn), C&amp;C Red Alert, C&amp;C Renegade, and C&amp;C Generals + Zero Hour, all released under the General Public Licence.</p>
<p>In short, this will continue to preserve the legacy of the games and make it easier for modders to continue creating content.</p>

<p>The news follows the launch of Command &amp; Conquer Ultimate Collection on Steam last year, after which EA commissioned modder Luke "CCHyper" Feenan to research improvements to the games - as detailed in a new reddit post.</p>
<p>In addition to opening the source code, which allows existing C&amp;C communities to continue supporting their work, Steam Workshop support has been added for more games in the series.</p>
<p>All Mission Editor and World Builder tools have been updated, meaning maps can be published directly to the Steam Workshop. In addition, a C&amp;C Modding Support pack has been released, which contains the source Xml, Schema, Script, Shader and Map files for all the games that use the SAGE engine - a long-requested wish from the community.</p>
<p>Lastly, EA has updated its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/modding-faq?isLocalized=true">Command &amp; Conquer Franchise Modding Guidelines</a> to reflect this initiative.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandandconquer/comments/1izmpmb/cc_steam_workshop_support_source_code/">C&amp;C Steam Workshop Support &amp; Source Code</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EA_Jimtern/">u/EA_Jimtern</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandandconquer/">commandandconquer</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

There's a temporary truce in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Galactic War, after a game-breaking bug introduced during maintenance.
</p>
<p>
The issue sprung up yesterday, after Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead issued an update to the game's backend. The problem saw planet liberation rates skyrocket - which is a good thing... until it isn't.
</p>
<p>
"While we know this is fun, we also know that it is breaking the Galactic War mechanic itself," Arrowhead wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1895176702252458384">post on social media</a>. "In short, this is harming the game experience and will have detrimental effects on the war mechanic in the future."

<p>
While players' sudden tide of victory will not be turned back, Arrowhead has frozen the Galactic War so no further damage to the game's balance is done.
</p>
<p>
"We have made the decision to pause the Galactic War temporarily until this is fixed," Arrowhead continued. "We're already starting the process, but we do not yet have an ETA for this fix."
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Helldivers 2 will remain fully playable, but victories will not contribute to the wider goal of liberating planets within the war. 
</p>
<p>
"This is our mistake and we own it," Arrowhead concluded. "We are not going to revert any of the damage done by this error, however, so your major order victory is still secure."
</p>
<p>
In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-creative-director-takes-sabbatical-promises-to-start-arrowheads-next-game-on-return">Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt announced he was taking a sabbatical</a> after working for 11 years on the series, but would return to begin develoment on the studio's next game.
</p>

Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-helldivers-2-has-received-a-stealth-ps5-pro-upgrade-and-heres-what-it-does">Digital Foundry analysed a 'stealth' update to Helldivers 2</a> that improved the game's performance for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is living up to its name, with some truly wild player numbers following its debut.</p>
<p>The next installment in Capcom's Monster Hunter series went live earlier today (28th February) and quickly surpassed Monster Hunter World's all-time player peak on Steam.</p>

<p>At the time of writing and according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 933,446 Monster Hunter Wilds players on Valve's platform. It currently has an all time player peak of 987,482, although it seems likely it will smash past this number over the weekend. This makes Wilds one of the most-played games on Steam, surpassing peak player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and even <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>To compare further, Monster Hunter World has an all-time player peak of 334,684, meaning Wilds has almost tripled the former's peak player numbers in less than a day. Are you one of them?</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Capcom gave us all a little teaser for what lies in store for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-content-update-brings-a-new-level-of-challenge-in-april">Monster Hunter Wilds' first post-launch content update</a>, which is now confirmed to be launching some time in "early April". This update will include a "new level of challenge" for players.</p>
<p>But, as for what players can expect in the here and now, well it sounds like quite a rather good ol' time. In fact, our Matt recently awarded the game four out of five stars, calling Wilds the "most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter" to date.</p>
<p>"Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p>
<p>If you are planning on making your way into the wilds of Wilds this weekend, but need a little point in the right direction, be sure to check out our guides coverage. Here's one on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-save-autosave-monster-hunter-wilds">how to save in Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and another on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-upgrade-weapons-monster-hunter-wilds">how to upgrade weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to get you started.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
