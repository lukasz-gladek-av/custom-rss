            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> office has been cordoned off by police following an explosion. While the source is currently unconfirmed, reports suggest that a boiler is the cause.</p>
<p>The building, located on Holyrood Road in Edinburgh, has been attended by both police and city fire departments. <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/25776012.gta6-dev-rockstar-north-building-taped-off-boiler-explosion/">According to the Scottish Herald</a>, around seven Scottish Fire and Rescue vehicles were sent to the scene after alarms were raised around 5am. No injuries or deaths have been announced by the authorities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-fire-crews-rush-ongoing-33257244.amp">Edinburghlive</a> has stated that Scottish Fire and Rescue have been on the scene for upwards of two hours after the call reporting the incident came in. The outlet was also provided a statement by Scottish Fire and Rescue, in which a spokesperson stated the following:</p>

<p>"I can confirm that we got a call at 5.02am this morning. We mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances. It's an ongoing incident and we're still in attendance at the moment with other agencies."</p><p>

The Scottish Herald were told, again by a spokesperson from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, that firefighters worked to secure "structural damage" to the building. These crews left after three hours after the area was deemed safe.

</p><p>This piece will be updated as more information on the explosion have been confirmed.</p>

            <p>We've been greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout Season 2</a> so far, and it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">most fans are</a> too, but the change from binge-based season drop to a weekly release schedule has had an impact on the show's ratings. Don't worry, though: this stumble isn't in danger of disappointing the powers that be.</p>
<p>On 15th January, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/streaming-ratings-dec-15-21-2025-1236475572/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> shared the latest report from Nielsen, a leader in media valuation and data analytics. As expected, the debut of Fallout's second season was a sizable one, with the show accumulating 794 million viewing minutes through the week of December 15th through 21st. At the same time, it was well below Season 1's appeal, which earned 2.9 billion for its opening week in April 2024. That one was Amazon's best-ever premiere on the platform.</p>
<p>Those keeping track of what goes down on the TV front might've already noticed what's going on here. Since Nielsen traditionally tracks viewership in minutes watched across devices that send the needed data, the company's numbers never give us the complete picture. It only tracks TV sets, but it's always been a good way to measure the temperature and streaming habits of the populace. The more important bit of info here is that 794 million minutes for a single episode versus 2.9 billion for an entire season that could be binged on Day One is very impressive all the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must take into account many viewers who have grown accustomed to Netflix's binge release strategy are just waiting for the entire thing to be available. All in all, Fallout is doing remarkably well still, and nabbed the 7th spot on <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/top-ten/">Nielsen's ranking</a> for the December 15th through 21st period. During that week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-things-final-battle-was-directly-influenced-by-baldurs-gate-3">Stranger Things</a> reigned supreme in the lead-up to its series finale with a massive 2.37 billion minutes watched.</p><p>As it stands, Fallout Season 3 is a go and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">already targeting a production start date for 1st May, 2026</a>. The Prime Video series is among the very few big-IP shows that are sticking to tight pre-production and filming schedules, with S2 arriving only a year and a half after S1. For comparison, we're still waiting for <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-ahsoka">Star Wars: Ahsoka</a>'s second season on Disney Plus; the first set of episodes came out during summer 2023.</p>
<p>Are you watching each episode of Fallout Season 2 weekly, or are you waiting to make your trip to New Vegas until it's all loaded up?</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Early indicators that advertisements are coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming service have been spotted by users, with messages stating that "ad-supported playtime" popping up for users when launching games.</p>
<p>One such user, The Verge's Tom Warren, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/2012346097465782273">posted their own experience seeing this message firsthand</a>. Ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming has not been confirmed by Microsoft as of writing, nor its scope across the service. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">last year an Xbox official confirmed </a>that the company would be experimenting with free ad-supported cloud gaming.</p>
<p>This hint at advertisement rollout across Xbox Cloud Gaming comes at an interesting time too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">with an Xbox Showcase set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. While it's been stated that the show will focus primarily on a handful of games including Fable and Forza, rumours have been circulating that such a shift with the company's cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">could be rolled out this year</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>It's also coming at an interesting time for cloud gaming in general. With the AI boom ongoing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">hardware prices have skyrocketed for consumers</a>. This will, or perhaps already has, curbed the ability of gaming enthusiasts to buy their own machines, potentially leading a new wave to Cloud Gaming services such as what Xbox is offering. While not especially great news for the consumer, there's no doubt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">Microsoft has positioned itself into a leading position as far as cloud gaming is concerned</a>.</p><p>Microsoft too has faced heavy criticism when it comes to its gaming output, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">laying off significant portions of its workforce last year</a> and cancelling several projects as a result. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-suffers-worst-year-on-record-for-console-sales-in-the-uk">2025 was also the worst year on record for Xbox console sales in the UK</a>, though competitors like the PS5 also saw a drop during the same period.</p>

            <p>Young Alfie Williams reckons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> should introduce his character from 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple into the multiplayer slasher-fest.</p>
<p>Williams was chatting with IGN's lovely social producer Mat Jones about the 28 Years Later sequel, when conversation turned to video games and Dead by Daylight. Now, when I say young Alfie Williams, I really do mean young. Williams is, at the time of writing, only 15.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, the actor - who plays Spike in both 28 Years Later and the newly-released sequel The Bone Temple - says that the previous inclusion of Stranger Things' characters by in Dead by Daylight proves that minors can be part of the bloody fray, so, really, why shouldn't the team include him?</p>
<p>"I know they bring Stranger Things in, so they can have minors in the game," Williams reasoned. He added he believes Dr. Ian Kelson, played by Ralph Fiennes in both films, would probably be quite a good fit for a Dead by Daylight survivor.</p>

<p>As well as Stranger Things, other Dead by Daylight collaborations have included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-details-its-walking-dead-collaboration-as-public-test-build-go-live">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-celebrates-ninth-anniversary-with-five-nights-at-freddys-and-the-witcher-collaborations">Five Nights at Freddy's, The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nicolas-cage-is-now-available-in-dead-by-daylight">Nicolas Cage</a> (who was able to fake his own death).</p>
<p>Given all that, a 28 Years Later collaboration is hardly out of the question, though I do think I would feel a little uneasy hunting down a child. What do you think of Williams' idea to feature Spike in Dead by Daylight?</p>
