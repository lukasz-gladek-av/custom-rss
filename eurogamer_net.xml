            <p>Rematch developer Sloclap admits some of the studio's fans were "disappointed" by the game's reveal, because they were expecting more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>.</p>
<p>Sloclap released its football game Rematch earlier this year, to plenty of praise. However, it wasn't what many expected the studio to come up with following its previous release, the kung-fu roguelike, Sifu.</p>

<p>"Some Sifu fans were disappointed when the game was revealed and we're sorry to say that," Sloclap creative director Pierre Tarno admitted to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/rematch-dev-is-sorry-that-players-wanted-more-sifu-but-for-the-moment-it-was-better-to-let-it-rest/">GamesRadar+</a>, before adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">marketing could have perhaps been a bit better on Rematch's reveal</a>.</p>
<p>"Because the reveal trailer had a cold open, like 'from the team behind Sifu', they were like 'alright, Sifu 2 incoming'," Tarno continued. "I'm sorry about that misunderstanding because I think we should have probably, early on, let the Sifu community know that we were about to announce a title and that it would not be Sifu 2, and they shouldn't be expecting it, just so they didn't have this disappointment."</p>
<p>The developer added Sifu was never intended to become the studio's identity, and it was time for something new. "We did a year and a half of post-launch support for Sifu," he said. "We felt that we'd really provided and kind of given everything we had on Sifu." But, at least for the time being, "it was better to let [Sifu] rest". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifus-last-ever-content-update-is-coming-in-september">Sifu ultimately got its last content update in September</a> 2023.</p>
<p>Continuing, Tarno said some players often expect "studios to be doing the exact same genre over and over again", but that is not the way Sloclap approaches things.</p>
<p>"We have a huge opportunity to pursue the creative projects that we are passionate about, and not many developers have that chance. It's really very rare for developers to be able to do that," Tarno elaborated. "And then I think players and also media realised that although it was not exactly the same, [the games are] both third-person action games. Both grounded, credible, still epic, with bodies and movement, it's physicality."</p>
<p>Tarno said "there is a lineage between the titles", from Sloclap's Absolver to Sifu to Rematch. "Our experience making the two previous games is what allowed us to make this one," the developer closed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">Rematch surpassed 1m sales in its first week on the market</a>, with three million "unique" players also joining the pitch thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom was one of those three million Rematch players, and had rather a good old time with it. "I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it. In fact I love it despite the fact that a large portion of the player base is the absolute worst kind of person: a ball hog."</p>
<p>For more, our Connor recently spoke to Tarno about the introduction of crossplay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-crossplay-top-priority-future-updates">which remains the "top priority" for Rematch and Sloclap</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-developer-sorry-to-disappointed-fans-wanting-more-sifu-but-it-had-given-everything-we-had-already]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> is set to receive a new update on 5th December, adding a third-person mode and New Game+ mode.</p>
<p>The free update will arrive on the third anniversary of the game's launch - and, conveniently, just ahead of the third Avatar film Fire and Ash that's due on 19th December.</p>
<p>The third-person mode will finally allow players to see their Na'vi protagonist, with reworked animations, controls and camera systems, all at the click of a button. The new trailer below shows it in action.</p>

<p>The New Game+ mode will allow players to replay the game with their existing inventory and skills against tougher enemies. A new skill tree and stronger gear will be added to assist.</p>
<p>The update will follow previous updates The Sky Breaker and Secrets of the Spires, which extended the story of Frontiers of Pandora.</p>
<p>Other quality of life additions since release include an improved Hunters Guide and a 40fps mode for consoles.</p>
<p>"It's a Ubisoft open-worlder to its core, but this spin on the world of Avatar has some really special moments," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review">review of Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-will-get-third-person-mode-in-free-update-ahead-of-new-film]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We've not had the chance to play every <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> game in-depth owing to the sheer volume of them and regrettably, one of the titles we've not been able to look at in depth is Io Interactive's classic Hitman: World of Assassination. That's a bit of a shame as it has a fascinating characteristic - its rendering resolution and performance changes according to how the Switch 2's front-end menus are set, leading to anything up to a 62.5 percent performance increase based on our testing. There's no in-game mention of this and certainly no in-game performance mode and yet there it is.</p>
<p>The story begins with an email I received last month from Harry Mingham: "Hitman: World of Assassination on Switch 2 runs around 30-45 fps around 90 percent of the time. Out of curiosity, I went into the system settings and changed the TV output res from 4K to 720p, went back into the game and found it vastly improves performance. The Hawkes Bay Mission ran at... a very solid and stable frame-rate". In fact, depending on the content, Hitman: World of Assassination can run at up to 60 frames per second with the console set to 720p, dropping into the mid 40s on more demanding scenes.</p>
<p>In putting this to the test, I chose to capture scenes from Paris, Mumbai, Berlin and Whittleton Creek at 720p, 1080p and 4K resolution - as dictated by the Switch front-end. Based on prior testing on other systems, I've found Berlin and Whittleton Creek to be GPU-intensive, while the proliferation of NPCs in Paris and Mumbai may help us to identify areas where Switch 2 may be CPU-limited. The results are intriguing.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Freshly clipped from DF Direct Weekly #223, check out Hitman: World of Assassination compared across various resolutions.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ6Mkwkvyxs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Focusing on Whittleton Creek gives us our biggest frame-rate differentials. 4K averages 46.88fps, rising to 40.45fps with Switch 2 set to 1080p, rising again to 59.93fps at 720p. So, performance increases by 9.7 percent dropping from 4K to 1080p (which sounds a little low), while 720p is 62.5 percent ahead of 4K and 48.2 percent faster than 1080p. So, what's going on? Well, setting the system to 720p seems to be producing a straight 720p image, allowing for a much higher frame-rate.</p>
<p>Things get more interesting at 1080p, however, as the game actually seems to be rendering at a slightly higher resolution, with pixel counts suggesting 1152p to 1188p. Meanwhile, with Switch 2 set to 4K, performance drops but pixel counts are still in the same 1152p/1188p window. The performance drop may be down to upscaling to a higher resolution with an approximate cost of around 2.4ms compared to what we assume is the same content without any upscaling. Maybe the game is using DLSS to upscale, as there are rounded edges where we'd expect to see aliasing. We're looking into this in a little more depth and have also asked Io Interactive for comment.</p>
<p>Moving on to our other test scenes, Berlin delivered similar differences between resolutions - 720p system output resolution is 61 percent faster than 4K, while "1080p" is seven points clear of 4K. This is a slightly more demanding scene than Whittleton Creek with 720p averaging 55.1fps, 1080p at 36.7fps and 4K at 34.26fps.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>In the stages chosen for CPU testing, there's expected behaviour - in scenes crammed with NPCs, the performance differentials between the three graphics modes close up significantly. Certain areas of the Paris stage can still see some wide gaps but as soon as Agent 47 takes his place in the packed fashion show, frame-rates converge somewhat - 42fps at 720p plays 39fps at "1080p" and 35fps at "4K". 720p should be higher but the bottleneck shifts from a GPU limitation to the CPU instead. Frame-rates also close up in Mumbai for similar reasons.</p>
<p>For the end user then, there are a couple of takeaways here: firstly, you can effectively max out frame-rates by dropping to 720p - the main problem being that the very noticeably lower resolution is not exactly a good look for the game. For 4K display owners, you can increase frame rate by around nine percent simply by changing the system menu to 1080p - though it does appear to be at the expense of upscaling. From the Digital Foundry perspective though, the "4K" mode is worth further investigation - since pixel counts seem much the same as the "1080p" mode, we might finally be able to get a grip on the computational cost of DLSS on the Nintendo hybrid.</p>
<p>There is the sense that these resolution/frame-rate shifts are not intended behaviour, however, as what is an effective "performance mode" would be something you'd expect the developer to have as an option in the menus. Game modes being tied to system settings isn't new - PS4 Pro was notorious for different 1080p and 4K modes - but seeing those changes kick in dynamically during gameplay as opposed to just when the game boots is something new for a home console. One of our backers on the DF Supporter Program pointed out that Switch and Switch 2 do this all the time "switching" between docked and portable play, so maybe that's part of the explanation here.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll get some clarification from Io Interactive soon.</p>

            <p>
After reliving some old-school rivalries with last year's Intellivision-themed DLC, Atari 50 is welcoming another classic contemporary through its interactive museum doors. Namco's legendary line-up of retro titles (or a few of them at least) are arriving in new DLC soon.
</p>
<p>
Atari 50's Namco Legendary Pack introduces an all-new interactive timeline focusing on the Japanese publisher's classic output, exploring the history of its games on Atari hardware through video interviews, archival materials, documents, and photos from the era.
</p>
<p>
And you'd better be a Pac-Man fan! Atari 50's Namco Legendary Pack includes three versions of the classic ball-gobbler - Pac-Man 2600, 5200, and Atari 8-bit, specifically - marking "the first ever re-release of these games for consoles."

<p>
On top of that, you've got US arcade versions of Dig Dug and Xevious ("developed by Namco in Japan and originally released by Atari, re-released in this form for the first time ever"), plus home console versions of Galaga, Xevious, Galaxian, and Dig Dug.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release date for all this yet, but it's coming to Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch "soon". And if you've yet to sample Atari 50's retro delights, last year saw the release of a standalone Expanded Edition, combining the already hugely generous base game and its Wider World of Atari DLC into a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-all-19-retro-games-coming-in-atari-50s-paid-the-first-console-war-dlc">single bundle featuring 150+ titles</a>.
