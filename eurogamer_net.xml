            <p>Regular Eurogamer readers may know I am rather fond of The Last of Us, and if anything to do with the series is due to pop up online, I am already eagerly awaiting it. So it was with some surprise this morning that I saw a new trailer for HBO's The Last of Us series had dropped. I immediately Clicker-ed to watch.</p>
<p>It turns out this trailer isn't for the show's upcoming second season, however. Or more specifically, it is a handy recap of season one in advance of that second season, packaged up into a video that lasts a little over five minutes. As you would expect, it covers all the essential plot points to get you up to speed - you know, the start of the outbreak (and the emotional impact behind that fateful night), Ellie's immunity, David (shivers) and the hospital finale.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, <em>that </em>kiss between Tess and an infected. Oh my word. It still makes me feel all funny even though I knew it was coming the moment the Capitol shots started showing up. Anyway, if you want to refresh yourself on the events of The Last of Us season one for yourself, you can do so below.</p>
