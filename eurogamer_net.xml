Nintendo's wading into the baby and toddler market with a new toy, clothing, and "general goods" range it's pulling together under the My Mario umbrella. And there's even a toddler-friendly stop motion Mario series releasing to accompany the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
My Mario is described as a "series which parents and children can enjoy together", and includes a mix of Nintendo's own products alongside those of partner companies. That starts with Nintendo's new animated Mario series - titled It's Me, Mario! Stop Motion Shorts - which will exist on the My Mario website and other channels. Each free episode is around a minute long and focuses on stop motion Mario showing "a variety of expressions and movements".

Elsewhere in the digital realm is Nintendo's free Hello, Mario! app for smart devices and Switch. This'll let children muck around with Mario's face in a way that sounds quite a lot like Mario 64's iconic title screen - yank him and he'll "react in various ways based on the player's input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, My Mario's website <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/block/index.html">features a dizzying array of baby and toddler-appropriate paraphernalia</a>, including bowls and spoons, cute Mario-themed hoodies, t-shirts, picture books, bibs, pyjamas, blankets, plushies, nappy bags, socks, rattles, and other bits and bobs.

Nintendo's own biggie, though, is a series of wooden block sets, one with three pieces and the other with 30. The bigger set costs 19,980 yen (around £100) and comes with a variety of classic Mushroom Kingdom cuboids, including the question mark block, the brick block, and the music note block. It also includes wooden power-ups - a super mushroom, green shell, fire flower, and super star - plus a chunky green warp pipe, with the box itself opening out to reveal a mini diorama scene. And finally, there are wooden versions of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi which, most notably, also double up as their respective amiibo figures for use in compatible games. So if you're still in the grip of amiibo collecting, you've now got something else to add to your list. That three block set, incidentally, costs 2,980 yen (around £15) and comes with Mario, a question mark block, and super mushroom.

All the above is included in Nintendo's first wave of My Mario products, which arrives in Japan on 26th August. My Mario will launch elsewhere in the world beginning in 2026.

            <p>
Bithell Games, the studio behind the acclaimed likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thomas-was-alone">Thomas Was Alone</a>, John Wick Hex, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a>, has announced job cuts impacting the "majority" of its full-time employees.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">statement announcing the news</a> on social media, studio founder Mike Bithell explained the company had been unable to secure a new larger scale project, meaning eleven jobs are now being made redundant. "This," he noted, "constitutes the majority of our full-time staff".
</p>
<p>
"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025," Bithell wrote. "We've fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance pay."
</p>
<p>
"It's important to state that this was an incredible team of exceptionally talented people. If you're a developer reading this, and you're hiring; anyone among those affected would be a great addition to your studio, please reach out if we can help to put you in touch."
</p>
<p>
Bithell concluded by noting the news will not affect the availability of the studio's existing self-published games, nor will it impact any ongoing support for those titles. "We are incredibly grateful for our audience," he added, "and hope that your interest in our work follows individual team members as they head into other roles."
</p>
<p>
"Bethel Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less."
</p>
<p>
Layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">continue to blight the games industry</a>, with <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">tens of thousands of workers</a> - across both major publishers and smaller studios - having lost their jobs in the last few years. In July alone, Microsoft laid off more than 9,000 employees, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">significantly impacting staff and studios across its Xbox division</a>, and that was followed by job cuts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-goes-independent-to-continue-focus-on-original-projects">Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassive-games-delays-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020-following-layoffs">The Dark Pictures Anthology studio Supermassive Games</a>.
