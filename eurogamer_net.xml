            <p>Former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has criticised Microsoft's recent price hike of Xbox consoles in the US, stating "console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues".</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">Microsoft announced the price increase</a> and blamed "changes in the macroeconomic environment", though didn't mention tariffs specifically.</p>
<p>Still, Ybarra - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-corporate-vice-president-mike-ybarra-announces-departure-from-microsoft-after-20-years">left his position as corporate vice president of Microsoft's gaming division in 2019</a> - responded to the assumption in a post on social media, adding "the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse."</p>
<p>In a later response, Ybarra added the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">previous price increase in May</a> was justified due to the rise in tariffs at the time, but that's not the case with this new rise.</p>
<p>"An excuse to continue raising prices, with no new increase in tariffs, is simply a different problem," he said, "and they are going to make consumers continue to pay for those problems."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues. And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</p>â€” Mike Ybarra ðŸ˜‡ (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>This price hike only affects consumers in the US, which is why tariffs have been seen by some as the primary reason.</p>
<p>Now, an Xbox Series X costs $649.99 (or $599.99 for the digital version), while a Series S costs $399.99 for the 512MB model and $449.99 for the 1TB model.</p>
<p>Despite the "changes in the macroeconomic environment", Microsoft reported an 18 percent boost in revenue at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off">latest earnings call</a>, with Xbox Game Pass making almost $5bn in annual revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-price-of-ps5-ps5-digital-and-ps5-pro-in-the-us">Sony also announced a price hike for its PS5 consoles in the US</a> back in August, with the base PS5 costing $549.99, the digital edition costing $499.99, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> costing $749.99.</p>

            <p>Over the weekend, Epic launched its new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Delulu mode with proximity voice chat, but already "thousands" have been banned for toxicity and hate speech.</p>
<p>The new mode sees players starting out solo, but able to join squads by chatting with nearby players. Players will need to have voice chat set to "Everybody" and won't be able to hide their display name while playing.</p>
<p>In theory, Delulu is a fun twist on the no-build battle royale formula, but in practice it's fuelled bad behaviour that's resulted in "thousands" being banned over the weekend, according to the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1969845572325494908">official Fortnite Status social media account</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, Epic seems to have expected this, with the account's pinned post detailing how players can report in-game conversations.</p>
<p>The mode has resulted in some amusing and heartwarming interactions. Here's one pacifist player strumming a guitar in an attempt to make in-game friends.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nnx5py/playing_guitar_in_delulu_last_night/">Playing guitar in Delulu last night</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/asymmetricalsoul/">u/asymmetricalsoul</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/">FortNiteBR</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Yet a thread titled "My fellow ladies: Howâ€™s Delulu" details the experiences of women in the new mode (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-banned-thousands-this-weekend-as-proximity-voice-chat-mode-delulu-launches-to-big-player-numbers-but-widespread-reports-of-griefing-and-abuse">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>It includes misogyny, hateful speech, and women being purposefully targeted by men. "It's been terrible for me so far," wrote one player. "I've been playing solo and there hasn't been one game where I haven't been told horrendous things I don't wish to repeat. I just want to have fun and enjoy the game."</p>
<p>Some posts are recommending female players don't speak, which is unfair and defeats the purpose of the mode.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nmom8n/my_fellow_ladies_hows_delulu/">My fellow ladies: Howâ€™s Delulu</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kilr_Queen75Xx/">u/Kilr_Queen75Xx</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/">FortNiteBR</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Sadly, this is often the experience when women play games online with voice chat. A report from September last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-thirds-of-female-players-still-report-being-harassed-when-playing-online">claimed two-thirds of female players report being harassed when playing online</a>. And when Call of Duty added proximity chat to its online modes, reports of misogyny were rampant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/look-out-for-number-1-in-fortnite-delulu?lang=en-US">Fortnite Delulu will return</a> this weekend, from 26th September until 29th September. It's unclear if it's set to become a permanent addition to Fortnite, but is there more Epic could be doing to protect players?</p>
<p>Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-launches-new-daft-punk-experience-but-no-the-duo-arent-getting-back-together">Daft Punk music experience was announced for Fortnite</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> continues to make a noise in China, this time through a nationwide McDonald's collaboration designed to coincide with this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>On the elaborate and specially designed menu are, according to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DO6aKmMEojo/?img_index=2">China Insider</a> and <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com.cn/news/20250919-Wukong">the McDonald's China website</a>, a huge black double beef "mooncake" (the Mid-Autumn Festival is also sometimes called the Mooncake Festival), a crispy chicken burger "mooncake", shrimp nuggets, which sound weird, curly fries and themed McFlurries. There's even a weird black-cased dessert thing, with a gooey yellow and white filling. Apparently this is a sesame lava pie, whatever that is, but to me it looks like a crusted, elongated Cadbury's Creme Egg. </p>

<p>But better yet! There will also be coinciding merch pop-ups in the biggest Chinese cities where people can buy exclusive Black Myth: Wukong x McDonald's merch. The most elaborate of these pieces is a dressing gown (it might be a wearable fleece thing - it's a bit unclear) which is black with ornate Wukong-related design-work and comes with a matching headband, which, admittedly, I rather like. There's a horrid white dressing gown with McDonald's logos and burgers on, too.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>The collaboration starts today in China, so hurry on over, and runs in thousands of restaurants until 21st October. And I know what you're thinking: lucky bastards - why do they get black burgers and dressing gowns and not us, in the West? Well we can't have it because we didn't give Black Myth: Wukong Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024, that's why. Don't, Bertie, don't.</p><p>Maybe a better question is why, a year after release, Black Myth: Wukong is still being celebrated in China. Well don't forget there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">a follow-up game called Black Myth: Zhong Koi</a> in development, which like Wukong, takes another iconic figure from Chinese folklore - the evil spirit-killing deity Zhong Koi - and spins a game around him.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has revealed a new farming spin-off game, titled (of course) Palfarm.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, the game will see players teaming up with their Pals to sew seeds, mine for ore, and befriend townsfolk. And it looks like there's a spot of romance too.</p>
<p>There's also combat, as evil Pals can raid your farm - defeat them to obtain further resources. "After all, combat is a form of harvesting in its own way," reads the Steam page. Gruesome.</p>

<p>It's mostly a spin on the popular gameplay seen in the likes of Stardew Valley, which has proven exceptionally popular over the past decade.</p>
<p>Yet this reveal comes just shortly after Nintendo's latest Direct where it revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ever-wanted-to-play-a-pokemon-animal-crossing-meets-minecraft-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-just-that-game">new PokÃ©mon life sim game Pokopia</a> in which players join 'mon to farm crops and gradually build an attractive little environment.</p>
<p>Both games are part of a long-established genre, but the timing doesn't help to shake the feeling Pocketpair is once again following in the footsteps of Nintendo.</p>
<p>Palfarm is yet to receive a release date, but is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/">Steam</a>. It's unclear if it will also be released on console.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lawsuit against Pocketpair for copyright infringement remains ongoing, as Nintendo was recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">granted a new patent around summoning monsters</a>. It's also argued that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-argues-mods-dont-count-as-proper-games-as-pokemon-v-palworld-lawsuit-continues">mods don't count as proper games</a>, countering Pocketpair's defence.</p>
<p>Pocketpair, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">continuing development of Palworld towards a 1.0 release</a> next year, fixing "jank" it wishes to properly address to set the full release up for success.</p>
