            <p>Photos purportedly taken on the set of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys-2">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a> have leaked online, including shots of an ominously dilapidated Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-officially-in-the-works">announced the sequel back in April last year</a>, but we've learned very little since then, making these pictures - which include a rusty sign of the toy animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, and my girl Chica - particularly exciting for some.</p>
<p>It's still unclear if the upcoming movie will be faithful to the second game's prequel timeline which takes place in the late 1980s.</p>

<p>A fan has also allegedly <a href="https://x.com/katsterlingfan/status/1878219889090982325">spotted</a> "some FNAF merch being sold for a possible scene" in the sequel, too.</p> <div>

<p>Whilst not remotely official - so take all this with a healthy dollop of salt - these photos were reportedly taken in River Town, outside of New Orleans. Whilst the OP originally thought it little more than "a little [local] fair" and nothing special, they later saw signs indicating that the area would be closed to the public by 3pm, and then signs for "Extras" and "a bunch of trailers". So make of that what you will.</p><div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> star Josh Hutcherson recently teased that the second Freddy-themed movie would be "much bigger" and "scarier" than its predecessor. He talked about "higher stakes" and hinted that there will be "more" and "different" animatronics, with the Freddy universe "opening up in a big way".</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sees-second-largest-video-game-adaptation-debut-of-all-time">Five Nights at Freddy's scored the second-largest debut of all time for a video game adaptation in the US</a>, coming only behind that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Nintendo and Illumination's animated Super Mario Bros.

            <p>Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has doubled down on its assertions that it is not a Chinese military company, saying that if the US Department of Defense does not "resolve any misunderstanding", it will "undertake legal proceedings".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">public statement</a> - which the company said it makes on a "voluntary basis" - it stressed the firm was "neither a Chinese military company nor a military-fusion contributor to the Chinese defence industrial base" and that while the allegation "does not affect [Tencent's] business", the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">the US Department of Defense made a "mistake" when it publicly classified the firm as a Chinese military company</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the company insisted that the inclusion on the list was simply a misunderstanding, but this subsequent statement takes a much firmer line, saying: "The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake.</p>
<p>"During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the company from the CMC List. The company will make further announcement(s) as and when appropriate."</p><p>As Tom reminded us when this first bubbled up last week, Tencent's reach across the global video games industry is enormous. It owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> maker Funcom and UK outfit Sumo Digital, in addition to several of its own companies, such as Pok√©mon Unite maker Timi Studios. It is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">in discussions with Ubisoft over a potential stock buyout</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Awesome Games Done Quickly has "come to a thrilling close", securing an incredible $2,556,305 - that's ¬£2.1m - for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>

<p>Speedrunners came from all over the world to "race through a bevy of games new and old", often with "zany incentives and challenges to drive donations", including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4AomNJHzHk">full-blown live concert</a> during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Dr. Doot playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> with a saxophone as a controller - which is embedded above - and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmrIvD1UNFI">an opera performance by trained singer Xem</a> after completing his <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>: Going Commando run. </p>

<p>Since 2010, Games Done Quick has raised more than $54 million (¬£44.2m) for charities worldwide, including Doctors Without Borders, Malala Fund, Organization for Autism Research, and more.</p>
<p>Next up is Back to Black, the first all-Black speedrunning charity event, which will run 6th-9th February and benefit racial justice nonprofit Race Forward. Summer Games Done Quick returns to Minneapolis, Minnesota to raise funds for Doctors Without Borders in July.</p>
<p>This time last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-the-moment-peanut-butter-becomes-the-first-dog-speedrunner-in-agdq-2024">Shiba Inu Peanut Butter became the first dog to speedrun a game during Awesome Games Done Quick</a>.</p>
<p>Peanut Butter speedran Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES, in 26 minutes and 24 seconds, which is around a minute slower than his own world record, but well within the 30-minute slot he'd been allocated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
