            <p>Digital Extremes has announced that its upcoming action MMORPG Soulframe will be receiving a founders pack that eager fans can purchase for exclusive items, gear, and a way to make a "permanent mark" on the game.</p>
<p>Announced during the recent Soulframe Devstream 11, the team dove into the latest updates for the nature-themed fantasy game in detail for its keen audience. What these rewards are remains largely a mystery, though we know they'll be themed around the first Envoys (names for play characters): Galene, Pothia, and Josalfar. More information is set to come in the future, but for now the price point and what these items will look like remain a mystery. Though, <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/founders">the illustration on the Soulframe website could be a pretty good clue</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also announced that Founders Pack owners would be able to invite a number of their friends to Soulframe: Preludes (Digital Extreme's version of an early beta version of the game). Earlier this year, the company opened the floodgates to any pending or new applications to join these preludes as part of its annual event: Tennocon.</p>

<p>Let's break down the Founders pack. So the "permanent mark" is the initial eyebrow raiser, and could be a callback to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a> Founders pack and a particularly cool perk it had. Warframe, Digital Extreme's first MMO, had Founders in-game names attached to specific missions, so players could hover over and see a list of Founders when they were looking around the star map (A sort of mission select). These days, the Founders names are found across the various Relays (player hubs), but nonetheless it's a permanent mark that went down well.</p><p>However, with that Warframe Founders pack came with Excalibur prime, Skana Prime, and Lato Prime. These are suped-up versions of pre-existing frames (playable characters) and weapons, and remain extremely cool pieces of gear that will likely never return to the game, especially given they mark a player who helped Digital Extremes out at their lowest point. However, these items also contribute to your account's mastery rank, a measure of player prestige, which has left some feeling a little sour over the years.</p>
<p>It's as such very unlikely that these Soulframe Founders items will contribute to your Soulframe account's Master level, given this continuous frustration from a portion of the fans. However, this hasn't been stated outright as of writing. An account's Master level in Soulframe provides Virtue points, which can basically be used to increase your ability damage, range, and duration. Though, it's worth noting some weapons scale with Master rank.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Digital Extremes to ask whether these Founders items will contribute to a Soulframe account's Master Rank, and received the following response courtesy of PR: "Weâ€™ll have more info to share on Soulframe Founders in the coming weeks".</p>
<p>Also announced in the Soulframe devstream was a small narrative addition to the Waste Bear Fable, a main quest of sorts currently playable in Soulframe: Preludes. In addition, a new interaction with the Witch Vermina will explore the colours of the world, unlocking the dye system for gear customisation.</p>
