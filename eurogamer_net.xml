<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> has today received its fourth update since release, as developer Build A Rocket Boy attempts to turn around the game's fortunes.
</p>
<p>
Available now across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, Update 4 brings improvements to the user interface, performance enhancements, and bug fixes. However, more is due in the fifth update, with the studio promising "a major performance, combat and Enemy AI system improvement".
</p>
<p>
MindsEye was heavily criticised at launch for its poor performance, among other issues. At the time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">Build A Rocket Boy acknowledged problems</a> and stated it was "working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles". At the end of June, shortly after release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch">layoffs were confirmed</a>.
