            <p>Ubisoft is currently holding a call with its investors, and 15 minutes before the call began, the French company issued a rare delay to the release of its quarterly earnings release and halted trading on its shares, a fairly alarming move that has got some people online wondering what's going on at the publisher.</p>
<p>According to an unexpected November 13 press release, the company has decided to postpone sharing its earnings "until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results." Ubisoft requests that Euronext (a European exchange market) to halt trading until further notice.</p>
<p>The publisher's statement reads:</p>
<blockquote>Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26. Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.</blockquote>
<p>The suspension will remain in place until the company publishes the delayed results "in the coming days", Ubisoft announced in said in a statement shared with both <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ubisoft-delays-half-year-results-requests-trading-suspension-2025-11-13/">Reuters</a> and posted online to various social media channels.</p>
<p>The motives for why the company has made this move are currently unclear. Well-known analyst for Nico Partners and online personality, Daniel Ahmad, notes that "this could imply an acquisition of sorts", or "could [...] imply some accounting / financial issue." </p><p>If you're wondering if Ubisoft is doing this because of broader market conditions, it's worth noting that whilst markets are in a downward trend today, it's only by about 1% in tech/financials markets (at time of writing, 6pm on 13th October). The most simple answer? Today’s earnings report is going to be spicy, and is liable to cause a big swing in the price of Ubisoft shares. In the current call, it's possible investors will discover additional info that will have an impact on business decsions they'll want to make.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on this story, and update you when more information reveals itself.</p>

            <p>The on-going situation between Rockstar and 31 dismissed employees is such a big deal, it's finally made its way to a session in the House of Commons. The issue was brought to Parliament by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cajardinemp.bsky.social/post/3m5jgfa3dis2m">In a social post</a>, Jardine noted: "Video game giant Rockstar has sacked more than 30 workers across the UK, including my constituents working at their Edinburgh office. I urged Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again."</p>
<p>You can see her comments to the assembly of politicans below:</p>

</span></p><p>"I declare an interest because I have an employee who works for the company I'm about to mention, though they are not affected by the actions taken," Jardine said in the session. "That company is video game company Rockstar, who's fired at least 30 employees across its UK studios, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> in Edinburgh. Several of my consituents have been affected, and some came to see me last week to express concerns. They claim they have been sacked because they were trying to unionise, and were discussing working conditions in private. But Rockstar has accused them of distributing confidnetial information, and sacked them for gross misconduct. I have written to Rockstar and asked for information on the issue, but I wondered if I can have a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss what steps can be taken to support [the affected employees]."
</p>
<p>The issue is being raised with ministers, and Jardine appears to be awaiting a meeting with those in charge to see what actions - if any - can be taken by government representatives in the coming days.</p>
<p>Rockstar claimed it fired the staffers for "gross misconduct", a statement which was later clarified to accuse the workers of sharing confidential info outside of the company. UK union the IWGB, of which the fired staff were members, have accused Rockstar of union busting and filed legal claims against the company. 
</p><p>This is just the most recent update in the on-going saga surrounding Rockstar and the 31 workers fired recently by the company. Earlier today, we heard about over 200 staff at Rockstar North who have signed a letter to management <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">calling for the "immediate reinstatement" the affected workers</a>.</p>
<p>"It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account – during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said an anonymous member of the fired Rockstar staff in the union's press release. "It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p>
<p>Rockstar has been in the news a lot lately. Aside from the on-goiong situation with the 31 affected members of staff, it also announced a delay to the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, moving the game from May of next year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">into November</a>. Publisher Take-Two said the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve". It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>
