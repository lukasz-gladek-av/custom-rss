            <p>
Keanu Reeves has made no secret of wanting to return to the world of Cyberpunk following his role as Johnny Silverhand in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - even though that could be a little tricky given <em>events</em>. However, series creator Mike Pondsmith is on the case, saying he's figured out "ways" to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
Back in September, when asked if he'd be interested in returning for developer CD Projekt's upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Reeves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/breathtaking-keanu-reeves-would-love-to-be-johnny-silverhand-in-cyberpunk-2">revealed he'd "love" to play Johnny Silverhand again</a>. That's great news for Reeves/Silverhand fans, of course, but easier said that done given the character's narrative trajectory left him, well, otherwise engaged by the time the credits rolled.
</p>
<p>
But it seems Cyberpunk series creator Mike Pondsmith has risen to the challenge, paving a way for a potential return. "Not that long ago," he revealed in Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=Ta51TFmBnop3th3L">recent anniversary livestream</a>, "I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again."
</p>
<p>
"I have ways to do that, Keanu," he continued enigmatically. "Contact me." Of course, given Pondsmith's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">admission</a> he's "not as involved directly" with Cyberpunk 2 compared to 1, CD Projekt might already have different ideas.
</p>
<p>
To date, little has officially been revealed about the sequel, beyond the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">pre-production is underway</a>. In May, CD Projekt confirmed around 100 developers were working on the project, with the bulk of the studio focused on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. That doesn't mean it remains a complete mytery, however.
</p><p>
Earlier this year, Pondsmith <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">claimed Cyberpunk 2 will feature a second city</a> - in addition to Night City - that's like "Chicago gone wrong". That's perhaps not a big surprise, though; Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending set several years later, after the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.

            <p>The UK's House of Commons has debated the need for improved video game consumer protections as well as video game preservation. In this debate, Concord's sudden shutdown was used as an example of a game shut down suddenly, and the requirement for strong consumer protections in such a case.</p>
<p>One MP stated in their statement: "A recent example is Concord, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn't always the case.</p>
<p>"I know the honourable members will agree that where publishers fail to make the life span of a game clear at the point of sale, they must be held accountable. That's why I welcome the strengthened consumer protections, including the digital markets, competition and consumers act 2024, which came into force earlier this year. This legislation rightly requires traders to provide clear, timely, and accurate information to consumers, including the longevity and functionality of digital products."</p>

<p>Other games of note mentioned as examples of games made unplayable, including The Crew as well as Anthem, the latter's servers will be shut down later this year.</p>
<p>The debate was had today in the UK House of Commons, in which MPs discussed the issues raised by the Stop Killing Games consumer movement. MP Ben Goldsborough led the debate, making the argument for further consumer rights in regard to live service video games.</p><p>Goldsborough noted that the video game industry provided both £7.6bn and 75,000 jobs to the UK. He noted in his opening statement: "Gamers still feel the deep sense of personal possession, because they invest more than money. They invest time, effort, imagination, and friendship. When a game shuts down without notice, that investment is lost."</p>
<p>He also urged funding partnerships, and sector support to make sure we maintain a library full of significant games. Goldsborough said:  "This is about fairness, responsibility, creativity, and protecting a cultural legacy [...] of which the United Kingdom should be proud."</p>
<p>There were issues raised with the suggestion, with one MP noting that when games are acquired or shut down altogether the responsibility to provide such support for preservation efforts or online support. This was countered by the claim that there's a need for "natural justice", that if someone has paid for a product they should be able to use it for as long as they like.</p>
<p><a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0195/">The UK government has stated it has no intention of changing consumer laws</a>, in spite of the overwhelming amount of pro-consumer and pro-preservation sentiment from the MPs present in today's governmental debate.</p>
