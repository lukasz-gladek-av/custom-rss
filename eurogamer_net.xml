While we may still have questions around <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s pricing and mouse controls, extensive hands-on time with Nintendo's new console has left us in no doubt of one thing: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World is an absolute banger</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Join us today as we hear more directly from Nintendo on its biggest Switch 2 launch title, and - if you're not sold yet - maybe you'll see something that ultimately helps justify <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s standalone £80 cost.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Mario Kart World Direct kicks off at 2pm UK time - that's 9am Eastern, or a 6am Pacific if you're over the pond - and is set to last for around 15 minutes. We'll be reporting live - let us know what you want to see!

Also: dare we dream for a Diddy Kong Racing-style story mode?</em></blockquote>
<p>Yes! Knockout Tour - the game's new battle royale-inspired survival mode - is definitely the star of the show. Glad you enjoyed!</p>

    <p>Looking to catch up on what we know so far? </p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">hands-on with Mario Kart World</a> immediately after the Switch 2 was revealed, and came away very impressed indeed. It is clearly the console's killer app - and a bold reinvention of the series' familiar gameplay.</p>
<p>"Mario Kart World's reinvention of the series may be a gamble, but it's absolutely one I think will pay off," I wrote earlier this month. "With a web of possible routes and hours of time likely to be spent exploring every corner of its highways, deserts and mountains - or racing to stay ahead of the competition in Knockout Tour - it's just as well the game's a Switch 2 launch title. I absolutely can't wait to play more."</p></div>

<p>This little nugget was casually tucked away in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/nintendo-switch-2-features">Split Fiction blog post</a> about Switch 2's features. "GameShare will enable Nintendo Switch 2 owners to invite another player to play together over a local wireless connection using just one copy of the game," the post reads.</p>
<p>"This 'other player' can be not only a Nintendo Switch 2 owner but a Nintendo Switch owner as well."</p>
<p>Well, I'll be, that is pretty neat! Perhaps it isn't a surprise to many, but I will admit I just assumed that Split Fiction would only be playable for those using an available release platform.</p>

<p>Nintendo gamers are really in for a treat, I have to say. Split Fiction is absolutely brilliant! And, I am far from the only one to think so. "Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Split Fiction will be released on Switch 2 on the console's launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">which is 5th June</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Bethesda is still to announce its highly-anticipated The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake, but there's no denying the project is real and ready to launch.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots and details of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake were dug up from developer Virtuos' website</a>. Now, references to the project have been found on Bethesda's own website too - including code for a "Buy Now" button that has since been removed. 
</p>
<p>
As Eurogamer previously reported, it's understood that Bethesda's current plans are to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass. But nothing has been officially announced - for now.
</p>

<p>
Still, Bethesda is clearly readying for next week behind the scenes, with some overly-eager website updating that - of course - caught the eye of fans. 
</p>
<p>
"I was digging through the source code of bethesda.net and found a reference to 'oblivion-remastered' in the Google Tag Manager setup," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k0o68n/just_found_reference_to_oblivion_remastered_on/?share_id=ZJgIC8zrHuGnKCtKH6nH5">fan posted on reddit</a>, showing a screenshot of the code in situ. 
</p>
<p>
"It points to this URL: https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/oblivion-remastered The page isn't live yet, but what's interesting is that I checked the Google Tag Manager container on the Wayback Machine, and this reference wasn't there as of April 10th. So it looks like it was added very recently!"
</p>
<p>
The code has now been removed - just as the screenshots from Virtuos' website were too. But, of course, copies are now all over the internet, and you can still see the original files in place via an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415122013/https://www.virtuosgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/">archived version of Virtuos' website</a>.
</p>
<p>After years of leaks and an even lengthier wait for a new entry in The Elder Scrolls series (don't look up how long ago Skyrim landed), fans don't have long to go now. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. Maybe that could come next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
