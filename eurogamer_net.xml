            <p>A new job listing has been spotted at Bluepoint Games, fuelling speculation over the studio's next project.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bluepointgames.com/career-board?gh_jid=5600969004">job in question</a> is for a senior combat designer, to "refine engaging combat systems and mechanics" for its "next great title". More specifically, the qualifications require "solid understanding of combat systems and mechanics for third-person melee action experiences".</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, for sure, and there are plenty of third-person action games out there with melee combat.</p>

<p>Still, it's been a while since the studio released a new game and fans are eager to know what it's working on.</p>
<p>The studio is known for its remakes and remasters, with its PS4 remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> really putting it on the map. This was followed by the PS5 remake of FromSoftware's Demon's Souls for the console's launch in 2020, and a year later the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-demons-souls-remake-developer-bluepoint-games">studio was acquired by Sony to become part of PlayStation Studios</a>.</p><p>Since then? Nothing. Back in 2024, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demons-souls-developer-bluepoint-games-still-working-on-an-original-title-for-playstation">studio was said to be working on an original title</a>, but earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Sony cancelled two live-service games</a>, one of which was from Bluepoint and reportedly based in the God of War series.</p>
<p>As a result, it's unknown what the studio is currently working on, though this job listing is certainly leading to plenty of speculation.</p>
<p>There's long been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-god-of-war-trilogy-is-rumoured-to-be-getting-remastered">rumour of a remake of the original God of War trilogy</a>, for instance, and after the cancellation of that live-service game, perhaps Bluepoint is now back on some form of remake.</p>
<p>The other big speculation - though it's more fervent fan desire at this point - is a remake of Bloodborne, FromSoftware's beloved PS4 exclusive that would certainly follow Bluepoint's work on Demon's Souls.</p>
<p>FromSoftware's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Hidetaka Miyazaki himself told Eurogamer that remakes and remasters can certainly benefit from new hardware</a>, while admitting Bloodborne is "a title we hold very dear and just as much as our fans".</p>
<p>"I think having new hardware is definitely a part of what gives these remakes value," he said. "Things you weren't able to achieve on previous generations of hardware, ways you weren't able to render specific expressions - [new hardware] sometimes makes it possible.</p><p>"However, I wouldn't say that's the be all and end all," Miyazaki continued. "I think purely from a user perspective, modern hardware also allows more players to appreciate all the games. And so, it ends up being a simple reason, but as a fellow player, I think that accessibility is important. I think that can be the driving force between bringing an old game to a new platform."</p>
<p>Still, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">Sony became FromSoftware owner Kadokawa's largest shareholder</a> last year (even though that's predominantly to scoop up anime rights more than anything), could the two companies have struck a deal for Bloodborne to return? And if so, is Bluepoint the right studio to make it happen?</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series of action games are notoriously challenging, but ahead of the release of Ninja Gaiden 4 its directors have emphasised the importance of fairness.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/ninja-gaiden-4-creators-say-fairness-in-dying-is-what-sets-apart-a-challenging-action-game-from-an-unreasonable-one/">Automaton</a>, directors Yuji Nakao (PlatinumGames) and Masakazu Hirayama (Team Ninja) discussed their approach to balancing the game's difficulty.</p>
<p>"What really stands out throughout the Ninja Gaiden series," said Nakao, "is how enemies are on equal footing with the player. They guard, and they even use throws."</p>

<p>He continued: "We focused not only on making the action feel satisfying, but also on offering the cathartic release of overcoming disadvantageous odds, that was a core part of development."</p>
<p>Hirayama added that fairness between the player and enemies is "crucial", maintained by whether death feels like the player's fault.</p>
<p>"If the player gets killed unreasonably," he said, "it's hard for them to reflect and think about what they could’ve done differently. But if they die because they made the wrong choice among several options, they'll think, 'Okay, let's try this instead'. That kind of trial-and-error cycle requires a fair dynamic between offense and defense to work. That's something we talk about a lot at Team Ninja, and it's something we've always valued throughout the series."</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Nakao, Ninja Gaiden 4 is "not a game you'll be able to breeze through" and has "hardship…scattered throughout". "That sense of catharsis you feel when you overcome those challenges is something I truly value," he said.</p>
<p>Debate around difficulty in games has raged for years, particularly with regards to Soulslike action-RPGs. While action games like the Ninja Gaiden series are known for their difficulty, the Dark Souls games certainly popularised high levels of challenge, especially after the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the debate has resurfaced in the wake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel. For many players, it's proven an incredibly steep challenge, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-admit-it-has-moments-of-steep-difficulty-but-also-a-higher-level-of-freedom-to-avoid-getting-stonewalled">the studio's Ari Gibson noted</a> players "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled."</p>
<p>After Ninja Gaiden 4's initial reveal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">Nakao spoke to Eurogamer about honouring the series' legacy</a> with its dual protagonists, as well as its difficulty.</p>
<p>"Ninja Gaiden is known for its intensity, especially that back and forth between offence and defence, and that dynamic ebb and flow of the combat," said Nakao. "With Ninja Gaiden 4, we are making sure it inherits those qualities and that the high speed action and the gameplay feel that longtime players have come to expect from Ninja Gaiden games - including the challenge and the difficulty - are present in this new entry."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Tokyo Games Show last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-xbox-tokyo-game-show-broadcast">Xbox detailed the difficulty options in Ninja Gaiden 4</a> for newcomers and experts alike ahead of its release later this month across Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC.</p>

            <p>New content updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> have been pushed back so developer Arrowhead can prioritise improving performance first.</p>
<p>In a new video, game director Mikael Eriksson acknowledged the current state of the game and the "many things" not working at the moment, which the studio's "top brains" are working to fix.</p>
<p>Issues include the need for smoother framerates across each platform, as well as crash rates and bugs leading to overall jankiness, and balance problems.</p>

<p>"After the last big update, Into the Unjust, we experienced more issues than what we were comfortable with," said Eriksson. "Players felt it, we felt it, and I would say the feedback that we've got has been very justified.</p>
<p>"We're taking this very seriously and we are focusing way more now on addressing these issues to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again. We have made the decision to push some of our content and feature updates a little bit into the future while we're addressing these things to make sure that we can get to a much more stable state that we can believe in."</p>
<p>Further, those future updates will be implemented in such a way to make the game more stable.</p>
<p>Some issues are quick to address, such as bug fixes, while others can be "tricky", such as fixing framerates.</p>
<p>"We are already making really big improvements and I'm confident that we will get there and we will be able to talk in more detail about this hopefully quite soon," Eriksson added.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 has been a phenomenal success that recently made its way to Xbox Series X/S, in addition to PS5 and PC. But as the game has ballooned in size and scope, performance issues have reared their head.</p>
<p>At the least, it's great to see Arrowhead acknowledge these flaws and commit to rectifying them, even if that means delaying future content.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems to be part of a strategy for improved communication from Arrowhead, following a blog post earlier this month explaining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-explains-why-its-so-big-to-install-on-pc-and-why-that-wont-be-changing-anytime-soon">why the install size for Helldivers 2 is so big on PC</a>.</p>
<p>In short, it's due to some players using older storage devices instead of SSDs, as the studio aims to accommodate a wide range of setups.</p>

            <p><a href="https://x.com/subonekd/status/1977237126850003005">As spotted by members of the Battlefield 6 community online</a>, reports from users of the Cronus Zen getting temporary bans for using the cheating hardware are circulating online, but the full scope of how effective the game is at banning users of this hardware remains unclear.</p>
<p>For those unaware, the Cronus Zen (and prior Cronus products) allow for the use of scripts and macros in games it's used with, and is usable on consoles including the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. These macros can be harmless in single player games, sure (back when I was younger people used it as an arcade stick adapter for the Xbox 360, which was cool). However, in multiplayer games the device has become infamous due to the ability to enable additional aim assist, recoil reduction, automatic drop-shotting, and more. <a href="https://www.cronusmax.com/">All of these specific macros and more are listed outright on the Cronus Zen website</a>.</p>

<p>However, players are questioning the validity of these temporary bans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o64hvu/cronus_zen_users_on_ps5_are_now_receiving/">due to an odd screenshot circulating online</a>. Initially, the screenshot seems real enough, but closer inspection reveals suspect details. For example, in the bottom right corner of the screenshot, the A and B buttons (which you'd expect from a console ban page) look incorrect, with the A looking more like an H. Very odd.</p><p>Heading to the Cronus Zen Discord, discussions are kept largely from public channels and hidden inside those only registered Cronus Zen users can access, but even there brief discussions about bans can be found. It looks as though the impact of these bans are in doubt, with Cronus users stating as long as you don't overuse these macros so as to be easily spotted by other players and cheat detection software, users won't be banned.</p>
<p>The flip side of the coin is prior statements made by EA, which mention Cronus specifically. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/interview-we-dont-consider-this-a-port-battlefield-6-dev-on-why-it-built-the-ps5-version-concurrently-with-pc">In an interview with Push Square</a>, technical director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> Christian Buhl stated: "Yeah, it's unfortunate that cheating has become a problem within the console space, especially with Cronus Zen machines and everything. So we've partnered with PlayStation and both Microsoft in this regard to kind of do detection. We actually have our own level of macro detection and everything.</p>
<p>"So if players are doing rapid with Javelin on the PC side. That's why we've enabled Secure Boot to help us combat the never-ending cheater problem. And we are aware of the console cheater issue, and we're going to be taking cheating very, very seriously here."</p>
<p>We know that EA intends to strike at Cronus users in Battlefield 6, but without a public statement from either EA / Battlefield Studios or Cronus itself, it's hard to  ascertain the scale of the impact on Cronus users. Cronus users have likely been put on notice though,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-players-on-ps5-and-xbox-can-block-pc-users-from-crossplay-as-studio-takes-cheating-extremely-seriously"> as the war on cheaters rages on</a>.</p>

            <p>Pokémon developer Game Freak has suffered another huge leak of data, revealing the studio's purported planned projects until 2030.</p>
<p>The leak comes a year to the day after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reels-from-unprecedented-gigaleak-of-significant-internal-data">"teraleak" of "significant internal data" that revealed unannounced Pokémon games</a>. Game Freak later acknowledged it was hacked, admitting personal employee information had been obtained. Then, in April this year, Nintendo filed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-want-to-force-discord-to-reveal-pokemon-teraleak-source">request to subpoena Discord</a> for the hacker's identity.</p>
<p>This new leak, revealing alleged future projects and concept art from new and old games alike, arrives mere days before the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, amid suggestions the same hacker was holding back this information.</p>

<p>The budget for Pokémon Legends: Z-A was reportedly just 2bn yen (around $13m). Typically, Japanese game development budgets are smaller than those we see in the West (for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to lower staff salaries), but this still feels like a very small amount for what is considered one of Nintendo's most significant series. What's more, as recent Pokémon games on Switch have suffered from poor performance, there's concern among the fanbase of a lack of investment to ensure future games run more smoothly.</p><p>Across the internet, there's notable commentary on this aspect of the leak, specifically. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o5wqxi/massive_pokemon_leak_purportedly_covers_nextgen/njcd9ef/">top comment</a> on a reddit thread discussing the leaks simply jokes that the whole leak is "just a Post-It note that says, 'even lower budget for next game'." <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1o5wqxi/massive_pokemon_leak_purportedly_covers_nextgen/njcg4mv/">Another comment</a> reflects: "A lot of people are going to complain about the money budget and not enough people will complain about the time budget of these games." Another poster notes: "The only leak I would care about is that they suddenly get a better engine, and actually treat Pokemon as a modern game with a high budget."</p>
<p>Within the leak itself, details have been shared purportedly covering the next four games planned until 2030.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler warning!</strong></p>
<p>The first of these is the next mainline game, the tenth generation, which reportedly has the codename Gaia and will be known as Pokémon Wind and Waves. It's seemingly set for release next year, followed by DLC in 2027, and will be set in Southeast Asia. Leaked screenshots of concept art show open, jungle areas, while budget-wise it's reportedly costing 3bn yen - another surprisingly small budget, but hitting roughly $20m, this time, a marked bump over Z-A's $13m (probably thanks to a series of planned improvements, such as a new engine, which commenters hope will improve performance on console hardware).</p>
<p>This will reportedly be followed by another Legends game, to be set in the Galar region of Sword and Shield - with the fitting codename of Ringo.</p>
<p>Then there's project Seed, which will reportedly combine multiple regions from past games. Lastly, the eleventh generation is reportedly aiming for a 2030 release.</p>
<p>Of course, it's worth questioning the validity of this information. Even if the reported details are true, the documents could well be outdated and plans may have changed since. There's also plenty of fan speculation wrapped up around the details.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted The Pokémon Company and Nintendo for comment on the validity of the leaks.</p>
<p>The news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-pokemon-legends-z-a-spoilers-are-out-in-the-wild-ahead-of-its-release-this-week">follows leaks of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> ahead of its release this Thursday, 16th October. Copies of the game are already out in the wild, are being streamed on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and illegal ROMs are already available, meaning spoilers are abundant.</p>
