            <p>When provocative horror game Horses was banned from sale on Steam and the Epic Game Store late last year, it nearly led to the closure of acclaimed Italian studio Santa Ragione - denied, as it was, access to some of the world's largest paying game audiences. But amid the panicked delistings there was another company determined to sell Horses and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/following-controversial-bans-from-steam-and-epic-santa-ragiones-horses-has-sold-18k-copies-and-repaid-debts">throw Santa Ragione a lifeline</a>: Poland-based online store GOG.</p>
<p>It was a bold stand in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">a year of panicked delistings and removals of games deemed to contain adult content</a> - action seemingly pushed and enforced by powerful payment providers MasterCard and Visa. This censorious approach sought to outlaw grotty pornographic games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/queer-developers-speak-out-as-adult-games-remain-in-limbo-following-payment-processor-showdown-at-steam-and-itchio">but it caught all kinds of well-meaning games in its net</a>, including games like Horses. GOG would not only stand up to this action by selling Horses but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-offers-13-free-nsfw-games-as-it-launches-anti-censorship-campaign-freedomtobuygames">it launched an anti-censorship movement in response</a>.</p>

<p>GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski told me, reflecting on the decision in an interview, that it was a "matter of freedom" for him. "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on values - our own and also what we believe are the right values for the industry," he said. "We believe in creative freedom, because once a company, through their own terms of service, decides what's good and what's not good - what's acceptable; what can be sold and what cannot be sold - it's a slippery slope from that point onward.</p><p>"We obviously are a business and we do assess our risks," he added, "because we don't want to hurt the business, we don't want to hurt the employees, and we don't want to hurt the players by doing so. So we are also careful. But with Horses... We are a curated storefront so we are actually playing the games that we are selling. The game is obviously controversial but there's nothing there that should deem it couldn't be sold.</p>
<p>"That's the role of regulators and governments to decide - democratic governments - what's legal and what's not legal, not companies that hold - Visa and MasterCard together - probably 90-something-percent of the market, then just decide whether something can be sold or not. For me it's a matter of freedom."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We are a curated storefront so we are actually playing the games that we are selling"</em></blockquote>
<p>Michał Kiciński - the new owner of GOG - put it more succinctly when he said to me: "Curation is the privilege and prerogative of each platform. The difference here with Horses is that we've played the game and we thought it was very cool."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">GOG became an independent and private company at the end of December</a>, meaning it's no longer a part of Polish superstar game-maker CD Projekt, which GOG had been for its entire 17-year (more like 18 if you count internal development) history. Michał Kiciński owns the company now. Coincidentally, he was one of the people who originally launched GOG, and he was one of the founders of CD Projekt, so he knows the businesses well. Kiciński left CD Projekt in 2012 in need of a break but remained - and remains - a major shareholder.</p><p>This newfound independence and autonomy allows GOG to be bolder; Kiciński has already said "I'm not afraid of risk" in relation to the company's future. But beyond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">a possible move into indie game publishing</a> there aren't plans to change what GOG does and what people like it for. Primarily the business is built on reviving classic games, both old and modern, and preserving them for years to come. It's also eternally committed to offering games without any kind of DRM.</p>

<p>But GOG does also sell newer games - and big games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. However, it does this selectively - a form of curation it believes is another notable difference in today's overcrowded gaming world.</p>
<p>As Gołębiewski explained: "The area of specialisation for GOG is the classics and the modern classics, where we want to provide a superior experience to any other store or a platform out there. That's why [we have] the GOG Preservation Program and why we are working hard on the first-party software to make sure that games are playable and stay playable 20, 30 years from now. Apart from that, obviously we welcome any good game onto the platform, because we want our users to have as rich a catalogue as possible, with quality being the limiting factor."</p>
<p>"This is very important," Kiciński said, continuing the thought, "because the difference - the big difference - between Steam and GOG, for example, is that GOG is a very curated platform. Playability and fun-factor are the most important for us, no matter if the game is an old classic, new classic, or indie game with great fun-factor. That's the specialty of GOG: to deliver games with the great fun-factor and playability despite the age."</p><p>It's still early days in GOG's independent new era, and it's worth pointing out that while GOG is technically a competitor to Steam, Kiciński's business has around two percent of the market, he said, while Steam has something like 80 percent, so there's an enormous difference in size. But as Kiciński pointed out, "It's super difficult to defend such a big market share," and perhaps as players seek alternatives to Steam's overloaded catalogue, a few percentage points might creep elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Capcom's upcoming Resident Evil Requiem will be "an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date", complete with ... (checks notes) ... a cleaning zombie.</p>
<p>This is coming from the game's director, Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed previous series entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>.</p>

<p>Nakanishi was talking during last night's Resident Evil broadcast, which gave us all another look at Requiem's gameplay, including how the sections between Grace and Leon differ. Grace's gameplay will have a much stronger slant on horror, while things will be more action-focused when we are in Leon's shoes.</p>
<p>Nakanishi again affirmed Leon - who is still a DSO agent after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">not a good choice for horror in the traditional sense</a>, because he isn't someone to flinch at simple things. "It may be a survival horror game, but I think we've made an experience that suits Leon," the director said, noting these sections will be more similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. Oh, and Requiem will "likely" push poor Leon to his limit, as if the poor chap hasn't already been through enough.</p><p>Nakanishi believes switching between Requiem's two leads will give players a "huge sense of catharsis" when the game is released next month. But, away from these two, last night's broadcast also gave us a look at Requiem's zombie enemies. These chaps will retain characteristics from when they were alive. What this means is in practice is one zombie who was a custodian before they were turned will still be found cleaning the building they're in. Personally, I would have hoped one benefit of becoming a zombie would be I would no longer have to scrub my oven and such, but, alas, this is not the case for Requiem's ghoulish foes.</p>
<p>You can check out the Resident Evil broadcast, including a look at how Leon's gunplay has been refined for Requiem, below.</p>

<p>For more, our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. So, that bodes well!</p>

            <p>The next game in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> series will be unveiled later this month.</p>
<p>The Life is Strange team has announced a livestream, which it will host via YouTube on 20th January, at 6pm for those of us in the UK. That's 10am PST / 1pm EST / 7pm CET for those in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>"Separate the real from the rumour... Join us for the exclusive reveal of the next Life is Strange game," reads the official YouTube video description. You see, news of the upcoming livestream comes one week after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-mysterious-new-life-is-strange-game-has-just-been-rated-in-europe">PEGI listing revealed another Life is Strange game was in the works</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of this slip, it was disclosed that fan-favourites Chloe Price and Max Caulfield would feature in the next Life is Strange game, which will be known as Reunion.</p>
<p>"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time… Losing her is Max's greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amazon Games has announced that New World, its MMORPG first released in 2021, will shut down on the 31st January 2027. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">This comes a few months after the developer "gutted" a vast number of staff late last year</a>.</p>
<p>When those cuts were first announced, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world">it was revealed on the New World website</a> that its 10th season 'Nighthaven' would be its last. Now, it turns out that season will be extended until the servers are shut down. The game has been pulled from storefronts, so only those who already own the game can continue playing into next year.</p>
<p>The statement also features a farewell from the remaining New World team, which reads: "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we're honored that we were able to share so much with the community.</p>

<figcaption>Here's the trailer for New World: Aeternum<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKnUBs-Ko44" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>"It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."</p><p>In response to this news however, a potential sprinkle of hope from COO of Facepunch Alistair McFarlane. Known as the studio behind Rust, the UK-based developer has built itself a solid foundation in the tumultuous games industry. Solid enough, it seems, to allow McFarlane to offer an eye-watering amount for the ill-fated MMO.</p>
<p>"25m, final offer" McFarlane <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011890710468071708">posted on Twitter</a> in response to the news last night. He'd follow this up with "Games should never die", indicating this to be a genuine offer (Eurogamer has contacted Facepunch to confirm).</p>
<p>Another noteworthy figure in the world of buying video game rights also popped their head up, with <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011991595273572406">Simon Collins-Laflamme of Hypixel Games writing</a>: "If you need tips about buying cancelled games, lmk". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">Laflamme bought Hytale back from Riot Games last year</a>, releasing it this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">to monumental success</a>.</p>

            <p>The recently teased Legend of Zelda: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> Lego set has leaked.</p>
<p>According to a Brick Tap source, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-legos-next-the-legend-of-zelda-set-will-be-based-on-ocarina-of-time">upcoming Zelda set</a> will be known as The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time, and depict, well, the final battle from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</p>
<p>On the box, we can see the chunky porcine Ganon standing tall and wielding his dual blades, while Link gets ready to strike down on the beast with his Master Sword. The titular Princess Zelda, meanwhile, is standing to one side, and has a Lego-fied beam of light emitting from her hands.</p>

<p>According to the leak, which was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1qe6y4h/zelda_77093_the_final_battle_ocarina_of_time/">shared on reddit</a> earlier this morning, Lego's The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time set will comprise 1003 pieces, and retail for £100 here in the UK.</p>
<p>Along with Link, Zelda and Ganondorf (as in, in his Gerudo chief form), the set will also include a Navi model, as well as - of course - a brick built model of the boar-like Ganon, which in personal opinion looks rather magnificent.</p><p>Should this leak be accurate, we can also expect to see the game's Megaton Hammer and a number of recovery hearts to also be included on the set's release. As for when that will be, the source said we are looking at a 1st March debut, which is actually quite soon.</p>

<p>This of course isn't Lego's only collaboration with Nintendo. Earlier this week, the two companies unveiled their previously announced Pokémon sets, which include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-unveiled-but-catching-em-all-will-cost-you">Pikachu and Poké Ball, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise and Eevee</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after these particular sets went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-really-want-those-pokemon-lego-kanto-region-badges-you-can-expect-to-pay-over-100-on-ebay-thanks-to-scalpers">resale sites such as eBay became awash with the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection</a>, which was only available via Lego as a free gift for those that pre-ordered the most expensive set from the collection, the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model.</p>

            <p>After the undeniable success of its live-action adaptation, Amazon Prime Video has announced a reality television show based on the Fallout games.</p>
<p>The show itself is known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, and will see contestants living inside a vault set within a "high-stakes world", with those taking part competing for a "huge" cash prize.</p>

<p>"Set inside Vault-Tec's bomb-proof vaults, Fallout Shelter drops a diverse group of contestants into an immersive, high-stakes world inspired by the games' signature dark humor, retro-futurism, and post-apocalyptic survival storytelling," reads Fallout Shelter's official logline.</p>
<p>The show itself will present competitors with "a series of escalating challenges", as well as "strategic dilemmas" and some "moral crossroads" to navigate. I mean, of course! And, as this show is based on Fallout, these challenges and games will all have some kind of focus on the franchise's core SPECIAL attributes. That's strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck.</p>

<p>Those taking part will need to demonstrate "ingenuity, teamwork and resilience" to guarantee themselves not just safety, but power as well. Oh, and there is also that aforementioned cash prize at the end of it all (which after Christmas and a cascade of birthdays on this end, I wouldn't say no to right now).</p><p>Fallout Shelter will run for 10 episodes, <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/fallout-competition-show-fallout-shelter-amazon-1236632365/">Variety</a> reports, with <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html">casting open now</a> for those over 21. Casting will close on 15th February. "Do you have what it takes to be the most SPECIAL?" the casting crew asks. Well, do you?</p>

<p>Fallout has seen quite a resurgence in popularity since Amazon's TV adaptation made its debut in 2024. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">games got a player boost with the arrival of season one</a>, a trend that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">continued with the current run of season two</a>. Along with returning faces like Ella Purnell and Walton Goggins, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-goes-full-new-vegas-with-a-new-trailer-showing-a-deathclaw-the-kings-and-macaulay-culkin">Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani have also joined the show for season two</a>.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming for Fallout's third season is currently expected to begin in May</a>. As for other potential Bethesda adaptations, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">Todd Howard recently told Eurogamer he "can't rule in or rule out an Elder Scrolls thing in the future"</a>.</p>
