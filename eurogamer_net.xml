            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s forthcoming espionage game Physint won't be released for quite a few years yet.</p>
<p>Kojima's next game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, is on the cusp of release, but Physint is already in development alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Xbox horror game OD</a>.</p>
<p>He even wants to create a film as well, but these game projects are a priority first. "Besides Death Stranding 2, there's Physint in development," Kojima told French magazine Le Film Français (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-says-in-an-interview-with-a-french-magazine-that-the-death-stranding-movie-is-planned-for-2027-and-that-physint-will-take-him-5-or-6-years.1192278/">ResetEra</a>). "It'll take me another five or six years. But maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film."</p>

<p>He continued: "I grew up with cinema. Directing it would be a kind of homage to it. Besides, I'm getting older, and I'd prefer to do it while I'm still young."</p>
<p>Kojima is now 61 years of age, meaning Physint won't be released until he's into his late 60s and, at this rate, a film won't be likely until he's in his 70s.</p>
<p>And with a few years to go until Physint, does that mean it could release on Sony's next console? Back in 2022, a confidential document suggested the company wouldn't expect a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-doesnt-expect-playstation-6-before-2027-confidential-document-suggests">PlayStation 6 until at least 2027</a>. Of course, that may have changed to even later now.</p>
<p>Kojima first announced Physint in 2024, describing it as "the third, new original IP since the establishment of Kojima Productions" and a "completely new 'Action Espionage' for the next-generation". Many fans are expecting it to rival Metal Gear, the series Kojima is most known for.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">Death Stranding 2 certainly has more than a shade of Metal Gear to it</a>, both in its expanded combat options and its story themes.</p>
<p>At a recent preview for Death Stranding 2, Kojima mentioned the desire from fans for a new Metal Gear game inspired Physint.</p>
<p>"Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create," he said. "But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That's when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected, and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint."</p>
<p>Still, he told Edge Magazine he's not "interested in appealing to the mass market", after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-isnt-interested-in-appealing-to-the-mass-market-but-death-stranding-2-playtests-proving-popular">test reviews for Death Stranding 2 came out positively</a>.</p>
<p>"Sony is pleased, of course, but I do wish it was a bit more controversial," said Kojima. "Blockbuster films need an 80 percent approval rating - I don't want to make games like that. I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market, or selling millions of copies. That's not what I'm aiming for."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
