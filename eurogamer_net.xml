            <p>We may be about to see a whole new product line of Valve-made gaming hardware. Speculation suggests Valve has a new Steam Controller, virtual reality headset, and console-like device in development, and they may be revealed as soon as this week.</p>
<p>The speculation seems to originate from trusted leaker Brad Lynch (SadlyItsBradley), who stoked the fires overnight by sharing <a href="https://xcancel.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813">an AI-generated mock-up of what he says the new Steam Controller will look like</a>. Notably, the haptic thumbpads have moved towards the bottom of the controller whereas they used to be towards the top. Lynch claims there's full finger-tracking in the grips, and that the controller can detect how far away your hands are from the handles.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p><p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p><p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p></div>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"Yes. It's an AI slop photo," wrote Lynch on X. "Trained on a real image of the new controller. It was just fast and easy to do it this way. I was not going to post the original one just in case it reveals any sensitive info from the source."</p><p>It's also Lynch who suggested a reveal date of 12th November, according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValveDeckard/comments/1oqwwla/steam_framedeckard_everything_we_know_so_far/">a coherent round-up of Valve hardware rumours on Reddit</a>. As you can see from that post, the bulk of the other patent-related rumours revolve around a new VR headset, which is believed to be codenamed Deckard - although it's also sometimes referred to as Steam Frame. That name - Steam Frame - may also refer to a new operating system developed for the device. The information suggests we're about to see another high-end VR headset priced at around the $1200 mark, possibly more.</p>
<p>The console rumours, meanwhile, revolve around something codenamed Valve Fremont, a games-capable box that features custom AMD processors and a Radeon graphics card. Again, the rumours originate from <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1957931577444561350">Brad Lynch, who highlighted the device's appearance on cross-platform benchmarking site Geekbench</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Valve has made considerable in-roads into the enthusiast-level games hardware space with the HTC Vive, a VR headset, and the more recent handheld device, Steam Deck. The attraction of a console-like device built to take advantage of Steam's enormous gaming catalogue will be strong indeed. I wonder, if it's true, how much it will cost.</p>
