  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Replaced, the highly-anticipated cyberpunk platformer from Sad Cat Studios, has been delayed.</p>
<p>Replaced is the rather wonderful looking 2.5D "retro-futuristic" sci-fi platformer, which is set in an alternate 1980s America that has been scarred by a nuclear catastrophe. It plops players into the shoes of Reach, an AI who becomes unexpectedly trapped inside a human's body.</p>
<p>But while we were once expecting to get our hands on Replaced next month, the developer has decided to delay its release a notch. In a statement, Sad Cat said while Replaced is "technically finished", it feels a few more weeks to get the game fully "polished, stable, and true to the vision we've shared with you" would be beneficial. As such, Replaced will now launch across PC and Xbox Series X/S on 14th April.</p>
<p>In the meantime while we wait, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highly-anticipated-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-gets-demo-and-you-can-play-it-this-week">there is a Replaced demo currently available to try out via Steam</a>. Sad Cat called the response to Replaced's demo thus far "the ultimate fuel" for the development team. "To be honest, putting it out there was nerve-wracking, but seeing your gameplay, reading your reviews, and hearing your excitement has been overwhelming in the best way possible," Sad Cat said in the statement announcing Replaced's delay.</p>
<p>"We are constantly reading your comments, and that feedback is helping us make the final tweaks that will make the full game shine."</p>
<p>Sad Cat closed by thanking its community for its "patience and support" in the years since Replaced was first unveiled. "Many of you have followed us on this journey every step of the way, and seeing your passion is what makes these final days and nights of development worth it," the studio said. "We are super close to the finish line and we can't wait for you to experience the final results of years of hard work."</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Replaced has had its release date moved. Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">studio was forced to delay Replaced due to the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>. Then, in 2023, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2024">delayed into 2024</a>, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/25d-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-into-2025">delayed once more into 2025</a>.</p><p>I was recently lucky enough to go hands-on with Replaced. "I really think Replaced has the potential to be something special. I fully expect I will need tissues by the end of it, though, because I have theory about where things are going and well, yeah, emotions. And while emotions alone don't always count for much, it's the brutality and relevance of its dystopian setting that makes such a human heart matter," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/replaced-preview">Eurogamer's Replaced preview</a>.</p>

            <p>Despite what confused Call of Duty players who changed teams would have you believe, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is a notable modern military FPS that's doing <em>fine</em> a few months in, usual bumps in the road included. Now, Season 2 has finally arrived <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-until-february-but-more-content-for-season-1-and-events-are-on-the-way">following a delay</a>, and it's kickstarted new positive and negative discussions.</p>
<p>Even though more maps, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-getting-battlefield-4-map-golmud-railway">fan-favourites from past games</a>, are coming this season, the first phase of S2 is all about Contaminated, a sprawling new location that offers different type of engagements, from medium-range to combat in trenches to close-quarters chaos in closed environments. It's an especially good fit for the attack/defence structure of the classic mode Breakthrough, yet it also adds a new mechanic to the game that's giving some players a headache.</p>
<p>As teased in the explosive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQLakPdVhEc">gameplay trailer</a> released last week, chemical weapons are a key part of this season's narrative and gameplay. It means Contaminated features huge chemical chaos at certain points (as shown off in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZJMlK1rHz0">extensive gameplay videos</a> from prominent figures in the FPS space), as the new map's exterior areas are engulfed in giant gas clouds that force every player to use masks, which make return after being a crucial element of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>.</p>
<p>The problem? Some players are having trouble equipping them (whether it's due to messy key binds or bugs) or straight-up dislike the mechanic. On the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/">Steam forums</a> for the game, it's common to find posts like "Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?" and "Gas I'm not a fan of. Died too many times putting mask on and off." Meanwhile, others praise the new map and the different rhythm it brings: "Say what you want, but this season/patch is a huge step in the right direction, so I don’t understand all the hate and negative reviews."</p>

<p>It's the usual back-and-forth, really, perhaps exacerbated by the fact Battlefield 6 admittedly leaned a bit too heavily on a CoD-like vibe to onboard more players at launch, which led to much of the player base fighting over whether the game should borrow more from its biggest (and currently defeated) competitor or stick to what made the series special. So far, it looks like EA and Battlefield Studios are doubling down on large-scale warfare that brings it back even closer to the series' roots, but it's not surprising to see it lose part of its launch-months weight as its future comes into focus.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/">On Reddit</a>, however, the vibes are more positive even if the usual bugs and performance woes that big updates introduce need to be dealt with. "My faith in BF6 has been restored," a veteran said before listing a number of changes that made the game feel better beyond new additions like the aforementioned map and extra weapons. Many joined the chorus, praising the new brand of chaos that Contaminated has brought: "I liked the map... bushes, trenches, bunker... I love it." Some are even more optimistic after just <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/2022008332488146971?s=20">Phase 1 of S2</a>: "Battlefield Feels Like War Again, And That Is A Very Good Sign," a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1r760za/s2_battlefield_feels_like_war_again_and_that_is_a/">thread</a>'s title states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the more realistic players are just wondering how long it'll be before the volatile community turns on the devs again: "How long does it take to be back at only hate posts on Reddit?" Immediately, many users suggested it would be a matter of hours or even minutes. Never change, Battlefield veterans. Never change.</p>

            <p>Today, in News I Didn't Expect To Ever Write, I bring to you <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Souji Souai LOVE</a>, a free game by chemical and cosmetics giant Kao Corporation that stars idols, only the idols are cleaning products. As in... their heads are bottles of detergent and other products. Japan once again proves its marketing game is centuries ahead of the rest of the world's.</p>
<p>The shocking news came to our attention via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/finally-an-idolmaster-clone-game-where-the-idols-are-all-detergents-and-cleaning-agents/">Automaton</a>. The site details the game is a 20-minute visual novel-style sim that has players embody a "rookie producer" tasked with making sure the group Shining4's debut performance isn't a failure. In traditional VN fashion, you must get to know each team member better and help them with menial tasks, such as... cleaning toilets (using their heads, I guess).</p>
<p>"It's exactly like one of my wacky animes," you might be thinking, and yeah, you're totally right. Souji Souai LOVE doesn't feature <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-EFRFk4fA0">little girls transforming into cars after drinking gas</a>, but it's odd enough from the get-go, and its catchy central song goes the extra mile to sell us on Kao's pitch:</p> <figure>

<p>Needless to say, a decent amount of money, time, and talent went into this marketing stunt, and Japanese social media users are shocked the company even got singer and voice actor Yoshiki Nakajima (The Idolmaster: SideM) and J-pop artist Kent Ito, among others, to voice these characters. "The four idols are Kyukyutto (dish soap), Bath Magiclin (bathtub cleaner), Toilet Magiclin (toilet bowl cleaner), and Quickle Wiper Three-dimensional Wet Sheets (for cleaning floors), all based on real-life products," Automaton's report revealed.</p><p>The game can be played through <a href="https://kao-shinseikatsu-game.com/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D33721277683654488724186108689161205022%7CMCORGID%3D952B02BE532959B60A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1771392119">Kao's official homepage</a> and works on PC and mobile. It may not be for everyone, but considering how much time the average Internet user spends every day doomscrolling on social media, this seems like a better use of a fraction of one's daily phone time.</p>

            <p>After showing off a selection of PlayStation-exclusive charms for in-game weapons, the Marathon social media account has indicated that similar charms will be coming to other platforms like PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>This post, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023835955149623660">made in response to a community question on the matter</a>, states:"We'll have weapons charms for Steam and Xbox players as well, which we'll share more about in the future!"</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2023819735737967016">The charms shown off</a> for PlayStation players include little weapon cosmetics referencing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. So for PC and console, one wonders what sort of other games will get nods in the form of such attachments.</p>
<p>Things really seem to be ramping up for Marathon. Not only did it take up a big spot during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">the recent Sony State of Play</a>, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Server Slam test</a> happening between the 26th February until the 2nd March. Finally, players will be able to make their own mind up on whether the game is a hit or a miss.</p><p>The game has certainly ran into its fair share of hurdles during development. Initial feedback on previous tests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">weren't entirely positive</a>, with many criticising the PvE aspect of the game as well as missing features like proximity voice. There was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">a massive plagiarism scandal</a>, which required developers to comb through the game to remove elements of work belonging to artist Antireal.</p>
<p>The game's journey to launch is nearly at an end, with the game launching next month on the 5th March. Will you be checking it out? Let us know!</p>
