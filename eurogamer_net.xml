            <p>Nintendo has altered the way it ranks best-selling games in the Switch eShop, which could have big ramifications for both shovelware games and indies alike.</p>
<p>The change comes as part of a major firmware update released yesterday for the older console, in preparation for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release next month.</p>
<p>Previously, the eShop listed best-selling games by total downloads from the past 14 days. That's now been changed to list games by total revenue from the past three days (spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6nDoGNfPc">GVG</a>, via <a href="https://kotaku.com/slop-nintendo-switch-eshop-best-seller-firmware-update-1851778523">Kotaku</a>).</p>

</figure>
<p>On the one hand, this appears to be a good move to help filter out cheap shovelware games. The eShop has been rife with cheap imitation games and "slop" - back in December, copycat games based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">Unpacking</a> were both called out.</p>
<p>The change in ranking means cheap games looking to make rapid sales will no longer be prioritised at the top of the charts, meaning studios will be disincentivised to game the charts with cheap knock-offs and sale prices aimed at undercutting bigger releases.</p>
<p>The flip side, though, is that legitimate indie games will likely have a more difficult time being discovered on the store. Instead, the chart will likely be dominated by fully priced AAA games - most notably, Nintendo's own, considering they're very rarely discounted.</p>
<p>At the time of the writing, the eShop Charts are dominated by predictable releases: Minecraft is top, followed by Animal Crossing, FC25, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>There is at least an option to view download exclusive games in the same format, though it's not shown by default.</p>
<p>It's certainly a welcome change, then, that focuses on legitimate games, but it's not necessarily an ideal solution.</p>
<p>Presumably this change will carry over to Switch 2, when it's released on 5th June. Nintendo previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-was-almost-called-the-super-nintendo-switch">digital store will have improved performance on the new console</a>, but it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eshop-music-wont-be-returning-for-switch-2">still won't have any music</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">Switch firmware update arrived yesterday</a>, adding Gameshare, Virtual Game Cards and more.</p>
<p>However, it was soon spotted that sharing Virtual Game Cards means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-users-say-virtual-game-cards-are-a-downgrade-as-online-game-sharing-changes">games can no longer be played online simultaneously across two consoles</a>, which users have called a "downgrade".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>App Store must now allow alternative payment options.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games is celebrating an enormous US court decision that forces Apple to allow alternative payment options on iPhone.
</p>
<p>
This is the key issue that began the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method</a>, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple last night by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker "in wilful violation" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing". 
</p>
<p>
That particular injuction saw Apple being told it had to allow purchases for apps from outside websites, to which Apple agreed but then decided to levy a 27 percent fee when doing so - effectively restoring its regular app store cut. 
</p>
<p>
In fiery terms, the US court has now said this move "strains credulity" and branded it an "obvious cover-up" designed to allow Apple to continue with "anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream".
</p>
<p>
The damning verdict echoes many of the arguments previously made by Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, who has campaigned against Apple's fresh barriers to outside payments.
</p>
<p>
"Apple's response," the court verdict reads, was to "impose new barriers and new requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page 'scare' screens, static URLs, and generic statements. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple's goal," the verdict continues, "was to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction."
</p>
<p>
More dramatic still, the court states that Apple documentation reveals the company "knew what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option", and that "to hide the truth, vice-president of finance Alex Roman outright lied under oath".
</p>
<p>
Sweeney, who previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499">took to social media last night to celebrate the decision</a> - and state that Fortnite would return to the US iPhone App Store next week.
</p>
<p>
"NO FEES on web transactions," Sweeney wrote. "Game over for the Apple Tax. Apple's 15-30 percent junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there.
</p>
<p>
"We will return Fortnite to the US iOS App Store next week. 
</p>
<p>
"Epic puts forth a peace proposal: If Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we'll return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Apple for comment, and asked whether it will be considering Sweeney's offer.

            <p>Throes of the Watchmaker, the much-anticipated DLC for retro RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>, will release later this month on 20th May.</p>
<p>The carnival-themed post-game adventure will arrive for free across all platforms: Nintendo Switch, Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The news was shared alongside a fresh trailer, showing off clockwork enemies, a new party member for the turn-based battles, and of course plenty of beautiful pixel art.</p>

<p>Throes of the Watchmaker will take place as a side adventure to the main plot, with Solstice Warriors Valere and Zale exploring the cursed carnival of Horloge to defeat the "mischievous Puppeteer".</p>
<p>The DLC promises over eight hours of gameplay, new playable classes for its pair of protagonists, the aforementioned new party member (called Arty), and three player local co-op.</p>
<p>It's also said to link to the studio's previous game, ninja platformer The Messenger.</p>
<p>Sea of Stars first released back in August 2023 - it's a retro RPG heavily inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and Super Mario RPG, with its active turn-based combat and chiptune score. I previously spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/composing-nostalgia-how-sea-of-stars-revisits-the-past-through-music">composer Eric W. Brown about working with Chrono Trigger's Yasunori Mitsuda</a>.</p>
<p>Though no longer available on PS Plus, the game is still on Xbox Game Pass if you're looking to catch up.</p>
<p>What's more, if the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">turn-based action of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has caught your attention, Sea of Stars is well worth a look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Borderlands 4, as we learned this week, is now arriving earlier than expected - but definitely not because of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, oh no. And with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">revised 12th September release date now out there</a>, developer Gearbox has shared more of its latest looty shooter in a new PlayStation showcase.
</p>
<p>
Weighing in at around 20 minutes, Gearbox's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY">PlayStation-hosted Borderlands 4 "deep dive" video</a> spotlights a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more - all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".
</p>
<p>
Borderlands 4 - which supposedly harkens back to a time when the series was more "grounded", according to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford - features four new Vault Hunters, and two were the focus of the studio's showcase: Vex the Siren and Rafa the Exo-Soldier.
</p>

<p>
Vex can utilise supernatural phase energy and conjure deadly minions, while Rafa comes equipped with an experimental exo-suit capable of "digistructing" an arsenal of weapons. In an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/">accompanying PlayStation Blog post</a>, Gearbox noted players can choose from three signature abilities  for their Vault Hunters, and there's talk of unique class Traits, special arguments, capstone abilities, and three branching upgrade paths of passive skills.
</p>
<p>
The team also highlighted some of Borderlands 4 new movement abilities - including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point-grappling - as they offered a short introduction to the Kairos, the all-new, seamlessly connected planet where the series' latest action unfolds. Expect new faces, returning characters - including Claptrap, Moxxi, and Zane - plus a personalised Digirunner vehicle players can summon to speed around the place.
</p>
<p>
There's plenty more detail to be found across Gearbox's deep dive video and blog post, so if any of that appeals, remember: Borderlands 4 now launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 12th September and not two weeks later. Why? That's "100 percent" down to the studio's "confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">according to Pitchford</a>. And really, honestly, nothing to do with publisher Take-Two wanting to nudge it out the way of its other big game, GTA 6.
