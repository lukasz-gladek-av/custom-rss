            <p>
If you've been itching for an excuse to get back out on the road again - by which I mean to sit in front of the computer playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> again - there's some good news. Developer SCS Software has announced its latest state expansion - this one providing access to the highways and byways of Missouri - launches next Thursday, 3rd April.
</p>
<p>
Missouri, if you haven't been keeping tabs, brings American Truck Simulator's current US state tally up to 17, following on from Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, and Arkansas. It's not the only expansion waiting in the wings, either; SCS has also previously confirmed it's working in Illinois, Iowa, and Lousiana - although these are further out.
</p>
<p>
Back to Missouri, though, American Truck Simulator's digital rendition of the Show Me State promises "vibrant cities" - including Saint Louis and its iconic Gateway Arch - as well as "diverse and beautiful" vistas, "from the rolling Ozark hills to charming small towns and vast farmlands."

<p>
"Experience the beauty of Missouri's sunrise and sunset as you drive through this picturesque landscape," SCS writes over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730870/American_Truck_Simulator__Missouri/">the expansion's Steam page</a>. "New depots and underground warehouses typical for this state add depth and realism to your trucking adventures. Engage in the heartbeat of Missouri's agriculture, transporting farm produce amidst fresh crops and rural vibes. Whether you're navigating urban streets in Saint Louis or cruising through serene countryside, Missouri offers a diverse and exciting trucking experience."
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Missouri's 3rd April arrival on Steam, SCS Software has released American Truck Simulator's 1.54 update. This introduces an overhauled cargo system - which the developer says "improves efficiency [and] saves disk space and memory by eliminating the need to store countless pre-made combinations" - and there's a more intuitive truck adjustment system, making it easier to tweak your in-cabin experience.
</p>
<p>
That's on top of NVIDIA PhysX physics implementation, which promises "more precise collision detection results and more robust behaviour during scenarios involving collisions", plus Driving Academy awards, and more - as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/537723186574262495?l=english">detailed in SCS' patch notes</a>.

            <p>
After Netflix's tentative first few years in games - which has seen it grow its mobile library, acquire studios, and dabble in triple-A development before dramatically changing course - the streamer's new gaming boss, Alain Tascan, has laid out the company's latest vision. This, he says, is less about the console model and more about phone-controlled party games.
</p>
<p>
Tascan - a 30-year industry veteran who most recently served as executive vice president of game development at Epic Games - joined Netflix last July, taking over the role from Mike Verdu, who <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflixs-mike-verdu-reveals-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">briefly transitioned to vice president of generative AI at Netflix</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-netflix-gaming-boss-departs-following-move-to-ai-role">departing the company</a>. And with nine months at the streaming service now under his belt, Tascan recently outlined his vision for Netflix gaming at this year's GDC.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the">reported by The Game Business
</a>, that vision takes a four-pronged approach, focusing on narrative and transmedia projects, on big mainstream IP, on being a trusted destination for families, and on party games played on TVs using mobile phones as a controller.
</p>
<p>
The latter, as Tascan sees it, is Netflix's attempt at Wii-style industry "disruption". "I love the Wii," he told The Game Business. "I am very vigorous about lowering friction and eliminating it if we can. I see that the subscription is friction as well. Maybe good friction because it makes business sense... But the other friction is having enough controllers for family. Having a piece of hardware that might be expensive... Waiting for a game to download... I am [looking at] all the obstacles, and asking if we can reduce them as much as possible."
</p>
<p>
As such, it's perhaps not surprising to hear Tascan's dismissal of the classic console model. "[When it comes to] console, we started to look at the future where the platform is agnostic," he said. "Look at the younger generation. Are eight year-olds and 10 year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6? I am not sure. They are wanting to interact with any digital screen, whatever it is, wherever it is, even in the car. With console you're thinking about high definition, you're thinking about the controller... If we look at this older model, I think it will restrain us."
</p>
<p>
Tascan also seems unconvinced classic console-style games have much value for Netflix - which might go some way to explaining why the streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">recently culled staff at respected Oxenfree developer Night School Studio</a>, and why it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">closed its high-profile triple-A studio</a> before it could release a game last year. "Does it really need to be these super complicated RPG-style games?," he posited to The Game Business. "There is a place for them, for sure. But this for me this is what's interesting... What do we give [Netflix subscribers], and in what way, so they can enjoy and engage with [games] over and over?"
</p>
<p>
The answer to that question is, apparently, party games. "I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone controller as a very innovative controller," Tascan explained. "On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen... if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you're alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?"
</p>
<p>
"We need to push the vision more than anything else and try to disrupt," he continued, "because I believe the threshold you need to hit for people to be entertained by games is very high... In terms of the disruption we can bring, distribution is one and the other is the phone as a controller. The communication between the phone and the TV. The IP. The transmedia aspect... I don't know exactly which one will work, but we have a few cards to play that are very unique."
</p>
<p>
"We have some very special competitive advantages," Tascan added. "We've just scratched the surface. For instance, for Squid Game, you watch the show and you unlock some currency in the game. But that's just the beginning. Imagine places where you watch something and then something special appears in the game, and maybe in the future you do something in the game and then you watch something – because of AI or what have you – and something happens there. We have a lot of things that we can imagine and reimagine."
</p>
<p>
No matter how Tascan's vision of mobile-driven party games, unlockable currency, and "AI or what have you" pans out, he insists Netflix is in the gaming business for the long haul. "If you look at our two co-CEOs... and look at where Netflix was 10 years ago in terms of their core business... they know the path of being stubborn, hard-working, innovating, having a vision and going after it... I believe them when they told me that gaming was important, because if [Netflix] wants to entertain the world then there's no-way around it, we need to be in games. When I look at these two leaders in particular... I believe in their full commitment."

            <p>
Following last week's news of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightdives-long-awaited-system-shock-2-remaster-finally-arrives-in-june">June release date for Nightdive Studios' long-in-the-works System Shock 2 remaster</a>, the developer's been talking about the future of the beloved series - suggesting a full-blown <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> remake could potentially also be on the cards.
</p>
<p>
A System Shock 2 remaster was initially announced back in 2019, midway through the development of Nightdive's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> 1 remake. And while the remake's road to release was a rocky one, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/system-shock-review-shodan-steals-the-show-in-this-faithful-remake">end result was very positively received</a> - to the point there's now enthusiasm for fully fledged System Shock 2 remake too. Something Nightdive's well aware of.
</p>
<p>
"I've been asked twice earlier today why we didn’t do a remake," Nightdive director of business development Larry Kuperman <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/">told VGC in a recent interview</a>. "And I said, 'Are you somehow under the impression that because we do a remaster that we won't be able to do a remake in the future?'" Kuperman's comments could, of course, be easily dismissed as purely hypothetical, if he hadn't then added, "That might be something that I can either confirm or deny. But there's going to be content coming out."

<figcaption>Here's a look at Nightdive's upcoming System Shock 2 remaster.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEY0utFag38" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
What that "content" might be is unclear, but given Nightdive owns the rights to the System Shock franchise, it's technically free to build on the games however it pleases. Where things get murkier, however, is the situation surrounding the series away from System Shock 1 &amp; 2. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock-3">System Shock 3</a>, for instance, is currently in limbo, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightdive-studios-says-the-fate-of-a-third-system-shock-game-lies-in-tencents-hands">rights to the game now with Tencent</a> following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warren-spectors-otherside-studio-hasnt-worked-on-system-shock-3-since-2019">complicated series of events</a> that saw the project fall off the rails.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to VGC, Kuperman acknowledged the "situation around System Shock 3 is very complicated", but suggested there might be some clarification on the project "potentially within a year... or it could take longer". But regardless of how System Shock 3 plays out, Kuperman confirmed Nightdive still has "visions of what we can do within what we control".
</p>
<p>
"We'll see what happens," he added. "I mean, there's stuff that we can do within the first and the second [games]." Which does, of course, brings us full circle, back to a potential System Shock 2 remake, or some unspecified new "content" for the first two titles at the very least.
</p>
<p>
Before all that, though, there's Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. This long-in-the-works spruce-up of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> developer Irrational Games' critically acclaimed 1999 FPS/RPG sci-fi horror hybrid promises enhancements to characters, weapon models, textures, cinematics, and animations. That's alongside quality of life improvements, optimised controller support, updated co-op multiplayer, and achievements - all of which players can experience when the remaster launches for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 26th June.
