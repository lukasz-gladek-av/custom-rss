            <p>Doom: The Dark Ages serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom and its sequel Doom Eternal, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">tells the "epic cinematic origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage"</a>. But, even though it's a prequel, don't expect The Dark Ages to end with the Slayer being popped in a coffin.</p>
<p>As a reminder, 2016's Doom opens with the Slayer lying in a coffin, before he swiftly breaks free from the chains binding him so he can shoot the faces off advancing baddies. It is quite the way to kick things off.</p>
<p>So, if The Dark Ages is going to set us up for Doom 2016, surely we already know how the upcoming game is going to end, right? Wrong!</p>

<p>"I mean, that would end the Dark Ages, the medieval chapter of the Doom saga. This is kind of like the Chronicles of the Slayer," Doom: The Dark Ages game director Hugo Martin told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-end-with-the-slayer-in-a-coffin-waiting-for-the-start-of-doom-2016-that-would-mean-that-we-couldnt-tell-any-more-medieval-stories/">PC Gamer</a>, when asked about potentially seeing the Slayer getting locked away.</p>
<p>"So if we took it all the way to that point, then that would mean that we couldn't tell any more medieval stories. And I'm not announcing projects or anything other than to just say it's better to leave it open."</p>
<p>The game director added that the Doom: The Dark Ages team has some DLC planned for the prequel, so again putting the Slayer in a coffin during the main story wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>"We do have a DLC and things like that, so it won't - I'm not giving away spoilers - but it doesn't end with him [in the coffin]," the developer continued.</p>
<p>"The story is that they collapsed a building on top of him and then put him inside of that sarcophagus that we find him in at the beginning of 2016," said Martin.</p>
<p>"And this game doesn't end that way."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has today received its latest update, fixing a number of issues.</p>
<p>The update, known as ver.1.000.05.00, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-soon-to-fix-monster-hunter-wilds-issue-where-its-celebrated-food-scenes-arent-showing">was announced last week</a>, and now that it's live Capcom has released a full list of fixes.</p>
<p>Alongside an issue where the game's celebrated food scenes weren't showing, other fixed issues include the Monster Field Guide not being accessible (which is pretty crucial), players falling through the map after the Towards Fervent Fields mission in Chapter 2-1, and issues with screen rendering causing force quits.</p>

<p>A full list of fixes can be found in the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom has also updated its list of known issues. These will presumably be fixed in the next patch, though some of these issues have been on this list for the past couple of patch notes.</p>
<p>The known issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network error occurs when firing an SOS flare right after a quest begins.</li>
<li>Link Members are not prioritized over other players and may not appear in some places including Base Camps.</li>
<li>Palicoâ€™s attacks with blunt weapons do not inflict stun and exhaust damages.</li>
<li>Hunter Profile cannot be edited properly on some occasions.</li>
<li>Some side missions cannot be completed under certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capcom has requested players restart the game and update to the latest version before playing again.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proven exceptionally popular since its release at the end of February. While Steam player numbers have taken a dip, its all-time concurrent player count peak was at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">over 1.38 million players during its first weekend</a>. That's the fifth highest peak ever on the platform.</p>
<p>The game sold 8m copies in its first three days on sale to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>. That number will have risen even further since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new filing from the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has confirmed multiple Switch 2 features.</p>
<p>Now we know Amiibo figurines will be supported, as Switch 2 will support NFC - it's in the right Joy-Con, just like the original Switch.</p>
<p>It's also confirmed to have faster Wi-Fi compatibility with support for Wi-Fi 6 networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth, up from Wi-Fi 5 on the original Switch. However, it doesn't appear to support the more recent Wi-Fi 7 or Wi-Fi 6E.</p>

<p>Further, we already knew Switch 2 would have USB-C ports both on top and at the bottom of the console, but these filings confirm both ports can be used to charge the console.</p>
<p>We also now know the Switch 2's code designation is BEE, with BEE-001 being the model of the console, BEE-012 and 014 being the left and right Joy-Cons, and BEE-053 being the Relay Box.</p>
<p>Similarly, the GameCube had the code DOL (for Dolphin) and the Wii had RVL (for Revolution).</p>

<p>Little is known about the console so far, beyond its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal back in January</a>, but it's hoped the Direct will provide a wealth of information: from its release date and price, to the launch line-up.

            <p>After its VR catalogue was removed from the Meta Store earlier this year, Insomniac has announced the affected games are now making a return.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, three of the four previoulsy delisted games are again available on the Meta Store. These are Edge of Nowhere, Stormland, and Feral Rites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Insomniac is still "actively" working on getting the fourth of its Meta VR titles - The Unspoken - back on the store front. "VR players, we appreciate your patience while we work with Meta [to] restore access to these games," <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1898232148911702187">Insomniac wrote on social media</a>.</p>

<p>All four of the affected games were developed with funding by Meta. While no reason was given for their removal from the store, the general consensus was that it was due to the certification process. A <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/stormland-oculus-rift-store-missing/#:~:text=Stormland%20and%20The%20Unspoken%20are%20back%20for%20sale,our%20blog%20from%20September,%E2%80%9D%20Meta%20explained%20via%20email.">similar thing happened back in 2022</a>, as well.</p>
<p>While the four games had seemingly been absent from the store for several months now, their removal was recently highlighted by freelance journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3ljd4dorpt42n?ref=uploadvr.com">Dominic Tarason</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"I thankfully picked up Stormland (their best-known game) and can still access it, but the others are so thoroughly vanished that not even pirate and torrent sites seem to have the rest anymore," Tarason wrote at the start of the month.</p>

<p>The fake Snake is Neil, played by Luca Marinelli - a new character for the sequel. We see him towards the end of the trailer wearing a bandana in a look strikingly similar to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> protagonist.</p>
<p>The rest of the trailer includes plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-sure-sounds-a-lot-like-death-stranding-so-far">elements familiar to fans of the first game</a>, but with plenty more surreal and bizarre happenings.</p>
<p>There's a mysterious faction, an environment warped by chiralium, and some absolutely nightmarish BTs. We also see Sam Bridges exploring more varied locales, from lush forests and snowy mountains, to a post apocalyptic city caught in a storm, and the more familiar Icelandic tundra.</p>

<p>There are plenty of story hints too inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, though at this point little of it makes sense. Kojima also continues his penchant for simplistic descriptive names: Dollman, Doctor, and Rainy, for instance.</p>
<p>The trailer is soundtracked by a new song from musician Woodkid called To The Wilder, which is out now.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> Strands of Harmony World Tour will take place this year, beginning at the Sydney Opera House on 8th November and then visiting 12 countries across four continents until it ends in Toronto on 28th March 2026. The London date is 16th November.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be available to pre-order from 17th March. According to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-details-leak-ahead-of-kojima-panel-later-today">leak ahead of the panel</a>, the collector's edition will cost $230.</p>
