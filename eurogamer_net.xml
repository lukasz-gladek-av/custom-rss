            <p>Last night, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> got some behind the scenes updates, and as has become tradition, this little morsel of change has immediately raised hopes that maybe, just maybe, we will be getting some kind of release date news soon.</p>
<p>These SteamDB updates were spotted and subsequently shared on social media by Wario64, who noted that one of the updated packages had just received its first update in 15 months. So, what could this all mean? Well, of course it means that developer Team Cherry is gearing up for the game's imminent release. Right?</p>

<p>Since Wario64's post, there have been plenty of other social media users who have come to this conclusion. "SWITCH 2 SHADOW DROP," <a href="https://x.com/Papa_Kutz/status/1929773856367300618">one excited fan wrote</a> with an accompanying gif of The US Office's Michael Scott getting very hyped up about things finally happening. I mean, we do know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">Silksong is set for <em>both </em>Nintendo's consoles</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2 is set to release this week</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-release-window-finally-narrowed-down">a Silksong tease earlier this year</a>, so maybe…</p>
<p>That said, the game is also coming to other platforms as well, and <a href="https://x.com/Animator_Alex/status/1929770574777033112">others have suggested that either Summer Game Fest</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">during the Xbox showcase on Sunday</a> will be when Team Cherry finally releases Silksong out into the wild. <a href="https://x.com/reverie_mark/status/1929781696804934110">Others are less certain</a>, but "manifesting" a release this week all the same.</p> <div>

<p>It has now been six years and a bit since Hollow Knight: Silksong was first announced, and many have been eagerly waiting ever since. In January, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">then finally assured us that Silksong was "real, progressing and will release"</a>.</p>
<p> So, do you think that release will be in just a few short days time?</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> and co released a sizzle reel for Summer Game Fest, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-releases-hype-trailer">featured titles such as Death Stranding 2, Dune Awakening, Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, and Mafia: The Old Country</a>, to name a handful. Silksong did not feature.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has now had 3.5 million players, less than a week since its release.</p>
<p>FromSoftware shared the news in a social media post, which also confirmed duo expeditions will be added "at a later date".</p>
<p>The multiplayer spin-off to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> is ostensibly a three-player game, though it's possible to play solo too. However, it's received plenty of criticism from players hoping to play as a duo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">FromSoftware stated it was considering adding a two-player mode post-launch</a>, with director Junya Ishizaki explaining it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>It seems, from this latest post, that the mode is on the way. It will follow the already announced DLC releasing later this year, as well as "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month".</p>
<p>The news suggests FromSoftware will be supporting the game with new content post-release.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">But the Night is far from over.<br>In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If you can't wait that long, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-two-player-elden-ring-nightreign-pc-mod-is-already-available">PC players can already play the game with two players thanks to a fan-made mod</a>.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign released last week and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">received two million players in its first day</a>. Initially, the game had a "Mixed" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/#app_reviews_hash">reaction on Steam</a>, but it's now recovered to "Mostly Positive". Perhaps players just needed to give it time and appreciate the game for what it is, rather than what it supposedly lacks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, FromSoftware <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">patched Elden Ring Nightreign to make it easier for solo players</a> - now there's a new automatic revive and an increase in runes gained. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">multiplayer remains the best way to experience the game</a>.</p>
