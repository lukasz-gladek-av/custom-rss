            <p>
EA's Star Wars strategy game, confirmed to be in the works back in 2022, has been given a title - Star Wars: Zero Company - and a first bit of artwork ahead of a full reveal this weekend.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars: Zero Company is a collaboration between EA's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> and developer Bit Reactor, a studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-veterans-form-new-studio-bit-reactor-to-focus-on-turn-based-strategy">founded in 2022 by veterans of XCOM and Civilization developer Firaxis Games</a>. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-three-new-star-wars-games-in-development-at-respawn">one of three new Star Wars titles announced by EA at the time</a>, the others being a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which released in 2023 - and a Star Wars first-person shooter which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">has since been cancelled</a>.
</p>
<p>
Little has been heard about Bit Reactor's game in the years since its announcement - although the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-star-wars-strategy-game-still-in-development-following-layoffs">studio did break its silence</a> to confirm the project had been unaffected by the EA layoffs that accompanied the end of Respawn's shooter - but all that's about to change.
</p>
<p>
EA has <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1911811628124742117">taken to social media</a> to share the first official details about the project, calling Star Wars: Zero Company a "single-player turn-based tactics game", and sharing a first bit of concept art. The image features a motley crew of unnamed characters (plus one luxuriant moustache) including a Jedi, Mandalorian, and Clone trooper - with the latter suggesting Zero Company is set in the prequel era. That's further supported by the appearance of a battle droid displayed on the holographic device held by our moustachioed friend.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, there's not much more to report - but that will change this weekend as part of 2025's Star Wars Celebration convention. EA says it'll be sharing a "world-exclusive first look" at Zero Company as part of a panel this Saturday, 19th April, at 8.30am. Expect those details to start working their way across the internet shortly after.
