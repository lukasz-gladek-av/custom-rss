            <p>House of the Dead 2: Remake will rise from the grave in spring/Q2 2025.</p>
<p>Coming to Nintendo Switch, PC via Steam and GOG, Xbox, and PlayStation, the remake features remastered music - although the classic soundtrack is also available - as well as modernised graphics, "faithful to the original" gameplay, multiple endings and branching levels, plus co-op.</p>
<p>You can check out the action in the video embedded below:</p>

<p>For the uninitiated, House of Dead 2 is, funnily enough, the sequel to Sega's prolific 90s rail-shooter zombie series. In this instalment, you take on the lone role of secret agent James - either alone or in co-op mode alongside fellow agent Gary - with one single mission: to neutralise the dangerous denizens standing in your way.</p>
<p>As well as the features listed above, there will also be a boss mode in which you'll have to speedrun killing all of the game's bosses, and a training mode is available to help you hone your skills.</p>
<p>This is the second of Sega's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, as Matt summarised for us this time last year, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>. With complaints highlighting control scheme issues and performance on last-gen consoles, so it'll be interesting to see how the second remake will be received.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">Sega's The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct.</p>
<p>Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. The duo have also worked on adaptations for the likes of Mortal Kombat (1995) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> (2020), as well as multiple Resident Evil films.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
