            <p>Virtuos - the studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">this year's successful The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> and whose staff have also worked on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-23-update-wants-you-to-relax-and-take-in-the-night-city-sights-with-new-self-driving-cars">recently announced Cyberpunk 2077 update</a> as well as serving as a support studio for the anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> - has reportedly been impacted by layoffs.</p>
<p>According to a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gautoz.cool/post/3lu3ntewdrk2t">BlueSky by Gauthier Andres</a>, a reporter for the French-language publication Origami, seven percent of the company's workforce will be subject to layoffs. That's 300 people.</p>
<p>These layoffs will allegedly be across the United States, Asia, Europe, and three branches in France. Andres' sources said the initial layoffs will affect those in China.</p>

<p>"Virtuos is said to have made significant efforts on Oblivion, with a policy of over-spending on quality and a royalty-free contract (without bonuses tied to the game's success)," Andres wrote (via machine translation). "The result: teams put under severe strain for a purely showcase game, whose profitability is doomed to be questioned."</p>
<p>The company reportedly put a freeze on raises and reduction on bonuses back in February of this year. This move led to questions regarding layoffs from staff to Virtuos' management. As a result, Andres said a strike is taking place at Virtuos Lyon, which will protest the layoffs and aim to "protect the future capacity of the branch".</p>
<p>According to sources, Virtuos is also making a move towards the use of generative AI. "In one year, we've gone from a few group-level presentations to basic but mandatory training for employees," Andres was told.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Virtuos for comment on the report.</p>
<p>Layoffs have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">a depressingly regular</a> story in the video games industry over the past few years. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">Microsoft began another round of layoffs at the company impacting in excess of 9000 people</a>. This saw games cancelled and studios closed.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/studio-behind-oblivion-remastered-one-of-2025s-biggest-hits-subject-to-mass-layoffs-report]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The team behind the upcoming Mortal Kombat movie sequel - aptly known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> - has released a new teaser for the film, with a certain Mr Johnny Cage taking centre stage (poetry!).</p>
<p>The teaser itself is called Uncaged Fury, and sees Karl Urban's Johnny Cage taking on a load of would-be assailants by whacking them all with pipes and leaping around in a rather athletic way. This leaping includes him jumping over a recently launched Bazooka missile, which despite being aimed at the ground manages to miss Johnny and hit… actually, I won't say, because you really do have to see it to believe it.</p>
<p>You can check out the new teaser trailer for Mortal Kombat 2 below.</p>

<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and recently starred in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it boring.</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-trailer-sees-johnny-cage-jumping-over-a-bazooka-missile-with-some-very-wide-legs]]></content:encoded>
