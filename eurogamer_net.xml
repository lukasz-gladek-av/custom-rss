Following the launch of last year's well-received Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars remaster, developer Revolution Software has teased a similar "reforged" treatment for the beloved point-and-click adventure's 1997 sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-2-smoking-mirror">Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-gets-september-release-date">Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars Reforged</a> took the original 1996 series instalment - in which American tourist George Stobbart teams up with photo-journalist Nicole Collard to unearth a global conspiracy - and gently reinvigorated it with 4K backgrounds, re-animated sprites, enhanced audio, and more.
</p>
<p>
The end result - which released for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation last September (with a Switch version arriving a little later) - was positively received among fans, and Revolution has now hinted it's getting ready to give Broken Sword 2 a similar makeover.

<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/revolution-software-teases-development-of-broken-sword-2-the-smoking-mirror-reforged">GameWatcher</a>, Revolution Software boss (and Broken Sword designer) Charles Cecil ended the studio's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2nhvPuhXyc">recent Christmas recap video</a> by rifling through concept art created for Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars Reforged. However, one last drawing lurked at the end of the pile - this one featuring various designs for George Stobbart's shorts-and-sunglasses get-up, worn as he explores the Central American town of Quaramonte in Broken Sword 2.
</p>
<p>
At that point, Cecil offered a knowing shrug to the camera before the video cut to a lingering close-up of George's holiday gear, just in case it wasn't obvious enough the first time around.
</p>
<p>
A Reforged edition of Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror would undoubtedly be warmly received by fans (especially as it's been fifteen years since the game's last remaster), but it's unclear when Revolution might get round to it. The studio is still hard at work on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-parzivals-stone-is-a-new-entry-in-the-classic-point-and-click-adventure-series">previously announced sixth series entry</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-parzivals-stone">Broken Sword - Parzival's Stone</a>, which is currently expected to arrive next year. Hopefully it'll have more than a tease to share before too long.

            <p>
Somewhat unbelievably, this February marks <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> series' 25th anniversary - that's a whole two and a half decades of "yibs", "neibs", and mysterious "incidents" involving suddenly ladder-less swimming pools - and EA is celebrating the occasion with a whole bunch of activities, including free updates, limited-time events, paid DLC, and more.
</p>
<p>
The Sims' quarter anniversary celebrations officially begin on 4th February, with a "huge" free <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> update introducing over 70+ new items spanning both Create a Sim and Build Buy modes. There's talk of turtlenecks and bodysuits, bike shorts, accessories, and hairdos. New furnishings, meanwhile, include "stylish" windows and doors, wood finishes for kitchen cabinets, and even a new playground pirate ship for the young 'uns.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, 4th February sees the launch of The Sims 4's new limited-time Blast from the Past event, presenting players will four weeks of challenges unlocking "iconic items from the 2000s", including a milk carton, telephone, alarm clock, birthday cake, and inflatable chairs. The Sims FreePlay is getting a similarly themed event on mobile, then, to wrap up the series' 4th February festivities, EA is hosting a 25-hour livestream from 10pm GMT. This'll feature Simmers and other special guests for a nostalgic look at The Sims' impact over the years.

<p>
That's not everything within The Sims' 25th anniversary orbit, however. Hurtling forward to 18th March, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-2007s-surprisingly-alright-the-sims-spin-off-mysims-is-heading-to-switch">recently released MySims: Cozy Bundle</a> - which contains beloved Wii series spin-offs MySims and MySims Kingdom - is making the jump from Switch to PC. And before that, there's another free update out today.
</p><p>
This one introduces a number of new features previously playtested as part of EA's relatively recent The Sims Labs initiative. There's a new main menu, for instance, putting your currently in-use Sims family front and centre, and all townie houses in Willow Creek and Oasis Springs - including those belonging to the Pancakes, Goths, Calientes, Landgraabs, and BFFs - have been rebuilt and renovated using some of the items added to the base game over the years. Full details of these latest improvements can be <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-1-14-2025">found in EA's patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's latest update arrives ahead of three new paid Kit DLC packs, launching this Thursday, 16th February. There's the Secret Sanctuary Kit, providing a range of items players can use to build a "luxurious space tucked behind a secret passage in a bookcase", while the Casanova Cave Kit promises items Sims can use to "entertain and make an impression". Lastly, there's the Comfy Gamer Kit, incorporating items themed around creating a "warm, inviting gaming room with personal touches".
</p>
<p>
EA says two additional kits are due this month, with more coming "later this year" - and further information on all the above is included in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4?isLocalized=true">25th anniversary news post</a>.

            <p>
We already knew <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> players loved mods, thanks to developer Larian's previous announcements on the matter, but it turns out Baldur's Gate 3 players <em>really</em> love mods - with the studio now revealing over 100m mods have been downloaded for the acclaimed RPG. And what better way to celebrate that impressive milestone, you might be asking yourself, than by giving PC, Mac, and console players an officially curated set of Withers boobs?
</p>
<p>
That, obviously, is something we'll probably need to circle back to imminently, but first a recap on those mod downloads. Larian last shared a figure back in October, confirming over 50m downloads since mod support was officially introduced on PC and consoles last year.
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead three and a bit months and that number has now skyrocketed to 100m downloads across all platforms. "You are modding naturals", Larian proclaimed in a <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1879196788319772971">social media post</a> celebrating the milestone - appending an image in which the two zeroes in "100" had been conspicuously placed across beloved undead NPC Withers' suddenly more ample chest.

<figcaption>Larian explains how it curates Baldur's Gate 3 mods on consoles.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHlbagHZR2U" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
And that, it turns out, was just a prelude for things to come, with Larian following up its initial post by <a href="https://x.com/larianstudios/status/1879203034544369798">announcing</a> it was celebrating Baldur's Gate 3's latest milestone by adding something new to its curated list of mods officially available across PC, Mac, and consoles. That mod in question is <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/withersbignaturals">MaybeAdam's "Withers Big Naturals"</a>, giving everybody's favourite companion-resurrecting pal the opportunity to breast boobily, if players so desire.
</p><p>
As to why Larian has decided to single out this particular mod, that's not entirely clear - but given the studio previously revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-modders-really-want-to-change-withers-name-to-bone-daddy">over 10,000 people had downloaded a mod renaming Withers to Bone Daddy</a>, this is evidently becoming something of a theme.
</p>
<p>
News of Baldur's Gate 3's 100m mod downloads arrives ahead of the massively acclaimed RPG's eighth and final major post-launch patch. It doesn't have a release date yet - although <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-31-patch-8-stress-test-register-now_130">stress testing is confirmed to begin this month</a> - but it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">promising to be a biggy</a>, introducing 12 new subclasses, cross-play, fancy new photo mode features, and more.
</p>
<p>
After patch eight's arrival, it'll be time for Larian to wave goodbye to Baldur's Gate 3 once and for all, fully shifting its resources over to its unannounced next project. Previously, the studio revealed it had two games in the works - both based on its own IPs - and it recently <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/baldurs-gate-3-devs-shift-full-attention-to-their-next-game/">confirmed</a> the majority of the team's "full attention is [now] focused on crafting [its] next title", and that'll be moving to a "media blackout" for the foreseeable future.
