            <p>Larian has shared some details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s PS5 Pro upgrade.</p>
<p>Those in possession of both a PlayStation 5 Pro and Baldur's Gate 3 will see the game's Quality mode can now run at native 4K (2160p), with 30fps. Its Performance mode, meanwhile, has been upscaled from 1440p to 2160p, with 60fps.</p>
<p>These adjustments, Larian said, will allow players to "achieve crisp console visuals without sacrificing smooth performance".</p>

<p>The developer added split screen gameplay on the PS5 Pro will now offer either 30fps or 60fps. The frame rate will depend on whether a player has opted for Quality or Performance mode.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, the developer has also issued a PS5 fix for that bug which prevented players from downloading or subscribing to mods when loading into another player's multiplayer game with mods enabled.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, PlayStation platform business group CEO Hideaki Nishino revealed Sony was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-was-already-working-on-ps5-pro-before-playstation-5-launch">working on its PS5 Pro console even before it released the base PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>And now, it is here. The digital-only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro arrived today</a>, costing £699.99/$699.99. It includes a 2TB SSD, a DualSense wireless controller and - as the PS5 did - a copy of Astro's Playroom pre-installed. As a general point, you will need to buy the vertical stand separately (£24.99). The separate disc drive is also compatible, and costs an additional £99.99. If you want to purchase everything, you are looking at a total of £825.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's Legend of Zelda film adaptation will be released at some point in the next five years and two months.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't shared a specific year for Link and Zelda's hop to the big screen as yet, however the company has at least narrowed it down to 2020-something.</p>

<p>In this week's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo shared an update on its 'visual content', which means its movie projects.</p>
<p>"In the field of visual content, we are making direct investments and are deeply involved in the planning and development of multiple productions," it wrote, with an accompanying infographic showing that rather vague Zelda release window: 202X.</p>
<p>Here, it also noted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">upcoming Super Mario Bros. sequel will make its debut in April 2026</a>. Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">Super Mario Bros. animated movie was a huge success for the company</a>, with Nintendo stating it was viewed in theaters by approximately 170 million people.</p>

<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie this time last year</a>, with a rather casual post on social media. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the movie</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution).</p>
<p>Film producer Avi Arad is also on board. Arad's previous video game to film projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">this year's Borderlands adaptation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-sequel-in-development-sony-pictures-confirms">Tom Holland-fronted Uncharted</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, yesterday the company gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-not-ruling-out-future-acquisitions-but-still-favours-organic-expansion-to-maintain-creative-culture">further insight on its approach to mergers and acquisitions</a>, while also confirming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch successor will be backward compatible with Switch games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
