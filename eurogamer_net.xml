            <p>Three games have been confirmed to be leaving Xbox's Game Pass subscription service in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Those three games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wargroove 2</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie</li>
<li>All You Need Is Help</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in any of the above games, now is your last chance to play them via Game Pass (at least for now, they may well be re-added at a later date). The above three games will leave the service both on consoles and PC on 15th September.</p>
<p>Chris Donlan was rather taken with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wargroove-2">Wargroove 2</a> on its release. "I liked the first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wargroove">Wargroove</a>, but I think I may end up loving this one," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wargroove-2-feels-like-an-incremental-sequel-with-a-lot-to-love">Eurogamer's Wargroove 2 feature from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>All You Need is Help, meanwhile, is described as a "quirky" co-op puzzle game, complete with fluffy cube creatures (see header above) which "team up to solve puzzles together".</p>
<p>For everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, you can check out our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Xbox Game Pass guide</a> detailing the many titles available.</p>

            <p>
Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto has claimed the "PS5 barrier" for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is "unexpectedly large", which has limited the game's success on Sony's console.
</p>
<p>
Tsujimoto was interviewed by <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Nikkei</a> back in May, though just recently published (and translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-president-regarding-building-upon-wilds-initial-sales-we-found-that-the-ps5-barrier-is-unexpectedly-large-ps5-the-main-platform-for-mhw.1285902/">ResetEra</a>), where he discussed the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">initial 10m sales in its first month of release</a>. 
</p>
<p>
He stated PS5 was considered the main platform for the game, however the steep price of both the console and the game itself - especially in comparison to previous entries in the series now available on sale - had an impact on sales. In particular, younger generations are often unable to afford such high prices.

<p>
Capcom therefore aims to boost sales of the game with limited time sales - it had a 20 percent reduction at the end of June, for instance.
</p>
<p>
More interestingly, Tsujimoto commented on the popularity of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, stating despite the price the "response was better than we had expected".
</p>
<p>
There's no indication here that Monster Hunter Wilds will appear on Switch 2 anytime soon. However, the series has a long history with handheld consoles from both Nintendo and Sony, with previous entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> releasing on Switch before other platforms.
</p>
<p>
However, with the multitude of performance issues across both home consoles and PC with Monster Hunter Wilds, a Switch 2 version seems ambitious at this point.
</p>
<p>
It's particularly interesting PS5 was considered the primary platform, considering the vast majority of sales for Monster Hunter Wilds have actually been on PC. It perhaps explains why the PC version of the game, with its much-criticised performance issues, is yet to be properly optimised - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-players-wait-almost-a-year-for-better-performance-capcom-is-in-danger-of-losing-its-most-important-audience">PC players will be waiting almost a year for a comprehensive fix</a>.
</p><p>
Ahead of the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-producer-acknowledges-importance-of-pc-platform-and-crossplay">producer Ryozo Tsujimoto noted there are "more players than ever playing on PC, including in Japan"</a> so Capcom sees "room for the series to capture new players who haven't tried it before if that's their chosen platform". At the least, Capcom was aware of the game's potential PC popularity.

            <p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series, and provided a little teaser of what's to come.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/RaymanGame/status/1962595259361210694">video posted on the official Rayman X account</a>, which had been dormant for years prior to today, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Gounon also announced Ubisoft will be sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews, concept art and more to make it a momentous occasion for the series, and give back to fans who've remained true to Rayman even now.</p>

<p>Composer for the Rayman series Christophe Heral then appeared in the video, thanking fans for lovely messages, saying he loves them very much, and playing a sweet performance to cap the whole thing off.</p>
<p>Rayman is one of Ubisoft's defining IPs, even if it's been left a bit by the wayside in recent years. It's nice to know some movement is happening on a new game, even if we won't be seeing it any time soon.</p>

<p>In the same post, Team Cherry noted that codes sent out to its Switch backers will be sent via email, and not be redeemable until the game has launched in their territory. If you are unsure when that is, yesterday the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-wont-release-bang-on-midnight-on-4th-september-so-maybe-dont-take-the-whole-day-off">developer announced that Hollow Knight Silksong will release at 3pm UK time this Thursday</a>. You can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight/posts/4473863">find out more about Silksong's key delivery details via Kickstarter</a>.</p>
<p>There are now only two more days to go until Hollow Knight Silksong makes its debut, after what to many has felt like eons of waiting patiently (and I am sure in some cases, not so patiently) for.</p>
<p>If you are interested in Silksong, but aren't planning on purchasing it right away, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9v2TJV_yws">our Zoe will be hosting a Silksong stream on Thursday</a>. Be sure to tune in.</p>

<p>Last month, our Dom braved the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> queues to go hands-on with Silksong, and came away impressed with its high challenge and how Hornet's movement differs from the original game's Knight.
