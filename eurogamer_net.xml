            <p>A book containing the video game scripts for both of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us games, including the first game's Left Behind DLC, is being released.</p>
<p>The tome itself has the very appropriate title The Last of Us: Part 1 and Part 2 Scripts, and is coming from the games' developer Naughty Dog in collaboration with Dark Horse Books. It will be released on 16th December, though pre-orders are open now via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506751326?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=sec2002-20">Amazon US</a> for $66.63. I have popped a message over to Sony to get clarification on UK availability and pricing.</p>
<p>"Relive every climactic moment in The Last of Us: Part 1 and Part 2 Scripts, from Joel and Ellie's time with Tess in Boston, to Ellie's joy while petting giraffes, to Joel's heart-wrenching decision at the Fireflies' hospital in The Last of Us Part 1. Then, dive into The Last of Us Part 2's dual-perspective story, including Abby's shocking introduction, Ellie and Dina forging a bond together, an enthralling encounter with the Rat King, and the final showdown between Ellie and Abby," reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Along with the scripts, this book will also include a forward from Troy Baker, who among other roles voices Joel in the Last of Us games, as well as an art gallery with work by principal character concept artist Hyoung Nam, and a cover with new art and block printing along the pages edges which have been designed to evoke "the franchise's iconic Cordyceps fungus" (see below).</p>

<p>"At its beginning, The Last of Us was a series of philosophical themes - grief, unconditional love, the relentless pursuit of justice - waiting to be shaped into a story," the Last of Us' creator Neil Druckmann said, via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/the-last-of-us-book-scripts-video-game-1236468201/">Variety</a>. "These scripts, written during the games' development, were meant to guide our team as we brought that world to life. They were never intended for public view - until now. For the first time, we're sharing them with you - hoping this rare glimpse brings you even closer to the heart of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and the world they inhabit."</p>
<p>Halley Gross, who co-wrote The Last of Us Part 2 with Druckmann, added: "Neil and I had the honour of leading this story, but the truth is, it only exists because of the remarkable team at Naughty Dog. Every moment was built by people who bring their full hearts and talent to the table. This compilation is a tribute to the studio and a celebration of what's possible when we create together."</p>
<p>Naughty Dog is really getting quite a bit of mileage out of its The Last of Us games. Along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">TV adaptation</a>, the developer also in the last couple of years has debuted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">souped-up PlayStation 5 Part 2 Remastered release</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-finally-gets-itself-a-pc-release-date">PC version of The Last of Us Part 2</a> (which followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-last-of-us-part-1-on-pc-what-we-think-so-far">PC release</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-the-last-of-us-part-1-the-digital-foundry-tech-review">remastered release</a> of the first game in the series).</p>
<p>The team also recently issued an update for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-play-the-last-of-us-part-2-in-yet-another-way-as-naughty-dog-releases-chronological-mode">allows you to play through the game in chronological order</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-want-yet-another-way-to-experience-the-last-of-us-games-theres-a-new-script-book-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But it's mostly about anime.</p>

    </div>

            <p>
Sony has whipped out its wallet and snapped up precisely 2.5 percent of publisher Bandai Namco as part of a "strategic partnership" that primarily appears to be focused on expanding audiences within the realm of anime and manga.
</p>
<p>
The news, of course, follows Sony's move to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">become FromSoftware owner Kadokawa's largest shareholder</a> last year. And while it might be tempting to conclude this new Bandai Namco is part of a nefarious scheme to lock FromSoftware in a PlayStation-shaped bunker, the reality probably isn't quite so Machiavellian.
</p>
<p>
Sony's decision to increase its shares in Kadokawa last December was - as with today's Bandai Namco deal - primarily about the anime market. In Kadokawa's case, it was said the increased partnership would allow Sony to adapt the company's IP (Kadokawa is a major name in anime publishing) into live-action film and TV dramas globally, as well as co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works, and more.
</p>
<p>
And it's a similar story with Bandai Namco. In a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/">joint statement</a> announcing Sony's acquisition of 16m shares in the company as part of a new "strategic partnership", the pair wrote, "Through this business alliance and Sony's investment in Bandai Namco... [we] will focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated."
</p>
<p>
This will involve implementing initiatives to expand the "works as well as products and services based on IP developed by Bandai Namco, leveraging Sony's strengths in areas such as the production and distribution of anime and other video content, as well as merchandising."
</p>
<p>
There was also talk of the companies "merging their strengths to create new and emotionally moving experiences for fans" in order to "maximise the value of IP" as part of the 68bn yen/$464m deal. There was not, however, any mention of a PlayStation-exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2.
</p>
<p>
Sony's recent anime-focused activity follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-completes-usd1bn-crunchyroll-buyout">$1bn purchase of streaming service Crunchyroll</a> in 2020. That deal, it said at the time, would create an "unprecedented opportunity to serve anime fans like never before and deliver the anime experience across any platform they choose, from theatrical, events, home entertainment, games, streaming, linear TV."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has finally been revealed officially, courtesy of a brand-new trailer premiered on YouTube. A legal disclaimer URL featured at the end of the trailer may have given away a release window too!
</p>
<p>The trailer itself shows in-engine footage, but not gameplay. You see all the Battlefield staples: tanks, helicopters, fighter jets, all blasting away at each other and demolishing buildings. The trailer sets up a private miltary force called Pax Armada too, which appears to the be antagonistic force in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>.
</p>
<p>The trailer started up with a in-engine camera feed where discussions can be heard about various modern war talk, different countries, whispers about who isn't present in the room, and quiet chatting about the upcoming statement from the President of the USA. This then led straight into the trailer.</p>

<p>The trailer ends with a date for an upcoming multiplayer reveal, which will take place on 31st July. You can wishlist the game now. In addition, the final shot of the trailer features a disclaimer that the game contains in-game purchases. </p>
<p>Typing in the disclaimer URL featured in this disclaimer takes you to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/game-disclaimers">a page on Battlefield 6's standard edition</a>. On this page you can read the following sentence on the standard edition pre-sell offers: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025.
