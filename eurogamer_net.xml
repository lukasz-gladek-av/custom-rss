            <p>Developer Hexworks has shared details on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a>'s PS5 Pro update.</p>
<p>As with games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it">Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</a>, Lords of the Fallen will benefit from that 'Enhanced' label on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro's release this week</a>.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen's case, this will see a 40 percent increase in pixel density. In addition, it will boast an enhanced Performance Mode, which means 1440p at 60fps (Upscaled to 4k). Quality Mode, meanwhile, will offer players 30fps at 4k.</p>

<p>As well as getting its game ready for the PS5 Pro, Hexworks has also released a patch for the base game. Patch 1.6 - as it is known - will include gameplay adjustments, steps to "further enrich the onboarding experience for new players" and a "more immersive" Umbral Realm, to name a few.</p>
<p>Hexworks specifically highlighted the below improvements, which arrive with Patch 1.6:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mob Density: </strong>Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a  smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from  stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few  fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed  via NG+ modifiers.)</li>
<li><strong>Ranged Enemies: </strong>We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct  instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li>
<li><strong>Jumping: </strong>Platforming in Pilgrim's Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making  jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li>
<li><strong>PvP Scaling:</strong> To elevate skill-based play in PvP, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics,  particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply  exclusively to PvP, so PvE players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li>
<li><strong>Attack Displacement: </strong>Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce  displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and  supporting your playstyle.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the team has said performance will be improved in some of Lords of the Fallen's more graphically challenging areas. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">Eurogamer's Lords of the Fallen review</a> criticised the game for its poor performance, but the developer has been steadily offering improvements on this.</p><p>Today's patch will leave players feeling more "empowered" on their journey, Hexworks said. Full notes can be found via <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1501750/announcements">Steam</a>. Lords of the Fallen is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTFv1.6&amp;utm_id=Lords+of+the+Fallen+v1.6">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/lords-of-the-fallen/9N3CJZ3HFHTF?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTF+v1.6&amp;utm_id=LOTF+v1.6">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lords-of-the-fallen/?utm_source=press+release&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;utm_campaign=LOTF+v1.6&amp;utm_id=LOTF+v1.6">PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro</a> from this Thursday.</p>

            <p>
Pokémon TCG Pocket, the new smartphone version of the classic Pokémon trading card game, looks to be off to a strong and lucrative start. 
</p>
<p>
A report into its launch by app store analytics firm AppMagic suggests the game has reached 12m downloads worldwide and earned $12.1m across its first four days, for an average of $3m every 24 hours (thanks, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-earning-over-3m-per-day-with-over-12m-banked-to-date/">MobileGamer.biz</a>).
</p>
<p>
45 percent of earnings so far come from Pokémon's home turf of Japan, with US the second-largest market, providing 25 percent of the game's app store revenue.

<p>
Using the same metrics, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> is reported to net around $1m per 24 hours - though the game also generates revenue outside of its app via various means, most notably its increasingly-prominent web-based storefront.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon TCG Pocket is heavily engineered around the opening of card packs, though you can also unlock the ability to play a faster-paced version of the traditional Pokémon card game too. 
</p>
<p>
Players get to open up to two card packs per day for free, if you build up enough "Pack Stamina", and can purchase further packs for real-world money. 
</p>
<p>
Further microtransactions exist to reduce the wait for new packs and cards, plus cosmetic options where you can customise your digital card folders, playmats and coins. 
</p>
<p>
"There's one inescapable truth about TCG Pocket though - it is free-to-play, and it wants your money," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn wrote after playtesting Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>. "It wants your money so badly in fact, you'd think it's been possessed by a Gimmighoul."
