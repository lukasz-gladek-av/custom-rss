            <p>Yesterday's Marvel Rivals update has seemingly wiped the ability to use mods on PC.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals has been in Season 0 since its release last month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-season-1-will-nerf-some-of-the-most-dominant-characters">yesterday the online hero shooter's first season launched</a>, bringing significant balance changes and the heroic Fantastic Four team: Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and the Thing.</p>
<p>Since the update rolled out, however, players are reporting that asset hash checking has stripped the ability to use mods, such as custom skins or FPS boosts.</p>

<p>Asset hash checking compares what you're running on your PC to what the servers <em>believes</em> your code should be running, and if it finds any differences - mods, in other words - the account could be banned.</p> <div>

<p>Whilst some lament the loss - including a lot of talk about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hy8pay/comment/m6jwd1z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Venom's "19-inch stalk"</a> - others are more ambivalent about the changes, <a href="https://x.com/DGetox/status/1877831137914921063">pointing out</a> that Marvel Rivals is a free-to-play game that relies on battle pass and skin sales to generate profit.</p>

<p>"NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>. "Its biggest impact is a renewed appreciation for the rivals that do it better." He awarded it two out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Festival, the concert-themed rhythm-action portion of Epic Games' free-to-play jack-of-all-trades juggernaut, is getting local co-op support next month - conjuring nostalgic memories of countless evenings spent twanging away in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a> with pals.
</p>
<p>
Not coincidentally, of course, Fortnite Festival is the work of Rock Band developer Harmonix (which Epic Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-acquires-rock-band-developer-harmonix">acquired back in 2021</a>) and is extremely reminiscent of the studio's beloved earlier titles, right down to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-developer-harmonixs-new-fortnite-music-mode-will-support-instrument-controllers">support for guitar-shaped plastic peripherals</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Epic has now revealed that, from Tuesday 14th January, Fortnite Festival will get a little closer to capturing the social spirit of those heady Rock Band days, by letting multiple players jam away in the comfort of the same room - but only on Xbox and PlayStation. The company hasn't shared much in the way of specifics just yet, but judging by the <a href="https://x.com/FNFestival/status/1877762481533165921">excessively elaborate, Snoop Dogg-starring trailer</a> it's released to announce the new feature, it'll support local co-op for up to four players, as well as the simultaneous use of two plastic guitars.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>GET THE BAND BACK TOGETHER ‚ÄºÔ∏è</p><p>Local multiplayer is coming to Fortnite Festival on Xbox and PlayStation January 14!  Stay *tuned* for more details üé∏ <a href="https://t.co/m5hzBmbCtw">pic.twitter.com/m5hzBmbCtw</a></p></div>‚Äî Fortnite Festival (@FNFestival) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNFestival/status/1877762481533165921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
This marks the first major new feature for Fortnite Festival this year, and follows Epic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-commits-to-rock-band-like-festival-musical-mode-support-through-2025-and-beyond">confirmation last December</a> that it would continue to support its rhythm game through "2025 and beyond". It made those assurances after revealing it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-waves-chequered-flag-on-rocket-racing-mode-themed-updates">no longer be releasing themed updates for Fortnite's Rocket Racing</a>, which has struggled to maintain player numbers since being introduced alongside Fornite Festival and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> in 2023.
</p><p>
The arrival of Fortnite Festival's local co-op support on 14th January coincides with the end of the mode's current Snoop Dogg-themed season and the start of the next, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">likely see Vocaloid popstar Hatsune Miku step in as the latest featured artist</a>.
