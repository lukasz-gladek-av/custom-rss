            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> has "enacted" over 23,000 "actions" against cheaters after rolling out a new system to find and detect players who use mouse and keyboard in console lobbies, a practice known as ximming.</p>
<p>While "enacted" doesn't necessarily mean all 23,000 accounts were banned outright, Blizzard says that brings the overall total of banned accounts to over 1m players.</p>

<p>"The new Mouse and Keyboard support will impact how we action users who previously used unapproved third-party peripherals to gain an advantage over players in the Controller Pool," Blizzard explained in a new <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24223576/">blog</a> post. "Bypassing the set restrictions in that pool with unapproved peripherals will be considered cheating and actions will be taken on your account.</p><p>"Previously, we deployed technology to help find and detect players who were using those peripherals on consoles. We enacted over 23,000 actions against players since that deployment. This included players who were directly using unapproved peripherals as well as players who grouped up with them to benefit from that unfair advantage."</p>
<p>Blizzard then admitted that it had to "adapt to new workarounds" but was now ready to "take more aggressive actions against those who try to circumvent the competitive integrity of our console players."</p>
<p>"We’ve rolled out new tech for Season 18 that should help us spot players that use unapproved peripherals faster and with more reliability," the post added. "We’re also laying down harsher consequences on users of unapproved peripherals, since the legitimate opportunity to compete using Mouse and Keyboard on an even playing field is now available, regardless of whether you own a PC or console."</p>
<p>Previously, the team would "warn and restrict" any offenders and send them to the PC Pool, especially for cheats playing at Competitive levels above Diamond.</p>
<p>Now, however, "continuing to use unapproved peripherals and devices in the Controller Pool will result in a full game account ban regardless of the player’s rank or mode".</p>
<p>The recent action has resulted in over one million accounts being banned from playing Overwatch 2. This includes players who used aimbots, wallhacks, and other cheats, as well as those who grouped up with known cheaters.</p>
<p>"While the effort to stop cheaters and the cheats they use is an ongoing effort, we want to reiterate our commitment to ensuring the outcome of every <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> match is determined by skill and passion, and not through unfair advantages," Blizzard added.</p>
<p>Aside from the Stadium update, Overwatch 2 Season 18 introduced significant changes, including heroes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuyang-revealed-as-new-hero-in-overwatch-2">Wuyang</a>, Pharah, Winston, and Brigitte, plus the Route 66 and London maps, new game modes, new All-Star rewards, Endorsements, and more.</p>

            <p>Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam.</p>
<p>Rumours began to swirl when Battlestate's head of studio, Nikita Buyanov, posted a captionless gif to X/Twitter over the weekend showing an old man delightedly holding down the steam button on his iron.</p>

<p>Definitive proof? Hardly, even if Buyanov were willing to troll his own playerbase. Fast-forward to today, though – 31st August – and it's confirmed: Escape from Tarkov is coming to Steam.</p> <div>

<p>The page has yet to go live on Valve's digital store, so we're yet to get any of the specific details, but Buyanov shared an image of the Steam logo superimposed on a Steam listing for Escape from Tarkov (see above), and wrote: "Yes! The page on Steam will be available soon. All the details later."</p>
<p>The Steam launch could coincide with another milestone for Battlestate – version 1.0 the tactical FPS will finally release on 15th November, 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-apologises-for-pve-mode-misstep-saying-it-did-not-foresee-such-a-reaction">Last year, Escape from Tarkov developer Battlestate apologised</a> after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-u-turns-on-decision-to-lock-exclusive-pve-mode-to-a-special-edition-following-blacklash">u-turned on a decision to lock an "exclusive" PvE mode to its €300 Unheard Edition</a> following player feedback, saying it is "very sorry that fans and the game community in general are experiencing these feelings".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will reportedly sell for around £17/$20/€20.</p>
<p>That's according to eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1n3hj7a/gamestop_listed_silksong_with_price/">spotted</a> that the highly anticipated sequel was listed on <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">Gamestop</a> (link since deleted) for $20.</p>
<p>Initially, it was thought this <em>had</em> to be a placeholder price, as the game has long been the <a href="https://gaminganalytics.info/gbwish_last">most wishlisted title on the Steam platform</a>. When players tried to purchase the game but couldn't complete checkout, this only strengthened the feeling the listing had to have been incorrect.</p>

<p>However, since then, noted and usually reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n496oj/billbilkun_hollow_knight_silksong_price_is_1999/">Dealabs leaker</a> Billbil-Kun has <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/hollow-knight-silksong-on-vous-devoile-le-prix-de-sa-version-pc-60443">all but confirmed the rumour</a>, revealing not just the Steam prices for Hollow Knight: Silksong, but also the price point on GOG.</p>
<p>According to the leaker's "recent research", Silksong will indeed retail for less than £20/$20/€20:</p>
<ul>
<li>UK: £16.75 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Europe: €19.50 (Steam) / €8.29 (GOG)</li>
<li>U.S.: $19.99 (Steam) / $19.99 (GOG)</li>
<li>Canada: $25.99 (Steam) / $27.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>Australia: $29.50 (Steam) / $30.19 (GOG)</li>
<li>New Zealand: $28.99 (Steam) / (GOG Unknown)</li>
<li>Japan: (Steam Unknown) / ¥2939 (GOG)</li>
</ul>
<p>The price points for console and Switch versions remain unknown. Dealabs did, however, add weight to rumours that there is no physical version of the game planned at this time.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will release on Thursday, 4th September 2025 for PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series. Yet contrary to what you may believe, Silksong hasn't been in development hell for that time, however – in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Team Cherry's developers say they were just having too much fun making it</a>.</p><p>The end of months of speculation has not been good news for all, of course; announcing the date so late in the game's development - a mere two weeks from release - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksongs-release-date-causes-delays-for-more-games-than-you-might-think">meant a slew of games which already had early September release dates suddenly found themselves in a difficult position</a>.</p>
