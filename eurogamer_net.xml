            <p>
The battle to reboot Capcom's Resident Evil franchise for the big screen is over, and Sony has been crowned the victor. But while the ink may still be fresh on the deal, Sony's wasting no time: it's already confirmed its new Resident Evil movie hits cinemas on 18th September 2026.
</p>
<p>
Word of a Resident Evil movie reboot first surfaced back in January, with Zach Cregger - writer and director of 2022's wonderfully unpredictable Barbarian - attached to the project. At the time, four studios - including Warners Bros. and Netflix - were reportedly vying for the rights to the lucrative franchise, but Sony (as <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-zach-cregger-sony-release-date-1236313985/">relayed by Deadline</a>) has now won out.
</p>
<p>
The kerfuffle for Resident Evil is perhaps not especially surprising given previous live-action movie adaptations collectively generated a staggering $1.2bn at the box office. And Sony's interest is <em>particularly</em> not surprising, seeing as it was a major beneficiary of all that money under its previous deal to inflict Paul W. S. Anderson's Resident Evil films upon the masses.
</p>
<p>
And this isn't Sony's first attempt at a reboot either. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-resident-evil-movie-reboot-is-called-resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city">also released 2021's underwhelming Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</a> - but while the studio's track record with the franchise isn't exactly encouraging, there's at least some reason to be optimistic. The fact Cregger is onboard to write and direct is an intriguing proposition, especially given his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-writer-zach-cregger-will-keep-adaptation-faithful-to-the-games">apparent keenness to keep his Resident Evil adaptation faithful to the games</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"I've been a rabid fan of these games for decades, and to be able to bring this amazing title to life is a true honor,‚Äù Cregger told Deadline following Sony's win. Constantin Film is producing and co-financing the movie, with PlayStation Productions also on board.
</p>
<p>
Will Sony's latest attempt at a reboot do justice to Capcom's esteemed - and let's be honest, utterly preposterous - survival horror series? With the next Resident Evil movie now pencilled in for a September 2026 release, we'll know soon enough.

            <p>
Frost Fatales - the winter version of Games Done Quick's all-women and femmes charity speedrunning event - returns this weekend for seven more days of fleet-fingered gaming feats.

</p>
<p>
Seven days and more than 60 speedruns later, this year's Frost Fatales comes to a close at 3:25am with SawaYoshi's Any% One-Handed speedrun of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a>. In between, you can expect a typically eclectic bedazzlement of swiftly performed entertainments, spanning everything from triple-A blockbusters and acclaimed indies to more leftfield curios.
</p>
<p>
You've got your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> Birth by Sleep Final Mix HD rubbing shoulders with Punch-Out!!, UFO 50's Barbuta, and Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. While the effervescent Princess Peach: Showtime makes way for the likes of Amensia: The Bunker, Clock Tower 3, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crow-country">Crow Country</a>, Backyard Baseball '97, Hylics, and more - as <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/55">detailed in this year's schedule</a>.
</p>
<p>
And if that sounds like the ideal way to spend the dying days of winter, speedrun fans can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">watch Frost Fatales 2025 as it happens on Twitch</a>, starting Sunday. This year's event will be raising money for the National Women's Law Center, a US non-profit that fights for women's and LGBTQ rights through initiatives that change laws, policy, and culture.
