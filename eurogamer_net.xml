            <p>Activision has announced the full suite of new additions coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> in its Season One update, which looks to be bringing a vast spread of new toys across all three game modes on the 4th December. It'll also let players skip the single player campaign and jump into the Warzone-style Endgame mode immediately.</p>
<p>Prior to Season One, players would have to complete the Black Ops 7 campaign before accessing the Endgame. Makes sense right? You'd want to know what the story is before hopping into the post-launch narrative vehicle which is the Endgame. Well, for those who want to farm out weapon cosmetics as fast as possible, you can skip past all the pesky narrative nonsense and get right into the action.</p>
<p>When you do you'll be facing a host of new world events, including a giant robot, and toxin-induced hallucinations. Later in the season you'll also be able to fight a VTOL aircraft that is, according to the official Season One blog post, "manifested by fear". It's a super scary VTOL, guys.</p>

<p>You'll also get new exotic skills to mess around with, and there'll be a Christmas-themed event near the end of the year to keep you festive. As for Black Ops 7 multiplayer, more than six new maps and modes are coming alongside a new scorestreak: the Deadeye Drone. Finally, multiplayer is gaining 12 returning loadout items from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> too which should mix things up as you journey through the prestige ranks.</p>
<p>To conclude, Black Ops 7 Zombies is getting a new round-based zombies map, new modes for both a narrative-led and challenge-focused experience, returning loadout items, and a festive-themed limited-time-event.</p>
<p>It all seems rather jam packed with engaging pursuits for every kind of Call of Duty fan. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-underperforms-on-steam-during-launch-weekend-but-does-that-mean-the-games-sold-badly">popularity of this Call of Duty is a bit of a mystery right now</a>, with the public data we can look at pointing to a less successful launch for the military FPS series than we've seen in recent years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european-sales-are-63-down-on-battlefield-6-and-50-down-on-black-ops-6">We do know the game is selling far less than Battlefield 6 in Europe so far, and is looking worse off than Black Ops 6 was in the same region</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">why not give Eurogamer's review a read</a>!</p>

            <p>Promising half-vampire, half-human role-playing game The Blood of Dawnwalker used AI during development to test spoken lines before hired actors came in to record them. Game director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz - formerly director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - told me this during a recent interview, in which he shared a fairly balanced take on AI use in general.</p>
<p>"We used AI for voices during the testing period of time before the recordings," Tomaszkiewicz told me, "because my experience from the previous projects was that you [understand] a lot more when you hear the voices, and we wanted to have it as soon as possible to test the game and iterate on it. And then when we decided the story was great and it worked, we started the proper recordings with the actors. This is the use of the AI we had in our company," he said, "and I think that it's quite reasonable.</p>
<p>"But on this subject," he added. "I think that AI should help people and AI shouldn't replace them. If we can use AI to make people's lives easier..." Here, he gave an example. He said his quality assurance team on Dawnwalker is currently combing the game's world for intersections between environment meshes to check they all line-up correctly, and that there aren't any holes where, presumably, players can fall through. Their time, he believes, could be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>"To be honest, I'd prefer to do it automatically - we have the tools for that; not AI but our own tool - and use the time of the people to tell me if the game is good," he said. "If the feel of the gameplay is proper. If the story is good and the dialogues: they understand it, they feel emotions and so on. This is the way we should use the skills of creative people.</p><p>"I'm not totally against AI," he added, "but it needs to evolve to the place where it will be the tool which helps us, like Google Translate, not something which steals the author rights and creates the graphics or the animations because it learns from the creations of people."</p>
<blockquote><em>"You need to have people who feel, who have this creative fire, who want to prove something"</em></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, he said, creative people will always be at the heart of a project. Replace them with AI and people will notice, because the human element will be absent. And it's that human element that's irreplaceable. "I don't believe that it will replace the creative people," Tomaszkiewicz said. "It can help, but not replace them. I don't feel that games created with only AI will have soul. I don't believe it. Really.</p>
<p>"I finished Dispatch recently," he went on, "which is my game of the year. I love this game. And I don't believe that AI could create something like this. It's not possible. You need to have people who feel, who have this creative fire, who want to prove something, who want to tell you a particular story and create emotions in these particular moments. A machine will not understand us as much."</p><p>Blood of the Dawnwalker is in development for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X, and scheduled for a release sometime next year. It follows the adventures of Coen, a recently not-quite-turned vampire, who has 30 days and 30 nights to rescue his family. But how he goes about it - and where he goes in the world - is up to you; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">there is no main quest in The Blood of Dawnwalker to guide you</a>.</p>

            <p>An anthology series based on Ubisoft's Far Cry games has been announced.</p>
<p>The FX series will feature a new cast and setting, with the team promising "the exact level of chaos your therapist told you to avoid". That sounds up Vaas' street, or beach, anyway!</p>
<p>Attached to the upcoming Far Cry project is Rob Mac (née McElhenney), known to many as Mac from Always Sunny in Philadelphia, a show he created and co-developed with Charlie Day (the voice of Luigi in the recent Mario Movie adaptations) and Glenn Howerton. Mac will produce the series alongside Alien Earth creator Noah Hawley.</p>

<p>"FX has had magnificent partnerships with Rob Mac and Noah Hawley for a combined six series and 32 seasons of television, and we couldn't be more excited that they are teaming up for Far Cry," said Nick Grad, President, FX Entertainment. "I have no doubt that they will tell this story in a way that is original, gripping and wildly entertaining. We also want to thank our partners at Ubisoft for entrusting us with this beloved property."</p><p>"Getting to work alongside Noah Hawley is a dream realised," Mac added. "Ubisoft has been remarkably generous, entrusting us with one of the most iconic video-game worlds ever created. And through it all, my FX family continues to lift me up with their constant belief and support."</p>
<p>"What I love about the Far Cry game franchise is it's an anthology. Each game is a variation of a theme, the same way each season of Fargo is a variation on a theme," Hawley furthered. "To create a big action show that can change from year to year, while always exploring the nature of humanity through this complex and chaotic lens is a dream come true. I'm excited to partner with Rob and bring our shared irreverent, ambitious sensibility to the screen."</p>
<p>In addition to a producer role, Mac - who also played Ian Grimm on comedy series Mythic Quest - will star in the Far Cry series, but as who remains for now unknown.</p>

<p>Word of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-far-cry-tv-show-that-doesnt-shy-away-from-the-darkest-most-absurd-parts-of-humanity-is-reportedly-in-development-at-fx">FX's Far Cry series first leaked back in August of this year</a>. Who leaked it? Well, Ubisoft itself, with the company accidentally posting about the show on its own site before quickly fixing its error and redirecting users back to the main page again.</p>
<p>Along with Far Cry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-splinter-cell-animated-series-arrives-next-month-but-theres-no-sign-of-a-new-game">Ubisoft also recently released an anime series based on its Splinter Cell games</a>.</p>
