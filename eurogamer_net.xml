            <p>
A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite">Sniper Elite</a> battle royale spin-off has reportedly been cancelled, after Chinese gaming giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> pulled funding.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sniper-elites-battle-royale-game-has-been-canceled-as-tencent-pulls-funding/">Insider Gaming</a>, which states that Project Archipelago: Sniper Battle Royale was recently scrapped following public playtests over the summer. 
</p>
<p>
That report claims Tencent got cold feet on the project after seeing the high-profile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">flop of PlayStation's recent live-service bid Concord</a>.

<p>
Sniper Elite developer Rebellion declined to comment on the report. Eurogamer has contacted it and Tencent for more.
</p>
<p>
British developer Rebellion announced "pre-alpha access" to Project Archipelago via a three-day playtest back in mid-August this year, though has been quiet on the game since. 
</p>
<p>
A trailer for the project showed squads of snipers picking off enemies from afar, in rusted, near-future environments that featured a mix of weathered contemporary buildings but also sci-fi-looking airships.
</p>
<p>
It's understood that there have been no job losses as a result of the cancellation, with developers moved over to the next main Sniper Elite game, Sniper Elite: Resistance, which is due to launch on 28th January 2025.
</p>
<p>"Currently, we are still in the process of learning," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">Sony boss Hiroki Totoki said this month of Concord's launch and sudden removal from sale</a>. "And basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The game is already available on mobile devices and Nintendo Switch, but the PC version will bring a host of visual improvements.</p>
<p>It will launch in Steam Early Access on 27th January 2025, but <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/pc-announcement">sign-ups are now open</a> for two Steam playtests in December and January ahead of release.</p>

<p>As the above trailer reveals, on PC Star Wars: Hunters will have visually enhanced battlefields, featuring higher resolution textures and shadows, and higher rendering quality.</p>
<p>Keyboard, mouse, and wireless controller support will all be included.</p>
<p>"The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC," said Zynga's executive vice president of games Yaron Leyvan. "This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time."</p>
<p>Zynga is best known for its mobile and Facebook games, notably Farmville, CSR Racing, and Words with Friends.</p>
<p>The company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-publisher-take-two-completes-127bn-takeover-of-farmville-developer-zynga">taken over by GTA publisher Take-Two</a> back in 2022 for $12.7bn.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zyngas-star-wars-hunters-finally-arrives-in-june-after-years-of-delays">Star Wars: Hunters was released on Switch, iOS and Android</a> on 4th June following multiple delays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mac Walters, the veteran writer and producer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for almost two decades, has announced a "pause" in operations at his new AAA game studio, Worlds Untold. 
</p>
<p>
Its team had been developing a near-future action adventure game set "in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration", backed by investment cash from Chinese game giant NetEase.
</p>
<p>
Last night, however, Walters announced that the studio was now seeking "a new partner to help bring our vision to life", with staff members now looking for work elsewhere in the meantime. 
</p>
<p>
"This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I'm deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we've had together at Worlds Untold," Walters wrote in a post on Worlds Untold's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/">LinkedIn</a> page.
</p>
<p>
"While we're pausing for now, this isn't goodbye - there's more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-mac-walters-leaves-bioware-after-19-years">Walters confirmed his departure from BioWare in January 2023</a>, after 19 years working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jade-empire">Jade Empire</a> and then Mass Effect as a lead writer for the franchise.
</p>
<p>
Worlds Untold also hosts Dragon Age alum Elizabeth Lehtonen as the studio's head of production, and concept artist Ramil Sunga as its head of art.
</p>
<p>
"As someone who's been at the heart of building out new IPs in the past, I recognise the challenges, but also the opportunities with creating worlds from the ground up," Walters <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-mass-effect-lead-writer-says-new-narrative-focused-studio-will-avoid-painting-ourselves-in-a-corner">told Eurogamer last year</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In a statement at the time, NetEase said it hoped Worlds Untold would build franchises "with depth and possibility that can't be contained in a single game, or even a single medium".
</p>
<p>
Walters has discussed his tenure working on Mass Effect at length with Eurogamer on several occasions - in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-mass-effect-from-the-birth-of-a-trilogy-to-andromeda-and-beyond">in-depth interview with our Bertie on dreaming up plans for an entire trilogy of games</a>, and with myself on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plotting-a-course-how-mass-effect-3-brought-the-trilogy-to-a-close">how BioWare wrestled its trilogy of storylines and characters to a close</a>.

            <p>Balatro, the indie roguelike inspired by poker, has generated almost $4.4m on mobile alone since its release in September.</p>
<p>That's according to data from AppMagic (thanks <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/balatro-nears-44m-on-mobile-amid-a-sudden-spending-surge/">PocketGamer.biz</a>), which reveals the mobile game made a million dollars in its first week across the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>Balatro was first released in February on PC and console, but its popularity has surged following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-out-on-mobile-later-this-month">release on mobile platforms</a>.</p>

<p>What's particularly interesting is its release as a premium game for an upfront £9.99, unlike so many free-to-play (with microtransactions) games on mobile.</p>
<p>Balatro is also part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>, meaning even more players have played the game through Apple's subscription, though it's unclear how much money its inclusion here has generated.</p>
<p>On launch day, Balatro made $162k and then peaked at $200k a week after launch on 29th September, resulting in that million dollar first week.</p>
<p>Since then sales have declined but its inclusion as a Game of the Year nominee (among others) at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">this year's The Game Awards</a> has caused a resurgence in sales in the last couple of weeks. This resulted in the game's second highest earning week to date, generating $727k.</p>
<p>Developer Localthunk confirmed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1fkp6m0/balatro_mobile_and_iap/">reddit</a> ahead of Balatro's mobile release it would not have microtransactions or "predatory monetisation".</p>
<p>The developer also spoke out, back in March, about the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama"> game's rating drama</a> after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'". Said Localthunk: "I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, Vectorman, and Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs are now available for Expansion Pack members.</p>

<p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, released in 1993, followed the first ToeJam &amp; Earl game from 1991, continuing the adventures of its whacky alien protagonists. However, it's a straightforward side-scrolling platformer where the previous game was inspired by Rogue.</p>
<p>Vectorman, meanwhile, was released in 1995 and was notable for its pre-rendered 3D models, rivalling those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> on the SNES.</p>
<p>Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs, meanwhile, is an earlier game from the platform: a top-down shooter adapted by Sega from the Capcom arcade game.</p>

<p>As shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1h01lva/new_app_update_confirms_new_promo_cards_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>, the following Pokémon will feature and all have new card artwork: Jigglypuff, Onix, Greninja, Haunter, Bulbasaur, and Magnemite.</p>
<p>The latter two are particularly important as they reportedly will be the focus of the forthcoming Wonder Pick event. That Onix artwork looks a little interesting though.</p>
<p>These cards will all feature in a Venusaur PvE event set to begin on 29th November and run until 13th December. Much like the Lapras Ex event, players will battle against AI in solo battles for the rewards.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has already proven incredibly popular since its launch last month - in its first three weeks it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget to also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-forget-to-spend-your-pokemon-tcg-pocket-pack-points">spend your pack points</a>: these are earned by opening booster packs and can be spent on specific cards, but they have an unknown expiry date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
