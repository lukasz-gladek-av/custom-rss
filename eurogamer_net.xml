            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> 2 developer Spiders is taking the end of the year as an opportunity to "reflect on our journey so far" and said it is "committed to building a great game alongside [the community] and listening to your invaluable feedback".</p>
<p>In an update posted to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/554602728738784050">Steam</a>, Spiders said "a lot has happened since the start of Early Access", but the team is "thrilled" about progress to date, despite it being a challenging experience that has seen Update 0.2 delayed with still no firm release date.</p>

<p>"[The decision to delay Update 0.2] allows us to focus on implementing significant improvements and fixes based on your feedback," the team said. "These include the combat system - which is as important to you as it is to us - the UI, character customisation, optimisation, and many other aspects."</p>
<p>This means Update 0.2 will not introduce a slew of changes, but instead the improvements will be "implemented gradually" over time.</p>
<p>"We wish we could provide a release date, but we would rather wait until we're certain," the team added. "What we can promise is that our priority remains delivering a game that meets your expectations and takes your feedback into account."</p><p>The update also explained that Spiders was working behind the scenes to address issues with Alivda's voice lines, and whilst the original voice actor was unable to reprise the role, it was working with a new artist to get the lines re-recorded and switched in "the next update".</p>
<p>"Ensuring your voices shape this journey has always been the goal of Early Access," the update concluded.</p>
<p>Shortly after Greedfall 2 released in early access on Steam, the Greedfall team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-is-addressing-two-important-subjects-combat-and-character-customisation">said the early access launch had been "exciting", but acknowledged improvements were needed</a>, including improving the drop rate, adjusting AI behaviours, and making dialogue scenes "less blurry".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Epic Games has signed a deal with European telecommunications company Telefónica to pre-install the Epic Games Store on all its new Android devices.</p>
<p>This means that new Android Telefónica customers in Spain, Spanish-speaking Latam, Germany, and the UK will have access to Epic Games' suite of games right out of the box in a move to "make <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and the Epic Games Store more accessible on millions of Telefónica Android devices".</p>

<p>"Players will now be able to more easily download Fortnite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league-sideswipe">Rocket League Sideswipe</a> as well as third party games in the future," Epic <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/telefonica-and-epic-games-bring-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-telefonica-devices">said</a>. "This is just the beginning, and over the next year the companies plan to expand the partnership and bring more benefits to mobile players across the Telefónica network."</p><p>Epic said this new "strategic alliance" will provide Android players with "a more competitive ecosystem [...] empowering them with a choice beyond the conventional app marketplaces". It follows Apple's decision back in August 2020 to boot Fortnite from the App Store after Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">deliberately circumvent</a> contractually mandated App Store payment mechanisms within the game, kicking off Epic boss Tim Sweeney's public <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-boss-pledges-more-legal-action-as-supreme-court-dismisses-apple-lawsuit-appeals">war with Apple in US courts</a>.</p>
<p>"Thanks to our partnership with Telefónica, players will now be able to access the Epic Games Store, Fortnite and soon games from third party developers directly on their Android device," said Michael Modon, senior director of growth partnerships for Epic Games. "We look forward to expanding our collaboration with Telefónica to bring even more benefits to players."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-commits-to-rock-band-like-festival-musical-mode-support-through-2025-and-beyond">Epic Games confirmed it would continue to support Fortnite Festival</a>, the game's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a>-style mode developed by Harmonix, for the forseeable future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
