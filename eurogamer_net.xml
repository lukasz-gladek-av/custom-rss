            <p>
Arcane fans have a five-minute animated treat to enjoy today, in the shape of a new story cinematic released by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> maker Riot Games. 
</p>
<p>
The video is primarily designed to showcase Noxus, the setting for League of Legends' new season which begins tomorrow, and the home of prominent character Mel Medarda.
</p>
<p>
But the video is simultaneously also a continuation of Mel's storyline from Arcane itself, and seems to set up what we may see next in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-cinematic-universe-to-expand-with-three-more-league-of-legends-animated-series">Arcane's upcoming Noxus-based continuation</a>. And if you need further reason to watch, the cinematic was created in partnership with Fortiche, the talented French animation house behind Arcane. Here it is:

<p>
First off, we can tell this is absolutely set after Arcane's second season due to Mel's new golden tattoos she acquires during its storyline. 
</p>
<p>
Here, we also get a proper look at LeBlanc, leader of the Black Rose group, who popped up within Arcane's second season but stayed largely disguised. She's seen here chatting with Vladimir, another League of Legends champion, about some unscrupulous-sounding plans for the Noxian empire.
</p><p>Following the conclusion of Arcane, showrunner Christian Linke confirmed the series would be followed by three additional shows featuring other locations within the League of Legends world. The first, set in Noxus, began production a year ago - and today's cinematic almost feels like a first trailer for that. Other series will then feature the regions of Demacia and Ionia.
</p>
<p>"We're really going wide, we're looking at every region and we really now have the ability to build a slate to tell many more stories - and continue some of them," Linke said previously.</p>
<p>If you haven't watched Arcane yet, it remains one of the best video game adaptations of all time and requires zero prior knowledge regarding League of Legends itself. Its first season is flawless, while its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">second was marred slightly from pacing issues due it cramming so many story threads in</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-film-gets-positive-update-more-than-10-years-after-its-director-was-first-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>10 years after he was first attached to the project, It and The Flash director Andr√©s Muschietti says he still has plans for Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The Shadow of the Colossus film has been, it is fair to say, a long time coming. We first got wind of an adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-in-works">all the way back in 2009</a>, when it was suggested that creator Fumito Ueda would be involved in some capacity. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-developing-shadow-of-the-colossus-movie">Chronicle director Josh Trank then joined the project in 2012</a>, but this still didn't seem to kick the film into any sort of gear. The following year, Sony then hired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-hires-hanna-writer-for-shadow-of-the-colossus-film">Hanna writer Seth Lochhead to pen the script for the adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, it was then revealed Trank had left the project to head to a galaxy far, far away instead (nothing sinister, just Star Wars). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-now-helmed-by-mama-director">Muschietti was announced to be taking over the reins from Trank</a>. But, like I said, that was in 2014. So, it has been over a decade since Muschietti was first brought on to direct the still non-existent Shadow of the Colossus film.</p>

</figure>
<p>And yet there is still hope, despite a very long period of absolutely no news whatsoever. Muschietti has now said he still has plans for the adaptation, and there is a script. In a conversation with programme <a href="https://youtu.be/Tugk5mzMHqM?t=2670">"La Baulera del Coso"</a> on Radio TU, Muschietti assured listeners the film was not "an abandoned project by any means" (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-is-alive-and-has-a-script/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"I'm not a big gamer, but Shadow of the Colossus seems to me a masterpiece and I played it several times," Muschietti said. "The film has been in development for 10 years and now the possibility of making it is opening up."</p>
<p>Muschietti stated he likes the project's script "very much", but admitted there were still a number of hurdles that needed to be sorted before the film could really get going. Namely, the financial side of things.</p>
<p>"Shadow of the Colossus is a cult game, but to make a good film, there is a studio that puts the numbers and says how much it is worth to give the director $200m, $150m, or $100m," he said. "There are different versions of the film, and obviously, I want them to give me $200m, but this is another factor to take into account."</p>
<p>So, I guess with this update, it is now a case of once again waiting to see if Muschietti gets the funds he hopes for, and then perhaps the Shadow of the Colossus adaptation will finally begin filming.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Colossus is not the only PlayStation IP currently slated for a film release. Just yesterday, the company announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">adaptations of both Helldivers 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. Meanwhile, its Until Dawn film is set to release this April, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">new cast of characters taking center stage in a brand new story</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Though available already in other regions prior to the film's release in December, in the UK the meals will be available from today until 18th February.</p>
<p>The included toy also differs. In the US the meals include a plastic character figure in a rolling wheel, while in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHenBg5IGyg">UK it's fabric balls with character faces</a>.</p>

<p>Those characters are Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Shadow, as well as (<em>slight </em>spoiler!) Super Sonic and Super Shadow.</p>

</span></p><p>Of course, this is far from the first time McDonalds has featured Sonic-themed toys in its Happy Meals.</p>
<p>In 1995 a promotion was launched to celebrate Mega Drive game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - I distinctly remember never receiving a Sonic toy and instead repeatedly getting a terrible Tails that wouldn't fly.</p>
<p>Other collaborations include mini handheld games in the 00s made by Fisher-Price, as well as a set of toys in conjunction with the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a> film.</p>

            <p>Classic FM is launching a new video game music radio series presented by Minecraft YouTuber DanTDM.</p>
<p>Next Level with DanTDM launches on Saturday 11th January at 9pm for an hour, and will run each week until Easter.</p>
<p>The first episode will focus on legendary soundtracks from games such as The Legend of Zelda, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, The Elder Scrolls, and of course Minecraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/dantdm-next-level-video-game-music-series/">Classic FM</a> has championed video game music for quite some time, with entries in its Hall of Fame from 2012. It then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-fms-video-game-music-show-is-back-for-a-second-series-in-november">launched High Score in 2017</a>, a radio series presented by BAFTA-award-winning composer Jessica Curry, who also co-founded Everybody's Gone to the Rapture studio The Chinese Room.</p>
<p>It seems clear, though, the radio service is aiming for a younger audience with the hiring of Daniel Middleton, aka DanTDM.</p>
<p>The YouTuber has 29 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw">his channel</a>, with more than 20bn views across his online content.</p>
<p>"Teenage me wouldn't be able to believe I have my own radio show!" he said. "Having studied music production at university and then worked in video games for the past 15 years, being given a show that celebrates the meeting of these two worlds feels totally surreal.</p>
<p>"Classic FM is such an iconic station and I'm really grateful and excited to have been given this opportunity."</p> <div>

<p>"Across three months, he will not only showcase the greatest video game music to our loyal listeners, but with Dan at the controls, we're looking forward to welcoming VGM fans to Classic FM for the first time too," added Classic FM managing editor Philip Noyce. "We have always championed new forms of classical music, from film scores to gaming soundtracks, so I'm pleased to announce this next chapter in our support of video game music."</p><p>DanTDM has recently been involved with charity work, <a href="https://x.com/dantdm/status/1859288096098898244">donating gaming carts to Great Ormond Street Hospital</a> for Children.

            <p>Sony's upcoming Until Dawn film adaptation will feature both a new cast of characters and a new story.</p>
<p>This titbit was shared during a presentation at CES by Sony's president of film division Screen Gems Ashley Brucks, who stated that while the film would - clearly - be different in some ways to the original Until Dawn game, it would still respect the series' source material.</p>
<p>"The key to [successfully] adapting these games comes down to one thing: respecting the source material," Brucks said (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-features-a-new-story-and-cast-of-characters">IGN</a>). "Our close collaboration with PlayStation Productions gives us and our filmmakers the advantage of working directly with the creators of the game."</p>
<p>The Sony exec said it was a "careful balance of trying to identify and incorporate what the fans love about the game and the experience as well as offering something fresh and exciting to entice newcomers".</p>
<p>"In adapting Until Dawn, filmmaker David F. Sandberg, who is a big fan of the widely acclaimed game, took the essence of what makes the game great and selected elements we think are the most important to the fans and paid homage to it in the right way," Brucks continued. "We then built out Until Dawn's universe, using the core premise of a group of friends who encounter a variety of terrifying threats to tell a new story that is truly visceral and horrifying."</p>

<p>Actor Peter Stromare, who is said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-sees-peter-stormare-reprise-his-role-as-dr-hill">reprising his role as psychiatrist Dr Hill in Until Dawn's adaptation (so, perhaps there is at least one returning character after all)</a>, added the film will "honour the spirit of the game".</p><p>"I have been lucky to be part of Until Dawn since the original, incredible, super terrifying game, and what's why I'm so excited to be part of this film, because the whole thing is a love letter to horror, and it completely honours the spirit of the game," Stormare said.</p>
<p>"The movie is going to be full of fresh characters and victims in a brand new story loaded with twists, so whether you're a longtime fan or discovering it for the first time, get ready for Until Dawn like you've never seen it before."</p>
<p>The Until Dawn film is set to arrive later this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-horror-until-dawns-live-action-movie-adaptation-arrives-next-april">on 25th April</a>.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, the recently released PS5 remake introduced a new ending for Until Dawn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">which hints towards a sequel</a> (please be aware of story spoilers for Until Dawn if you follow the link).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We are deeply disturbed by the recent reports surrounding Brandoville Studios," an Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer. "We strongly condemn all forms of abuse, and our thoughts are with the affected employees."</p>

<p>Yesterday a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horrific-abuse-of-workers-at-indonesian-external-development-studio-revealed-in-new-report">report from People Make Games detailed allegations of abuse by Brandoville commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai</a>, who ran day-to-day operations of the studio.</p>
<p>Before its closure, the studio provided art and animation support for games like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Age of Empires 4.</p>
<p>However, reports allege from 2019 to the studio's closure in 2024, Lai abused multiple employees. This ranged from imposing a strict work schedule and daily Christian worship, to forcing an employee to write lines like a schoolchild, humiliating her in front of colleagues, and demanding a video of her slapping herself a hundred times as punishment.</p>
<p>Other abuse includes controlling the finances of employees and overworking a pregnant employee, whose prematurely born son sadly died after four months in intensive care.</p>
<p>You can watch the full report in the video above, though be aware it contains harrowing content and footage.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has also contacted Age of Empires publisher Microsoft, though a response is yet to be issued.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch next month, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">delay in November</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
