            <p>The latest UK charts for physical video game sales are here, and this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has punched its way to the top spot.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1946977090487923167">The Game Business' Chris Dring</a>, physical sales for DK's latest outing were three times that of Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze on the original Switch. Dring also noted that Donkey Kong Bananza sold half of what Super Mario Odyssey did on its launch, but it is worth bearing in mind that when Odyssey released in 2017, the Switch had already been available for a little while. Additionally, Odyssey came out in October rather than July, when game sales are typically less ardent.</p>
<p>While digital sales are generally on the rise, and of course many such as myself will have purchased Bananza this way, <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1947064492627546281">Dring added many Nintendo owners still prefer physical media</a>. </p>
<p>"A brilliant core mechanic and clever design twists make Bananza a delightfully sticky 3D platform adventure topped off with a sweet central character relationship," our Alex wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Eurogamer's Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, awarding Nintendo's newest Switch 2 release four stars.</p>

            <p>Amazon's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> series is being helmed by many of those also involved in the service's acclaimed Fallout show.</p>
<p>The first season of Fallout - which starred Ella Purnell as the wide-eyed and somewhat naive vault dweller Lucy, and Walton Goggins as the rather charismatic noseless Ghoul - debuted in April last year. On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">the adaptation was a huge hit for Amazon</a>, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>.</p>
<p>So, what has all this got to do with Mass Effect? Well, in November of last year it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">confirmed Mass Effect was officially getting a TV adaptation at Amazon</a>, with Fast &amp; Furious 9 scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties. Along with Casey, though, fans have just this weekend noticed that a number of the production team from Fallout are also going to be working on Mass Effect.</p>

<p>This little nugget of information was tucked away in an Instagram post shared by Casey last November, which <a href="https://x.com/WeAreMassEffect/status/1946667243858731420">has since resurfaced</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm working on a Mass Effect show for Amazon. We're greenlit to start our writer's room at the top of 2025. Doing this right is and has been top priority for nearly two years now (though we paused for the strike last year)," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCIXbiuSR5R/?igsh=a2IydzBvYmVwNGFp">Casey wrote back in November last year</a>. "We have a great pilot script and series outline, the team that Amazon has in place (same team as #fallout including the fantastic @scottfarris) is incredible. Standby for further updates. This is gonna be the next year/two years of my life. And it'll be special."</p>
<p>Scott Farris is a senior development executive at Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video, and has been with the company for over a decade.</p>
<p>"As one of the company's earliest hires, Scott was a founding member of its original scripted drama team and played a key role in launching marquee series such as The Man in the High Castle, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and Jack Ryan," reads <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-farris-16664a27/">Farris' LinkedIn page</a>.</p>
<p>"Over his tenure, Scott has helped guide the development and production of Amazon's most ambitious global series - most recently including Fallout, developed with Jonah Nolan, which became the studio's most commercially successful series to date and earned 16 Emmy nominations in its first season.</p>
<p>"Some exciting upcoming projects include an adaptation of Stephen King's Carrie with Mike Flanagan, the highly anticipated Fourth Wing, based on the bestselling romantasy series, and an adaptation of the multi-billion-dollar video game franchise Mass Effect."</p>

<p>In addition, last month it was announced that Doug Jung - known for his work on the upcoming Chief of War and as a co-writer for Star Trek Beyond - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-trek-beyond-co-writer-joins-mass-effect-tv-series-as-a-showrunner">had joined Amazon's Mass Effect TV series as a showrunner</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, details of the Mass Effect adaptation for now are quite limited, but we do know former Witcher Henry Cavill at one time had an interest in the project. Back in February 2021, Cavill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-teases-secret-project-that-appears-to-be-related-to-mass-effect">snapped alongside a script</a> apparently related to Mass Effect. Then, in December of that year, not long after Amazon was said to be nearing a deal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-would-love-to-discuss-being-in-the-mass-effect-tv-series">Cavill casually revealed he'd "love to have a conversation" about it</a>. However in the time since then, Cavill has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">confirmed to be involved with Amazon's Warhammer adaptation</a>, so it is likely things have changed.</p>
<p>As for Fallout, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/walton-goggins-celebrates-wrapping-fallout-season-two-by-peeling-off-his-skin">the second season wrapped filming earlier this year</a>, and Goggins has already assured fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">it will blow the first season out of the water</a>. New cast members reported to be joining Goggins and co. for Fallout season two include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-reportedly-adds-marvel-actor-kumail-nanjiani-to-its-cast">Kumail Nanjiani as "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel"</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Macaulay Culkin as "a crazy genius-type character"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Chinese Room, the British studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, has gone independent from previous owners Sumo Digital following a management buyout.</p>
<p>The Brighton-based studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumo-buys-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-maker-the-chinese-room">bought by Sumo Digital back in 2018</a>, which was acquired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> in January 2022 in a deal worth around £919m.</p>
<p>Now, The Chinese Room will continue developing original games independently, following its success with oil rig horror game Still Wakes the Deep that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">won the BAFTA for New Intellectual Property</a> at this year's awards, as well as both performer awards.</p>

<p>"This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision," said studio director Ed Daly.</p>
<p>"This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">Sumo Digital announced it would refocus</a> on "development services for partners", which would "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people". The news followed layoffs in June 2024, where 15 percent of the company were let go.</p>
<p>Sumo Digital put The Chinese Room up for sale earlier this year, but it was likely the studio would be sold to an overseas buyer. This management buyout therefore allows The Chinese Room to remain as an independent British studio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Still Wakes the Deep publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-publisher-confirms-small-number-of-layoffs-as-its-sold-to-investment-firm">Secret Mode confirmed a "small number" of layoffs</a> earlier this year as it was sold to an investment firm.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room's next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">worked on with Paradox Interactive</a>. It's then working on two further new original projects.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 was previously aiming for a first half of 2025 release, but was delayed back in March. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-troubled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-another-delay">now aiming for an October launch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-goes-independent-to-continue-focus-on-original-projects]]></content:encoded>
