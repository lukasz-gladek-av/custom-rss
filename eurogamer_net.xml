            <p>Rocksteady has released the final piece of content for its beleaguered live-service game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>.</p>
<p>Back in December, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">studio confirmed the fourth season would be the game's last</a>, and now its final chapter has been released. Season four, chapter eight went live last night, and in the process wrapped up the story of Harley Quinn and her fellow band of misfits as they sought to stop the conniving Brainiac from causing mishap here, there and everywhere.</p>
<p>It also gave players clarification on exactly what was going on with DC's heroes, such as Batman. <strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League season four, episode eight below</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The final chapter of the game closes with a 2D animated cinematic narrated by Harley Quinn, revealing that - shocker - those members of the Justice League that were popped off earlier in the game were in fact clones. So yes, the actual Batman is still alive and well. In fact, it is the caped crusader who delivers that final blow to Brainiac. The mini bombs that were implanted in the Suicide Squad's heads at the start of the game are then disabled, and Brainiac gets delivered to Waller.</p>
<p>However, many players are, alas, pretty disappointed by how the ending of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ultimately played out.</p>
<p>"What was the point of the game if they are all alive," reads one comment on a video showcasing the final scenes. Another added: "Because of some small clues, the Justice League not actually being dead was teased since the launch of the game. However this still feels cheap as hell."</p><p>Some are more forgiving than others, though. "Honestly that's all I care about is seeing (Batman Alive)," one wrote. Another reasoned given some of the backlash Rocksteady faced early on in the game's life, bringing the Justice League back from the supposed dead was a good move.</p>
<p>You can check out the ending of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League below.</p>

<p>While it won't be receiving any new content from here on, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will still remain playable in both online and the recently released offline mode, Rocksteady has said.</p>
<p>"All online features will continue to be available after Season 4, so players will still be able to enjoy co-op with friends, as well as all previous seasonal/episodic content. An offline mode will also be available as part of the Season 4 update, giving players the option to experience the main campaign and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection," reads the season's <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">FAQ page</a>. The developer added any remaining LutherCoin will "continue to be available after Season 4", while also confirming the in-game store will also continue to function.</p>

<p>Soon after release, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. A report then followed, which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>

            <p>NetEase has confirmed Marvel Rivals will receive a new hero every month and a half, but won't be adding enforced roles.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen was asked about the cadence of heroes joining the game.</p>
<p>"Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes," said Chen. "We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves. The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero. We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community."</p>

<p>Chen also discussed why the team has not included enforced role lock - setting a limit on what class types can be in a team, for a balanced spread of healers, tanks, attackers - which is something the community wishes to change.</p>
<p>It appears the team won't be altering this, but will instead provide new possibilities with the team-up mechanic.</p>
<p>"At its core, it's really about the game balance," said Chen. "So, what we want to offer is more line-up or more team comp possibilities through our hero design and our team-up mechanic. So, we'll be taking a little bit more of a Marvel-inspired approach.</p><p>"It's all about giving the players the freedom to experiment and find their unique strategies, as we've seen in many games and streams. Post-launch, people have been exploring an indefinite amount of team compositions, and we're excited about what's coming, we believe no role queue will lead to a richer gaming experience for everyone."</p>
<p>Game balance will also continue to be scrutinised. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-season-1-will-nerf-some-of-the-most-dominant-characters">Season One has brought a number of balance changes</a> to nerf some of the most popular characters, as NetEase has released a Hero Hot List to show the most frequently chosen heroes.</p>
<p>"After the launch, we've been keeping a close eye on the game's environment and balance," said Chen. "Moving forward, we will be looking at hero pick rates and win rates in different scenarios. Once we have some more detailed analysis and through thoughtful consideration, we'll definitely make necessary balances and adjustments.</p>
<p>"It's all about creating a good experience for our players. It hasn't been that long since our launch, so we're going to continue to monitor everything and make sure everything feels right."</p>
<p>The hero shooter's first season also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-update-kills-mods-removing-cheats-skins-and-19-inches-of-venom">briefly put an end to mods on PC</a>, to prevent custom skins, FPS boosts and potential cheats. However, modders quickly found a way to use them once again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following the launch of last year's well-received Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars remaster, developer Revolution Software has teased a similar "reforged" treatment for the beloved point-and-click adventure's 1997 sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-2-smoking-mirror">Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-gets-september-release-date">Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars Reforged</a> took the original 1996 series instalment - in which American tourist George Stobbart teams up with photo-journalist Nicole Collard to unearth a global conspiracy - and gently reinvigorated it with 4K backgrounds, re-animated sprites, enhanced audio, and more.
</p>
<p>
The end result - which released for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation last September (with a Switch version arriving a little later) - was positively received among fans, and Revolution has now hinted it's getting ready to give Broken Sword 2 a similar makeover.

<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/revolution-software-teases-development-of-broken-sword-2-the-smoking-mirror-reforged">GameWatcher</a>, Revolution Software boss (and Broken Sword designer) Charles Cecil ended the studio's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2nhvPuhXyc">recent Christmas recap video</a> by rifling through concept art created for Broken Sword: Shadow of the Templars Reforged. However, one last drawing lurked at the end of the pile - this one featuring various designs for George Stobbart's shorts-and-sunglasses get-up, worn as he explores the Central American town of Quaramonte in Broken Sword 2.
</p>
<p>
At that point, Cecil offered a knowing shrug to the camera before the video cut to a lingering close-up of George's holiday gear, just in case it wasn't obvious enough the first time around.
</p>
<p>
A Reforged edition of Broken Sword 2: The Smoking Mirror would undoubtedly be warmly received by fans (especially as it's been fifteen years since the game's last remaster), but it's unclear when Revolution might get round to it. The studio is still hard at work on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-parzivals-stone-is-a-new-entry-in-the-classic-point-and-click-adventure-series">previously announced sixth series entry</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-parzivals-stone">Broken Sword - Parzival's Stone</a>, which is currently expected to arrive next year. Hopefully it'll have more than a tease to share before too long.

            <p>
Somewhat unbelievably, this February marks <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> series' 25th anniversary - that's a whole two and a half decades of "yibs", "neibs", and mysterious "incidents" involving suddenly ladder-less swimming pools - and EA is celebrating the occasion with a whole bunch of activities, including free updates, limited-time events, paid DLC, and more.
</p>
<p>
The Sims' quarter anniversary celebrations officially begin on 4th February, with a "huge" free <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> update introducing over 70+ new items spanning both Create a Sim and Build Buy modes. There's talk of turtlenecks and bodysuits, bike shorts, accessories, and hairdos. New furnishings, meanwhile, include "stylish" windows and doors, wood finishes for kitchen cabinets, and even a new playground pirate ship for the young 'uns.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, 4th February sees the launch of The Sims 4's new limited-time Blast from the Past event, presenting players will four weeks of challenges unlocking "iconic items from the 2000s", including a milk carton, telephone, alarm clock, birthday cake, and inflatable chairs. The Sims FreePlay is getting a similarly themed event on mobile, then, to wrap up the series' 4th February festivities, EA is hosting a 25-hour livestream from 10pm GMT. This'll feature Simmers and other special guests for a nostalgic look at The Sims' impact over the years.

<p>
That's not everything within The Sims' 25th anniversary orbit, however. Hurtling forward to 18th March, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-2007s-surprisingly-alright-the-sims-spin-off-mysims-is-heading-to-switch">recently released MySims: Cozy Bundle</a> - which contains beloved Wii series spin-offs MySims and MySims Kingdom - is making the jump from Switch to PC. And before that, there's another free update out today.
</p><p>
This one introduces a number of new features previously playtested as part of EA's relatively recent The Sims Labs initiative. There's a new main menu, for instance, putting your currently in-use Sims family front and centre, and all townie houses in Willow Creek and Oasis Springs - including those belonging to the Pancakes, Goths, Calientes, Landgraabs, and BFFs - have been rebuilt and renovated using some of the items added to the base game over the years. Full details of these latest improvements can be <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-1-14-2025">found in EA's patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's latest update arrives ahead of three new paid Kit DLC packs, launching this Thursday, 16th February. There's the Secret Sanctuary Kit, providing a range of items players can use to build a "luxurious space tucked behind a secret passage in a bookcase", while the Casanova Cave Kit promises items Sims can use to "entertain and make an impression". Lastly, there's the Comfy Gamer Kit, incorporating items themed around creating a "warm, inviting gaming room with personal touches".
</p>
<p>
EA says two additional kits are due this month, with more coming "later this year" - and further information on all the above is included in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4?isLocalized=true">25th anniversary news post</a>.
