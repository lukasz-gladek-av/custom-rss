            <p>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>", as developer Larian moves away from the series.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> released towards the end of 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-mammoth-success-drives-larian-to-bumper-207m-pre-tax-profit-for-2023">became a smashing success for Dungeons and Dragons owner Hasbro as well as Larian</a>. The game won scores of praise (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">and awards</a>) across the world, and last year Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-has-more-players-this-year-than-its-actual-launch-year">game's average daily peak concurrents were up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent in 2024 over 2023</a>.</p>
<p>However, despite this heady success, Larian is moving on from Baldur's Gate, and has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>. So, where does that leave the future of Baldur's Gate? Well, there are plenty of others who are "very interested" in Baldur's Gate, SVP of digital games at Hasbro Dan Ayoub has said.</p>

<p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," Ayoub told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says">IGN</a> during this week's GDC event in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Now, while the wording of "in pretty short order" certainly sounds promising, this doesn't mean we are about to suddenly get Baldur's Gate 4. In fact, Hasbro isn't "in a hurry" for that particular game.</p>
<p>"That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things," Ayoub explained, with the publication adding the exec said he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but it will take some time.</p>
<p>As for other Hasbro Dungeons and Dragons games, Ayoub said he is "never one to shy down from a challenge". After all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-dungeons-and-dragons-game-on-the-way-from-disney-dreamlight-valley-team">there are several other</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">D&amp;D-based games in the works</a>, and in November Hasbro announced following the success of Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business">yet another Dungeons &amp; Dragons game was in production</a>.</p>
<p>"I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar, and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher," Ayoub closed.</p>

    <blockquote><cite>Raziel says:</cite> How level-gated is the main game? Did you find yourself having to do side-quests (or grind even) to reach that level or does it pace well with the story?</blockquote>
<p>Several folk asked about this yesterday too - thanks for your questions <strong>November02</strong> and <strong>MrZappa</strong>. </p>
<p>After the game's prologue, the map opens out and you can travel anywhere. Enemies have a base difficulty in each region which then syncs with yours as you level up, so you're never going anywhere that's a cakewalk. You can generally tackle areas and equip gear about five levels higher than yours.</p>
<p>There's definitely a structure to the game - you'll discover/be encouraged to go after some of the main targets before others. But there's not a strict order within that, and I never found myself having to grind in order to move on, or because I was unable to do anything else before being a higher level. </p></div>

<p>My understanding is there will be a launch update to fix some minor bugs (ones I haven't really seen - it's already very smooth). Currently the game is on version 1.0.0 for me.</p>

<p>I'm guessing you mean snakes! (Could be slow worms.) I can confirm Shadows' total snake count is: zero.</p>
<p>For my fellow vegetarians, one small thing I liked about Shadows is it never forces you to hunt/kill animals. The game's world is teeming with life - but it's there to be observed and painted!</p>

<p>I spent some of my review time playing via GeForce Now, but wouldn't want to base any firm technical opinions on that (I had no complaints, though!). Digital Foundry has a detailed look at Shadows' PC performance coming.</p>

- How long did it take you to finish the game? and did you do much of the side quests?
- Did you find side quests and exploration worthwhile?</blockquote>
<p>New Eurogamer feature/old Assassin's Creed fan - hello :)</p>
<p>It took me 55 hours to hit the credits, completing the main story, all companion sidequests and the epilogue quests for both Naoe and Yasuke. That's the real meat of it all, though of course completionists have more to do. (Hello again.)</p>
<p>Exploration is a big part of the fun of the game. I found it far more rewarding, not least because Shadows' world is so visually stunning. Anything to do with Naoe/Yasuke's personal stories are great and very worth doing. Companion characters are a mixed bag, and not essential.</p></div>

<p>As a long-term Assassin's Creed fan, stealth is my go-to as well. As a percentage of the game's full run-time, it's not often Shadows forces you to play as one character over another - and as Yasuke much less than Naoe, who gets the game's lengthy prologue pretty much to herself. </p>

            <p>A year and a bit on from its monumental debut which saw the internet dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' game surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> now has crossplay.</p>
<p>The update went live today across platforms, with developer Pocketpair proclaiming "the wait is over". Crossplay was included in a roadmap laid out by the developer back in January, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">Palworld team outlined its plans for the game's second year</a>. At this time, however, no release date was mentioned.</p>
<p>Other new bells and whistles added with today's update include a new storage system, dedicated servers for those playing on Mac, and a photo mode.</p>

<p>You can check out the full notes for today's Palworld update below:</p>
<p><strong>New Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Crossplay! Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</li>
<li>Global Palbox - Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</li>
<li>Dimensional Pal Storage - A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox! Guild members can access it, and it can also be used as a personal storage with private settings.</li>
<li>Cosmetic Armour System! You can now equip armour cosmetically in the Antique Dresser. Change your character’s appearance without affecting armour stats!</li>
<li>Photo Mode - Accessible from the Pal Command Wheel. Hide the UI and move the camera around to take stunning screenshots.</li>
<li>Drafting Table - Combine low-rarity blueprints to create higher-rarity ones!</li>
<li>Dedicated Servers for Mac</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specification Adjustments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buildings can now be placed even if they overlap with a Pal</li>
<li>When connecting foundations or roofs, the connected pieces will now automatically align in the same direction</li>
<li>Assigning an Ice Pal to the Flea Market will slow down item decay in storage and sales</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Balance Adjustments</strong></p>

<li>Increased EXP gained from defeating the Attack Chopper</li>
<li>Increased the DPS of Flamethrowers</li>
<li>Adjusted the default attack used by Electric and Dark Pals when all active skills are on cooldown, making them more in line with the other elements</li>

<li>Summoned raid bosses can no longer damage other bases</li>
<li>Added Water attribute to Dumud</li>
