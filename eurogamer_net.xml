            <p>
Mark Barlet, founder of high-profile gaming accessibility charity AbleGamers, has been accused of fostering abuse at the non-profit for more than two decades. 
</p>
<p>
In a wide-ranging report published today by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors">IGN</a>, former colleagues claim Barlet used sexist, racist and misogynistic language in the workplace, including about other employees, and made comments offensive to other disabled people.
</p>
<p>
One source claimed Barlet repeatedly referred to her as the company's HR representative, as she was the only woman in the business. The source claimed Barlet would then also make offensive remarks regarding her breasts in front of colleagues.
</p>
<p>
Barlet, who left the charity last September following an investigation by an external law firm, denies all claims of abuse and harassment. 
</p>
<p>
"After thoroughly being investigated by an independent third-party, it was determined that none of that was true," Barlet said in a statement.
</p>
<p>
Other claims involve wasteful spending of the charity's funds by Barlet, involving first class air travel and extended hotel stays following business trips, and an expensive office charger for his Tesla.
</p>
<p>
In response, Barlet said his travel was justified by company policies, his extended trips were to cover additional business meetings, and his Tesla charger was just a "plug".
</p>
<p>
Regardless, it's claimed that an April 2024 investigation by  external payroll and HR firm ADP advised AbleGamers' board to part ways with Barlet, after concerns over his spending. 
</p>
<p>
This advice was reportedly ignored, prompting multiple employees to file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaints, prompting the latter invesigation that did then result in Barlet leaving the charity in September 2024 - albeit reportedly with a severance package. 
</p>
<p>
Since his departure, Barlet has started a new accessibility firm, AccessForge, while employees who spoke out about him claim they were subsequently forced out of AbleGamers by its board in retaliation.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, employees still at AbleGamers claim they have been repeatedly dissuaded from sharing their experiences for IGN's report. It's alleged that the charity's Steven Spohn has told staff not to speak out, for fear of "ruining the charity's reputation".
</p>
<p>
Neither Spohn or AbleGamers responded to IGN's requests for comment.

            <p>Microsoft is laying off three percent of its workforce across the business - potentially including its gaming division.</p>
<p>The news comes from a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a> report, following Microsoft's latest financial report from the end of April where it announced an 18 percent year-on-year increase in net income - plus a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports">five percent increase in gaming revenue</a> specifically.</p>
<p>"We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.</p>
<p>Back in June last year, Microsoft had 228,000 employees, meaning that a three percent drop would amount to approximately 6840 people - though of course employee numbers may have fluctuated, especially following other rounds of layoffs.</p>
<p>As such, this would be the largest round of cuts since the company laid off 10,000 employees in January 2023. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>, The Coalition, and 343 Industries were all affected.</p>
<p>Since then, Microsoft has continued to lay off staff. In January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 people from across Microsoft's video game teams were laid off</a>, with a further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">650 staff laid off in September</a>.</p>
<p>Already this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reportedly-makes-small-number-of-layoffs-across-divisions-including-gaming">Microsoft laid off a "small" number of employees back in January</a>. While these cuts were performance-based, this new round of cuts are not related to performance, the Microsoft spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for further comment on whether Xbox Studios are impacted.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Microsoft confirmed it would be raising the price of its Xbox console across the world</a>, with some new games costing $80.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5s-best-selling-games-last-month-were-all-from-xbox">Microsoft-published games even dominated the download charts on rival console, Sony's PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's all go on the Illuminate front in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, with the co-op sci-fi shooter's powerful third faction having now set a course for Super Earth - and it's bringing "new terrors" along too.
</p>
<p>
All this arrives as part of Helldivers 2's latest update which - in lore terms at least - sees the squid-like Iluminate emerging from the Meridian singularity in order to bring the never-ending fight for Democracy to Super Earth itself.
</p>
<p>
In more specific terms, that means a wave of brand-new Illuminate enemies. There's the Stingray - jetfighters that unleash devastating strafing runs from above - and the Crescent Overseer, which "has the ability to lay barrages on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> in cover".

<p>
Worse still are the Fleshmob; failed Illuminate experiments assembled from Voteless parts and let loose on the battlefield. Developer Arrowhead is also teasing "even larger ships", but is leaving players to discover these on their own.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Arrowhead has introduced a new load-out customisation  feature it says will work with "the bulk of" Helldivers 2's weapon offerings. "Most primary weapons now have levels that are achievable by completing missions," it <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/?sf277258176=1">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition."
</p>
<p>
Players can also unlock patterns and apply them to their weapons, and a variety of patterns tied to previous Warbonds - specifically Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds - will be made available on 15th May. That's the same day the new Masters of Ceremony Warbond arrives.
</p>
<p>
And finally for Helldivers 2's latest update, item rotation has been removed from the Superstore, meaning players can purchase any item they want anytime they want, no waiting required. It launches today on PS5 and PC.
