            <p>
Santa Ragione - the acclaimed indie studio and publisher behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-review-a-horrible-nightmare-in-all-the-right-ways">Saturnalia</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mirrormoon-ep-review">Mirror Moon EP</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mediterranea-inferno-review-a-bruising-intensely-stylish-post-covid-nightmare">Mediterranea Inferno</a> - has accused Apple of yanking one of its titles from the App Store without "clear justification".
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Eurogamer, Santa Ragione co-founder and director Pietro Righi Riva revealed the studio's 2016 visual novel Wheels of Aurelia will be delisted from the App Store on 25th July following a number of unsuccessful appeals to Apple.
</p>
<p>
According to Riva, Apple's reasoning for Wheels of Aurelia's removal has remained vague, with the company only citing its "policy to remove apps deemed 'obsolete' or 'outdated'" during correspondence. Riva insists the game remains "fully functional and compliant with current technical standards" and that no "clear justification" for the removal has been provided "despite multiple appeals and sincere efforts to seek clarification." We've contacted Apple for comment.
</p>
<p>
Riva added that "enforced and unnecessary" updates "represent a substantial financial burden" for developers, and "negatively [impacts] their ability to sustain existent projects and to pursue new creative endeavours."
</p>
<p>
"We firmly believe that removing fully functional artistic works simply due to infrequent updates undermines the value and sustainability of games as cultural and artistic products," he continued. "Like books, films, and music albums, video games represent complete creative works that do not inherently require continual updates beyond maintaining basic functionality."

Riva called Apple's practices "especially troubling" given the tech company's "dominant position in digital distribution", adding they reinforce the "importance of diversified ecosystems". He also applauded the European Union's recent efforts at "fostering more fairness and plurality in the digital marketplace." Apple, of course, has repeatedly expressed its discontent over EU decisions stemming from the Digital Markets Act legislation Riva appears to be referencing, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-appeals-eus-500m-fine-for-app-store-anti-steering-practices-says-its-far-beyond-what-the-law-requires">currently appealing a â‚¬500m fine</a> it received in April over the restrictions it places on app developers wishing to use alternative purchase methods.
</p>
<p>
Santa Ragione is far from the only developer to take issue with Apple's approach. Studios described creating games for the company's platforms as being "like an abusive relationship" in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-games-for-apple-platforms-like-an-abusive-relationship-say-developers">report last year</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developer Epic Games has been heavily involved in legal efforts to curtail Apple's much-criticised practices following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">significant falling out</a> in 2020.
</p>
<p>
As for Wheels of Aurelia, Santa Ragione is making the game - a "narrative road trip... set in the roaring Italian 70s" - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wheels-of-aurelia/id1198170026">free on the App Store</a> until its delisting on 25th July, to ensure "as many people as possible can experience this work before its removal".

            <p>Free-to-play MOBA Predecessor is doing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> as it returns to its original map, in tribute to its Epic Games-developed predecessor (pun intended).</p>
<p>Epic Games previously released a MOBA called Paragon, but in 2018 it shut down the servers. However, content creator Robbie Singh refused to let it die and so, using public assets from Paragon, formed Omeda Studios to develop spiritual successor Predecessor.</p>
<p>A year after its launch in August 2024, Predecessor will now return to Paragon's map, called Agora, following demand from its community. It's a move similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite's OG map</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-dutys-original-verdansk-map-return-dated">Call of Duty Warzone's return to Verdansk</a>.</p>

<p>"The Agora map holds a special place in the hearts of OG Paragon players because it was their first introduction to that world, a world that felt vast, immersive, and alive in a way other MOBAs, constrained by isometric perspectives, simply couldn't replicate," Singh told Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"The sense of verticality, scale, and atmosphere gave players an unprecedented level of immersion, making them feel not like detached commanders but as true heroes fighting for control of a living, breathing world."</p>
<p>Predecessor plays similarly to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> as a lane-based strategic MOBA with over 40 heroes to play as, but with a third-person perspective and map verticality.</p>
<p>The Agora map will be playable for a limited time in Predecessor's new Legacy Mode, which arrives in the game's patch 1.7. This will also include a new hero, Renna (pictured above) - a powerful dark magic wielder.</p>
<p>Patch 1.7 will be available from 22nd July, and will also include new skins and gameplay fixes.</p>
<p>"There has never been a better time to play Predecessor," said Singh. "The game has evolved thanks to our incredible community, who constantly engage and share their feedback. We believe we've found a great blend of fast-paced action and deep strategy, doubling down on the things players care about most, like increased verticality and fluid combat, while introducing an augment system that gives players unprecedented freedom to shape their playstyle."</p>
<p>Singh also pointed to the regular addition of new heroes and the thriving competitive scene as key reasons for players to stick with the game.</p>
<p>Predecessor launched in August 2024 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic). It's hoped the game will not only outlast Paragon, but will continue to compete against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-continue-to-dominate-accounting-for-40-of-time-spent-on-ps5-and-xbox-in-us-last-month">other popular live-service games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-moba-predecessor-follows-fortnite-with-return-to-original-map]]></content:encoded>
