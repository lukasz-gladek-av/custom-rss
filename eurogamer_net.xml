            <p>
Following recent claims Warner Bros.'s Wonder Woman game was in trouble and still "years away from release", the company has reportedly now cancelled the project and shut down its developer Monolith Productions as part of a string of studio closures.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lizk5skwps2d">made the claim in a post shared on BlueSky</a>. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> is shutting down Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego, sources tell Bloomberg News," Schreier wrote. "Warner Bros. is also canceling the Wonder Woman game."
</p>
<p>
Schreier <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-games-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release-if-it-ever-launches-at-all">first suggested Wonder Woman was in trouble earlier this month</a>, as part of a report detailing the culture of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment during the tenure of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">outgoing president David Haddad</a> - a period said to have lacked a "strong, cohesive vision".

<p>
At the time, Schreier claimed Wonder Woman had "struggled to coalesce" in the years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">its announcement in 2021</a>, with the project having switched directors and been rebooted early last year. All that upheaval was reported to have cost Warner Bros. $100m, with sources telling Bloomberg its future remained "in question".
</p>
<p>
Wonder Woman's reported cancellation comes amid an extremely rocky period for Warner Bros.'s games division, with Warner Bros. Montreal's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a>, Rocksteady's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, party brawler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all having failed to resonate with consumers. 
</p>
<p>
We've reached out to Warner Bros. for comment on these latest reports and will update the story as more comes in.

If you've already hoovered up developer Color Gray Games' excellent deduct-'em'-up sequel The Rise of the Golden Idol, you might well be delighted to hear The Sins of New Wells - the first of its previously announced post-launch DLC episodes - is arriving this March.
</p>
<p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol, if you're unfamiliar, takes the sleuthing formula of its 2022 predecessor and shifts it from the 18th Century to the 1970s. Eurogamer liked its 20 new cases enough to declare it a "compelling modern mystery thriller" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">our four star review</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
Prior to its release, Color Gray Games confirmed The Rise of the Golden Idol <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sleuthing-sequel-the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-shares-post-launch-dlc-roadmap-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch">would be getting a paid Detective Pass</a>, granting access to four additional self-contained DLC Investigations throughout 2025 - each one featuring "at least" four new cases. And we now know the first of these, The Sins of New Wells, is coming in March.

"Homicide detective [REDACTED] has been transferred to the [REDACTED]," the studio explains in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/521956605068051135">announcement</a>, "where corruption runs as deep as the sewers beneath New Wells. Here, crime is business as usual. But as he and his new partner, Cliff Savea, investigate a string of brutal crimes, they find themselves pulled into something far more insidious...Lemurian magic."
</p>
<p>
And if that appeals, The Sins of New Wells will be available as part of the aforementioned Detective Pass bundle, which costs £14.99/$17.99, or as an individual purchase priced at £4.99/$5.99. It's coming to PC, consoles, and the Netflix-exclusive mobile version.
