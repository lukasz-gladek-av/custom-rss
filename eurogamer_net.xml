            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - the sequel to developer Level 5's 2012 Nintendo DS life sim and RPG <em>thing</em> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-studio-announces-free-dlc-as-the-slow-life-rpg-sequel-gets-off-to-a-flying-start">getting a bunch of free DLC</a>, which we already knew. What we weren't previously aware of, however, is that its DLC will include an open-world roguelike mode.
</p>
<p>
It's not entirely clear <em>why</em> a relatively laidback, job-focused life sim RPG would want to get in on the roguelike action, but that's what Level 5 is going for. As <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250619/">detailed in its announcement blog</a>, the update - which is currently "actively underway" - will feature an "evolved version of Ginormosia, including a system blending roguelike and open-world elements".
</p>
<p>
Level 5's announcement stops short of explaining how the new mode will actually work, but it does say the update will include "engaging content for both experienced players and newcomers alike." Additionally, the update promises "powerful new gear", plus "stylish equipment, mounts, and a variety of unusual items." A telephone made of butts immediately springs to mind, but I suspect I'm likely to be disappointed.

<p>
And we're not quite done yet. Fantasy Life i's free DLC update will also include a brand-new character who'll "leave a significant mark on the world", plus new hairstyles and new emotes to "make it even more enjoyable for players to express themselves in-game". As for when all this will show up, Level 5 says "as soon as possible".
</p>
<p>
"Level 5 appreciates everyone's continued support and remains committed to continuously refining Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time," it concludes in its announcement post, "as well as expanding content to provide the best possible gaming experience."
</p>
<p>
Why all this free DLC? That'll be down to Fantasy Life i's impressive sales, with the game having already shifted 1m copies since its release at the end of May. Level 5 is also celebrating the milestone with a "commemorative gift code" that'll unlock an "exclusive piece of equipment", plus a "commemorative Pegasus mount" - although its post profusely apologises for mistakenly giving players on certain platforms a unicorn instead. That error should now be fixed, alas.
</p>
<p>
And if you'd like to bump that sales number up to 1m and one, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">got off to a flying start</a>, with Nintendo proudly trumpeting the console as its "fastest-selling hardware ever" just days after launch. But while things are looking rosy for Nintendo, a new report suggests third-party titles have so far struggled, with one third-party publisher saying sales have been "below our lowest estimates".
</p>
<p>
That's <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">according to TheGameBusiness' Chris Dring</a>, who collated some pertinent sales figures surrounding Switch 2's launch in his latest newsletter. The key numbers are that 48 percent of physical game sales in the UK (and 62 percent of physical game sales in the US) were first-party titles, if Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle is excluded; but if it's <em>not</em>, 86 percent of Switch 2 physical game sales in the UK were for first-party titles. Nintendo, for context, had three titles available physically at launch: Mario Kart World, plus Switch 2 editions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>; third-parties released a total of 13 physical games.
</p>
<p>
Dring notes Switch 2's figures are an improvement compared to the original Switch's launch, where 89 percent of UK physical sales were from first-party games, but adds that "most third-party Switch 2 games posted very low numbers", despite the availability of some big names, including Civilization 7, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, Street Fighter, and Hogwarts Legacy (the report's source, NielsenIQ, does not publicly release video game sales data).

<p>
Speaking to TheGameBusiness, one unnamed third-party publisher painted a bleak picture of its Switch 2 launch sales, saying they'd been "below our lowest estimates". However, not every third-party release has struggled. Dring says CD Projekt's Cyberpunk 2077 was the "best-selling third-party game during the launch of Switch 2", and did "reasonable numbers".
</p>
<p>
Dring highlights the fact CD Projekt was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">one of the few publishers not to opt for Nintendo's controversial Game Key Cards</a>, which require full downloads to play, and quotes CD Projekt's Jan Rosner as having previously said, "Do not underestimate the physical edition. It's not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right."
</p>
<p>
As to <em>why</em> most third-parties have got off to a slow start on Switch 2, Dring suggests a number of reasons in his analysis; there's the console's enhanced backward compatibility, for starters, meaning many players (we've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-scarlet-violet-pokemon-love">some of them here</a>) are likely also delving into the original Switch's impressive back catalogue right now. That's alongside a lack of reviews covering third-party games given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/virtual-boy-switch-2-review">Nintendo's decision not to provide early consoles to press</a>, and it's hard to ignore the fact almost all third-party Switch 2 titles are ports of older games, which many core players have likely already experienced elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Despite all this, Dring says many major publishers have told him Nintendo is "actively trying to push third-party games this time around", so the hope will obviously be that sales pick up once players have had their fill of Mario Kart World. Notable confirmed third-party titles still to release include EA Sports Madden 26 and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, while Nintendo's big hitters include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-musical-twist-revealed-plus-dk-rap-is-included">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and Pokémon Legends: Z-A, plus Switch 2 editions of Super Mario Party Jamboree and Kirby and the Forgotten Land.
