            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> may have welcomed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">impressive number of Steam players giving the open beta a whirl</a>, but many of these players are not especially impressed.</p>
<p>A quick look over on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> reddit feed shows multiple screenshots of angular, almost Nintendo 64-looking graphics. In one clip shared by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1gh0deu/graphics_be_damned_ill_hunt_them_all_the_same/">Magolich</a>, the player looks like they are trying to hunt down an animated origami creation, rather than a fully fleshed beast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as you can see in the header image above and the posts below, several characters look like a very basic version of what they are surely meant to look like, and the fellow above brought to my mind a Lord of the Rings' Uruk-hai after a bad night.</p>

</span></p><p>These images have certainly made me chuckle, but obviously are far from ideal. Thankfully, the Monster Hunter Wilds' team has said the final game is "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test". It has also shared a few <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/4175478969021690194">troubleshooting pointers</a> for those still looking to get into the beta.</p><p>"The purpose of this test is to allow players to experience a limited portion of Monster Hunter Wilds and also to verify various technical aspects such as network load and overall operation prior to the game's full release," the developer wrote on Steam.</p>
<p>"Please note that the final product is still in development. Certain aspects such as game specifications and balance may differ in the full version. We are committed to ensuring the quality of the final product."</p>

<p>Our Ed has been hands on with the game already, and came away impressed. "For the most part, Monster Hunter Wilds strikes a balance between approachability and depth of combat. It offers a familiar thrill of the hunt, of player customisation (the new armours look awesome), and of extravagant combat, but with a fresh world ripe for a bit of co-op action - even with NPCs," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release in full in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">February next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered is sitting on a mixed Steam user score as players take issue with a number of things, including performance, stuttering, audio glitches, and the fact you need a PSN account despite the game being a single player adventure.</p>
<p>Not that the latter is new information, of course. Just like other notable PlayStation-flavoured Steam releases such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, players knew they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-will-require-a-psn-account">wouldn't be able to play Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC without a PSN account</a>. That doesn't mean they're done making their unhappiness known, though, or plan to stop warning other players of the requirement.</p>

<p>"I really wanted to play but it sucks to have to have an [PSN] account to play it, and the worst thing is that when you want to verify your account or tells you that the password is invalid or you have to repeat the procedure again, why do I have to have a playstation account if I'm going to play on a damn PC???" posited <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamdoll19/recommended/2561580/">one</a> of the 39 percent of players to have left a negative review on Steam.</p>
<p>"Game runs very poorly. Awful optimisation. Running game with 4070. Refunded," added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051476976/recommended/2561580/">another</a> particularly succinct player.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt about it - when it comes to porting or developing for PC, Nixxes is still the best of them all!" says <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/stepasr/recommended/2561580/">one</a> more positive take. "The Complete Edition was already amazing, but now, with this Remastered, we've reached new heights, as with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p>"They've redone everything, even the benchmark, and the technical side is finally packed with features: from all upscalers to frame generation, all the way to dynamic resolution. The game's visual quality has improved tenfold, performance is excellent, they did an incredible job, and it deserves recognition. And all this for just 10 bucks! Kudos all around! Enjoy the game!"</p>
<p>On reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1gh15wp/really_enjoying_the_remaster_but_it_def_needs_a/">this player</a> broke down some of the game's biggest issues: "Really enjoying the remaster, but it [definitely] needs a patch or two. I'm noticing small stutters or hitching during cutscenes, the audio mix in that first town area has some weird reverb with NPC chatter and sound effects… A few minor floating items or clothing graphics glitches. This is not killing my immersion or anything but would be nice if these things were sorted out."</p>
<p>Other complains report problems with controllers, freezes, and numerous crashes.</p>
<p>The issue around PSN linking all stems back to the beginning of the summer with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers' PC PSN log-in requirement</a>. There was such a vitriolic backlash that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony backtracked on its original plans</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">auto-refunded players who bought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Playdate Season 2 is set to drop in 2025.</p>
<p>Whilst no firm release date has been revealed as yet, developer Panic said it would have "a new collection of surprise games developed specifically" for its dinky handheld system next year.</p>
<figure>

<a aria-label="Playdate Update - Fall 2024" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSNBCK5gIcY?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>Details on "price, the exact number of games, and the developers begins [them]" will be confirmed next year, with Panic stating that whilst the pandemic and unprecedented chip shortage up-ended plans to simultaneously release games at the exact same time the first time round, "Playdate 2 hopes to deliver on that original idea" next year.</p>
<p>Interested? Playdate owners will be able to purchase the fresh batch of games via Playdate's Catalog when it releases. All new Playdates sold will continue to have Playdate Season 1 bundled in with the price of the system itself.</p>
<p>"Since the beginning, the number one question from Playdate owners has been: 'When will there be another Season?'" says Greg Maletic, Playdate project lead.</p>
<p>"Season One was a hit - players loved games like Crankin's Time Travel Adventure and Zipper. They also loved the excitement of receiving two surprise games a week: that time-release aspect encouraged players to dive deeply into each title before the next arrived. But one thing we couldn't do with Season One was synchronize play for everyone. With Season Two, we finally can!"</p>
<p>Donlan reviewed the Playdate console back in 2022, calling it "a fascinating puzzle in itself".</p>
<p>"Attached to my memories of Mad magazine are inevitably a bunch of memories of early home computers - the C64 and Amstrad in my case - and there's a lot of that DNA here too," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">Eurogamer's Playdate review</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, there was an even bigger Playdate puzzle - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400k-worth-of-playdate-game-consoles-have-gone-missing-in-vegas">$400k worth of Playdate game consoles disappeared in Las Vegas</a>, with company co-founder Cabel Sasser calling it "a bit of a true crime drama".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
