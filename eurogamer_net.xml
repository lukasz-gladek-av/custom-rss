            <p>The Last of Us season two is under way, and this weekend we were treated to the second episode. 'Treated' is, perhaps, the wrong word to use here. After all, there were some pretty major story beats in this episode, and well, you know voices on the internet have opinions on what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of major spoilers for The Last of Us below. </strong></p>

<p>We knew it was coming, but it happened perhaps sooner than many of us expected. In the second episode of The Last of Us season two, Joel is killed by Abby.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no bad blood at all between Pedro Pascal and Kaitlyn Dever, who play Joel and Abby on the show. Soon after the episode aired, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIsnfw9uzpL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Pascal shared a heartwarming picture of the two on set</a>, captioning the image: "Thank you, scene partner. You little miracle."</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Pedro Pascal</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But, while Pascal and Dever are smiling in the photo, there is no denying that the moment of Joel's death was tough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joel-actor-pedro-pascal-discusses-the-last-of-us-season-twos-most-shocking-moment-yet">for the cast and viewers</a>. Perhaps it was harder for those coming to the show without any prior knowledge of the source material. This user seems to think so.</p>

<p>Some have said they will <a href="https://x.com/B3ARZATTO/status/1914157825669976290/photo/1">never emotionally recover from seeing Ellie lying next to Joel's dead body</a> at the end of the episode.</p>
<p>"Ellie crawling to Joel’s body and cuddling up next to it.. that was way worse than the game," <a href="https://x.com/giannaispunk/status/1914137102511415581">wrote one viewer</a>.</p>
<p>"Does it ever keep y'all up at night knowing how Joel was ready to end it all? to accept his fate in death, until he heard Ellie yelling for him to get up? What little energy he had left was used in trying to push himself to live for her," <a href="https://x.com/pascalfanatic/status/1914528859787039152">another viewer wrote</a>, referring to the way Joel lifted his fingers while lying on the ground in a beaten bloody mess.</p>
<p>"THE WAY HIS FINGERS TWITCH. HE WANTED TO REACH OUT TO HER. OH MY GOD," <a href="https://x.com/lcvespascal/status/1914161545593983060">reads yet another post</a>.</p>
<p>Here's another user so upset by the whole ordeal that full caps lock was the only way to write. "ELLIE LAYING ON TOP OF JOELS BODY WAS THE MOST FOUL THING I’VE EVER SEEN," <a href="https://x.com/xkimberlynx/status/1914136143781671400">they wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Some viewers have just decided to go into denial, and as far as they are concerned Joel is absolutely fine, thank you very much.</p><p>

"I'm still convinced Joel'ss death scene was a mass hallucination like no that actually did not happen," <a href="https://x.com/dayasrussell/status/1914330722610864196">wrote one hopeful viewer</a>. 

</p><p>"Guys he got up !! He listened to Ellie !! im so glad hes alright that was a close one," <a href="https://x.com/troianns/status/1914397799715672203">one person said</a> with an image of Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal on set.</p> <div>

<p>Others shared photos of Pascal's Joel with his daughter Sarah, played in series one by Nico Parker. "25 long years later, they’re finally together," wrote one viewer with a collection of images.</p>

<p>I think <a href="https://x.com/wizardjarin/status/1914266574346658117">this user</a> has summed things up quite well for all of us watching The Last of Us season two. They captioned an image of Pascal bobbing about in the ocean while on holiday as this: "New photo of Pedro Pascal swimming in our tears."</p>
<p>Agree, we have probably all cried an ocean's worth since episode two aired earlier this week. At least he's still alive to look after Grogu in The Mandalorian, I suppose…</p>

<p>On the plus side, though, at least Joel knew he was handsome before he was beaten to a pulp. Abby said it both this episode and the first episode.</p>

            <p>
A developer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</a> has commented on recent research that pitted various AI models against the classic courtroom series' first installment.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ace-attorney-dev-reacts-to-the-game-being-used-to-test-how-smart-ai-models-are-maybe-this-kind-of-deductive-power-is-the-strength-of-humans/">Automaton</a>, Hao AI Lab used Ace Attorney to try and benchmark four AI models' memory, reasoning skills, visual understanding and strategic decision-making - with some performing better than others.
</p>
<p>
While none of the AI models managed to beat the game, Google Gemini and Open AI's o1 managed to reason their way through to its penultimate episode.
</p>
<p>
"This index uses Ace Attorney to evaluate the AI's practical ability to 'find inconsistencies in testimony, select appropriate evidence to support them, and refute them most effectively'," AI researcher K Ishi <a href="https://x.com/K_Ishi_AI/status/1912330532274483213">wrote</a>. "As a result, the best 'lawyer' was o1."
</p>
<p>
The research was designed to test each AI's ability to consider "the entire flow of the case and make decisions without being limited to current testimony", Ishi added, as well as having the "ability to consider the timing of 'meaningful' situations and create the most effective strategy". 
</p>
<p>
Each AI's understanding would also have to remain flexible enough to react to fresh evidence coming to light mid-trial, he continued. You can watch each of the four AI models tested play the game via the video in the embed below.

"How should I put this, I never thought the game I worked on so desperately 25 years ago would come to be used in this way, and overseas at that (laughs)," <a href="https://x.com/m_sugimori/status/1913719762762477685">wrote Ace Attorney developer Masakazu Sugimori</a>, who composed the game's soundtrack and voiced antagonist Manfred von Karma.
</p>
<p>
"I find it interesting how the AI models get stumped in the first episode," Sugimori continued, in response to seeing the research. "[Ace Attorney director Shu] Takumi and [executive producer Shinji] Mikami were very particular about the difficulty level of Episode 1 - it's supposed to be simple for a human. Maybe this kind of deductive power is the strength of humans?"
</p>
<p>
"The reason why Takumi and Mikami were so particular about balancing the difficulty level of Ace Attorney's first episode was because 'there was no other game like it in the world at the time'," Sugimori added. 
</p>
<p>
"It had to be a difficulty that would be acceptable to a wide playerbase, but it had to avoid being insultingly simple too. They were going for the kind of difficulty that gives you a sense of satisfaction when the solution hits you."
</p>
<p>
And as far as we know, no AI has been programmed to feel that same sense of satisfaction - yet. Come back in five years, though, and it'll be interesting to see whether the AI models of 2030 can beat the game.
</p>

            <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, has shared his thoughts on the shocking events from this week's episode.</p>

<p>During the early hours of Monday morning for those of us here in the UK, the second episode of The Last of Us season two aired. It was a packed showing, with more infected than you can shake a stick at. But, even though the siege of Jackson was surely an suspenseful and emotionally impactful story beat, there is one moment in particular that has grabbed the hearts of viewers and torn them  into a million pieces - Joel's death.</p>
<p>As in The Last of Us Part 2, in the show Joel is killed with a golf club by Abby, a former Firefly seeking revenge for the death of her father.</p>
<p>In the season one finale,  Joel massacred the Fireflies in Salt Lake City in a bid to save Ellie, his surrogate daughter. And now, the time has come for him to face the consequences of those actions. Abby - played in the show by Kaitlyn Dever - arrives in Jackson with a group of fellow former Fireflies to even the score. And she does, beating Joel until finally dealing a killing strike to the neck with a golf club. It's a hard watch.</p>
<p>But, what is it like for Pascal and the rest of The Last of Us' cast and crew? "I'm in active denial," <a href="https://ew.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-pedro-pascal-shocker-kaitlyn-dever-bella-ramsey-on-set-exclusive-11717893">Pascal told EW</a>, following the episode's debut.</p>
<p>"I realise this more and more as I get older, I find myself slipping into denial that anything is over. I know that I'm forever bonded to so many members of the experience and just have to see them under different circumstances, but never will under the circumstances of playing Joel on The Last of Us.</p>
<p>"And, no, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about it because it makes me sad."</p>
<p>But while it may make the actor sad, Pascal believes the fact that this narrative has affected and pained so many people is a "brilliant achievement of the storytelling".</p>
<p>"I have nothing but respect for the level of investment that people have in a video game or a TV show or movie or book. I experience that myself. I've flung books across the room because its impact is so profound on me and experiencing the story," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-joel-death-last-of-us-1236373640/">Pascal said</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The show has made a few tweaks to The Last of Us Part 2's narrative - for example having Dina on patrol with Joel that day, rather than his brother Tommy. Another change made by the showrunners was to have Bella Ramsey's Ellie drag herself over to Joel's dead body, an image that will stay with me for a long time to come. According to showrunner Craig Mazin, this moment was "in there from the very beginning, draft one". This is because Ellie at this moment also believes she is going to die.</p>
<p>"Ellie's been kicked in the ribs. She's clearly very injured. She has no reason to think she's going to survive," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-joel-dies-pedro-pascal-1236372785/">Mazin told Variety</a>.</p>
<p>"She's not crawling over there just to say goodbye. She's crawling over there so she could be with him in death. That's where she wants to be, and it's when she takes his hand. We've seen her do it before. Bella Ramsey, geez."</p>

            <p>
Bethesda will finally show off its long-awaited The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remake today.
</p>
<p>
Teaser imagery can now be seen on Bethesda's social media channels pointing to today's date, 22nd April, and a time: 4pm UK. (That's 11am Eastern or 8am Pacific if you live across the pond.)
</p>
<p>
Bethesda then links to its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube pages, directing you to watch the game's announcement trailer when it drops. But when will the game itself be available?
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">Eurogamer previously reported</a>, amidst a sea of leaks, Bethesda has been planning to announce and shadow drop the game this week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass.

Bethesda's Oblivion Remaster has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-reportedly-set-for-imminent-reveal">one of gaming's worst kept secrets over recent months</a>, with screenshots popping up in the files of developer Virtuos' website this month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">references to the game on Bethesda's own site</a> just days ago.

<p>
That's not to mention the years of references to the project <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">spotted in Microsoft documents</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">whispered by a former developer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over the long weekend, the leaks continued. Fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k3tvxy/oblivion_remake_steamdb_listing_leaked/">spotted a SteamDB listing</a> for the game, while others claimed it had suddenly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1k3sclu/oblivion_remastered_appearing_on_steam_accounts/">turned up in their Steam accounts</a>. Others noticed that the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k4b068/esrb_oblivion_entry_last_updated_50_minutes_ago/">US ratings board listing had suddenly been updated</a> too.
</p>
<p>
The Oblivion Remake is expected to be a new version of Bethesda's classic Elder Scrolls game built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 by port studio Virtuos.
</p>
<p>
According to an earlier leak by a ex-Virtuos developer, the game will feature newly reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery and hit reaction systems, as well as a fresh HUD.
</p>
<p>
How will it feel to play? Well, here's <a href="https://80.lv/articles/virtuos-the-code-behind-remakes-remasters-adaptations/">Virtuos design director Nicolas Roginski speaking in March 2024 to 80.lv</a> seemingly about the project, without actually naming what it is.
</p>
<p>
"We are working on a very big, unannounced project," Roginski said. "Our approach for the design work of this remake is simple but challenging. It's challenging, mainly because of players' perception of their old memories. We tend to recollect things much better than they really were. 
</p>
<p>
"Hence, if we deliver the reality of what gaming was like in the earlier days, there is a good chance that players will be disappointed because it won't match the 'feeling' of their memories.
</p>
<p>
"To produce a quality remake, we aim at recreating the 'feeling of the memory', not the actual memory. Our design approach at Virtuos is 'Keep, Improve, Create'."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to "remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. I fear that ship has now sailed. Tune in at 4pm today to see Jim be disappointed, I guess.
