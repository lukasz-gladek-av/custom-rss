            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> developer Shift Up expects the forthcoming PC release of its action game to exceed sales of the console release.</p>
<p>As part of its latest financial report, the company was asked about the expected results of Stellar Blade on PC, where it noted the "higher market share" for PC over consoles. It follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-coming-to-pc-in-2025-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-release">similar comments from its previous financial report</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>

<p>That "significant expansion" is presumably due to the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p>
<p>The company is analysing the market for comparison and also promised an optimised experience, even on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"We have identified and analysed both successful and underperforming cases of console exclusives released on PC, and we are preparing to release the game in a way that ensures continued success in the PC market," the company continued.</p>
<p>"This will include optimisation, enhancing user convenience, adding supplementary content, and tailored marketing strategies unique to Shift Up. In particular, we plan to optimise the game to ensure smooth gameplay even in UMPC (Steam Deck) environments."</p>
<p>The release of Stellar Blade on PC, expected at some point this year, will follow other PlayStation exclusives like God of War, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and most recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.</p>
<p>However, these releases have seen diminishing returns in terms of player numbers. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 remains Sony's biggest success on PC</a>, released simultaneously across PC and console.</p>
<p>Other companies are also looking at PC releases of console games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in particular has launched a multiplatform strategy, with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth both released on PC in the last year following PS5 exclusivity.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, meanwhile, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick teased a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">possible PC release for GTA 6</a>, though Rockstar is officially focused on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S for launch.</p>
<p>While Shift Up didn't reveal further sales figures for Stellar Blade, it previously announced it had sold over a million copies in its first couple of months. As a result, Shift Up has now recorded its highest annual revenue with a 30 percent year-on-year increase.</p>
<p>"Despite being a narrative-based single-player game with a defined ending, it has been continuously updated like a live-service game, and has steadily built a strong global fandom for the Stellar Blade IP," the company said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">game received a PS5 Pro patch</a> in time for the new console's release, which Digital Foundry described as a "hugely effective upgrade".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Marvel Rivals has quickly U-turned on plans to reset player ranks twice per season, after an outburst of fan feedback against the idea.
</p>
<p>
Developer <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html">NetEase last night announced</a> it would implement a mid-season rank reset "to shake up the battlefield" on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Alongside this, the addition of Fantastic Four members The Thing and Human Torch were also confirmed, completing the superhero family's addition to Marvel Rivals' roster (and tying in nicely with Marvel's newly-released trailer for the Pedro Pascal-starring reboot).

<p>
But feedback to the sudden reveal of a mid-season rank reset was swift, and decidedly negative. 
</p>
<p>
"This is an extremely demotivating idea to rank reset every 45 days," <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1889003952877740498">one fan wrote on social media</a>. "This game is not a battle royale."
</p>
<p>
"No rank resets," wrote another. "It's not a fun and engaging mechanic stop resetting the ranks. I will stop playing this fkn game if you use this cheap tactic to grip players."
</p>
<p>
Roughly 12 hours later, and <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html">NetEase has this morning issued a fresh update</a> - confirming that the mid-season ranked reset had been scrapped.
</p>
<p>
"We received a wealth of feedback from the community," NetEase confirmed. "A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable. In light of the community's input, we have decided to make some changes.
</p>
<p>
"When the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset," the developer continued. "Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half. To earn new rewards, players simply need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the relevant conditions by the end of the season."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://x.com/itskyoji/status/1889208880174907838">Said one fan in response</a>: "A dev team that makes adjustments almost immediately, unlike my teammates."
</p>
<p>
Marvel Rivals debuted late last year and quickly found an audience, despite an initially mixed criticial response. "NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>.

            <p>As is tradition at this point, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will have a poison swamp just like previous Souls games.</p>
<p>That said, it's a little different this time. Nightreign will feature "large-scale changes to terrain in the form of procedurally appearing volcanos or swamps or forests".</p>
<p>That's according to director Junya Ishizaki, who spoke to PC Gamer (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreigns-map-will-sometimes-see-large-scale-changes-to-terrain-including-procedurally-appearing-volcanos-forests-and-yes-swamps/">GamesRadar</a>) to discuss these changes to the game's map.</p>

<p>"We wanted the map itself to be a giant dungeon, so players have the chance to traverse and explore a different way every time they play," he says. "You have to choose the boss you want to face at the end of the third day.</p>
<p>"Once you've made that choice, maybe you have an idea of how you want to strategize against that boss, and this might change how you approach the map. We wanted to offer players that agency, to decide 'I need to go after a poison weapon this time to face this boss'."</p>
<p>It certainly seems inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s map changes, that altered familiar locations with the addition of volcanoes and swamps over time, albeit here with the possibility of happening - or not - each match. As previously announced, Nightreign also features a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">battle royale-style shrinking zone, as players outlast its day and night cycle</a> over three in-game days. The procedural nature of these terrain changes also fits with what seems to be a roguelike-esque structure to the game.</p>
<p>Indeed, the reveal trailer for the game appears to show a variety of environments we can now assume are procedurally generated, including a seemingly poisonous area and a lava-filled cave.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>That looks pretty poisonous to me | <span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Swamps aren't the only returning feature either, as Ishizaki previously confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">"small number" of enemies from across the Dark Souls series will appear in Nightreign</a>. Eagle-eyed fans already spotted The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> in the trailer, but presumably more will be included, perhaps as part of these randomised events?</p>
<p>It won't be long before we can find out more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">Nightreign as its beta test takes place this weekend</a> for those who previously registered. The test will last from Friday 14th February to Monday 17th February as a series of three hour long sessions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
