            <p>A patent filed by Sony over a year ago has resurfaced, and shows the company has ideas for an AI 'ghost' that could assist players if they get stuck in a game.</p>
<p>The aforementioned patent, which was recently noticed by <a href="https://www.allaboutai.com/ai-news/sony-ai-ghost-player-patent/">allaboutAI</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, describes an "overlay" version of a player's character. When in use, this overlay character would be able to demonstrate actions, such as how to solve a puzzle or by providing "example controller input button sequences", which would in turn allow a player to then progress with the game.</p>

<p>In some cases, an AI 'ghost' could also have a conversation with the player's character and give some "guidance or instruction" about what to do. Other times, the ghost could complete a section for the player. It sounds like an evolution of PlayStation's Game Help on PS5, which offers users tips and guides via videos and images on screen.</p>
<p>An image within the patent also describes mode switching, which would encapsulate four different options for users to be able to choose from. These are: Story Mode, Combat Mode, Exploration Mode and Full Game Mode .</p>
<p>"Although video game technology has seen many advances, some players find themselves in need of assistance. Games become very complicated, so players who are not experts oftentimes quit playing or find it hard to complete tasks," <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">the filing reads</a>. "Players are able to do research for the game or even look up prior gameplays on internet sites, but that process is time consuming and many times not very relevant to tasks and/or scenarios currently being encountered by the player."</p>
<p>Should these AI Ghost helpers become a reality, it appears that they would be trained on existing footage of any given PlayStation game.</p>



<p>Assistance in games is, of course, nothing new. As I have already mentioned, the PS5 has Game Help, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-soon-add-ai-copilot-to-minecraft-offering-real-time-advice">Microsoft has its own Copilot AI feature</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, games more broadly often include a range of features to make them more accessible for as wide an audience as possible. This includes everything from adjustable difficulty levels to controller remapping, colour-blind modes and in-game hint systems (I personally quite liked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returning-to-monkey-island-with-its-legendary-creators">book that Guybrush had tucked away in Return to Monkey Island</a>, but there are plenty of other examples out there).</p>

<p>As for AI, it remains an area of heated debate within the industry. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. That number is now likely to be higher, and a more recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Last year, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>

            <p>An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> player calling for help while playing the game had their door kicked in by a concerned neighbour, who thought their wails were a sign of real-world distress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/">User Dreamthorp on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a> was house-sitting for a friend and decided to boot up some Arc Raiders. While playing ,they claim to have been calling to their squadmates for help when a nearby neighbour heard the commotion. Fearing the worst, they came to the rescue, kicking the door.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the door didn't break thanks to the two deadbolts keeping it locked and secure. Dreamthorp claims that the friend they were house-sitting finds the whole situation funny, and the whole story has a happy ending, with Dreamthorp posting a picture of a six-pack of Shiners left at the neighbour's door as thanks.</p>

<p>Arc Raiders continues its hot streak as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">both a top seller over the Christmas holiday</a> and one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">of the most popular games out right now</a>, players remain engaged with its blend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">hyper aggressive extraction-style PvP gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">the interesting social dynamics present in an otherwise perilous experience</a>.</p><p>As for what's to come in 2026 for Arc Raiders? There's still little in terms of official confirmation on what's coming up for the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-snow-map-condition-flickering-flames">following its winter Cold Snap event</a>. With the year well underway, there's no doubt big news for Arc Raiders is just around the corner.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Rick Lane wrote: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>
