            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a> Season 2, entitled Where Clouds Embrace The Dawn, will launch on 6th June.</p>
<p>Calling it "a significant update and milestone moment" - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-its-not-a-joke-zenless-zone-zero-really-is-coming-to-xbox">the gacha game will also release on the same day for Xbox</a> - HoYoverse teased that in Version 2, players will "embark on a brand-new and exciting journey to Waifei Peninsula, alongside Yixuan from Yunkui Summit".</p>
<p>"In this expansive update, Proxies will venture into the all-new Waifei Peninsula alongside trusted allies such as Yixuan from Yunkui Summit, revitalize the Suibian Temple nestled within the bustling Failume Heights, and take on more challenging Hollow combat in a more open and spacious environment. To commemorate the game's first anniversary, Version 2.0 will bring a wide array of celebration rewards including a free S-Rank Agent, a free S-Rank W-Engine, 1,600 Polychromes and 20 Encrypted Master Tapes," the developer added.</p>

<p>Following the resolution of the Sacrifice crisis in previous chapters, Season 2 sees Proxies further uncover the hidden secrets of Phaethon and experience new Hollow exploration gameplay that harnesses the forces of Ether.</p>
<p>"The region's main city Failume Heights thrives near the Lemnian Hollow, renowned for the rare resource Porcelume. It offers distinctive tea houses, pawnshops, and dessert stalls, inviting Proxies to immerse themselves in the local atmosphere," HoYo added. "Meanwhile, Proxies will take on management of their very own Suibian Temple, upgrade the temple's facilities and earn in-game rewards by dispatching Bangboos, completing commissions, and collecting resources from the Hollows."</p>
<p>Several new allies will join the roster: Yixuan, also known as the Grandmaster, will join the combat as an S-Rank Agent, Ju Fufu, the senior disciple of Yunkui Summit, who will debut as an S-Rank Fire Stun Agent, and Pan Yinhu, Yunkui Summit's A-Rank Physical Defense Agent.</p>
<p>The S-Rank Ether Support Astra Yao and the S-Rank Physical Defense Caesar will return to the Version 2.0 banners.</p>
<p>Players can also expect Hollow Zero: Lost Void to be updated with "new commissions and the possibility to equip multiple Gears to different Agents, adding more strategic options to battles", plus a brand-new 3D map with enhanced navigation features.</p>
<p>"In Version 2.0, Proxies will be able to enter the cinema in Lumina Square to enjoy movies with different characters during the Gravitational Attraction event and obtain exclusive rewards by completing certain tasks, including an A-Rank W-Engine Reel Projector," we're told. "In the Soul of Steel: Golden Bond event, Proxies can pilot sleek mechs into the Hollows, take on a variety of challenges, and earn abundant rewards."</p>
<p>In March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">two voice actors working on Zenless Zone Zero were suddenly recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike over AI abuse</a>, and discovered the change alongside the publication of the game's patch notes. In a statement subsequently shared on social media, the studio said its contracts offer "explicit AI protections, regardless of union status" and it will continue to work on its clients' projects "in the most human way possible".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetherRealm has confirmed there will be no more additional story chapters or characters "from this point on".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the studio said that despite "hearing players' requests for continued game support of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>", "there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released". It will, however, "continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes".</p>

<p>"It's disappointing because there's no thorough QoL, no online lobbies, &amp; locked away skins....you truly gave us an unfinished $140 game," <a href="https://x.com/Mikemetroid/status/1926025851734196480">replied</a> one player. "An extreme low from WB/NRS. What changed over there???"</p>
<p>As for that "next project" NetherRealm refers to? Well, no-one's entirely sure as it's not been formally confirmed as yet, but that's widely thought to be Injustice 3. Let's watch this space.</p>
<p>Some fans aren't surprised by the announcement, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-mortal-kombat-1-definitive-edition-has-fans-thinking-warner-bros-has-quietly-wrapped-up-development">NetherRealm Studios released its surprise Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition on Switch, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC earlier this month with minimal fanfare</a>, bundling together the main game, its Khaos Reigns story expansion, Shang Tsung, two Kombat Packs featuring additional fighters and Kameo characters, some in-game currency, and a selection of skins. Animality finishing moves have also been added in a free update for all players.</p>
<p>"The arrival of the definitive edition meant it was over with the previous games, so... I guess that was it," noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1kmhhqw/this_means_its_over/">one poster on the Mortal Kombat subreddit</a> at the time, a sentiment largely shared across the playerbase.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition costs Â£55/$70 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, while Switch players can pick it up for $60. There's also a Â£50/$60 Definitive Edition Upgrade ($50 on Switch) for Mortal Kombat 1 owners wanting to get everything in the new version without purchasing each bit of DLC separately.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has had an unexpectedly strong start for a sequel to a fairly obscure 13-year Nintendo DS game. And developer Level 5 has now thanked fans for their enthusiasm, pledging to release free DLC in response to its "global success".
</p>
<p>
The Girl Who Steals Time, for context, is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".
</p>
<p>
But in this post-Stardew Valley world - where you can't watch an indie showcase without seeing a dozen new village sims jostling for attention - the newly released Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals seems to resonated with audiences. It's garnered a positive early critical reception and even surpassed 45K concurrents on its first day on Steam (that's more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> managed) - and Level 5 is now celebrating its launch with news of more to come.

<p>
"Due to the game's global success and the warm support from players around the world," it <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250523_01/">wrote in a message on its website</a>, "we have decided to release a free DLC that includes new recipes as well as expanded content under the title 'Update the World!'."
</p>
<p>
Level 5 hasn't shared much in the way of specifics, but it promises "new content designed to make use of high-rarity weapons obtained from Treasure Groves and other sources", as well as "even more opportunities [for players] to showcase their gear". The studio says it's working to release the DLC "as soon as possible", and will provide further details at a later date. It sounds like there's even more on the way too; "We will continue to update and improve Fantasy Life i," it adds, "so that players can enjoy its world more comfortably and for an even longer time." 
</p>
<p>
Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.
