            <p>Two voice actors working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a> have been suddenly recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike over AI abuse, and discovered the change alongside the publication of the game's patch notes.</p>
<p>Emeri Chase, who played Soldier 11, announced they were replaced as they were "unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protections".</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nicholas Thurkettle, who played Lycaon, has also been recast despite not being a member of the union. Both actors only found out about the recasting at the same time as players, when details of <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/37341958">Zenless Zone Zero's latest patch</a> went live.</p>

<p>Chase posted a thread on social media to explain the situation.</p>
<p>"I'd like to clarify that there's a difference between being 'struck' and not being on an Interim Agreement," they said. "Union projects that began work prior to the strike and non-union projects are not 'struck'. But they also do not offer the Union-enforced AI rights we are fighting for.</p>
<p>"Many actors are choosing to voluntarily withhold work on these categories of projects because we feel it is the best way to support the Union's fight for the protections that are critical to our continued ability to create the art we love.</p>
<p>"I knew that by withholding work it was possible I'd be replaced, though of course I hoped they would choose to leave her silent until I was able to return. I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you."</p>

I was replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry.

Any other theories that pop up are incorrect.

</span></p><p>Eurogamer has contacted HoYoverse for further comment.</p>
<p>Today, Eurogamer reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">strike from US actors' union SAG-AFTRA remains ongoing</a> as it warns of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse" in the latest proposal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike began back in July last year</a>, with the main sticking point being the need to protect actors from AI abuse.</p>
<p>While some actors are still working despite the strike, Chase and Thurkettle's situation is a clear example of the risk actors are taking to protect their livelihoods as the dispute continues.</p>
<p>Today the union urged performers to "seriously consider the consequences" of working with game producers at this time, not only in undermining the strike but opening performers to AI misuse.</p>
<p>In related news, HoYoverse announced actor Showtaro Morikubo will no longer voice Ifa in the Japanese version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Genshin_7/status/1899664144800080249">social media announcement</a>, the company stated "due to various circumstances" the actors has "been forced to withdraw from the project".</p>
<p>While no further details have been given, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/genshin-impact-ifa-japanese-voice-actor-suddenly-changed-fans-speculate-that-the-reason-is-political/">Automaton</a> reports fans are speculating it may be due to Morikubo appearing in a live reading back in 2024 called Inochigake no Shougen (Life-risking Testimonies), based on a book of the same name which contains testimonies of Uyghur people. The book likens the Chinese government's treatment of the Uyghur to the suppression and genocide of Jewish people by the Nazi party.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Netflix's first gaming boss has left the company, following a shift in role and various changes behind the scenes last year.
</p>
<p>
Mike Verdu launched and led Netflix's gaming efforts in 2021, but was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflixs-mike-verdu-reveals-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">moved to a new role - VP of Generative AI for games at Netflix</a> - in November last year. At the time, Verdu said peers should "pay no mind to uninformed speculation in the media about changes at Netflix Games", as the changes were a "planned transition".
</p>
<p>
Now, Verdu has departed the company entirely, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc">Game File</a> has reported.
</p>
<p>
The move follows a number of shifts behind the scenes last year, including the hiring of gaming industry veteran Alain Tascan to serve as Verdu's replacement as gaming boss.
</p>
<p>
In October 2024, Netflix closed a major internal game studio led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten, and scrapped its big-budget project before it was ever announced.
</p>
<p>
By January, <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Netflix had reportedly dropped at least six other game projects</a> it was planning to publish - including cosy Hobbit sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, which will now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-yet-again">launch at a later date without the streaming company's involvement</a>.
</p>
<p>
And in February this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">Netflix cut staff at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio</a>. No announcement was made on how many jobs were lost, or what the studio was working on next.
</p>
<p>
As Netflix reorganises its plans, it remains unclear how its gaming focus will look going forward - other than Verdu will not be part of it.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix celebrated its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-celebrates-its-biggest-quarter-yet-by-putting-uk-prices-up-again">increasing its prices yet again</a>, including here in the UK.

            <p>
Lego is working to build up its in-house game development, the company's boss has revealed. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf">The Financial Times</a>, Lego boss Niels Christiansen said the company was increasing its focus on video game experiences created by its own teams, following years of partnerships with outside companies. 
</p>
<p>
"We can definitely say, as long as we're under the Lego brand, we can cover experiences for kids of all ages, digital or physical," Christiansen said. "[In-house game development] is something we're building up. We have made quite a few investments in the future â€“ I'd almost rather overinvest. That's the benefit of being family-owned and long term."
</p>
<p>
For over a decade, Lego games were mostly made by British studio TT Games, with a popular tie-in to a big movie franchise released every year.
</p>
<p>
For 15 years, TT Games pumped out dozens of annual Lego games with a familiar formula, based on Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel and DC characters. It also mounted the ambitious toys-to-life effort <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But that era of Lego gaming is largely over, with only one entry - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> - in the past six years. TT Games is reportedly still working on a further title, but it is not expected in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Lego has licensed its brand to a wider set of developers - most notably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games, and the recent launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, co-developed by Guerilla Games and published by Sony. Fortnite now has a deep integration with Lego, with minifigure versions of most of its digital skins, two large Lego game modes, and countless mini-games made by Lego itself and fans.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, now rebranded to Lego Fortnite Odyssey, is a Minecraft-y offering regularly played by around 50,000 people concurrently within the main Fortnite client. Last December, the company also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">launched Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>, a gentle life sim and house decoration game, to a smaller audience.
</p>
<p>
For now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-lego-horror-cheerful-games-and-others-we-just-cant-get-into">The Lego Group has a small team of designers building and launching game concepts within Fortnite</a>, which now has an impressive replication of Lego bricks and physics baked into Epic's Unreal Engine. It'll be interesting to see what's next, as the wait for TT Games' next old-school Lego game continues.
</p>
<p>"I hope it will never be done," head of Lego gaming at The Lego Group Remi Marcelli told Eurogamer last year, of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-lego-fortnite-i-hope-it-will-never-be-done">the company's big Fortnite mode, which continues to expand</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Three top Ubisoft employees have appeared in a French court, accused of harassing employees before their departure from the company almost five years ago.
</p>
<p>
The trio includes Serge Hascoet, Ubisoft's previous chief creative officer and right-hand man to company boss Yves Guillemot, plus the former VP of editorial and creative services Tommy Francois, and Guillaume Patrux, a game designer and director.
</p>
<p>
All three deny sexually and psychologically harassing and humiliating employees during their tenures at the company, up until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">they resigned or were dismissed in 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
Details discussed during the court appearance this week (thanks, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250310-former-ubisoft-bosses-on-trial-in-france-over-alleged-harassment-1">France24</a>) include accusations of racist comments and behaviour by Hascoet, who allegedly asked a Muslim employee if she agreed with the Islamic State terrorist group in the wake of the 2015 Paris terrorist attack. It's alleged that the same staff member had their computer desktop wallpaper changed to that of bacon, and had food placed on their desk during the fasting month of Ramadan.
</p>
<p>
A string of allegations concerning Francois includes him having regularly watched porn in the company's open-plan office, kissing colleagues, and remarking on their appearance by calling them "ugly" or a "slut". Francois specifically is accused of sexual assault for allegedly forcing himself on a young employee during a Christmas party. He also allegedly forced a young employee to perform a headstand while wearing a skirt.
</p>
<p>
Patrux, meanwhile, stands accused of psychological harassment.
</p>
<p>
The trial has now been adjourned until 2nd June after lawyers complained they had not been given long enough with the case's documentation.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Ubisoft for comment.

            <p>
Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> is suing PlayerAuctions - an online marketplace already targeted in a complaint by Roblox - accusing it of selling "heavily modified" player accounts, items, and virtual currency obtained through hacks and cheats.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's lawsuit - filed in the US Central District Court of California last week and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit">spotted by Polygon</a> - targets PlayerAuctions' Chinese owner Paiao Network Technology. It accuses the company of running a "lawless enterprise", claiming it has "full knowledge" of the alleged "rampant infringement and other unauthorised conduct" happening on its site.
</p>
<p>
"[This] is not a regular online marketplace," reads the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon">filing</a>. "Instead, [it] runs a sophisticated sales platform and actively recruits 'sellers' skilled at using hacking software and other exploits to create infringing digital goods and to provide illegal 'services' to players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>." More specifically, Take-Two claims PlayerAuctions contains "thousands of listings for unauthorised, infringing GTA 5 content â€“ including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency â€“ all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two claims PlayerAuctions sells accounts manipulated through hacking to provide "exorbitantly high game level ranking and in-game currency amounts", as well as content ordinarily only accessible through gameplay or purchases. "At the scale of its website," continues the lawsuit, "PlayerAuctions risks upending the GTA 5 player experience and interferes with the balance and fairness of the game."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two claims it has "repeatedly confronted PlayerAuctions with evidence of infringement and other tortious conduct", but says its cease and desist orders have so far been ignored - all while Paiao Network Technology allegedly continues to reap "millions in revenue" from infringement. Take-Two says it's bringing its complaint to the court in order to "shut down PlayerAuctions' rampant infringing online marketplace, end its corrupt business model, and protect the integrity of GTA 5 for its players."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two is claiming relief for copyright and trademark infringement, and is requesting the court "preliminarily and permanently" prohibits PlayerAuctions from selling accounts, virtual goods, and virtual currency in GTA 5 or any of its other games. Additionally, Take-Two wants PlayerAuctions to be prohibited from "aiding, abetting, contributing to, or otherwise assisting, benefiting or inducing" hacking of its software or infringing its GTA trademarks.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's lawsuit follows a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/824845348/Roblox-vs-PlayerAuctions-via-Polygon">similar filing against PlayerAuctions by Roblox Corporation last month</a>. The company is also seeking monetary damages, as well as requesting the court prevents PlayerAuctions from buying, selling, and trading Roblox-related products.
