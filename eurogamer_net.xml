            <p>
Capcom has unveiled a bustling in-game event schedule for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, with the first oppurtunity to gain new gear available now.
</p>
<p>
Six events will go live over the next three weeks, each lasting for a week or two, with rewards ranging from new headgear to... more cheese? I guess <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">Monster Hunter Wilds is really leaning into its cheese naan meme</a>.
</p>
<p>
The schedule begins now with Ku-Ku Gone Cuckoo, an event based in the Scarlet Forest which requires you gather special materials to obtain the Mimiphyta α headgear. This runs until 18th March.

<p>
The Stalking Supper event is also now active, which rewards you for gathering more Kunafa Cheese in Windward Plains to be used on your barbecue grill. This runs until 11th March.
</p>
<p>
Upcoming quests include Tongue-Tied, running from 11th-18th March, which involves gathering Armor Spheres, and then a trio of new events beginning on 18th March.
</p>
<p>
These include Ballet in the Rain, which involves gathering Glowing Orb - Swords, Sand-Scarred Soul, for gathering Glowing Orb - Armors, and Like A Fire Hidden By Sand, where Capcom says you can obtain "the Expedition Headgear α, a piece of equipment based on the emblem of the expedition!"
</p>
<p>
Capcom has a <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/event-quest/en-us/schedule?utc=0">full event schedule on the Monster Hunter Wilds website</a>.

Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom announced that Monster Hunter Wilds was its fastest-selling game ever</a>, with 8m copies shipped so far.

            <p>PlayStation has been hit with more layoffs from its Visual Arts studio, following the recent cancellations of multiple live-service games.</p>
<p>The layoffs come amid a restructuring of Sony's US studios, as an unknown number of staff from the San Diego-based Visual Arts studio will be let go this week.</p>
<p>Visual Arts supported first-party development (including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us remasters), and while these new cuts include staff who contributed to the recently cancelled live-service game from Bend Studio among others, <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734">Kotaku</a> has reported the layoffs are more widespread.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sony for further details on these layoffs.</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">several cancelled projects from Sony</a>, including a live-service game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and another from Bluepoint reportedly based within the God of War series.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony cancelled live-service shooter Concord</a> back in September, admitting "our initial launch didn't land". A month later, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">shut down developer Firewalk Studios</a> as the game would remain permanently offline.</p>
<p>This time last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony laid off 900 staff</a> equating eight percent of its workforce. The reductions were predominantly due to the closure of its London Studio and reductions at Firesprite.</p>
<p>On the flipside, Sony still has its Horizon live-service game in development, which has now added former Bungie senior design lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjamesproctor/">Chris Proctor</a> to its team as a design director. At Bungie, his focus was on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s weapons.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Dotemu and Guard Crush Games, the studios behind 2020's widely acclaimed beat 'em up sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, are teaming up again for something a little bit different: Absolum, a fantasy themed side-scrolling brawler with rogue-like elements that's launching this year.
</p>
<p>
Absolum aims to combine "thrilling arcade beat 'em up action" with "intricate, refined combat" to create what Dotemu is describing as a "rogue 'em up". There's talk of quests, branching pathways, NPCs, unlockable items, permanent warrior upgrades, and combinable character skills - all in a fantasy adventure channeling the spirit of classic brawlers including Golden Axe.
</p>
<p>
Absolum's action plays out across Talamh, a world of wonder and cosmic horrors gripped by warfare following a cataclysmic magical event. That's where the game's four-strong band of rebels comes in, all setting out on an epic quest to oppose the Sun King Azra and liberate Talamh after they're imbued with powerful magic.

<p>
All four rebels are playable (either solo or co-operatively) and feature their own unique skill set and personality, with two having been revealed so far. There's Galandra, for instance - an agile, sword-clad fighter designed to excel in close-quarters combat - while Karl is a tanklike dwarf armed with devastating punches and a rifle that can bring down opponents from afar.
</p>
<p>
"Absolum blends arcade-like melee combat with spells, counters, upgradable abilities and uniquely powerful playable fighters," explains Dotemu, "hosting a grand, high-stakes quest across an array of hand-crafted stages." Those stages - and Absolum's striking visual style - have been brought to life by the artists and animators at animation studio Supamonks.
</p>
<p>
Absolum doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">via Steam</a>) sometime later this year.

            <p>
Three years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s Expanded &amp; Enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the game's next-gen features have - just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-gets-new-pc-version-that-adds-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-features-for-free">Rockstar promised last month</a> - finally made the jump to PC in a free update for all existing users.
</p>
<p>
From today, Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy (as the original PC version is now being referred to) has been delisted from PC store fronts to make way for GTA 5 Enhanced. And as per <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/7551a7k917554a/free-upgrade-for-grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-now-available">Rockstar's announcement</a>, this new edition introduces a range of features, including new vehicles, new ambient wildlife, and support for Rockstar's GTA+ subscription service.
</p>
<p>
It also adds new graphics options, including the ray traced shadows and reflections first introduced on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, alongside other additions - such as ambient occlusion and global illumination - exclusive to PC. That's in addition to support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates, as well as AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS support - with Frame Generation support coming at a later date.

<p>
Elsewhere, DualSense controller owners can now use its adaptive triggers during gameplay, and Rockstar is also touting faster loading times via SSD and DirectStorage, as well as enhanced audio - including Dolby Atmos, and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music.
</p>
<p>
And for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">Grand Theft Auto Online</a> players, the updated PC version gets kernel-based anti-cheat protections and proactive voice chat moderation, as well as the lies of new vehicles, Chameleon Paints, and high-performance mods from Hao's Special Works. 
</p>
<p>
All this comes with a higher set of minimum and recommended PC specifications, but anyone unable to meet those increased demands can still access Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy via the game's launcher. Be aware, though, the two versions are considered entirely separate, meaning friends will all need to be using the same version if they want to play together. Additionally, it's <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/89953o1153a39a/pre-load-the-free-grand-theft-auto-v-pc-upgrade-now">necessary to migrate Story Mode and Online progress to the new edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
To coincide with the launch of GTA 5 Enchanced, Rockstar is discounting the game by 50 percent on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/grand-theft-auto-v">Epic</a> store, bringing the price down to £14.99 until 20th March.
</p>
<p>
All this PC activity comes as Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">prepares to release GTA 6 this autumn</a> - although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">publisher Take-Two has hinted the PC version won't arrive until later</a>. That tallies with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recent claims by accessories company Corsair Gaming</a>, which suggested the PC release isn't due until "early 2026".
