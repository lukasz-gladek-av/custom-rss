            <p>
Facebook owner Meta has reportedly cut over 100 jobs at Reality Labs, the division responsible for its virtual reality and augmented reality software and hardware, including Quest.
</p>
<p>
The news was initially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/655835/meta-layoffs-reality-labs-vr-supernatural">reported by The Verge</a>, whose sources said the cuts had impacted teams within Meta's Oculus Studios - which is focused on developing games for the company's Quest headsets - as well as "some" employees from Reality Labs' hardware arm. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/meta-lays-off-more-than-100-staff-across-reality-labs-unit?embedded-checkout=true">later reported "more than 100" workers were impacted</a>.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to The Verge, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed cuts had been made within Oculus Studios, saying "some" teams were "undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size." Clayton added the changes were intended to "help Studios work more efficiently on future mixed reality experiences for our growing audience, while still delivering great content for people today." The Verge says Meta declined to comment on layoffs outside of Oculus Studios.
</p>
<p>
Impacted staff include the team behind Meta Quest fitness application Supernatural, which Meta acquired for $400m USD - alongside its developer Within - in 2023, following an anti-trust battle with the FTC. The Supernatural team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/getsupernatural/permalink/9571469649572696/">confirmed it had been affected by Meta's latest layoffs</a> in a statement shared on Facebook, writing it was "deeply saddened" by the loss of "some of our incredibly talented team members".
</p>
<p>
Despite the layoffs, Meta says it remains "committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged."
</p>
<p>
Meta has dramatically reduced staff numbers of the last few years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-announces-further-10000-job-losses">cutting more than 20,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023</a>. Lone Echo developer Ready at Dawn - which Meta acquired in 2020 - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-heavily-impacted-by-latest-meta-layoffs">heavily impacted</a> by those cuts and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-and-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down-by-meta">closed down at the end of last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today's Reality Labs layoffs follow Meta's admission last April that the AR/VR <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/facebook-owner-meta-loses-a-billion-per-month-on-its-arvr-division-but-believes-it-will-be-worth-it">division had lost over $1bn every month</a> for most of the last two years, with the company saying it expected losses to increase as it deepened its investment.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> arrives this June, but there'll be an opportunity to check out its sandy survival action ahead of its full launch. Developer Funcom has announced it's holding the game's "largest beta yet" in May, with keys being made available to "tens of thousands" of players.
</p>
<p>
Funcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcoms-open-world-survival-mmo-dune-awakening-gets-first-trailer">unveiled Dune: Awakening in 2022</a>, as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/conan-exiles-developer-funcom-lands-deal-to-make-dune-games">deal to make "at least" three games</a> set in the Dune universe. It whisks players to Arrakis for an open-world, multiplayer survival adventure drawing from Frank Herbert's sci-fi novels and Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations.
</p>
<p>
Dune Awakening has been in closed beta for over a year now, but with its full release now looming following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-delayed-for-last-minute-changes-from-beta-testers">brief delay</a>, Funcom is preparing one final, large-scale beta blowout that'll run from 9th-12th May. The studio is calling it Dune: Awakening's "largest beta yet... with a huge number of new players joining compared to previous closed betas".

<p>
It'll give players a chance to experience survival in the vast, wormy deserts of Arrakis, as well as "most of" Dune: Awakening's first story act - which Funcom says should equal around 20 hours of playtime. Unlike previous betas, there's no NDA to sign, and all gameplay can be shared.
</p>
<p>
To be in with a chance of taking part in the beta, players have a number of options. They can either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">visit Dune: Awakening's Steam page</a> and hit the 'Request Access' button, or tune into the Global LAN Party Broadcast on 10th May, which will include developer chat and more. Funcom says "tens of thousands" of keys will be handed out during the broadcast, and these can be used to gain immediate access to the Dune: Awakening beta weekend.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening gets its full Steam launch on 10th June, and an Xbox Series X/S and PS5 release is due at a later date. It's looking pretty promising too; Eurogamer's Robert Purchese came away impressed after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">going hands-on with it earlier this year</a>, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within.... keep an eye on this one."
