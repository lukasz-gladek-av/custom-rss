            <p>As we creep ever closer to 13th April, HBO has dropped an all-new teaser for the second season of its critically-acclaimed series, The Last of Us.</p>
<p>Once again, the teaser shows just how closely the TV adaptation mirrors the game, with some scenes seemingly reenacted shot-for-shot from The Last of Us Part 2, including the barn dance and the hospital basement.</p>
<p>Please note, <strong>there will be some story spoilers for The Last of Us Part 2 - and therefore potentially the show - below</strong>.</p>

<p>The teaser is barely two minutes long, but it sure packs a lot in, giving us a peek at the Scars, the Washington Liberation Front (WLF) soldiers, and Nora, bathed in the blood-red light of the hospital basement.</p>
<p>We also get brief glimpses of Dina and Jesse, a familiar-looking troop stomping through the snow on a mission, and the museum visit, too.</p> <div>

<p>Interestingly, we also see an Infected slowly exhaling a plume of spores into the air. Whilst much more in keeping with the original game narrative, it perhaps hints at how the Cordyceps infection has adapted to survive for the show's second season.</p>
<p>As the words "Every path has a price" flash up towards the end of the video, Ellie looks at Joel in disbelief and says: "You swore".</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">set to kick off in the US on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, but showrunner Craig Mazin has already confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">will not cover the entirety of Part 2's narrative</a>. It will, however, feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">a lot more infected than the first season</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, we learned Joe Pantoliano, Alanna Ubach, Ben Ahlers, Hettienne Park, Robert John Burke, and Noah Lamanna <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">will all be joining Bella Ramsey's Ellie and Pedro Pascal's Joel</a> when the second season airs next month.</p>

            <p>Players have blasted NetEase for a perceived lack of moderation across Marvel Rival lobbies.</p>
<p>"Forget about loser queue, I want to get out of racist queue," wrote redditor Murkwan on the official Marvel Rivals subreddit. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/forget_about_loser_queue_i_want_to_get_out_of//">post</a> has since been locked and deleted, but not before securing 1400 likes and almost 500 comments, the majority of which agreed with the OP.</p>

<p>Whilst many players seem to get grief merely for playing certain characters (primarily Jeff the Landshark), others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk7gf9/">say</a> they regularly hear racist and sexist slurs, but "haven't gotten a ban notification for weeks" even when they report offending players (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-racism-no-username-moderation-called-out/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"The problem is that this takes a toll on you," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgj7stz/">explained one player</a>, responding to a suggestion that players should "mute, report, block" and move on.</p>
<p>"As a woman, I don't use mic unless with my friends. If I speak with random teammates I'll always get some insult or disgusting comment. I just ignore, report and block, but it's not nice at all. It's not like 'haha what a loser'. First time maybe. The third game you hear something like that you just want to stop playing even if you love the game.</p>
<p>"So in cases of racism, it's the same," they added. "Yeah, ignore those losers, but reading or hearing insults over and over again makes you really want to not play anymore."</p>
<p>"I'm sick of people telling women what they need to do to counter the harassment they're experiencing like that's their job," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk4gxa/">added</a> another respondent. "That's just the digital version of telling women not to dress some specific way or they're 'asking for it'."</p>
<p>Black players also contributed to the thread, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjh1br/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjornc/">admitting</a> "comms stay off with randoms" completely, even in ranked play.</p>
<p>Other players have taken to X/Twitter, with this commenter writing: "Seriously?? MarvelRivals, wheres the moderation??" asked one player, including a <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878646544142086654">screenshot</a> of a grossly antisemetic username. "Big fan of the game but seeing this mid game is gross."</p>
<p>"Its even worse [because] I can't leave the match without being penalised and having my own gameplay experience suffer, so I just have to play with this person," they <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878647306997952674">added</a>.</p>
<p>"When you think about it, it's even weirder when it's in a Marvel game," said u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgkeiwq/">fistfightcrash</a>.</p>
<p>"Stan Lee was pretty clear that what the X-men was originally about was the civil rights movement. This is a Stan Lee quote from the 60s:</p>
<p>'Let's lay it right on the line. Bigotry and racism are among the deadliest social ills plaguing the world today. It's totally irrational, patently insane to condemn an entire race.'</p>
<p>"If you're racist, how could you possibly think this is your space?" they concluded. "Unless you're real old, Marvel was probably vocally anti-racist before you were born."</p>
<p>We've reached out to NetEase for comment.</p>
<p>Last month, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's not all, either - Update 3 also brings the "highly-requested" return of the Western theme.</p>
<p>As for Update 4? Frontier's still being coy, but so far it's revealed players will able to build their own restaurants in which you'll have to "satisfy multiple guest needs and tolerances", Frontier Workshop extra features such as a Featured Creators list, alerts, and a What's Hot list, plus career maps in Sandbox mode in Act 2.</p> <div>

<p>We can also expect stock coasters (part 3), an as-yet-unannounced additional ride, plus "franchise mode improvements" and "ongoing stability and performance enhancements". Expect more details as we get closer to April.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC, whilst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-outlined-bringing-more-rides-and-continued-performance-improvements">February introduced new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars</a>.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," Matt wrote in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, awarding it 2 out of 5 stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
