            <p>Soulframe, the upcoming fantasy action RPG by Digital Extremes, has totally overhauled its progression system as part of the latest Preludes alpha update. Whereas before player progress involved a more traditional skilling system, a more intuitive alternative has been integrated.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of the three in-game Virtues - Courage, Spirit, and Grace - which to put simply represent melee, magic, and ranged respectively. Prior to this update, you could invest points into these Virtues to build towards the kind of playstyle you want.</p>
<p>With the latest update, players can instead see their virtues shift automatically with each level up. In addition, they can equip a 'Virtue Prism' to concentrate on a particular direction for their character, which will result in the virtues shifting manually. In addition, a new armour system attaches virtue scaling to equipment, the idea being a full set of melee armour will work better with more Courage, etc.</p>
<p>Alongside these drastic changes to player progression, more customisation options have been added to the game. These include face, hair, and weapon customisation, all of which can be played with via the Verminia in the Nightfold hub. There are also three new weapons to unlock: the Clivers, Basker's Wrest, and Seathorn.</p><p>Finally, there's a new mission type in which you destroy polluting towers dotted across the map. Also,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026"> if you watched the Tennocon trailer last year</a>, you may remember a big bear boss battle! Beating that now unlocks a more challenging open world bear boss that you can take on for tantalising rewards.</p>
<p>When Soulframe will leave this period of Prelude alpha tests remains a mystery, though it's clear the team at Digital Extremes is cramming as many updates to the game as they can before a big launch event, perhaps a smart move <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframes-leads-dont-know-if-itll-survive-the-brutal-live-service-market-so-theyre-betting-big-on-a-community-first-approach">given how treacherous the live service space is</a>. That being said, players have been able to spend some cash early to support development, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-is-getting-founders-packs">Founders packs offering exclusive cosmetics and more</a>.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil</a> franchise is the <em>bad </em>kind of nightmare when it comes to adaptations. The movie series kickstarted by Paul W.S. Anderson back in 2002 found tonnes of success, but it's hard to suggest it was quality blockbuster filmmaking. Then came an <em>even worse </em>(despite all the reverence for the source material) movie in 2021, that failed to create a new continuity. And let's not talk about Netflix's 2022 series... Now, in 2026, we're waiting to see whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger can right this ship</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside Sinners, it's safe to say Weapons was one of 2025's biggest and most celebrated horror movies, mixing refreshing thrills, raw horror, unexpected comedy and wild twists in a way we rarely see these days. By all accounts, Cregger <em>should </em>have the sauce to make a very fun Resident Evil movie even if he chooses to completely step away from what's been done before in movies and video games. (And it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-resident-evil-film-lives-in-the-world-of-re2-and-re3-but-with-the-tone-of-4">he's doing exactly that</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, during a <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/oliver-berben-constantin-film-resident-evil-berlin-efm-1236718667/">chat with Deadline</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/weapons-director-had-carte-blanche-to-do-whatever-he-wanted-with-resident-evil-movie-reboot-studio-ceo-says/">VGC</a>), Constantin Film CEO Oliver Berben, who stepped into the role nearly two years ago, elaborated on how the team is approaching this new attempt at 'cracking the code' of the enduring horror franchise. First, he doubled down on the idea that it's "far away from everything that is connected to Resident Evil, only because Zach Cregger has his own style".</p>
<p>Like horror aficionados who have been keeping track and loving the last few years' best flicks in the space, Berben is also of the opinion the genre needs voices willing to take a handful of risks with every project. Of course, Cregger's body of work in the genre so far perfectly embodies that spirit, so it was "a no-brainer" to give him "the carte blanche to do whatever he wanted to do with that IP".</p><p>"With Resident Evil, we have had an incredible journey with one of the most successful international IPs of more than a billion dollars in box office for many years and now we are creating something new, not just a new story idea, but to allow a new generation to take the IP into their own hands and form something different," Berben added.</p>
<p>The next Resident Evil movie, which doesn't have an official title yet, was also co-written by Cregger alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-biggest-surprise-of-the-night-a-brand-new-aaa-john-wick-game-coming-from-the-developer-of-space-marine-2">John Wick</a> veteran Shay Hatten. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">stars Austin Abrams (who already was a fan-favourite in Weapons)</a>, Paul Walter Hauser, Zach Cherry, and Kali Reis, among others. It's set to be distributed theatrically by Sony Pictures and will invade cinemas on September 18, 2026.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a pretty sweet co-op game full of surprises. It also has one of the best original soundtracks of 2025, and that includes its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3531720/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN_The_Forsaken_Hollows/">Forsaken Hollows</a> DLC. Sadly, we were barred from putting together the ultimate FromSoftware-made Soulslike playlist until the expansion's music was made officially available. Now, the wait is finally over.</p>
<p>On 16th February, the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/2023396957709058235?s=20">Elden Ring social media channels</a> announced The Forsaken Hollows' unique tracks were free and out in the wild after a longer-than-desirable wait. It's no secret one of the most celebrated aspects of FromSoftware's output is the amazing compositions that accompany every banger, and Shoi Miyazawa's work on the DLC deserved to be fully released too.</p>
<p>You can find all the available options to listen to the full soundtrack <a href="https://lnk.to/vfQOnLvR">here</a>; Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, Line Music, and more are included, so co-publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware went big with the release once again. The full album runs slightly over 44 minutes versus Nightreign's 2 hours and 24 minutes, fitting the DLC's size when compared to the full base game.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-composer-on-marilyn-manson-myst-and-more-ign-first">IGN interviewed Miyazawa</a> about his work on Nightreign and experience working for FromSoftware. He admitted he was an Armored Core fan first and foremost, well before joining the studio's efforts, and said King Crimson and Marilyn Manson are some of his key musical influences. For <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Nightreign, however, the vibes were understandably more dark fantasy-like, and most players would agree he's created legendary soundtracks for these games alongside the other credited composers. Let's hope this isn't his last rodeo in the Lands Between.</p>
