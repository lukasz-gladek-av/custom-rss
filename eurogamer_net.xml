            <p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">announced</a> that it is raising the price of the PS5 in the US. The price increase of $50 affects all PS5 models and will come into effect from 21st August.</p>
<blockquote><p>Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.</p>
<p>The updated recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99</li>
<li>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Sony stated that its prices for PS54 accessories are unchanged, and that there are no price changes to announce for additional markets.</p>
<p>The PS5 has already seen price rises in other markets, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">UK getting its own hike back in April</a> this year. Australia and New Zealand also got the news back then that they'd have to pay more to own a PS5.</p>
