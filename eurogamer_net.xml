            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-4">Far Cry 4</a> may have been released over a decade ago (yes, really), but Ubisoft clearly isn't done updating it.</p>
<p>Far Cry 4 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2014-far-cry-4">which first made its debut in November 2014</a> - is set to receive an update for the PlayStation 5, which will see it able to run at 60fps. It has been able to do this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dxJFCgkNws">Xbox Series X/S since 2021</a>.</p>
<p>The notes for this particular Far Cry 4 PlayStation update are pretty snappy. It simply says Version 1.08 introduced "support 60 FPS on PS5 console", so there you have it.</p>
<p>This is not the first Ubisoft game to get itself a boost like this. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-odyssey-gets-60fps-support-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-tomorrow">Assassin's Creed Odyssey got itself a 60fps update</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S back in 2021. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-syndicate-gets-ps5-pro-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-enhancements">also got one in November last year</a>.</p>
<p>Now, fans are hopeful that more Far Cry releases will also get themselves a 60fps boost. In fact, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1kacv3l/comment/mplpid3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user</a> has even said they will offer up their soul to Ubisoft if grants <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Far Cry 3</a> some 60fps love (and fixes some controller issues). This seems a touch excessive to me, but I would also be pretty happy heading back to the Rook Islands for a little nosey around with an improved framerate accompanying me.</p>
<p>"Far Cry 4 does all the things that its predecessor did and more - more weapons, more vehicles, more modes, more ground to cover - so if all you're looking for is a big old wide open space to tear up with a friend, go forth and make merry with mortar," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-4-review">Eurogamer's original Far Cry 4 review</a>. "Far Cry 4 is well worth a visit, but it's more a backpacker's delight than a five-star island paradise."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
