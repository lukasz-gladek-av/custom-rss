            <p>
Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s female V are both set to join <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.
</p>
<p>
The crossover is expected to go live tonight, with the characters and various accessories available to buy in the game's shop.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games confirmed the crossover and showed off the appearance of the characters within Fortnite yesterday, in a post on social media that teased: "We're expecting some guests from Night City."

It's perhaps not surprising to see Cyberpunk 2077 turn up in Fortnite - its developer CD Projekt Red has forged close ties with Epic Games through its switch to Unreal Engine for future development (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">first trailer for The Witcher 4</a>, and our first look at The Witcher's world in Unreal, debuted this month at The Game Awards). And the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-4-starts-tomorrow-with-geralt-and-doomslayer">Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri all joined Fortnite previously</a>.
</p><p>
Fun fact: this will be Keanu Reeves' second character in Fortnite, after his previous addition as John Wick. But he's not the first actor to get into the game twice. Zendaya (in her Spider-Man and Dune guises) and Harrison Ford (as both Han Solo and Indiana Jones) have also previously found their way into Fortnite more than once.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's latest additions come amidst a typically-busy end of year season for the game. Its Winterfest event is now on offering daily free cosmetic rewards (leading up to a Santa Snoop Dogg skin on Christmas day), heralded by the in-game arrival of Mariah Carey from a giant block of ice. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-and-plungerman-plop-into-fortnite">Skibidi Toilet is now in the game too</a>.

        <p>Key members of original dev team say they were ready and willing to make a sequel.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA reportedly rejected proposals to create a brand new Dead Space game.</p>
<p>Glen Schofield - who directed the original game and went on to co-found both Sledgehammer Games and Callisto Protocol studio, Striking Distance - said that EA shut down a proposal for "Dead Space 4", saying it wasn't "interested right now".</p>
<p>The news follows EA's launch of the critically-acclaimed Dead Space Remake in January 2023, but uncertainty over the franchise's future.</p>

<p>"We tried actually, you know, the three of us. We tried Dead Space 4," Schofield said in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/cU5PrEr1HjM?t=5480">Dan Allen Gaming</a>, alongside his former colleagues, creative director Bret Robbins and animation director Christopher Stone. "We're talking this year."</p><p>"We didn't go too deep. They just said, no, we're not interested right now, we appreciate it, blah blah blah, and you know, we know who to talk to, so we didn't take it any further, and we respected their opinion. They know their numbers and what they have to ship and all that, so..."</p>
<p>"All three of us sat down and wanted to do it," Stone added. "The industry is in a weird place right now. People are really hesitant to take chances on things, so you've got to take it with a grain of salt, who knows, maybe one day. I think we'd all love to do it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, we've got some ideas," Schofield teased.</p>
<p>When asked by Allen if they'd really return to the horror series, Stone said: "I'd make a Dead Space 4," and Schofield simply said: "Yes."</p>
<p>When Bret Robbins didn't say anything, Schofield pointed out that Robbins had "a good game going" given he was "having a great time" working with Dan Houser at Absurd Ventures.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, rumours swirled that despite the Dead Space Remake's critical acclaim, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-series-reportedly-on-ice-following-sequel-remake-rumours">whole series was reportedly "on ice"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Just 15 percent of Steam players spent time with new releases - defined as games released in 2024 - this year.</p>
<p>That's according to Steam itself, which gave us a little insight into the broader playing habits of its players as part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/641297020996289523">Steam Replay 2024</a>.</p>

<p>This year, the recap not only shows you how many games you played and when, but also your favourite genres, the achievements you unlocked (the median was 13), the number of games played (for most, this is four), and your longest streak (the average was six days, apparently).</p>
<p>"How many games did you play, and how does that compare to last year? Did you unlock a bunch of achievements? What about your longest streak? These fun numbers and more are in your Replay," Valve teases.</p>
<p>You also get the chance to be humbled by the amount of time you spent with your most-played games of 2024, as well as a quick recap of any playtests you participated in, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-antitrust-lawsuit-expands-to-include-anyone-who-has-paid-a-commission-to-valve-since-2017">A 2021 antitrust dispute brought against Steam has now been expanded into a class action lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the case concerned just two companies - Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios - but a court document recently showed the motion for class certification has been approved. This means the lawsuit now applies to "any developers, publishers, or individuals" who have honoured Steam's 30 percent cut on any and all purchases on or after 28th January 2017.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
