            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s next patch, 7.2, will release on Tuesday 25th March.</p>
<p>As always, the new patch - titled Seekers of Eternity - will extend the story with new quests and dungeons, a new raid in The Arcadion, a new trial, and more. You can see what's to come in the trailer below - who's the boy with the blue hair?</p>
<p>However, the anticipated Cosmic Exploration and Occult Crescent field operations modes will follow in slightly later patches: the former in patch 7.21 on 22nd April, and the latter in patch 7.25 on 27th May.</p>

<p>The news was shared by director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fydpys-4P4w">latest Letter From The Producer stream</a>.</p>
<p>Highlights from the stream include this look at the flamboyant raid boss coming to The Arcadion a week after patch launch:</p>

<p>Finally, here's Yoshida and global community producer Toshio Murouchi trying on some cute new merch:</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-72-due-end-of-march-with-even-more-final-fantasy-9-references">mentioned in the previous Letter From The Producer</a>, the 7.X series will continue with references to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>. However, it's the Occult Crescent field operation that's perhaps most intriguing.</p>
<p>On a separate island, players can explore the field together to fight monsters and bosses, with a different levelling system based around knowledge collecting. The difference between your level and that of enemies will influence damage dealt and taken, and if incapacitated, players will lose experience points when not revived, which could ultimately result in a loss of knowledge level.</p>
<p>Players will also have a secondary support job to boost their abilities, with classes similar to those in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-v">Final Fantasy 5</a>. This field operation looks to provide a fresh twist on the MMO's co-operative gameplay.</p>
<p>Cosmic Exploration, meanwhile, is a new activity for crafters and gatherers, with new moons arriving with each new patch to explore. Players will explore moons, gather resources, and build bases in a communal experience - its story is all about building a spaceship launching base.</p>
<p>Ahead of the livestream, Yoshida was interviewed by Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/36244">Famitsu</a>, where he stated this patch would be the largest to date. That will please fans who have burned out on the game since the release of Dawntrail.</p>
<p>Other smaller changes Yoshida mentioned include being able to use a mount while running and a new jog mechanic once your sprint runs out in cities and safe areas, both of which will aid with the speed of exploration.</p>
<p>Further, Yoshida told Game Watch he was initially skeptical of including so many Final Fantasy 9 references in Dawntrail and these following patches (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-14-yoshi-p-was-initially-unsure-about-referencing-final-fantasy-9-in-dawntrail/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"Regarding FF9 elements, I was rather torn... At first, I thought it might be best to distance ourselves a little from homages to FF9 and was going to go with that approach," he said.</p>
<p>"FF9 is a masterpiece, and everyone has a strong emotional attachment to it, so I wanted to avoid consciously pulling the story too much in that direction. However, I now think that the current flow of the story is appropriate in light of future developments."</p>
<p>Of course, series fans will be aware of rumours of a Final Fantasy 9 remake, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is yet to officially reveal any such project.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Square Enix revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-series-has-now-sold-over-200m-copies-worldwide">Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200m copies worldwide</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft is considering the launch of a fresh business unit, part-owned by outside companies, that could manage its biggest video game brands.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers">new Bloomberg report</a>, which claims that Ubisoft shareholder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> is being considered for a minority stake in the new venture.
</p>
<p>
The move would likely include lucrative franchises such as Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry. These series would then be owned by this new entity, rather than Ubisoft directly. 
</p>
<p>
This business tactic could see Ubisoft's new entity valued higher than the company itself currently, Bloomberg's report states. At the same time, the Ubisoft mothership would remain owned by its founding Guillemot family - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">something that has reportedly been a sticking point in discussions over Ubisoft's future</a> so far.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Ubisoft confirmed it was undertaking a strategic review to help right-size the business</a>, following years of falling share prices and a string of disappointing game launches - most notably including big budget new hope <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.
</p>
<p>
The company's next big bet, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, has been delayed twice to ensure it arrives next week in the best possible state.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">Ubisoft has cut jobs repeatedly across the business</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">and closed several studios</a> - including its UK based Leamington team. Overall, the company has cut its total staff from 20,279 people in 2022, to 18,666 in September 2024, before its most recent round of redundancies.
</p>
<p>
"As we mentioned during our Q3 sales, the review of various transformational strategic and capitalistic options is ongoing," a Ubisoft spokesperson told Eurogamer this week. 
</p>
<p>
"The Board has established an ad-hoc independent Committee to oversee this formal and competitive process, so as to extract the best value from Ubisoft's assets and franchises for all stakeholders. Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materialises."
