            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a> team has announced that the game will cease to be playable on last-generation PS4 and Xbox One consoles starting 13th November. All development and support for the game will be focused on the PS5 and Xbox Series consoles going forward.</p>
<p>According to the PUBG team, this decision was made to ensure players have a more stable gameplay environment (less crashes) and to improve visuals and performance.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>End of Support for PS4 and Xbox One / Transition to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transition Schedule</strong></p>
<p>During the live server maintenance on November 13, 2025</p>
<p><em>Please note that the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process of each platform. Any updates will be shared separately.</em></p>
<p><strong>Important Notes</strong></p>
<p>After the live server maintenance on November 13, PUBG Console will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS will no longer be downloadable or playable on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Your existing account data and purchased items will be securely preserved. You can log in on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the transition and continue playing with your existing accountâ€”no separate transfer process required.</p>
<p>PlayStation users will need to download the PS5 version of PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS from the PlayStation Store after November 13 in order to continue playing. Xbox users who already have the game installed will receive the current-gen version automatically via Smart Delivery starting November 13.</p>
<p><strong>Refund Information</strong></p>
<p>Refunds for BATTLEGROUNDS Plus and PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS will be handled in accordance with each platform's refund policy and procedures. For more details, please contact the customer support team of your respective platform.</p>
<p><strong>Supported Specs After Transition to Current-Gen Consoles</strong></p>
<p>Following the transition of PUBG Console to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on November 13, the supported specifications will be as follows:</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<th></th>
<th>Xbox Series S</th>
<th>Xbox Series X</th>
<th>PlayStation 5</th>
<th>PlayStation 5 Pro</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Resolution</th>
<td>1080p/1440p</td>
<td>2160p</td>
<td>1440p</td>
<td>2160p</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>FPS</th>
<td>60fps/30fps</td>
<td>60fps</td>
<td>60fps</td>
<td>60fps</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Xbox Series S supports either 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps, and you can choose between the two settings.</p>
<p>Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 Pro support Dynamic 4K resolution.</p>
<p>The supported specifications for current-gen consoles were determined through extensive technical review and internal testing to ensure the most stable and optimized PUBG Console gameplay experience. In particular, memory and graphical specifications have been carefully configured with future content updates in mind, to ensure the system is well-prepared to support them smoothly.</p>
<p>As PUBG Console supports cross-play between platforms, fairness across all platforms was one of our top priorities. With this in mind, our goal is to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To account for differences in hardware performance, Xbox Series S will offer selectable options such as Resolution Mode and Performance Mode.</p>
