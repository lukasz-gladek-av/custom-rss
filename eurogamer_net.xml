            <p>The next Call of Duty installment was announced over the weekend, along with its release platforms: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 is slated to debut across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7's omission of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> release (at least presently) from the launch platform line-up has raised some eyebrows due to the fact that, back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-agreement-for-call-of-duty">Microsoft announced a deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to its platforms</a> on "the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity".</p>
<p>However, while for now there is no word of a Switch 2 release for Black Ops 7, the team is "committed" to bringing the Call of Duty series to Nintendo, Activision has told Eurogamer.</p>

<p>In a statement shared with Eurogamer, Activision confirmed: "We're committed to getting the franchise on Switch. Both teams [are] working on it. Will share details when ready."</p>
<p>On its release, Black Ops 7 will be able to be played solo or with friends "in a thrilling and innovative" co-op campaign, while also having the series' "signature" multiplayer experience. This will include new maps and more from Zombies.</p>
<p>The upcoming game is being helmed by Treyarch and Raven Software, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">developers promising the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet</a>. It stars Heroes and Gilmore Girls' Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason.</p>
<p>We can expect further details on Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this summer, the team has said, so stay tuned for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
