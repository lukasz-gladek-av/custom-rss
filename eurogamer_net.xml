            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you're the sort of player that jumps into the yearly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> experience, there's probably one thing that's stuck with you more than anything else: that obscene download size.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the catch-all Call of Duty app (often referred to as Call of Duty HQ) via Xbox wants me to free up 381.19GB of space on my PC hard drive in order to install all the 'recommended' files it needs to run. The Steam app only requires 'at least' an SSD with 128GB available space, which is still, frankly, too much.</p>

<p>In an announcement made via <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1949968296121344261">Activision's CODUpdates account</a> on X, the publisher announced:</p>
<p>"On July 29 at 9am PT, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will be moved from the main Call of Duty install and become standalone downloads."</p>
<p>That means, sometime this week, you will be able to load the games on their own - without the need for the massive download offered by the Call of Duty HQ app. In short, as soon as tomorrow (30th July), anyone that owns either of the games will be able to launch directly into the titles once downloaded. Read: no faffing with interstitial menus or confusing screens via the somewhat cumbersome app.</p>

</figure>
<p>Legacy content for each title - this means MW2 and MW3 modes within the main Call of Duty HQ app - will be automatically removed on 7th August, freeing up space for players still wanting to access the other Call of Duty titles without bothering with the two affected titles.</p>
<p>Whether this indicates Activision is willing to remove other Call of Duty games from the app in the coming days and months remains unclear. It's also unclear why these two games have been targeted first: do they have a lower engagement rate than other titles? Are they simply easier to unhitch from the integrated ecosystem?</p>
<p>It also raises questions about upcoming series entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> (the multiplayer aspect of which we can expect to see sometime 'this summer').</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3s-up-to-200gb-file-sizes">Way back in 2023</a>, Activision justified its decision to merge all the games into one app by saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusing-call-of-duty-hq-launcher-justified-by-activision">it allowed for easier file management and seamless switching between games</a>. Even back then, the decision drew fire from the community. Players criticised the publisher for putting the onus on individuals to "reduce the overall footprint" of the title. At the time, players became frustrated and confused when trying to access games they actually owned, as the app kept presenting them with opportunities to purchase the newest content added to the store. As you can imagine, this went down poorly.</p>
<p>Are you still playing either of the affected titles? Is this going to have a meaningful impact on you - or your SSD? Is there any reason for you to go back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-campaign-review-vapid-and-hastily-assembled">the "vapid and hastily assembled" Modern Warfare 3 campaign</a>? Probably not, after all this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-plans-warfare-2-installation-file]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Battlefield 6 was officially unveiled earlier this month, and it looks like so far the community is keen for the upcoming release, despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042s-opening-weekend-has-been-a-disaster">somewhat lacklustre initial reception to its predecessor Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7355565272528826369-FoP1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">a LinkedIn post</a> shared by Alinea Analytics CEO Rickard Linder, following the debut of Battlefield 6's reveal trailer last week, the game racked up nearly 500,000 Steam wishlists over the weekend (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wishlist-on-steam-half-million/">Insider Gaming</a>). Linder added roughly 60 percent of those who added Battlefield 6 to their wishlist had played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't too shabby when you consider that former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">Eurogamer editor in chief Martin Robinson called Battlefield 2042 "the weakest Battlefield in some time"</a> when it first released in 2021. To be fair, the team did work on improving Battlefield 2042, and in 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-with-humility-and-hustle-dice-might-yet-win-the-war">Eurogamer noted DICE had "course-corrected in dramatic fashion"</a>, though the developer would likely "have to wait for the next iteration to see its efforts rewarded". Given those wishlist numbers, it seems this may indeed be the case.</p>

<p>Like I said, we got our first look at Battlefield 6 last week, courtesy of a new trailer. While a firm release date was not provided as part of this reveal, the disclaimer URL featured in the video takes you to a page that says: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-finally-revealed-with-a-dedicated-multiplayer-reveal-coming-next-week">This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025</a>.</p>
<p>A separate multiplayer reveal is scheduled for later this week, on 31st July.</p>
<p>Aside from what has been officially announced, we already know a fair amount about the next Battlefield entry. Leaks from the Battlefield Labs tests revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush will be coming back to Battlefield 6</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">single player details have spilled out into the internet</a>, and a variety of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">weapons that'll be usable in the full release have made their way online, too</a>. Then, just this weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leaks-keep-on-coming-this-time-its-the-battle-royale-map">Battlefield 6's Battle Royale map popped up online</a>.</p>

<p>Also recently shared via the world that is social media are images from the Battlefield 6 alpha showing that the 'Battlefield stretch neck' - which is exactly as it sounds, with players having overly stretched necks - is back (see image above).</p>
<p>"It is an absolute classic that dates all the way back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a> beta," <a href="https://x.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1949885360613323210">reads a post on X</a>. "It is a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>"Battlefield is so back."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-lukewarm-reception-to-battlefield-2042-fans-seem-to-be-getting-behind-battlefield-6-as-steam-wishlist-numbers-soar]]></content:encoded>
