            <p>An MMO based on Sony's Horizon IP has reportedly been cancelled.</p>
<p>We first got wind of a Horizon MMO in 2022, when a report stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmo-reportedly-in-the-pipeline">project was in the works at Guild Wars' NCSoft</a>. At this time, a source familiar with both Sony and NCsoft said the two companies had "tentatively agreed to pursue a business partnership in which [NCsoft] will create new games using Sony's promising game IP".</p>
<p>A year later in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-report-of-horizon-mmo-ncsoft-and-sony-announce-strategic-partnership">Sony and NCsoft publicly announced a strategic partnership</a>, designed to "expand beyond console and broaden PlayStation's reach to a wider audience". While neither company referenced Horizon as part of the announcement, it was widely believed the series was a key part of the collaboration.</p>

"Among them, 'H' and 'J' have already disappeared from the company's organisational chart," reads a translation of the report.</p>
<p>The Horizon MMO was reportedly set for a release on PC and mobile. Eurogamer has reached out to NCSoft and Sony with regards to today's report.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has become the latest company to pull its advertising from a major Japanese broadcaster, after reports of a sex scandal involving the former frontman of a popular boyband and a female employee.
</p>
<p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> maker is currently in the midst of an advertising campaign for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, and had been subject to calls from fans to join a growing boycott of the high-profile Tokyo-based Fuji Television, <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF214EX0R20C25A1000000/?n_cid=SNSTW001&amp;n_tw=1737435375">Nikkei</a> reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-suspends-commercials-on-major-japanese-tv-network-amidst-sex-scandal/">Automaton</a>).
</p>
<p>
Fuji TV has been accused of setting up a June 2023 meeting under false pretenses between an unnamed female employee and Masahiro Nakai, a prominent actor and former lead of boyband SMAP.

<p>
It is alleged that Fuji TV falsely told its employee that she would meet Nakai at a company dinner alongside other attendees. In reality, the female presenter found herself meeting Nakai alone, and she was sexually assaulted.
</p>
<p>
According to Japanese newspaper reports, Nakai subsequently paid the woman 90m yen (around £470k) in an out of court settlement, which became public knowledge last month. Nakai has since issued an acknowledgement of "shortcomings".
</p>
<p>
For its part, Fuji TV has denied it deliberately set up the meeting, and begun an internal investigation to address concerns of a culture where male celebrities were given access to its female employees.
</p>
<p>
The channel will now replace regular TV advertising with public service announcements from non-profit organisations.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is back online, following its unexpected ban in the US.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">digital collectible card game was banned in the US alongside TikTok</a>, due to its publisher Nuverse being owned by TikTok owner ByteDance.</p>
<p>At this time, developer Second Dinner said the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the Marvel Snap team as it was to players, too. It went on to state it would do everything it could to get the game back up and running as quickly as possible. Second Dinner has now achieved this, and Marvel Snap is back online in the US.</p>

</figure>
<p>The developer is now "working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher" to ensure this kind of surprise ban does not happen again.</p>
<p>Calling this move the "start of a new era" for the card game, the Marvel Snap team acknowledged players may have "more questions than answers". However, it assured its followers on social media that it would keep them updated with more details on the matter "as soon as possible".</p>
<p>There are still some remaining issues following Marvel Snap's suspension. Replying to users on X, Second Dinner said it is still working on restoring the game's App Store availability, adding this "may take some time".</p>
<p>It additionally noted "in-app purchases remain unavailable but the team is working on it". In the meantime, it said web shop purchases are all in working order, so players can go there for now.</p>

<p>Following its release, Marvel Snap won itself scores of fans, including many on the Eurogamer team. It was soon nominated for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-sweeps-bafta-nominations">number of awards at prestigious events including the BAFTAs</a>.</p>
<p>Our Donlan was especially taken with Marvel Snap on its debut, praising the game for giving him some welcome moments to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>"Whenever I lose a game - and I lose all the time - I get to spend a pleasant few moments working out what went wrong, picking over my deck, and swapping cards in and out. There's a reward for being bad at the game. How kind," he wrote in his feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2022-marvel-snap-offered-the-best-moments-of-reflection">Games of 2022: Marvel Snap offered the best moments of reflection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Rare artist Kevin Bayliss has responded to Donkey Kong's redesign seen in the Mario Kart segment of the Switch 2 announcement.</p>
<p>As fans quickly spotted, the gorilla has received a bit of a redesign for the next karting game. He now looks closer to his film design and the retro design by Shigehisa Nakaue, with a cuter looking face.</p>
<p>Bayliss, who redesigned Donkey Kong for the SNES game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, responded to a fan video spoofing the new look.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Excitement continues to mount ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' release next month, but if there's one big question mark around the whole thing, it's just what sort of performance improvements Capcom has been cooking up since its rather wobby public beta. And the publisher has now given a brief update on performance, alongside confirmation it's "looking into" lowering the game's recommended GPU requirements on PC.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds' first public beta went live last October, and it immediately became clear there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">still work to be done</a> on the performance front. Players soon took to the internet highlighting everything from erratic framerates, even on decently beefy PCs, to unfortunate visual glitches making the whole thing look like Capcom's lead platform was the N64.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the publisher moved to remind players Monster Hunter Wilds was "still in development", offering assurances the full game was "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test", and that it was "committed to ensuring the quality of the final product." There was hope among fans some of these improvements might be evident in Monster Hunter Wilds' second open beta, scheduled to run from 7th-9th February, but Capcom recently confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">that wouldn't be the case</a>.

<p>
The company has, though, now provided a short update on performance, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>'s <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">official German social media channel</a> recently posting (as per Google translate) that the team "has been addressing rendering issues from the open beta test and is continually working on improvements for launch". These assurances were accompanied by a video offering what Capcom called a "look at our updated Prioritise Performance more for PS5", albeit not a particularly illuminating one given the less-than-stellar quality of X's video player. Prioritise Performance mode (AKA Prioritise Framerate) targets up to 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X, compared to 30fps when using Prioritise Graphics mode.
</p><p>
Capcom also noted it's aiming to improve PC performance in a "similar way", and that it's additionally "looking into whether we can lower the recommended GPU requirements". The publisher raised a few eyebrows last September, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">revealed</a> Monster Hunter Wilds would require an RTX 2070 Super/RTX 4060/RX 6700XT to reach 60fps (with Frame Generation) at 1080p, so word there may be improvements here - particularly given the open beta's erratic performance on mid-range hardware - is encouraging.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 28th February, and the Character Creation, Story Trial and Slay Doshaguma Quest seen in last year's first open beta will all be available again when beta #2 kicks off earlier in the month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale was quite taken with Monster Hunter Wilds' "familiar thrill of the hunt, player customisation, and extravagant combat" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">went hands-on in August</a>, so hopefully Capcom can iron our those remaining wrinkles before launch.
