            <p>Following the success of its Festival of Seasons concert, which you could say hit all the right notes, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is touring another musical rendition for the beloved video game.</p>
<p>Symphony of Seasons, as it is known, will be an all-new concert, which will boast a bigger orchestra than its predecessor. In fact, it's got a 35-piece orchestra, which will perform new arrangements of the soundtrack as gameplay footage is shared.</p>
<p>Described as a "musical journey from your first day in the valley to your arrival to the summit", Symphony of Seasons has been curated by Stardew Valley's creator,  Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone.</p>

<p>"Watch your farm grow throughout the four seasons, and explore the most memorable locations of the valley: from Pelican Town to the Skull Cavern, from Ginger Island to Calico Desert, from the Submarine to the Wizard's Tower and much more," the <a href="https://www.stardewvalleyconcert.com/home">Stardew Valley concert page reads</a>.</p>
<p>The concert tour will be coming to the UK in 2026. It will be in Glasgow on 10th February of that year, before heading to Manchester on 12th February and London on 14th February.</p>

<p>As for the video game world, earlier this year, ConcernedApe admitted he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">hadn't actually touched his next game - Haunted Chocolatier - "in a long time"</a>, because his focus had been on Stardew Valley.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was first announced back in 2021</a>, with a cute trailer showing off its spooky chocolate-making, monster-stabbing, small town-living role-playing gameplay. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone previously said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Uncork'd Entertainment has acquired distribution rights to 'George A. Romero's Resident Evil' - an investigative documentary which looks into the filmmaker's unrealised film adaptation of the video game series - in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3840097/george-a-romeros-resident-evil-documentary-releasing-in-january-2025-exclusive/">Bloody Disgusting</a>, the documentary has been directed and co-written by Brandon Salisbury. It takes us back to 1998, when Constantin Film set out to bring Resident Evil to the big screen with the help of Romero. On its release, the documentary will include archival footage, as well as interviews with those who were involved in the unreleased film, going into the reasons why it was never made.</p>
<p>"George Romero gave birth to modern horror, the modern zombie, and ultimately Resident Evil," said Salisbury. "I am honoured to bring fans the untold story of his most important unmade project, to celebrate the legacy of the man that inspired me to pursue filmmaking as a career. I hope fans enjoy this ultimate experience in survival horror."</p>
