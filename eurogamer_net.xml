            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has agreed to halt all promotion and public testing of Light of Motiram - the post-apocalyptic open-world survival game Sony previously accused of being a "slavish clone" of PlayStation's Horizon series in a lawsuit - as the two companies battle it out in court.
</p>
<p>
Light of Motiram, developed by Tencent's Polaris Quest studio, emerged at the end of last year, and its accompanying images - featuring mechanised animal-like creatures and very Aloy like key character art - immediately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">drew comparisons with Horizon</a>. And Sony agreed, mounting legal action against Tencent, who it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">accused of copyright and trademark infringement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Since then, we've had a bit of back-and-forth - Tencent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">accused Sony</a> of seeking an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions", a claim Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">called "nonsense"</a> - and Tencent even went as far as to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">quietly update Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> to tone down the more "egregious" Horizon similarities. But the lawsuit rumbles on.

<p>
Sony wants the court to block Light of Motiram from sale when its legal hearing gets underway next year, but in the interim Tencent has agreed to keep the game out of the spotlight. As <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-promote-light-of-motiram-run-public-tests-sony-horizon-lawsuit-2026-hearing/">reported by TheGamePost</a>, Tencent this week submitted a new California court filing agreeing there will be "no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram" while Sony's injunction request is being argued. This is part of a deal in which Sony will give Tencent more time to respond to its injunction motion.
</p><p>
"SIE requested, and the Tencent Entities agreed, that (a) the extended briefing schedule and later requested hearing date will not be used to argue that SIE delayed in seeking a preliminary injunction," the filing reads, "(b) there will be no new promotion or public testing of Light of Motiram during the pendency of the Motion for Preliminary Injunction, (c) the Light of Motiram release will not be moved up to before Q4 2027, and (d) the Tencent Entities will not seek expedited discovery in connection with the Motion for Preliminary injunction".
</p>
<p>
TheGamePost notes Sony and Tencent have jointly requested the court hearings - covering both Sony's injunction request and Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit - be moved to the same day in January next year.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update, which is set to go live on the 9th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1996248184381641171?s=20">Announced in a Battlefield Comms post</a>, the developers have stated that work continues to enhance both components of online play. This is especially noteworthy as issues surrounding both online netcode and hit registration have been points of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to build on our work to make hit registration feel consistent, reliable, and predictable during every engagement," the post states. "With this update, we have improved how bullet trajectories are aligned in fast-paced situations, including cases where shots were fired while transitioning into a zoom. These improvements correct inconsistencies that could affect hit registration and the readability of where your shots were landing. We have also made updates to better handle high-density combat scenarios to ensure bullets register more reliably when multiple players are fighting in close proximity."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the new Battlefield 6 update has included additional gameplay adjustments to better the overall experience of getting into a firefight. The post elaborates: "In parallel, we have tightened the clarity of damage feedback so that health UI changes and damage cues feel more immediate and easier to understand during combat. While this is separate from Netcode itself, improving how damage is presented plays a key role in making hit registration feel responsive and intuitive.
</p><p>"Lastly, we have resolved an issue where clients could briefly display certain pieces of geometry as intact even though they had already been destroyed on the server. Fixing this eliminates cases where incoming damage could appear to pass through walls."</p>
<p>Other improvements include a general tweak to soldier visibility. There have also been adjustments to various weapons including changes to weapon-handling, first shot accuracy and more. Certain game modes include Rush and Breakthrough have also been altered to improve the attacker flow, aiming to stop oversaturation when it comes to defending objectives.</p>
<p>Finally, the post pledges further improvements to "clarity, responsiveness, and fairness in combat". So it seems as though this continued string of gameplay shifts from EA and Battlefield Studios won't be stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>This update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of games post-launch were cheater free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>
