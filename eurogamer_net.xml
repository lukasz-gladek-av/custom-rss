            <p>Rovio has announced a third <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/angry-birds">Angry Birds</a> film is on the way, due for release on 29th January 2027 to rival new Zelda and Sonic films.</p>
<p>The Angry Birds Movie 3, from Paramount, will see the likes of Jason Sudeikis (Ted Lasso), Josh Gad (Frozen), Rachel Bloom (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend), and Danny McBridge (The Righteous Gemstones) reprise their roles as the coloured birds from the hit mobile game.</p>
<p>The third film will also feature the likes of Keke Palmer (Nope), Lily James (Cinderella), Sam Richardson (Ted Lasso), Nikki Glaser (Golden Globe Awards), and Emma Myers (A Minecraft Movie).</p>

<p>John Rice will once again direct, following his work on the first Angry Birds film, while Thurop Van Orman will continue as screenplay writer from the sequel.</p>
<p>"We're very excited to be partnering with Paramount Pictures and extremely proud of our incredible cast," said John Cohen, producer. "Not only do we have Jason, Josh, Rachel and Danny returning to voice their fantastic characters, but they're surrounded by an all-star ensemble of comedic talent. These are some of the funniest people out there today, and we're so thrilled to have them all on board."</p>
<p>The first two Angry Birds films have grossed over $500m worldwide.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie had the biggest US domestic opening weekend ever for a video game adaptation</a> last week and generated $301m worldwide on its first weekend. There are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">already talks for a sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the third <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">Sonic the Hedgehog film led to the film franchise surpassing $1bn</a> at the global box office.</p>
<p>So far, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">biggest video game film adaptation ever remains Nintendo's The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, which earned $500m globally in a single film. But perhaps this will be usurped by Minecraft.</p>
<p>No doubt the success of these films has spurred Paramount into creating a third Angry Birds film.</p>
<p>However, there is stiff competition. Next year will see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">release of a second Mario film in April</a>, as Nintendo looks to capitalise on its previous success.</p>
<p>Then in 2027, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">Sonic the Hedgehog 4</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-by-nintendo-and-its-not-as-far-away-as-you-might-have-feared">The Legend of Zelda</a> films will be released in March, following The Angry Birds Movie 3 two months prior.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>' previously announced cross-save feature will not be launching on PlayStation 4 and PS5 at the same time as other platforms due to a "legal issue".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, developer Poncle said the team had run into an issue last minute, which "requires us to share info on our partners that we're unable to". As such, the "chances of cross-save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim", it said.</p>

<p>But while the chances are slim, they are "not impossible" the Vampire Survivors developer continued, stating it is going to keep working with PlayStation to get the issue sorted.</p>
<p>"We're so sorry to build up any anticipation for this feature on PlayStation only to change plans at the last minute," Poncle wrote, before closing:</p>
<p>"For anyone wanting Cross-Save just to unlock trophies, it's worth noting that PS Trophies are automatically disabled on a platform level for all games when using a save file from another platform."</p>
<p>As for other platforms, cross-save will be coming to Vampire Survivors via PC, Xbox and mobile devices in coming weeks. It will then arrive for those playing on Nintendo Switch at an unspecified later date, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> if the developer "can do so without breaching any privacy commitments".</p>

<p>At last night's BAFTAs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">Vampire Survivors was deemed the best Evolving Game</a>, winning out against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Online, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, Sea of Thieves and World of Warcraft. The game previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-wins-best-game-at-bafta-game-awards">scooped itself up the BAFTA for Best Game in 2023</a>, beating out heavy hitters including the likes of Elden Ring and God of War: Ragnarök. It also won the award for Game Design.</p>
<p>Not only that, Vampire Survivors is also getting its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">animated TV series</a>. I wonder what will be necks for this breakout hit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-review-near-endless-rpg-popcorn">Christian Donlan described as "near-endless RPG popcorn"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
