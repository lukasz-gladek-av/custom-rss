            <p>Former DreadXP and Critical Reflex alum Ted Hentschke has teamed up with Jakub Ba≈Çuszek-Sobolewski to form Black Lantern Collective, a new publisher dedicated to horror games.</p>
<p>Described as an "all-new indie publisher leveraging the passion and expertise for established horror savants to bring a curated collection of chills, thrills, and unease to the freaky masses", Black Lantern hit the ground running with ten game announcements, but kicks off its release schedule with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/">Captum Mortum</a>, an atmospheric psychological horror game coming in August.</p>

<p>"Caput Mortum is a short first-person horror experience inspired by retro 3D dungeon crawlers and survival horror games," the team explains. "Delve into a tower of forgotten nightmares, where every step could be your last. Overcome horrors from beyond death and unlock the secrets of forbidden knowledge."
</p>
<p>Also on the way is a first-person narrative adventure "about tagging billboards and watching your house burn down", <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105190/CHILDREN_OF_SATURN/">Children of Saturn</a>, rogue-like dice build <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3512300/Dead_Finger_Dice/">Dead Finger Dice: A Billionaire Killing Game</a> wherein you take on pole dice against blood-thirsty demon billionaires - as you do - and a "darkly quirky" RPG called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3145370/Muffles_Life_Sentence/">Muffles' Life Sentence</a> set in a prison where innmates are remade to match their crimes. The latter is out now on Steam.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amazon MGM Studios has selected yet another video game series for a TV show adaptation - and this time it's Wolfenstein.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/">Variety</a>, the exact plot details have yet to be disclosed, but the show's official tagline reminds us that "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen".</p>

<p>Jonah Nolan (aka Jonathan Nolan) and Lisa Joy - names you would've seen on the credits of Fallout - are already on board as executive producers, along with Athena Wickham, James Altman, and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson. Patrick Somerville will serve as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner under his production company, chaoticgood.tv.</p>
<p>Variety reports Somerville - who created the shows Maniac and Station Eleven - has reportedly been a fan of the Wolfenstein games "since he was a child".</p>
<p>Amazon is clearly looking to replicate the success of its hugely successful game-to-TV adaptation, Fallout, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime</a>, even though the show's second season's December 2025 debut is still months away.</p>
<p>More than 100 million people have watched Fallout's first season to date, Amazon has revealed, making it one of the streamer's top three launches ever. Amazon is now moving quickly to make more of the show, and begin teasing its second batch of episodes with another longing look at the Las Vegas skyline at the end of the below trailer.</p>
<p>Other in-progress TV adaptations at Amazon include a series based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">God of War</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">Warhammer 40,000</a>. In fact, Amazon is so confident of its God of War adaptation, it has ordered a second season before the first has even been aired.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Krafton has acquired 100 percent of Last Epoch developer, Eleventh Hour Games.</p>
<p>Krafton said it was a "strategic acquisition" that aims to expand the global player base, bolster live service capabilities, and demonstrate commitment to the action RPG genre, but stressed "the team behind Last Epoch will continue to work on the game, scale development across console platforms, and expand seasonal content". The acquisition amount "includes an initial consideration of ¬£71.5m ($96m)".</p>

<p>While the deal helps Krafton secure "a competitive franchise IP in the action RPG genre and further strengthen its position in the global market", in turn, Eleventh Hour Games gets "the resources and infrastructure to better serve its community, ensuring that Last Epoch continues to evolve and meet the expectations of its growing player base".</p>
<p>"Joining Krafton is a dream come true for Eleventh Hour Games," said Eleventh Hour CEO, Judd Cobler. "Their deep-rooted passion for ARPGs aligns perfectly with our mission. With Krafton's support, EHG is poised to elevate the Last Epoch franchise to even greater heights. As a studio built from players of the genre, we couldn‚Äôt be more excited for its future."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/last-epoch-review">Eurogamer's Last Epoch review</a>, we awarded it a middling 3/5, writing: "A versatile build system allows for experiments with deep skill trees and unusual crafting mechanics - but after the initial excitement of creating those builds, momentum fades."</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-ready-to-take-on-subnauticas-creators-in-court">Krafton said it "look[ed] forward to defending itself in court"</a> after Unknown Worlds' former leadership confirmed they would be suing the publisher after they were suddenly ousted and replaced earlier this month. The publisher also insisted that any and all decisions made about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> were made "to ensure it's the best possible game and lives up to fan expectations".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquires-last-epoch-studio-eleventh-hour-games]]></content:encoded>
