            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> (Yoshi-P) intends to work on the game "for at least a good while", even as he works on other projects within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zydl9wAQuc">Noisy Pixel</a> at Pax West, Yoshida discussed what keeps him working on the MMORPG after 12 years, to which he described himself as "more of a businessman" than a creative person.</p>
<p>"People tend to say we're creators or creative, but I am an employee at Square Enix and I receive money to make games," he said, "and I think my primary purpose is to make games so that we are delivering it to gamers out there, fans, players that want to consume our product. I think that is fundamental or a minimum requirement that I have because I belong to this company."</p>

<p>He continued that designers working in a company and feeling bored should remove themselves from a corporate environment, but he doesn't "have that strong personal desire to go into my own creative things".</p>
<p>"So when asked, do I ever get bored with Final Fantasy 14?" Yoshida concluded. "I don't think so, because there are a lot of things that I have yet to actualise in 14, things that I want to do, things that I must do, things that require to be taken care of. And so I think for at least a good while, I should be ok."</p><p>Yoshida added he wishes to do less "management or operational things", joking he may be scolded for his response. "I already do a lot of game developing and I've sacrificed some sleep sometimes," he said, "but perhaps if I were to have a choice, I would like to focus in on the game development design."</p>
<p>Yoshida is best known for his work on Final Fantasy 14, but in recent years has been pulled into other projects. Yoshida heads up Square Enix's Creative Business Unit 3, responsible for the MMORPG as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>: The Ivalice Chronicles. He was also co-producer on Fantasian: Neo Dimension.</p>
<p>In another interview at Pax West, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-naoki-yoshida-wants-players-to-stop-sending-developers-demoralising-abuse">Yoshida requested players stop sending developers demoralising abuse</a>.</p>
<p>"I want to emphasise here, there is a person behind the games," he said. "While I understand some harsh criticism might be necessary sometimes, there's a person behind the games that you enjoy and if you have that harsh criticism, I think we would want to have it be constructive.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has argued mods shouldn't be recognised as "prior art", and therefore are irrelevant to its ongoing lawsuit with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> creator Pocketpair.</p>
<p>As part of its defence against alleged copyright infringement of the Pokémon games, Pocketpair has pointed to mods as an example of prior art that would invalidate Nintendo's patent claims. Specifically, it highlighted the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/690?tab=description">Pocket Souls</a> Pokémon mod for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>, which allows players to capture and battle with enemies in the game.</p>
<p>Now, in a response spotted by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">Game Fray</a>, Nintendo is disputing the defence because it believes mods don't stand on their own as they require an original game to run on. As such, mods shouldn't be subject to patent infringement in the same way Palworld is.</p>

<p>As Game Fray points out, game makers often look to mods for inspiration, so Pocketpair's defence should be valid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/nintendo-reportedly-gets-even-more-obnoxious-about-patent-law-by-taking-a-mods-arent-real-games-stance-against-a-dark-souls-3-mod-that-could-invalidate-its-palworld-lawsuit/">PC Gamer</a> reported Japanese courts have a history of siding with patent lawsuit defendants able to present examples of prior art. That's why Pocketpair is using Pokémon-themed mods as such an example, which Nintendo is now attempting to invalidate.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">Nintendo was granted a patent in the US</a> based on the gameplay mechanic of summoning a sub-character to fight another, which covers whether the summoned character battles on player input or automatically.</p>
<p>Games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer the patent is "enforceable in so far as it has been granted, but Nintendo likely knows it 'got away with one' here and would prefer not to make a court actually sign off."</p>
<p>Don McGowan, former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company, meanwhile, believes the patent will likely be ignored.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">Pocketpair has disputed Nintendo's claims</a> as part of the ongoing lawsuit, but has already accommodated changes to Palworld.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">Palworld is also heading towards a 1.0 release</a> next year as it aims to fix "jank".</p>

            <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">A patch for Borderlands 4</a> has gone live on PC, which claims to address many of the crashes plaguing the game. Specifically, crashes related to animation states, audio, collision checks, and "various" GPU-related things. Basically everything, then.</p>
<p>The patch also irons out kinks affecting the Gilded Glory pre-order bonus pack, which was conflicting with the Reward Center in the game. This fix will also be coming to the console versions of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in "the coming days" (I expect verification procedures have slowed its release down).</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 was released last week and, though popular, faced backlash for poor performance on PC. Boisterous Gearbox Software boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-advises-borderlands-4-players-to-get-a-refund-if-theyre-not-happy-with-it-as-social-media-tirade-defending-pc-performance-continues">Randy Pitchford since spent the week defending against complaints</a> on social media about it. There are fixes in the works, he confirmed, but he argued that Borderlands 4 was never designed to be a twitchy high-frame shooter like those in the competitive genre, so will never perform in that way - not unless you made graphical trade-offs to enable it.</p>
<p>Our Borderlands 4 review is in the works, by the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Change List:</h2>
<h3>Stability</h3>
<ul>
<li>Addressed crashes tied to animation states, audio, and collision checks</li>
<li>Addressed various GPU-related crashes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gameplay &amp; Progression</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resolved an issue where the Reward Center could stop working after claiming the Gilded Glory Pack rewards</li>
<li>Addressed a progression blocker in the mission "Talk to Zadra," where the objective could fail if players exited and relaunched mid-dialogue</li>
<li>Corrected "Doesn't own DLC" warnings incorrectly showing up on non-DLC gear</li>
<li>This will be fixed on consoles in the coming days.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Loot &amp; Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated loot pools so Gilded Glory Pack guns no longer appear in standard chests</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weekly Minor Updates:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every week, we will see changes to which Weekly Big Encore Boss and Wildcard Mission is live! Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine is also on the move!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weekly Big Encore Boss</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Weekly Big Encore Boss is a tougher variant of an existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weekly Wildcard Missions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Weekly Wildcard Missions add challenging new traits to an existing mission. These missions feature a guaranteed Legendary drop that you can repeatedly earn to get your ideal roll.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go in search of where the Black Market Vending Machine has moved to and discover what's available in your game every week. Remember, while the location is the same, your vending machine items are different from other players, so ask around to see if someone has the item you're looking for!</li>
</ul>
