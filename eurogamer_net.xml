            <p>Charlie Cox won himself a Game Awards nomination for his work voicing Gustave in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. However, while the actor is understandably delighted to see his work recognised, he says as much of the credit needs to go to Gustave's motion performance actor, Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Cox recently reacted to his Best Performance nomination while speaking at a panel (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517">recorded by POSTA Entretenimiento</a>). "Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination," Cox said, before immediately praising Cazorla's work bringing the Clair Obscur character to life.</p>

<p>"I've said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing french actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role," Cox shared with the audience.</p>
<p>"And so, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Cox admitted that while Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud". Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent</a>.</p><p>Cox is not the only Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 cast member to be up for the Best Performance award at this year's Game Awards. Both Ben Starr and Jennifer English have also been nominated for their part in Sandfall's turn-based RPG. Meanwhile, the title is also up for Game of the Year, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>
<p>With 12 nominations to its name, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has made Game Awards history by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">becoming the most nominated game since the show's conception</a>.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 will take place on Thursday, 11th December, at 7:30pm EST. That's very early in the morning on the 12th, if you are in the UK. Will you be watching?</p>
<p>For more on Clair Obscur, back in October the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-still-has-secrets-fans-havent-found-says-director">game's director Guillaume Broche revealed there are still secrets fans are yet to discover</a>, but he wouldn't give any hints. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">update for Clair Obscur is also on the cards</a>.</p>
