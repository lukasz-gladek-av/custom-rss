            <p>Today's the day. This afternoon, Nintendo will air a Switch 2 dedicated Direct broadcast from which we expect a release date and price for the new console, as well as a look at some of its upcoming games. And as ever, we'll be watching, reporting and reacting to the broadcast live, as it happens, right here.</p>
<p>Set your Alarmo clocks for 2pm BST / 3pm CEST / 9am EDT / 6am PDT. The show is expected to be an hour long.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo, remember, has already unveiled the form factor of Switch 2</a>, which surprise surprise, looks a lot like the existing Switch, only bigger. Lurking within, though, are significant changes, such as Joy-Con that magnetically snap to the side of the machine, USB-C ports, a mysterious C button, rumoured mouse-like Joy-Con functionality, and, of course, more powerful innards. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2s-reveal-what-have-we-learned-about-its-performance-potential">as Digital Foundry noted, while forensically picking over the Switch 2 details</a>, we're still not sure exactly how powerful it is. Questions remain. Will they be answered today?</p>
<p>The previous reveal also gave us a glimpse of a new Mario Kart game, which notably teased the possibility of 24-player races. Will we see more of that game today? And what of Nintendo's other first-party games for Switch 2 - are there any, and if there are, which ones will they be? Big, legacy franchises, or smaller things? I also wonder what kind of third-party support Nintendo has attracted for Switch 2.</p>
<p>But the biggest questions are of course price and release date. How soon will the console come out? There's a widely held belief Switch 2 is imminent, though the console's public hands-on tour runs until June. Is that when it will finally arrive? And how much will it cost? There's talk of a $400 price point, which puts it $100 above what Switch 1 launched at, and talk of $70 games. But will these figures be born out?</p>
<p>There's lots to discover, and we'll be building up to the reveal throughout the day here. Excited?</p><figure>

    <p>There's lots of speculation about the price of the Switch 2, but whatever it comes in at we're looking at a chunky spend for day one buyers. If we make some reasonable guesses for the prices of the hardware and games, well, it won't be a good day for the credit card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch 2 console: £400</li>
<li>Switch 2 Joy-Con Pair: £65</li>
<li>Switch 2 game: £60</li>
<li>512GB Micro SD Card: £40</li>
</ul>
<p>The console, a second set of Joy-Con, memory card, and two games would be £625. Ouch!</p>

    <blockquote><cite>Ninginja says:</cite> I think people expecting under £400 are in for a bit of a rude awakening, but I'll be the first to admit to being very happy if it comes in lower than that.

I expect around £419 personally, translating to around €500 here in Germany. Of course, Nintendo cannot set the price here in Europe, so who knows really.</blockquote>

      <p>Joy-Contentment?</p>
    <p>Nintendo loves a new colour Joy-Con almost as much as it loves making money (maybe the two are linked?). At the OG Switch launch buyers had to choose between the sleek grey or the more fun blue and red. It's hard to believe Nintendo won't launch a whole range of different colours for its Switch 2 Joy-Con range, but I wouldn't be overly surprised to see day one buyers limited to the black we've seen shown off already. They are starkly un-kiddy, which would make sense given early adopters are likely to be kids only at heart, not age. Still, I'd expect some red ones for Mario, green for Pikmin, and blue-ish for Zelda(?) at some point.</p>

Some great questions cropping up in the comments. Will legacy games get a boost if played on Switch 2? Back compatibility is a feature here, remember. Also, what are the chances of a new 3D Mario being teased today, or more? As Tom pointed out in his comment, Switch 1's first year brought us Odyssey - what will Switch 2's first year bring? And where on Nintendo's list of priorities is a new Animal Crossing, as Will rightly wonders?
</p>
<p>A new generation does tend to be a great time to introduce new IP, as well, as we saw Nintendo do with Arms on Switch 1 and Splatoon on Wii U. Is there a new franchise waiting in the wings for Switch 2?</p>

      <p>The missing Link?</p>
    <p>There's always excitement around a new console, but there's something extra special about a Nintendo console reveal because you can't help but expect something a little different. I'm sure we'll hear something about the system offering something we didn't expect (or at least already know about), but I'm most interested in finding out what games Nintendo has planned.</p>
<p>The original Switch had a brilliant first year, notably launching with the possible game of that decade, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. We also got Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Arms. My concern is that Switch 2 won't be able to better that, mainly because there won't be a new Zelda any time soon (barring a monumental surprise). Will the new Mario Kart be able to carry online discussion like Zelda did? We'll see.</p>

      <p>The mysterious "C" button</p>
    <p>
Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-final-switch-2-tease-shows-mysterious-c-button">Nintendo has lifted the lid slightly on the mysterious "C" button on the Switch 2</a>. A new video posted on the Nintendo Today app shows it being pressed and sounding a little jingle and then... Well, that's as much as we were allowed to see. Could it be a shortcut button to capture gameplay, or to get to social features on the console, and what might they be if there?

        <p>But mysterious mobile game is apparently not.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Back in 2020, streaming giant Netflix announced a partnership with Ubisoft to create streaming "content" based on Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">including at least one live-action TV series</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Five years and several <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> later, however, and we're yet to see Netflix's TV project materialise.
</p>
<p>
Has the project been quietly canned? Not so, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/i/160364118/item-what-about-netflixs-assassins-creed">Game File</a>, which reported that the series is still in "active" development as part of an article featuring a chat with Netflix's gaming boss Alain Tascan.
</p>
<p>
Few details have ever been announced on the Netflix Assassin's Creed series, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-assassins-creed-adaptation-loses-die-hard-writer-jeb-stuart">Die Hard writer Jeb Stuart was briefly attached</a> for a period. 
</p>
<p>
A mysterious <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/assassins-creed-mobile-game?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Assassin's Creed mobile game announced by Netflix and Ubisoft in 2022</a> - of which we knew nothing at all - is no longer in development, Tascan appeared to suggest.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first Assassin's Creed Netflix project to fall by the wayside. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-anime-announced-by-netflix-castlevania-creator">Assassin's Creed anime was announced by Netflix in 2017</a> from Adi Shankar, creator of the popular Castlevania  animated series. However, the project ultimately failed to materialise.
</p>
<p>
Last month, speaking at GDC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-games-boss-says-consoles-not-the-future-as-streamer-looks-to-phone-controlled-party-games">Tascan said he believed consoles were not the future as the streamer looks to phone-controlled party games</a>. "Are eight year-olds and ten year-olds dreaming of owning a PlayStation 6?" he wondered.

            <p>Developer Rebellion is celebrating its "most successful launch" ever with the release of Atomfall, a game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-let-me-bash-a-mans-head-in-with-a-cricket-bat-while-he-was-having-a-wee-and-i-think-i-love-it">our Ian showered in praise</a> after it allowed him to bash a man over the head with a cricket bat as he (the man, not Ian) was having a wee against a wall.</p>
<p>The studio announced its pseudo-apocalyptic survival game - set in the rather splendid ol' chap that is 1950s rural England - had already reached 1.5 million players since its debut at the end of March.</p>
<p>"A pleasure having you observe Protocol in Wyndham," the Atomfall developer celebrated on social media.</p>

<p>Along with this impressive player milestone, Rebellion has also shared some thoroughly British Atomfall statistics.</p>
<p>Among us, we have managed to devour 4m pasties, and savour 300,000 cups of tea, which, honestly, seems quite low to me, given I probably drink that in about a week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there have been 3.7m kills with a cricket bat (and only 1m of those were Ian). Lastly, want to know how many players killed the scientist right at the start of Atomfall? That's 316,000 of us.</p>

The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">Switch 2</a>'s most mysterious button has been teased by Nintendo, ahead of the new console's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">full unveiling in just a few hours</a>.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has, to date, avoided speficially highlighting the mysterious "C" button located on the Switch 2's right-hand Joy-Con. Indeed, when the Switch 2 was first revealed, the button's face was left completely blank. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-finally-confirmed">image posted to Nintendo Today last week did however finally show the button's lettering</a>, if you squint.
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems, we will finally find out its true purpose. A new video <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">posted to the Nintendo Today app</a> promoting this afternoon's Nintendo Direct focuses fully on that C button, and shows it being pressed. A little jingle plays. But what just happened?
</p>
<p>
Fan theories point to this being some kind of capture or social button, allowing you to more easily share gameplay or discuss what you're currently playing with others. Could this be a feature similar to the Wii U's much-missed Miiverse, perhaps?

Yesterday, Nintendo teased another new Switch 2 hardware feature - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mouse-functionality-all-but-confirmed-thanks-to-latest-console-teaser">the mouse-like controls of the console's fresh Joy-Con</a>. 
</p>
<p>
We now have only a few hours until Switch 2's secrets are revealed. Be sure to join us at 2pm UK time later today, 2nd April 2025, for the main event.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a full demo of the Switch 2's hardware, Nintendo is expected to unveil the key games which it will launch its new console with, most notably including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Switch 2 Mario Kart</a> glimpsed earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
We're also expecting to finally hear word of the Switch 2's launch date and price, with a release expected around June - after the culmination of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">Nintendo's public Switch 2 hands-on tour</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> might be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-finally-adds-the-series-iconic-burglar-and-it-only-took-11-years">tootling along merrily</a>, but it's now over 10 years old and fans are getting increasingly impatient for clarity on what's next for the franchise - particularly given EA's somewhat confounding communications on the matter. Amid all this, extensive footage of EA's new The Sims "game concept" has now surfaced online, fuelling all sorts of disappointment as fans ponder a reality where the future of The Sims is, in fact, just a tacky looking mobile game.
</p>
<p>
To recap, EA first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gives-super-early-look-at-next-generation-sims-game-project-rene">began discussing its "next generation" Sims game</a>, codenamed Project Rene, back in 2022. This, many assumed, would be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> - until, that is, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">announced Project Rene wasn't The Sims 5</a>, that The Sims 5 wasn't happening, and that whatever Project Rene was would instead co-exist alongside The Sims 4. It also teased a bunch of "cosy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, [and] mobile narrative games" coming under The Sims banner, before revealing Project Rene (whatever it was) would begin playtesting soon.
</p>
<p>
In the six months since then, playtest footage has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1frtd5c/new_project_rene_formerly_the_sims_5_screenshots/">sporadically leaked online</a>, leaving fans largely unimpressed. And it seems unlikely the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE">sudden influx of new gameplay footage</a> (as flagged by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/another-disappointing-looking-project-rene-leak-makes-me-wish-ea-would-finally-step-in-and-say-anything-at-all-to-sims-fans/">PC Gamer</a>) will change that, given that the bland visuals, endless reward-incentivised to-do lists, and front-and-centre currency focus feels more like a free-to-play mobile wallet squeezer than a truly "next-generation" The Sims game.

<p>
EA describes the playtest - officially titled <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.lifegame&amp;hl=en">City Life Game With Friends over on Google Play</a> - as "small parts of a larger game concept". And the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE">newly</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXD7u0miBKA">shared</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pMyt1ioAs">footage</a> focuses on the same multiplayer-enabled plaza location we've <a href="https://streamable.com/guwvh2">seen in numerous leaks before</a>, only now festooned with even more garish free-to-play-style window dressing as players stroll around, strike up conversations, and hand out a few muffins. It's not especially inspiring stuff - and given EA's refusal to clarify the nature of the project, it's unclear how horrified fans should actually be.
</p>
<p>
All this, of course, comes as developer Krafton's highly anticipated The Sims competitor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> launches into Steam early access. And while I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">wasn't particulary impressed with InZoi</a> during my time with it last month, it's unlikely anyone's going to be dazzled by anything resembling EA's City Life Game with Friends when Krafton's game is around.
