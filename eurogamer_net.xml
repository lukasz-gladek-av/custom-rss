            <p>Dragon Quest 12 is still in development, series creator Yuji Horii has confirmed.</p>
<p>The latest in the long-running RPG series was first announced back in 2021 but little has been seen since beyond the initial teaser trailer.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, though, Horii held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfikAAlgNsw">livestream</a> with this radio show group KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-12-is-still-fully-in-development-new-information-to-be-revealed-little-by-little-says-series-creator/">Automaton</a>) where he confirmed the development team is "working hard on Dragon Quest 12".</p>

<p>Further details are expected to be released little by little, though nothing more was revealed at this time.</p>
<p>Back in May last year, <a href="https://x.com/YujiHorii/status/1794984625107832939">Horii also acknowledged Dragon Quest 12</a> on social media, stating the development team wanted to make a game "worthy of the final contributions of the two people who passed away".</p>
<p>Those two people are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">Dragon Quest character designer Akira Toriyama</a> and composer Koichi Sugiyama, who had worked on every game in the series before their deaths.</p>
<p>Horii's comments came shortly after Dragon Quest series producer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-yu-miyake-stepping-down-as-producer-on-dragon-quest">Yu Miyake stepped down from his role</a> to oversee <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s mobile game division, putting Dragon Quest 12's development into question.</p>
<p>Now, in his livestream, Horii apologised for confusion around the game's development and denied it had been cancelled.</p>
<p>Little else is known about Dragon Quest 12, though at the series' 35th anniversary livestream Horii stated the classic turn-based battle system will be altered and the tone will be darker and aimed at adults.</p>
<p>In its latest earnings report, Square Enix stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake exceeded sales expectations</a>. Previously it reported sales of 2m copies, with the game becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">2024's biggest game in Japan</a> after just a week on sale.</p>
<p>While similar remakes of Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are expected this year, anticipation is building for the next full release in the series to build on the success of Dragon Quest 3.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Exactly a year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">Walt Disney Company announced it was acquiring a $1.5bn USD stake in Epic Games</a> and launched a multi-year partnership to create an "expansive and open games and entertainment universe connected to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>", the Fortnite x Disney collaboration event has reportedly moved into a "stable" build.</p>
<p>Whilst it remains unclear, what, exactly, the collaboration will be, noted Fortnite leaker HypeX said the status change likely comes because "they probably made a lot of progress and moved into the next roadmap milestone".</p>

<p>At the time the collaboration was announced, explicit mention was made of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar, with users able to "create their own stories and experiences, express their fandom in a distinctly Disney way, and share content with each other in ways that they love".</p> <div>

<p>Since then, fans have gone on to form their own theories - or wishlists - including the suggestion by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ik9odz/comment/mbkt5e8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">some</a> that we could see a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-infinity">Disney Infinity</a>-esque mode added to the Fortnite, or some kind of persistent "Disney Metaverse" to explore.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, hopefully we won't have to wait too much longer for the finer details.</p>
<p>HypeX also confirmed over the weekend that Fast &amp; Furious x Fortnite skins are also "coming soon".</p> <div>
