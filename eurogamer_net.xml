            <p>The second season of HBO's The Last of Us is almost upon us, and finally more about Catherine O'Hara's new character has been revealed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">O'Hara's casting was announced in February of last year</a>, although at this time who she was playing remained a mystery. There were rumours her character was called Gail, and these have ultimately been proven correct. But, who exactly is Gail?</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of spoilers for The Last of Us (both games and the show) below</strong>.</p>

<p>In an interview during The Last of Us season 2's premiere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann confirmed O'Hara is playing a therapist living in Jackson, but also that she is - somewhat of a surprise to me - Eugene's wife. This marks a significant change from the games, and has made me curious about what this will mean for season two's story.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">it was announced Joe Pantoliano had joined The Last of Us' cast as Eugene</a>, a character mentioned in Part 2 but who doesn't appear in person, barring collectables.</p>

<p>In the game, Eugene is a patrolman who lived in Jackson before dying of a stroke aged 73. Prior to his death, he formed a close relationship with Dina (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-dina-and-alien-romulus-have-an-unexpected-connection">played in the show by Isabel Merced</a>). Little else is really known about Eugene, but players can find a letter in the game which reveals he had a wife and daughter, however he left them to join the Fireflies, where he served with Joel's brother Tommy.</p>

 </a>
</figure>
<p>The showrunners previously said Eugene's story was going to be expanded upon for the show, with an episode akin to season one's Bill and Frank episode, so I assumed this meant they would be telling Eugene's story of leaving his family to join the Fireflies. Maybe it still will, and maybe O'Hara plays Eugene's second wife but… how will the fact that Joel killed a load of the Fireflies at the end of the first season impact those therapy sessions?!</p>
<p>Ooh, I am looking forward to finding out. You can check out a clip of O'Hara as Gail with Pedro Pascal's Joel in the second season of The Last of Us below.</p>

<p>During the same The Last of Us premiere event, <a href="https://x.com/Variety/status/1904351105447809242">Druckmann also teased some of the show's impactful moments</a>, noting during the filming of episode six of season two: "Our actors...left a piece of their soul in this episode."</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us will kick off next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. Spores have been confirmed for The Last of Us' second season, with the showrunners <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-promises-viewers-a-different-evolution-of-infection-plus-spores-make-a-return">promising viewers "a different evolution" of infection</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo will reportedly launch its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> games in three phases.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/">Insider Gaming</a>, the first phase will see <em>primarily </em>first party games released on the console's launch, which is believed to be June. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-analysts-predict-400-price-and-biggest-console-launch-ever-in-june">console launch date ties in with what both analysts</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-coming-in-june-at-400-former-nintendo-employee-predicts">former Nintendo employee have predicted will be the case</a>.</p>

<p>The second phase of Nintendo's game launch plan is then reportedly set for around October-November, and will have a greater focus on third-party studios. Sources said these studios are expecting to get their hands on a Switch 2 dev kit in June.</p>
<p>The third and final phase will tie in with the holiday period, Insider Gaming reports. So, to me that's the end of November and then December. 
</p>
<p>Thankfully, there isn't too much longer to go until we hear something more concrete on Nintendo's Switch successor. A dedicated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo Direct focused on the Switch 2 will take place on 2nd April</a>, where we'll presumably hear about the release date and price. And, just maybe, we will hear about more games coming to the console, so don't get your hopes up, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>? Ooh, what about Silksong?! We surely must be getting an update on that soon…</p>
<p>Anyway, in the meantime while we wait for more, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know about Switch 2</a> so far.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
