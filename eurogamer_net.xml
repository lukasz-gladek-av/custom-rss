            <p>There is a new patch for co-op climbing caper Peak, which adds a colour blindness mode as well as a number of fixes and balance tweaks.</p>
<p>The colour blindness mode, which has long been requested by the Peak community, adds patterns to the game's different coloured berries. This, the developer says, will help "further differentiate them", and make the berries more readily able to be told apart.</p>
<p>On the balance side of things, the Peak team has among other things made Nest Eggs heavier.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest patch notes for Peak below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Colour Blindness Mode! This adds patterns to differently-colored berries to further differentiate them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the maximum time before the first tornado can spawn.</li>
<li>Slightly increased the minimum time before a tornado can spawn again.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced the commonness of the "Tornado Hell" biome variant,</li>
<li>It is now wayyy less likely that the maze is blocked after entering the TOMB.</li>
<li>Nest Eggs now weigh more to match the weight of the Egg inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would be unable to obtain the Endurance Badge!</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where The Scoutmaster couldn't climb walls. This went unnoticed for a while because he can jump pretty high, but now he should be even scarier.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Scrolls and Berrynanas and other objects that change form when used would drop the new item instead of putting it in your hands.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue where playing a vanilla game after previously having visual mods installed (or playing with a modded player while not having their same mods installed) could cause a variety of visual and functionality issues. This could include, but was not limited to, players permanently showing up as a default skin in the endgame screen even if not wearing modded cosmetics, as well as the endgame report breaking entirely and preventing certain achievements from being obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, rarely, getting caught in a tornado would cause the game to freeze on the loading screen upon failing a run.</li>
<li>We gave the backpack new physics that should prevent more cases where people would lose their backpack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Magic Bugle and Scoutmaster's Bugle play at a strangely low volume. (its not too loud now I promise)</li>
<li>The Guidebook renders at a higher resolution if you set the Render Scale to low.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where placing a Scout Cannon atop a jellyfish could cause a softlock.</li>
<li>A missing treetop has been added to a branch on the giant tree.</li>
<li>Removed the annoying flicker on the end game countdown.</li>
<li>Removed Scoutmaster grain effect in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Rainbow stamina bar is now slower in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it said "Move" instead of "Interact" on a prompt in the Controls page.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
