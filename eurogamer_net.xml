            <p>Nintendo has increased its sales forecast for its recently debuted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console ahead of the festive season.</p>
<p>"The full-year sales unit forecast for Nintendo Switch 2 hardware has been increased by 4m units to 19m units, and software by 3m units to 48m units," the company wrote in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">most recent financial report</a>.</p>
<p>As of 30th September 2025, the Switch 2 has sold 10.36m units, Nintendo revealed. This means the company has shifted a total of 4.54m Switch 2 hardware units during the three months ending 30th September of this year. To put that into perspective, 4.54m sales in the second quarter is unmatched by any other console.

<p>"Additionally, the forecast for Nintendo Switch hardware has been decreased by 0.50m units to 4m units, and software has been increased by 20m units to 125m units," the company continued.</p>
<p>The original Switch, which first released back in 2017, has sold a total 154.01m units as of 30th September. According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">latest financial reports</a>, Nintendo's best selling console thus far remains Nintendo DS, but only by an actual smidge. The DS as of September has sold 154.02m units. It seems more than likely that the Switch will usurp the DS in terms of sales by the next reporting period.</p>

<p>If you compare this to other consoles in the same launch time, you can see just how impressive these stats are: the PS4 managed 7.5m in the same timeframe, with the PS5 achieving 7.8m, and the original Switch shifting just under 5m (4.7m, to be precise).</p><p>Looking ahead to full 12-month figures, Nintendo's target of 19m Switch 2 sales will put the new console comfortably ahead of the original Switch (which managed just over 14m), the PS4 (clocking in at 13.5m), and the PS5 (which had a peculiarly similar trajectory to its predecessor at 13.4m).</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, earlier this week it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-apparently-a-very-good-mario-themed-reason-you-should-go-and-see-wicked-for-good-this-november">a trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be attached to screenings of Wicked: For Good</a>, which is set to release on 21st November. Some have since started speculating that Rosalina, should she appear in the upcoming sequel, will be voiced by Ariana Grande, who stars and Glinda the Good in the Wicked film adaptations.</p>
