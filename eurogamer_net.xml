Pokémon fans attending this month's big meetup in Los Angeles are being encouraged to bring a can of soup along with them. 
</p>
<p>
The initiative is part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic's push to aid LA's wildfire relief efforts - which also involves a joint $1m donation from the developer and The Pokémon Company group.
</p>
<p>
Some fans were unsure whether Pokémon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles would still go ahead at the city's Rose Bowl Stadium later this month, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">January's devastating wildfires</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But after several weeks of uncertainty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-offers-refunds-for-los-angeles-event-following-wildfires">Niantic confirmed at the start of February that the event would continue as planned - with optional refunds</a> for those who decided they no longer wanted to attend.
</p>
<p>
"For ticket-holding Trainers attending the in-person event, Niantic will host a donation drive at Rose Bowl Stadium supporting the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.
</p>
<p>
"The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank supports food pantries across Los Angeles County, and we encourage ticket-holding Trainers who are able and willing to participate in this drive to bring one can of protein or low sodium soup to the event."
</p>
<p>
Numerous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-donation-to-los-angeles-wildfire-relief">video game and entertainment companies have donated to LA wildfire relief efforts</a> over the past month.
</p>
<p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the wildfires. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-flying-drone-that-crashed-into-firefighting-plane-during-la-wildfires">He now faces up to a year in prison</a>.
