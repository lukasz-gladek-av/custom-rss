            <p>DreadXP's second Indie Horror Showcase 2024 was broadcast last night, ushering in a flood of new spooky game announcements, including a new trailer for the upcoming remaster of 2002 third-person survival shooter The Thing.</p>
<p>At less than two minutes long, it doesn't give away much, admittedly, but it's our first glimpse at The Thing: Remastered's gameplay. You can check out the teaser below, which shows off how the team at Nightdive is handling the remaster:</p>

<p>The Thing: Remastered takes place in a frozen arctic tundra where "a mysterious shape-shifting alien has wiped out the crew of the US Outpost #31 research facility". You play as Captain J.F. Blake (no relation), the leader of a United States Army Special Forces rescue team sent to "investigate the blood-curdling events that transpired in the original The Thing film".</p><p>"Trapped by the elements and at risk of infection by a horrific entity, Blake must keep his squad together to survive by gaining their trust and ensuring that their fear and paranoia don't get the best of themâ€¦ or himself," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>The Thing: Remastered is coming to Nintendo Switch, PC, via Steam PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and last-gen consoles in 2024. As yet, there's still no firm release date.</p>

<p>Of course, The Thing: Remastered wasn't the only update from last night, so I've embedded the full Indie Horror Showcase above for those who might have missed it. Hosted by the fabulous content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JohnWolfe">John "red means scary" Wolfe</a>, it's a creepy celebration of the best indie horror games currently in development. To support the event, there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/theindiehorrorshowcase">Steam page</a> where you can play demos and add your favourite games from the showcase to your wishlist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
GAME customers are once again facing a familiar wait to play the latest big gaming launch - this time, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> - as the beleagured high street chain has failed, once again, to send out pre-order copies in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
Customers say the retailer has taken payment but failed to provide their Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 copy on launch day - and with little to no communication on when it will actually arrive. 
</p>
<p>
A note on GAME's support site has acknowledged this latest snafu, and said that affected orders are currently "processing". Eurogamer has contacted GAME parent company Frasers Group for more.
</p>
<p>
"We are aware some customers may have not received their delivery of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 yet," Game's Help <a href="https://help.game.co.uk/support/home?_gl=1*zk2a5c*_gcl_au*NTgwMzQ4MjAzLjE3MjgwNDIyNTY.">website</a> states. "We are currently processing these orders and will keep you updated with further information. We apologise for the delay."
</p>
<p>
GAME previously pushed customers to pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 with the promise of a Steelbook case and the ability to "pick up and play 10.25.24" - today's date.
</p>
<p>
But affected GAME customers have told Eurogamer that there's no sign of their copy, or the Steelbook, and that customer service representatives have said copies won't be delivered until at least next week.
</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/gwp5mahbuaah6bp.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>"Pick up and play 10.25.24" | <span>Image credit: <cite>GAME</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In an email sent by GAME customer support, seen by Eurogamer, a  service advisor acknowledges that the customer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 order "is part of a group of products that are experiencing delays as part of our website updates". 
</p><p>
This refers to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">ongoing issue Eurogamer reported on previously that results from GAME's systems being merged into those of Frasers Group</a>. This has also blocked GAME customers from seeing older orders - or easily modifying or cancelling them - on GAME's website. 
</p>
<p>It's all left GAME customers once again in limbo - unhappy at having to wait, and unwilling to simply pick up a copy elsewhere due to the difficulties of getting a refund and the loss of GAME's Steelbook.</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-game-pre-order-customers-receive-copies-but-for-wrong-edition">GAME customers faced an anxious wait for copies of Silent Hill 2</a> to arrive - and when they did, they initially did so without the chain's offer of a Steelbook case included. Eurogamer reported previously on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pre-order-customers-left-in-limbo-as-metaphor-and-silent-hill-2-launches-loom">GAME customers waiting weeks, in and in some cases months</a>, for missing pre-orders to arrive.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs.1019148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft boss Satya Nadella will earn a wallet-busting $79.1m (Â£60.9m) this financial year, up 63 percent on his compensation for 2023.
</p>
<p>
The huge boost to Nadella's pay in both cash and stock, announced by Microsoft last night, comes after a positive year overall for the company's financial revenues - but a turbulent 12 months for its employees.
</p>
<p>
2024 has seen two mass layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 staff laid off in January</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">a further 650 Xbox employees were shown the door</a> in September. 
</p>
<p>
Regardless, Microsoft's shares are up and the company's market value is now higher than $3tn, as it works to capitalise on the rise of AI. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">shut down three Bethesda gaming studios</a> in June - Arkane Austin, the now-external Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-concerned-over-layoffs-due-to-lack-of-industry-growth">Xbox boss Phil Spencer discussed a lack of overall growth in the console market</a>. 
</p>
<p>Writing in Microsoft's 2024 Annual Report, released last night, Nadella painted a rosier picture, however.</p>
<p>"We are bringing great games to more people on more devices," Nadella wrote. "With our acquisition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> King, which closed October 2023, we've added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1bn in lifetime revenueâ€”from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, Diablo, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. 
</p><p>"And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love - where, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms."</p>
<p>That cross-platform publishing programme will continue over the next few months with the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> for PC and Xbox in December, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">PlayStation in February 2025</a>, with the expectation that other games will then follow. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a lengthy message posted to X/Twitter, "Bucky" called out "hilariously emotional takes", noting that whilst hateful comments are "running rampant in the gaming scene these days", "the Palworld ones are particularly silly".</p>

<p>"You just throw out accusations based on vibes and if you aren't doing that then it's just hilariously emotional takes like 'can't wait for you all to lose your jobs and go bankrupt'," Bucky wrote.</p>
<p>"If you're hyping a building full of people losing their jobs, then it's not an us problem, it's a you problem. These sorts of over-emotional takes are running rampant in the gaming scene these days, but the Palworld ones are particularly silly."</p><div>

<p>"The sad part is most of the directed hate on Palworld is bait. Some rando account that posts 24+ times a day and struggles to get 1000 views per post picks up Palworld as an easy target, gets a cosy half a mil off a low-effort 'PALWORLD IS SLOP' post and then milks it for a week," they added.</p>
<p>"If you hate Palworld, and I mean if you genuinely hate Palworld, then do yourself a favour and mute us on Twitter, hide the game on Steam, and stop thinking about it. Who wants to dedicate time and energy to things they don't like?</p>
<p>"Your hate serves only to upset yourself and feed grifters their views. Move on."</p>
<p>In response, iWill - who seemingly prompted Bucky's message with a viral post earlier this week <a href="https://x.com/iWillTheGamer/status/1849269224788602936">pointing out the similarities between Pals and PokÃ©mon</a> - said, "I would like to state, I don't hate Palworld. Never played. Think its cool how they started the year off tbh. I personally just found this funny and never seen that 'Pal' before and made that comparison. Don't talk bad about Palworld. Please? They iight."</p>
<p>Following last month's shock announcement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo is suing Palworld maker Pocketpair</a> for the infringement of "multiple patents rights", an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ps5-release-finally-available-in-japan-despite-looming-nintendo-lawsuit">IP expert has claimed it's "exceedingly plausible"</a> Nintendo crafted its patent applications specifically to target Palworld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
