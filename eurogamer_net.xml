            <p>Nightmare Kart is set to receive an expansion, despite a DMCA takedown from Sony against the developer's Bloodborne PSX demake.</p>
<p>Originally known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bloodborne-kart">Bloodborne Kart</a>, the racer is a spin-off from the Bloodborne PSX demake from fan developer Lilith Walther. The name was changed to Nightmare Kart once Sony got involved and requested Walther "scrub the branding" from the game.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-bloodborne-fan-project-gets-the-legal-takedown-treatment-sparking-speculation-an-official-remake-is-coming">legal takedown was issued by MarkScan Enforcement against a YouTube video of Walther's Bloodborne PSX demake</a>. Now the full game itself has been <a href="https://itch.io/takedowns/1370201">removed from itch.io</a> with a notice from the same company.</p>

<p>MarkScan represents Sony Interactive Entertainment, with the notice claiming copyright infringement.</p>
<p>"No person is entitled to upload, stream (live, delayed, repeat etc.), make available for download, broadcast and/or communicate to the public, the copyright content listed above, in any manner whatsoever, through any transmission platform, including the internet, for viewing on devices such as computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablet computers, etc. without express authorization from our client," the notice reads.</p>
<p>As reported earlier this week, another fan project from modder Lance McDonald has also been hit by a claim, which enabled Bloodborne to run at 60fps.</p>
<p>McDonald shared a social media post from Walther confirming both projects had been hit by DMCA takedown requests. Walther's post has since been removed.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Sony for comment, but has not yet received a response.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">MarkScan are a company hired by Sony Interactive Entertainment. They’re the same company that DMCAed my page about the Bloodborne 60fps patch. And now they’ve DMCAed an old video about the Bloodborne PSX demake project. That’s pretty wild.

<p>It seems, therefore, that Sony is gradually targeting all Bloodborne fan projects. But why? Hope has, of course, turned to a possible official remake, though Sony or FromSoftware are yet to announce anything.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Nightmare Kart is still available for free. It released in June last year, and its suitably named DLC The Old Karts will add in a new mini campaign, as well as new racers, karts, tracks, and power ups.</p>
<p>Bloodborne DLC The Old Hunters introduced Lady Maria, who's already paralleled in Nightmare Kart as Mistress Mary. Perhaps we'll get an Orphan of Kos equivalent?</p>
<p>Former PlayStation exec <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">Shuhei Yoshida reckons Bloodborne creator Hidetaka Miyazaki is "so busy"</a> a remake hasn't been possible.</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it," said Yoshida.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Miyazaki told Eurogamer</a> he's "very happy" to see so many passionate fans calling for a Bloodborne remake.</p>
<p>"Put simply, it makes me very happy to see it's a title with a lot of specific memories, both for me and the staff who worked on it," he said. "And when we see those passionate voices in the community, of course it makes us feel thrilled, it makes us feel very fortunate to have that and to have those memories."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Avowed will include the option to play at 60fps on Xbox Series X, developer Obsidian has now confirmed, after previously saying the game's "core" 30fps option was a benefit.
</p>
<p>
Game director Carrie Patel has now confirmed an option for "up to" 60fps will exist in the game at launch, as part of a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtStowg2Rk">MinnMax</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Last year, art director Matt Hansen said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-currently-targeting-baseline-of-30fps-on-xbox-consoles-to-make-way-for-juicier-vfx">Obsidian had decided to target 30fps as Avowed was a single-player game</a>, and therefore "you don't necessarily need that 60fps". Indeed, 30fps allowed Obsidian to "get a lot juicier with VFX and lighting", he continued.

<p>
"It's a trade-off we opted to make relatively early, and we're really happy with that," Hansen added. "The game's running pretty smooth for, you know, how visually dense it is, and that was always our goal."
</p>
<p>
That said, Hansen has still left wiggle room that other options might make the game's final release. Performance optimisation was "one of the last things you do", he noted.
</p>
<p>
This week, on being asked what Avowed's frame-rate would be, Patel answered: "You can get up to 60[fps]". Details of the game's resolution at that frame-rate were not mentioned.
</p>
<p>
Set in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe, Avowed is the latest game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> studio Obsidian, and is set to launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in just a couple of weeks, on 18th February. As you'd expect, PC and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will get access to the game on day one.
</p>
<p>
"Avowed plays like a funny Obsidian role-player where you buddy up with the voice of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Garrus," I wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-plays-like-a-funny-obsidian-role-player-where-you-buddy-up-with-the-voice-of-mass-effects-garrus">hands-on with Avowed</a> last year. "If you're after a fresh Obsidian hit... Avowed is one to keep an eye on."

            <p>Harrison Ford has praised Troy Baker's depiction of his iconic whip-toting archaeologist in Xbox's recent release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>Ford was interviewed by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f">Wall Street Journal</a>, and discussed the suggestion someone might use AI to replicate his likeness in the future. Notably, his last appearance in the Indiana Jones film series includes a digitalised de-aged likeness of himself, seen through flashbacks.</p>
<p>"You don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent," said Ford, before referring to Baker's performance as the iconic Indy.  "He did a brilliant job, and it didn't take AI to do it."</p>

</figure>
<p>Indeed, Ford isn't concerned with AI. "My plan is to keep working behind that face till I don't care what happens anymore. I'm selling that piece by piece while I'm alive," he said. "I've been compensated. You don't need to worry about me."</p>
<p>AI has been a major talking point for video game actors, and a key hold-up in negotiations between actors' union SAG-AFTRA and the video game industry as a strike continues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke to celebrated video game actor Jennifer Hale</a> about the strikes, with Hale describing AI as "an existential issue for all of us".</p>
<p>"We need to be able to control when our voice is used," she said. "I don't want my voice used on a project that I would never support or that I didn't say yes to. We need to be compensated for when our voice is used, because we are paid for our exposure as much as for our time."</p>
<p>If anything, Baker's performance as Indiana Jones proves AI isn't necessary to replicate an iconic character - talent is enough.</p>
<p>Baker has been widely praised for his performance in the game, which begins with a recreation of the prologue from Raiders of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">five star review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. It went on to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">Eurogamer's Game of 2024</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Resident Evil Re:Verse was developed in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Resident Evil series, and your overwhelming support for the game has far exceeded our expectations since the time of its release," reads a <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/reverse/us/topic/topic_250206.html">statement from Capcom</a>.</p>
<p>"Now that we've reached a new turning point for the series, we feel that Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably.</p>
<p>"We are incredibly grateful for your warm support for Resident Evil Re:Verse, and we deeply apologise for bringing you this disappointing news."</p>
<p>Any RP Boosters or content unlocked in the game's Premium Pass will be available from now until servers are shut off.</p>
<p>Though originally intended to release alongside Resident Evil Village, Re:Verse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-reverse-resurfaces">delayed multiple times</a> before eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-reverse-has-a-new-october-release-date">releasing in October 2022</a> with Village's Winters Expansion DLC - that was 17 months after Village.</p>
<p>That means Re:Verse has lasted just over two years.</p>
