            <p>
May is here, and with it comes a fresh batch of additions to Xbox Games Pass' catalogue for Ultimate and Standard tier subscribers. It's quite a busy month too, bringing a number of day-one big-hitters including Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet.
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages is the headline act, of course, giving the series' classic demon-slaying action a medieval twist - including the addition of a great big bonking shield - in an adventure set before events of 2016's Doom. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-doom-the-dark-ages-reveals-another-reinvention-but-one-that-feels-less-cleanly-defined">looking pretty promising</a>. Revenge of the Savage Planet, meanwhile, is the follow up to Typhoon Studios' comedic 2020 action-adventure Journey to the Savage Planet; it retains the zany tone of its predecessor, but - as Eurogamer's Robert Purchase wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review">his three star review</a> - is perhaps "not as wild and carefree as it wants to be".
</p>
<p>
And here's everything currently confirmed for Xbox Game Pass in May:
</p>
<h3>Out today:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dredge (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S) - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>

But of course, where there's a hello, there's a goodbye, and May sees a number of Game Pass departures to go alongside the above additions.

<li>Chants of Sennaar (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Dune: Spice Wars (Game Preview) (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
