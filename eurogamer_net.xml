            <p>Team Cherry has teased more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> releases beyond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, which (if they ever do materialise) would sit alongside the studio's previous games, rather than act as any kind of continuation that would require an understanding of earlier lore to appreciate.</p>
<p>In a newly unearthed interview with <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/works/125388--hollow-knight-silksong-game-worlds-acmi/">ACMI</a> (the Australian Centre for the Moving Image), which appears to have been conducted ahead of Hollow Knight: Silksong's release in September, Team Cherry studio leads Ari Gibson and William Pellen discussed their Hollow Knight titles.</p>

<p>When asked by the co-curator of the ACMI's Game Worlds exhibition how the duo would define success, the developers both agreed that releasing Silksong with "no major bugs" would of course be desirable (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-hopes-if-there-were-ever-new-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-they-could-just-exist-alongside-one-another-so-the-order-you-play-them-doesnt-matter/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p>
<p>Pellen then said "the 'goal' is already kind of done, I think," stating: "We had an idea for a game that we wanted to make, and we wanted to make the best version of that game, a version of the game that satisfies the theme, the best version we can make."</p><p>Gibson agreed with Pellen's words here, adding the aim with Silksong was to make "a game that can stand alongside Hollow Knight." He noted Silksong "kind of branches off in a nice way" and so the two games "really complement" each other. "It's nice developing something where there's no tech race," Gibson continued. "We're not trying to push boundaries; we have a very set style, it's pretty simple."</p>
<p>The Team Cherry studio head then said he doesn't think players would "feel like you lost anything, traveling back to the original game after playing Silksong," before adding this rather teasing little comment.</p>
<p>"And if there were ever others, we would hope that they all follow that same pattern – that the series is all games that just exist alongside one another."</p>
<p>Now obviously this is a very hypothetical 'if' from the developer, and by no way means that we can expect an entire Hollow Knight series with more entries than the Witcher and Game of Thrones books combined. But even so, it is nice to know that the developers still see a possibility that they could return with some more Hollow Knights in the future.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Silksong five stars. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Eurogamer's Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie recently spoke to several developers about the impact Silksong's low price will have on other indie games. Does it really matter, or has Team Cherry unexpectedly set a precedent for other indie games going forward? You can find out in Bertie's feature: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">Is Hollow Knight Silksong's 'cheap' price a problem for other indie games? Devs and publishers weigh up its impact</a>.</p>
