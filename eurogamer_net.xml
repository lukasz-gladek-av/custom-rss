Infinity Nikki, the hotly-anticipated "cosy" open-world adventure from the designer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, now has a release date.
</p>
<p>
Android, iPhone, PC and PlayStation 5 versions of Infinity Nikki all arrive on 5th December, Singaporean developer Infold Games confirmed today, allowing players to dress up, explore and befriend cute pets in an ever-expanding open world.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki is the most ambitious project yet for the Nikki series, which has to date enjoyed enormous popularity in China.

This latest entry boasts involvement from Nintendo veteran Kentaro Tominaga, who worked for 20 years at the Mario maker and served as game designer on Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
</p>
<p>
Infold's hopes for this new entry are clearly high, with a worldwide marketing push and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-tops-30m-registrations-and-its-not-even-out-yet">30m registrations for Infinity Nikki</a> already under its brightly-coloured belt. And yes, that is Jessie J singing the song for the game's trailer, above.
</p>
<p>
Infinity Nikki's smartphone predecessor Shining Nikki was downloaded 100m times, though was the subject of a cultural spat in South Korea over traditional costumes - leading to the game's Korean version being pulled, and criticism of the developer's handling of the issue.
</p><p>
At Nintendo, Tominaga served as assistant director on GameCube classics such as Zelda: The Wind Waker, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a> and Mario Kart: Double Dash. More recently, he worked on Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-link-between-worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a> and received a special thanks credit in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.

            <p>
There's a lot to love about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, but one of its most impressive and remarked-upon technical aspects is undoubtedly its advanced rendering of characters' hair. 
</p>
<p>
Hairstyles move and sway naturally as you and your party walk, while long hair streams out behind as you run. Your whole hairdo reacts if you are impacted by a sudden force or object.
</p>
<p>
There are up to 50,000 strands of hair on each of Dragon Age: The Veilguard's main characters, powered by something BioWare and EA's Frostbite engine team call Strand Hair technology. It's something originally worked upon for EA Sports FC, but which has been expanded upon greatly here.
</p>

<figcaption>Here's a video version of our Dragon Age: The Veilguard review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"While Strand Hair is present in other EA games, the BioWare team had to push the limits even further for Dragon Age: The Veilguard," EA writes in a new deep-dive <a href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard">blog post</a> on Stand Hair. "For example, implementing Strand Hair technology for characters who have waist-length hair with horns on their head presented some unique challenges.
</p><p>
"With hair attachments that move seamlessly, and the decoupling of simulation and render tessellation, this is the first EA game to offer such detailed physics-driven long hairstyles. The Frostbite team increased maximum hair length from 63 points to 255, and implemented a new system for complex hair structures like braids."
</p>
<p>
Tomb Raider's TressFX eat your heart out.
</p>
<p>
There's some detailed technical notes on how it all works, though perhaps the most interesting bit here is how BioWare had to overcome difficulties dealing with the wealth of other semi-transparent objects on screen. In EA Sports FC, this hadn't been much of an issue. Here, in scenes frequently enveloped in fog, smog or fire, it was. 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, BioWare developed a system where each hairdo is rendered multiple times, with opaque and transparent layers rendered and then blended on the fly.
</p>
<p>
"We first render the opaque part of strand hair, and then we render transparent objects," BioWare's senior rendering engineer James Power noted. "The shaders for the transparent objects use the transparent hair depth texture to determine whether the shading pixel is 'under' or 'on top' of the strand hair. If it's below, it renders the hair and marks a stencil bit (think of it as a masking texture)."
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/datv-strand-hair-blog-layered-transparency.jpg.adapt.1920w.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
There's discussion here too of how Strand Hair's "high memory footprint" is handled without degrading the performance. Dragon Age The Veilguard was never going to have a full squad of 22 characters on-screen all with Strand Hair at once, as is the case in EA Sports FC. But the added complexity of longer hair and more technical environments mean BioWare needed ways to adjust memory usage when multiple characters are shown.
</p>
<p>
For lower quality settings on PC, as well as Xbox Series S, the ability to ditch Strand Hair for more standard hairdo assets is also supported.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is clamping down on what it calls "disruptive behaviour" - specifically, players going AFK to boost account levels without playing, or playing on alternative servers via VPNs.
</p>
<p>
The franchise's Ricochet Anti-Cheat technology has been tuned to better detect AFK players who load into matches simply to gather XP without any intention of playing, disrupting team balance and infuriating team mates. 
</p>
<p>
Anyone looking to unlock Ranked Play will now need to win 50 match-made multiplayer matches before doing so, in order to ensure Ranked players are at the correct skill level (presumably, to give less experienced players a chance to improve but also stop sweaty veterans making fresh accounts that get matched with newbies). 
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, this change is also designed to give Ricochet a cache of match history data to "examine", with top players further looked into via a Replay Investigation Tool to ensure everyone's playing by the rules. 
</p>
<p>
These updates will also apply to Ranked Play when it arrives in Call of Duty Warzone, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes">patch notes</a> state.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday we took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-battle-pass-includes-a-parasite-skin-for-some-reason">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 1 battle pass</a>, which includes a parasite skin and what looks like a rip-off of Rocket Raccoon.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warzone-black-ops-6-season-1-release-date-time">Call of Duty Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> launches today at 5pm UK time. </p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will add the ability to trade cards with other players at the start of 2025, the smash hit smartphone game's development team has confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
Before then, the game will also be refreshed with the launch of new booster packs due "by the end of the year".
</p>
<p>
In a development update posted to X, the Pokémon TCG Pocket team said it was "aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be traded starting in January 2025". It's unclear, however, which cards these might be limited to, and what other costs or limitations might be involved.

Pokémon TCG Pocket's plan to add fresh booster packs before the end of 2024 lines up with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-expansion-due-late-january-leak-suggests">recent datamine which suggested at least one additional pack would arrive in December</a>, before a fully-fledged new expansion due on 29th January next year. 
</p>
<p>
That datamine also highlighted in-progress work on a new card rarity and rare card picks being added to the Wonder Pick mechanic. As ever, however, datamined details are subject to change.
</p>
<p>
"We have other new features in development outside of the trade feature," the Pokémon TCG Pocket team wrote. "We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalised, so please look forward to it.
</p>
<p>
"We hope you continue to enjoy Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket. Don't forget to open your packs each day!"
