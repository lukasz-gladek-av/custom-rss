            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind Afrofuturist metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> publisher Pocketpair to release its next game.</p>
<p>Set for release in 2025, it will be a horror game but not part of the Tales of Kenzera universe.</p>
<p>Last year's Tales of Kenzera: Zau, published by EA, was the first in the series, with more games planned to continue that world. However, this next game will be a shorter and separate project.</p>

<p>"Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it. It will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say," said Surgent Studios CEO Abubakar Salim.</p>
<p>"We're still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we've come from and where we're going."</p>
<p>Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing.</p>
<p>"As the games industry continues to grow, more and more games find themselves struggling to get funded or greenlit," said head of Pocketpair Publishing John Buckley. "We think this is a real shame, because there are so many incredible creators and ideas out there that just need a little help to become incredible games.</p><p>"We were instantly fascinated by Abubakar's creative vision for a horror game on a topic he's uniquely qualified to explore. The ultimate goal of Pocketpair Publishing is to find creators with a genuine passion for games and enable them to create fun, new experiences for gamers all over the world."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Eurogamer was shown a prototype for a new gothic horror game called Project Uso</a>, where players take the role of a vampiric android bearing the soul of Eshu, the god of chaos.</p>
<p>However, Surgent Studios has confirmed to Eurogamer today's announcement is a separate project, while Project Uso will be the continuation of the Tales of Kenzera world.</p>
<p>As a result, details on this new small project are largely unknown. It's set to release later this year.</p> <div>

<p>Following Tales of Kenzera: Zau, staff from Surgent Studios faced redundancy as the developer sought funding for its next project.</p>
<p>"There is this idea of constantly being pushed to grow, to be bigger, to do more, to spend more," Salim previously told Eurogamer. "And within an industry that is, rightfully, so artistic in its nature, that isn't necessarily always the answer."</p>
<p>That consideration may point to the decision to work with Pocketpair on this new, smaller game.</p>
<p>Salim has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abubakar-salim-addresses-fever-pitch-of-racism-received-after-launch-of-tales-of-kenzera-zau">received a torrent of racist abuse online</a>, in the midst of openness about the development of Tales of Kenzera.</p>
<p>"I'm happy that we've been really open with as much as we can," he said. "Whatever feedback you have, send it through. Racism isn't feedback."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Extremely OK Games - the studio behind beloved 2018 platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> - has announced the cancellation of its "2D explor-action" project Earthblade, calling the news a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".
</p>
<p>
Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-dev-announces-new-game-earthblade-with-vibe-revealing-teaser-art-and-music">unveiled Earthblade back in 2021</a>, sharing some mood-setting teaser art and a musical snippet. A full reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">arrived a year and a half later</a>, offering an early glimpse of a side-scrolling platformer - blending elements of combat and exploration - that would see an "enigmatic child of Fate returning at long last to Earth".
</p>
<p>
At the time, the project was expected to arrive in 2024, but Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-developers-next-game-wont-be-out-this-year">confirmed a delay last March</a>. And while it didn't commit to a new release window, it moved to assure fans progress was not "stagnant" and that the team was "still excited to work on it".

<p>
Today, however, the studio has announced Earthblade is no more. In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">lengthy post shared on the Extremely OK website</a>, studio director Maddy Thorson went into some of the factors leading to the project's cancellation. These include a "disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste" which, as painted in today's announcement, saw Thorson and Noel Berry on one side and studio "founding member" Pedro Medeiros on the other.
</p><p>
Thorson says the issue was eventually resolved following a "very difficult and heartbreaking process", but noted the outcome resulted in Medeiros' departure from the Earthblade project after "both parties... agreed in the end that we should go our separate way".
</p>
<p>
This, in turn, prompted the remaining members of Extremely OK to "take a serious look at whether fighting through to finish Earthblade was the right path forward". And while the project "had a lot going for it", according to Thorson, "it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process."
</p>
<p>
"Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day," Thorson continued, "and realised that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."
</p>
<p>
"Pedro isn't to blame for this," Thorson stressed. "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."
</p><p>
With Earthblade officially no more, other members of the team have also "moved on". However, Thorson and Berry now plan to "take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned... wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects." As a result, the duo are "prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/towerfall">TowerFall</a>'s inception."
</p>
<p>
"We are happy to return to our roots," Thorson concluded, "and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us."

            <p>
EA has lowered its financial forecast for its current fiscal year, pointing to the 'underperformance' of EA Sports FC 2025 - which it says accounts for the "majority" of the shortfall - alongside lower-than-expected interest in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
As noted in EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">revised outlook</a> for the year ending 31st March 2025, the company was previously forecasting a  "mid-single-digit growth in live services net bookings". However, it now expects a "mid-single-digit decline", blaming the "majority of the change" on EA Sports 2025 - which saw a "slowdown in momentum" following its release in September.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, EA has reported lower-than-expected interest in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, saying BioWare's fantasy RPG "engaged" approximately 1.5m players during the quarter - a number it describes as being "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations."
</p>

<p>
All this means the publisher now anticipates net bookings of approximately $2.21 billion for its third fiscal quarter and an updated range of $7-7.15 billion for fiscal year 2025.
</p>
<p>
"During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio, EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a statement accompanying today's revised guidance. "However, Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> underperformed our net bookings expectations." Even so, Wilson says, "We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline."
</p><p>
Despite Dragon Age: The Veilguard failing to meet EA's business expectations, BioWare's latest was well-received by critics when it launched in October 2024. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">wrote in his five star review</a>. "The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was less enthused by EA Sports FC 2025, however. "Another year where the annual tweaks settle in such a way as to recreate, or reposition, the same old problems that have been here since the beginning," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">wrote in his three star review</a>. "This is EA Sports FC 25. I love it. I hate it. It'll probably be like this forever."
