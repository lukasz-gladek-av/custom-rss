            <p>In case you hadn't herd, a little something called the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> released yesterday. Nintendo's latest console arrived in a flurry of red boxes, with many new owners quickly making the most of launch title <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there is one standout star in Mario Kart World. No, not Mario, Luigi, Peach or any other of Nintendo's staple karting racers. Rather, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">the all-new Cow has stolen the hearts of many a Mario Kart World owner</a>, to the point where races are now a mélange of moooo-ving parts.</p>

<p>There have been numerous social media posts showing Mario Kart World races which have been infected with rad cow disease (thank Ian for that pun).</p>
<p>"24 people all cows," reads one translated Mario Kart World post on X, with an accompanying video proving these players aren't doing things by calf measure. "Mario Kart is too chaotic, lol."</p> <div>

<p>"I've been in three full cow races."</p> <div>

<p>Cow certainly seems popular, with other users just sharing posts of appreciation for the new racer. </p>
<p>"COW MAINS RISE UP MOOO," reads one social media post, complete with their Cow reaching up in victory, udders flying in the breeze like they just don't have a care in the world.</p> <div>

<p>So, have you managed to get your hands (or hooves) on Mario Kart World yet? Who is your go-to racer? My console still hasn't arrived yet, but when it does, perhaps I will see you in one of those lobbies bursting at the seams with Cow!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are yet to play but are planning on it later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-mario-kart-world-defaults-to-smart-steering-but-its-easily-turned-off">know that Smart Steering controls are on by default</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> has arrived on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> as part of its GameCube collection, but the default controls make the game virtually unplayable.</p>
<p>This might shock you for a racing game, but F-Zero GX is all about going really fast. And to do that you need to boost - a lot.</p>
<p>Except by default, the Switch 2 maps accelerate to the A button and boost to the Y button. In order to effectively boost you need to be accelerating, which means hitting both buttons at the same time. And that's practically impossible, especially without hitting the B button which is brake by default.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it's easy enough to remap the controls. Hit the minus button to suspend the game and bring up the options, and from here you can switch any of the controls around.</p>
<p>So what's best? I swapped the Y and B buttons around, so I could boost more easily instead of braking. After all, who hits the brakes in an F-Zero game?</p>
<p>An alternative would be to put boost on X, which is also accessible while pressing A to accelerate, though you'll need to move attacks (on X) to another button. This A and X combo would mimic the original controls that put boost on the kidney shaped Y button above the central A.</p>
<p>Another option would be to put boost on the Switch 2's L button, which is unused by default.</p>

<p>Of course, the real alternative Nintendo wants is for you to buy the GameCube controller, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">that'll set you back almost 60 quid</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">remaining two GameCube classics are The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Soul Calibur 2</a>, but the controls appear much more manageable by default. The collection is available for those with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>F-Zero GX was developed by Sega and published by Nintendo for the GameCube back in 2003. Since then, we haven't had a new home console entry in the series (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-99-feels-like-a-battle-royale-in-a-pinball-machine">beyond F-Zero 99</a>). Still, I'm very happy to see Switch 2 technically launch with an F-Zero game, just like the SNES and GBA did - I've missed those camp post-race news reports.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></p><p>Up to 12 players can join the same voice chat, opening up a world of possibilities for you and your crass friends. Game Chat is also free until the 31st March 2026, so you've got almost a year to swear as much as you want and see it transcribed on your Nintendo Switch 2. Bet the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour"> Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> doesn't teach you about that, huh?</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that regardless of any profanity, the Game Chat feature is still a major boon for the console, due to its ability to allow those unable to use the microphone for any reason to type out messages on a virtual keyboard, or alternatively allow those who'd struggle with said keyboard to send messages without much trouble.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> kicked off its early release for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition players yesterday, hitting a peak player count of almost 100k worm lovers.</p>
<p>This early launch, which requires people to drop at least £58.50 / $69.99 / €69.99 to hop in, immediately found itself a sandy society of 79,410. The following hours would see the figure slowly climb to a peak of 93,634 before tapering off for the night.</p>
<p>Prior to the release the game surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers">Steam Top Sellers page</a>, falling short of just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a>. Earlier this year the game held its final invite-only beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">which eventually opened to those who pre-ordered</a>. That beta hit a peak of 37,889, so there's a real sign of growth in terms of early adopters.</p>

<p>The launch was not without its technical stumbles, the eternal curse of MMO launches. A selection of players suffered from crashes and freezing issues, with Funcom urging those affected to update Nvidia drivers, limit in-game CPU usage, and disable Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling.</p>
<p>Server capacity issues were also a thorn in the player's side initially. Due to the number of players flooding in, Sietches (the game's name for server instances) were filling up fast. In response, Funcom pumped up the number of players that could populate each Sietche so playing with friends was more feasible.</p>
<p>But compared to the launches of the past, it's not too drastic a technical disaster! Which is good for these kinds of games, first impressions are crucial and nothing turns people away like a massive login queue or progress blockers. </p>
<p>As for what this means for Dune Awakening? Well, the fact that this pre-order release has hit a far larger peak than the previous beta indicates a real growth in interest for the game, and that a substantial number of players dropped a solid chunk of cash on the game to get in ASAP.</p>
<p>In addition, it may just be a canary in the coal mine for an even greater spike in popularity come June 10, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">when those who nab the standard version of Dune Awakening gain access</a>. Given you've got streamers diving in, plenty of buzz on social media, and a strong start reverberating around the MMO space right now, I'd imagine the Funcom devs are absolutely beaming right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The team over at CD Projekt may be busy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">working on a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077</a>, but that doesn't mean it has finished with the first game. Last night, the developer announced that, yes, there is another update on the way for V and the rest of Night City.</p>
<p>The news was shared during a dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/t_SENc98vkI?t=3621s">Cyberpunk 2077 Switch 2 livestream</a>. Just around the time the developer was wrapping up its stream, the host drew attention to some of the questions viewers had been asking. Well, she drew attention to one particular question viewers had been asking: Is there going to be more DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>?</p>
<p>"I can tell you right now, we are planning another part for the game," senior community manager Alicja Kozera casually dropped. "The last one wasn't the last one."</p>

<p>This update will be known as 2.3, and will arrive later this month, on 26th June. Further details on what exactly will be included with this particular Cyberpunk 2077 update will be shared in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Sharing the news <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">again on social media</a>, CD Projekt's global community director Marcin Momot proclaimed: "We're not done yet!"</p>
<p>Momot again reiterated that the team would be "spilling the beans" closer to that 26th June release date, asking that fans wait patiently for more news and "let the team cook".</p>

<p>Rumours that Cyberpunk 2077 would be getting more content started making the rounds earlier this week, when a LinkedIn post from a developer at Virtuous was circulated online. This post said the developer was working on Cyberpunk 2077 DLC, something that hadn't been announced yet.</p>
<p>As for Cyberpunk 2077, it is now available on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>. Our pals at Digital Foundry have taken the game out for a spin on the Switch 2 already, asking the question: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Can the new Nintendo console handle it?</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
