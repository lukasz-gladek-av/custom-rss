            <p>Acclaim, the publisher behind hundreds of classic games from the 80s and 90s, is set to be revived.</p>
<p>The company closed back in 2004 as it filed for bankruptcy, but will now return to support indie developers and "reignite classic franchises" from its portfolio of IP.</p>
<p>Acclaim was known in the 90s for game adaptations of familiar franchises, from WWF (now WWE) and The Simpsons, to movie tie-ins like Alien 3, Judge Dredd and Batman Forever, to comic book games like Spider-Man and Wolverine.</p>

<p>It also published the likes of the controversial Mortal Kombat games and Theme Park. Then, in the late 90s, it was prolific for publishing N64 games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a>, Extreme-G, Shadow Man, and the South Park FPS.</p>
<p>As well as resurrecting its old franchises, the company will be offering funding, marketing, and PR support to indie studios.</p>
<p>The newly-revived publisher has an advisory board of industry leaders, including "licensing icons, professional athletes, living music legends and season veterans who have defined the intersection of video games and pop culture". That includes two-time Hall of Fame wrestler Jeff Jarrett.</p>
<p>"For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the '80s and '90s," said Jarrett.</p>
<p>"From my early involvement with the publisher's hit 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>Acclaim was originally founded in 1987, publishing a number of NES and Game Boy games. However, sales of its games declined in the early '00s which led to a number of studio closures across the UK. Eventually the company closed in August 2004, closing all of its facilities and terminating all employees at its Austin and New York studios.</p>
<p>Still, a number of game franchises first published by Acclaim have made a return in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-n64-racing-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-today">High-speed racer Extreme-G and puzzle game Iggy's Reckin' Balls</a> were added to Nintendo Switch Online's N64 catalogue last year, which were followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-mature-app-receives-two-additional-n64-games">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Shadow Man in the Mature app</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, as previously reported, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-shadowman-game-in-the-works-21-years-after-the-last">new Shadow Man game is in development</a> from Blowfish Studios along with comic publisher Valiant Entertainment, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-turok-game">Saber Interactive is working on a new Turok game</a> it revealed at last year's The Game Awards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Activision's social media post advertising a new entry in the Guitar Hero series is market research for a game that doesn't exist, and is not meant to be an actual announcement, Eurogamer understands.
</p>
<p>
The fake advert - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-accused-of-ai-slop-yet-again-this-time-for-new-guitar-hero">which has been dubbed "AI slop" for its use of poorly-generated imagery</a> - is one of several tests currently being run across the publisher's social media profiles. 
</p>
<p>
These adverts also include new smartphone games in other Activision franchises such as Call of Duty and Crash Bandicoot that also don't exist (yet) either. 
</p>
<p>
Clicking on some of the adverts will take you through to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GuitarHero/comments/1j0jbh3/instagram_ad_for_a_new_guitar_hero_mobile_game/">mocked up mobile store page</a> organised by marketing service Geeklab, and then onto a survey that reveals "this isn't a real game, but could be some day!"
</p>
<p>
Market research questions then include queries asking users what made them click on the advert and what gameplay features they expected the game to include, based on the fake advert.
</p>
<p>
Activision posts on Instagram and Facebook have similarly advertised "Call of Duty: Zombie Defender", "Call of Duty: Sniper" and "Crash Bandicoot: Brawl".
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Activision plans to develop two new Call of Duty titles for mobile platform:</p><p>ðŸ”¸ Call of Duty: Zombie Defender<br>ðŸ”¸ Call of Duty: Sniper</p><p>AI-generated advertisements are being used to gauge player interests. If there is enough interest, the project will go into development. Theseâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/PWA1KjLd4h">pic.twitter.com/PWA1KjLd4h</a></p></div>â€” Leakers On Duty (@LeakersOnDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/LeakersOnDuty/status/1896536223478403382?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Artwork for the latter game, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Activision/videos/569180362817791/">hosted on Facebook</a>, again shows obvious use of AI image generation. One squirrel-like character appears to be missing half a face.

<p>
Will any of these Guitar Hero, Crash Bandicoot or Call of Duty smartphone games ever see the light of day? That remains to be seen. If and when they do, however, here's hoping Activision hires some actual humans to work on their artwork.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision recently added a warning label to the Steam page for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> confirming the game "uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets", after players spotted various in-game examples - including a zombie Santa Claus with six fingers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Inzoi - the upcoming and rather realistic looking Sims-like - is set to launch in early access later this month, and ahead of that people want to know one very important thing: what's the sex situation?</p>
<p>Sex is, of course, a pretty common feature in Maxis and EA's The Sims series, where it is known as WooHoo. And Inzoi players want to have a deeper understanding of what will be the WooHoo equivalent in Krafton's own life-sim.</p>

<p>The Inzoi team recently hosted a Q&amp;A session <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1162040845181124621/1345026317103534131">via the game's Discord</a>, where it was asked: "In Inzoi will you be able to have interactions for the purpose of creating babies?" (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/theres-sort-of-sex-in-inzoi-its-developers-explain-as-terminally-horny-life-sim-players-ask-about-getting-freaky-and-watching-their-zois-shower/">PC Gamer</a>). So, essentially, let's talk about sex, baby, but without actually using that word.</p>
<p>Here's what assistant director Joel Lee had to say about sex in Izoi: "There is a feature in the game that you obviously know what's happening, the male Zoi and the female Zoi are together, likely in bed, with the intention of creating babies. How visually apparent is that? That's where you have to go to your imagination. </p>
<p>"What you're seeing is not what you're seeing; you have to assume that's what's happening. Is that clear enough for everyone? It's there. Sort of. Maybe not to the level that everyone would have been expecting."
</p>
<p>Reading this, I assume this means Inzoi won't feature the same over-the-top interactions such as shaking bushes, love hearts popping out of rocket ships and a bombastic firework finale like we see in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>. That is perhaps understandable, given Inzoi is going for a more realistic tone (even if the characters do wear towels in the shower).</p>
<p>I am still not sure exactly what sex in Inzoi will look like, though. Also, given the game will feature same-sex relationships, I presume sex won't only be limited to - in Lee's words - the intention of creating babies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">Izoi is set to release in early access on 28th March</a>, via Steam. Our Ian along with Outside Xbox's Jane went hands on with Inzoi last year. You can check out their thoughts on the game - including its toilet animations - below.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has trumpeted its latest legal success in the company's ongoing fight against pirated games as "significant" not only for itself, "but for the entire games industry".
</p>
<p>
The Mario maker today confirmed it had won a final victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage, which operates the website 1fichier.com, following years of legal wrangling and repeated appeals.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's victory means European file-sharing companies must now remove illegal copies of games when asked to do so, or be held accountable and cough up potentially sizable fines as punishment.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, the Judicial Court of Paris ordered Dstorage pay Nintendo â‚¬935k (Â£773k) in damages after it was found to be hosting pirate games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wins-case-against-french-filesharing-service-hosting-pirated-games">Dstorage launched an appeal, which then failed in 2023, and was ordered to pay Nintendo further costs</a>. But the case didn't end there. 
</p>
<p>
Dstorage finally took the matter to the highest French judiciary court, where it argued that a specific court order was required before it needed to remove content from its hosting services. This bid has also now failed, ending the long-running matter for good.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo is pleased with the court's finding of liability against Dstorage," reads a statement from the Mario maker shared with Eurogamer this morning. 
</p>
<p>
"Together with its recent decision of 15th January 2025, confirming that a major French Bank had rightfully terminated a payment processing agreement with 1fichier.com due to lacking anti-piracy measures, the French Supreme Court leaves no doubt that sharehosting providers like 1fichier.com are not a safe haven for storing and sharing illegal content.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo promotes and fosters development and creativity, and strongly supports developers who legitimately create new and innovative software. Nintendo's message to consumers is not to download pirate copies of Nintendo games as this increases the risk that this will interfere with the functionality and experience that playing legitimate Nintendo games on authentic Nintendo hardware provides."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's campaign against game piracy has regularly hit the headlines over the past year, perhaps most notably with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">the shutdown of Switch emulator Yuzu - whose creator agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4m</a> (Â£1.89m). 
</p>
<p>
Last summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-war-against-switch-piracy-ramps-up-with-two-fresh-cases">Nintendo tracked down the moderator behind the infamous SwitchPirates reddit</a> and claimed the individual ran "several pirate shops" that sold "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games". Nintendo is seeking damages in the millions of dollars.
</p>
<p>
In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">Nintendo filed a lawsuit against a streamer who regularly played pirated copies of Nintendo games ahead of release</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>. The streamer had previously boasted he "could do all this all day" as he had "1000 burner accounts".
