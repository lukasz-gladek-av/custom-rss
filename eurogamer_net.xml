Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Hades 2's appearance in last week's Switch 2 Direct showcase</a>, developer Supergiant Games has confirmed the roguelike sequel will launch for the platform - as well as the original Switch - as a timed console exclusive.
</p>
<p>
Supergiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-is-getting-a-sequel-the-princess-of-the-underworld-is-heading-our-way">announced a second Hades was in the works</a> at the tail-end of 2022, and it eventually entered PC early access in May last year. It's all change this time around too, with the original game's dashing protagonist Zagreus stepping aside so his sister - Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld - can take the spotlight as she embarks on a quest to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. With a little help from the Olympian Gods, of course.
</p>
<p>
Since entering PC early access, Supergiant has steadily expanded and refined <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, building on the formula that helped its predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is-hades-and-now-we-chat">earn the title of Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2020</a>. And, now, following last week's confirmation of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> release, the studio has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs">appeared in the latest instalment of Nintendo's new Creator's Voice series</a> to introduce the game to a new audience and confirm - via a quick on-screen message toward the end of the video - that Hades 2's 1.0 release will come to Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive.

<p>
That announcement appeared to cause a little bit of confusion, however, and Supergiant <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1909686305342328902">took to social media</a> shortly after to clear up a few details. "Hades 2 v1.0," it wrote, "will launch simultaneously on our Early Access platforms (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hades-ii">Epic Games Store</a>), Nintendo Switch 2, and the original Nintendo Switch." The only remaining question for now, then, is exactly when 1.0 will show up - but that's still TBA. All Supergiant has said so far is that early access will "continue during 2025", and that it doesn't have a specific end date "at this time".
</p>
<p>
The wait, though, should be worth it. Hades 2 was already looking special when it debuted last year, with Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">calling it a "game I already love" in his early access review</a>. So expect good for its eventual launch on Switch and Switch 2.
