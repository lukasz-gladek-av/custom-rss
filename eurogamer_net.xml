            <p>
We were big fans of developer Bugbear Entertainment's demolition derby racer Wreckfest when it launched back in 2018, so there was some excitement when a sequel was announced last year. And now, the studio has now confirmed similarly enthusiastic sorts can slam pedal to the metal from 20th March, when Wreckfest 2 launches into Steam early access.
</p>
<p>
Wreckfest 2 promises what Bugbear is calling the "next evolution of full-contact racing", and there's talk of an overhauled physics engine, more intricate component damage simulation, and "even higher crash fidelity" - all working together to conjure "absolute vehicular mayhem".
</p>
<p>
Course-wise, Bugbear is promising a blend of high-speed circuits, "crazy courses with obstacles and jumps", plus intersections and oncoming traffic. Initially these'll be available in Racing, Derby, and multiplayer modes - supporting up to 34 players - with more to come. Sometime into Wreckfrest 2's early access release, for instance, Bugbear is introducing a revamped career mode designed to adapt to individuals' playstyles, plus a skill-based matchmaking system and server queues for online players.

<p>
Vehicle customisation also has a major role, and players can spruce up their cars with new armour and component types suited to different driving approaches. New components will arrive as early access continues, with other future additions set to include tournaments, high-score challenges putting players in "unconventional vehicles", and mod support.
</p><p>
Bugbear says the goal of early access is to ensure Wreckfest 2 is "shaped by [player] feedback" from day one. And while there's no indication of how long early access will last as yet, the original Wreckfest notably remained in early access for four years. The results, however, were worth it, with Martin Robison calling it a game of "primal pleasures" and "little by way of pretension" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wreckfest-2-gothic-1-remake-gameplay-and-everything-else-from-thq-nordics-showcase">his Recommended review</a>.
</p>
<p>
So if you're eager to get behind the wheel as Wreckfest 2 heads toward the early access finish line, you can do so when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/">it comes to Steam</a> on 20th March.

UK game maker Sumo Digital has told staff it will refocus exclusively on "development services for partners", rather than continuing to create its own IP.
</p>
<p>
This decision will "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people," a <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2025/sumo-group-update/">statement</a> from the company noted today. 
</p>
<p>
"We are committed to minimising this impact as much as possible, exploring all options to retain talent, and supporting those affected with transparency, care and compassion," it added.

<p>
Headquarted in Sheffield, Sumo Digital has grown considerably since its founding in 2003, with development offices in Nottingham, Newcastle, Leamington Spa and Warrington, and also abroad in India. 
</p>
<p>
The company additionally owns several other studios, including the Brighton-based The Chinese Room, developer of Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a>.
</p>
<p>
In 2021, Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> announced it had bought parent company Sumo Group in a deal worth around Â£919m. 
</p>
<p>
Today's news seems set to mark the second round of layoffs at the company in under a year, after 15 percent of its staff were let go in June 2024, and Canadian indie studio Timbre Games was divested. 
</p>
<p>
Sumo Digital has long been a work-for-hire studio that has quietly helped develop some of video gaming's biggest blockbusters, with contributions to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s recent Hitman trilogy, Xbox's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> and 5, Activison's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-vanguard">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a> and Warner Bros' Hogwarts Legacy. 
</p>
<p>
It has also worked on a long list of games as lead developer, including Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing, and LittleBigPlanet 3 and Sackboy: A Big Adventure for PlayStation.
</p>
<p>
More recently, Sumo had begun working on its own IP, including puzzle platformer Snake Pass, and indie titles such as DeathSprint 66 and Critter Cafe that it released through its own publishing label, Secret Mode.
</p>
<p>
Sumo's statement says the company has now been forced to balance "creative ambitions and the commercial realities to ensure the long-term stability and success of our business". 
</p>
<p>
The company continued by saying it hoped the decision would strengthen its position as "a premium development partner" going forwards. 
</p>
<p>
"Whether collaborating on new or established games, co-developing games, providing specialist engineering, or porting services; we are confident in our teams' exceptional talent and our ability to thrive in this next chapter," the company concluded.
