            <p>You will very soon be able to register to take part in the network test for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s upcoming co-op spin-off, Nightreign.</p>
<p>Those who are keen to participate in the test can register from this afternoon at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>The test itself is scheduled for 14th to 17th February, and will run in three hour blocks. On the 14th (so, Valentine's Day, and really, what is more romantic than Elden Ring?), the session will run between 11am and 2pm UK time. On the 15th, there will be two sessions. The first will run from 3am until 6am, the second will run between 7pm and 10pm. The session on the 16th will run between 11am and 2pm once again, and the final session on 17th will run from 3am until 6am.</p>

<p>Nightreign's test will be available across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, although the developer notes the full game will also be available to those on PC via Steam, as well as Xbox One and PS4 consoles.</p>
<p>"The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch," reads the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test">information page for Nightreign's network test</a> (where I also presume a link for registration will also be made available). </p>
<p>"Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has shared a new Group Customer Harassment Policy to protect its workers from toxic fan behaviour.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/customer_harassment_policy.html">policy</a> states there are instances where "certain customers take actions... that constitute 'customer harassment'" of employees, be that through violence, defamation, intimidation or other means.</p>
<p>"Such actions do not only prevent our employees and partners from engaging in their work with a sense of security but also causes disruptions to other customers," the policy reads. "Square Enix will not tolerate harassment and will take action as necessary."</p>

<p>Alongside a definition of what it deems to be harassment, the company said it reserves the right to cease providing support services or products, and to protect employees through legal action or criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>The policy does not specify examples of this harassment, though it's clearly been put in place as the result of such behaviour.</p>
<p>In particular, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> fandom is notorious for divided opinions on Aerith and Tifa and their relationships with Cloud.</p>
<p>"I say this with love: FF7 shippers need to touch noses," said Aerith voice actor Briana White back in December. "We're all the same family in loving these characters so relax."</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">When my sibling &amp; I would fight as kids, my mom would tell us to touch noses until we inevitably started giggling and got over it. I say this with love: FF7 shippers need to touch noses. We're all the same family in loving these characters so relax ðŸ’•</p>â€” Briana White (@ItsBrianaWhite) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1869877671628607729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Last January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-shippers-ruin-great-story-development-with-overt-sexualisation-says-cloud-voice-artist">Cloud voice actor Cody Christian</a> said shippers "ruin great story development" with overt sexualisation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> producer and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has addressed abuse against the game's developers on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Back in January 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-naoki-yoshida-addresses-verbal-abuse-from-players">Yoshida addressed abuse aimed at developers</a>. "I mean, I can take it, even though it doesn't make it less bad, but staff members will feel really down after getting those words when they gave their absolute best into trying to create something where everyone can enjoy, and this may end up making them no longer create things that are fun from there on," he said.</p>
<p>Then last year, following the release of latest expansion Dawntrail, he commented on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/transphobic-abuse-sent-to-final-fantasy-14s-wuk-lamat-voice-actor-breaks-my-heart-says-naoki-yoshida">transphobic abuse sent to Wuk Lamat voice actor Sena Bryer</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid one of our staff members received very negative comments and it almost felt like a personal attack, which breaks my heart, because she worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all," said Yoshida. "It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p>
<p>While Square Enix should be commended for protecting its staff, it's sad that fan behaviour makes such a policy necessary.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There has been a flurry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>-related news in recent days, but not from Nintendo itself. Now, the Mario maker has broken its silence on the week's reports.</p>
<p>During this week's CES trades show in Las Vegas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">reportedly-accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps Switch 2 were shown off</a> by accessories manufacturer Genki. Several images and videos of this model were subsequently shared across social media (as you can see below). It is worth noting that Genki has since said <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html">its model was created based only on leaked information from the industry</a>, and it has not actually seen a Switch 2 console. </p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a statement to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, telling the world that those images and videos making the rounds are "not official".</p>

</figure>
<p>Here's the very to the point, translated statement from the article: "The images and videos, they are not official."</p>
<p>While this statement is fairly innocuous in a lot of ways, and not exactly surprising given we already knew it was not Nintendo itself showcasing the hardware, this marks the first acknowledgement by the company that these leaks are even happening at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has not actually said anything about the accuracy of the third-party Switch 2 model which has been shown.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>In addition to that mock Switch 2 model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">yesterday we had some further console leaks</a>. Purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards started showing up. Meanwhile, another report suggested Nintendo's upcoming console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock. There were also some new murmurings over the Switch 2's optical sensor.</p><p>Nintendo will be sharing something official on its Switch successor soon enough, though. It previously confirmed we would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">receive a proper announcement before the close of the fiscal year</a>, which ends 31st March. What we do know for sure is that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bald headed assassin simulator Hitman: World of Assassination has amassed an impressive body count of 75 million players.
</p>
<p>
World of Assassination was originally launched in 2021 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S under the name of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, and was then retitled two years later when content from the trilogy's other games was added in. 
</p>
<p>
Today, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is celebrating the game's continued success. A million players logged on in December alone, the studio said, lured in by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-next-elusive-target-is-jean-claude-the-splitter-van-damme">fresh mission starring 90s action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>.

<p>
Many of those players will likely be people sampling the game via its Free Starter Pack option, which also currently lets you take down Van Damme as one of the game's limited-time Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
Amusingly, IO says that only 40 percent of players who attempted to take down Van Damme have been successful at doing so. (The developer tracked the longest successful attempt at seven hours, with the shortest just 21 seconds.)
</p>
<p>
Van Damme disappears from the game as an Elusive Target at the end of this weekend, on Sunday 12th January, but you can buy permanent access to a mission featuring the star in a Â£4 DLC mission pack.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, IO says it is working on more content for Hitman to release later this year - though there's no details yet on what. 
</p>
<p>
IO is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">its under-wraps James Bond 007 game</a> and a mysterious fantasy game project. Additionally, the company is now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">handling publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the AAA game from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies.

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> film adaptation, set to star Star Wars actor Donnie Yen, has been canned.</p>
<p>That's according to Yen himself, who confirmed the cancellation to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/action/506279/sleeping-dogs-movie-donnie-yen-release-update">Polygon</a>.</p>
<p>"I spent a lot of time and did a lot of work with these producers, and I even invested some of my own money into obtaining the drafts and some of the rights," he said. "I waited for years. Years. And I really want to do it. I have all these visions in my head, and unfortunately... I don't know, you know how Hollywood goes, right? I spent many, many years on it. It was an unfortunate thing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-donnie-yen-says-sleeping-dogs-movie-in-production">Yen confirmed the film was in development in February 2018</a>, but little has been heard since and no release date was given, so it's not particularly surprising to discover its cancellation.</p>
<p>Sleeping Dogs was a 2012-released open world game published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, which was something of a GTA-style game set in Hong Kong but with martial arts combat and parkour.</p>
<p>Though received well by critics, it criminally remains a cult classic.</p>
<p>Still, a film starring and directed by Hong Kong filmmaker Yen would've been a natural fit. And the live-action reveal trailer above certainly hints at what we're missing.</p>
<p>Plenty of other film adaptations have been revealed recently. Sony confirmed earlier this week both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers will be adapted to film</a>.</p>

            <p>
As expectation grows of a new Half-Life game announcement, fans believe they can now see evidence of the project on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Firstly, let's address the obvious. Yes, the decades-long wait for Half-Life 3 has become something of a meme and all suggestion of its existence is to be treated with caution. That said, there's strong evidence that Valve is once again working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailing datamined assets and code snippets</a> backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved.
</p>
<p>
All signs point to something being afoot, and now Steam seems to show Valve has a second unreleased game lurking behind the scenes (as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Deadlock</a>, which is still listed as an 'upcoming release' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-croaks-down-on-deadlock-cheaters-by-letting-you-turn-them-into-frogs">despite being in beta</a>). 
</p>
<p>
A thread on the Valve <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1hw5kx6/i_could_be_onto_nothing_here_but_is_this_new">reddit</a> has highlighted the recent change that now lists two games from the developer as 'upcoming', with some sleuthing work by fans using the Wayback Machine pointing to this change occuring sometime within December 2024.
</p>
<p>
Searching for Valve on Steam and filtering via upcoming releases and then specifically games does indeed list two projects - with only Deadlock visible.

<p>
It's unlikely this project is In the Valley of the Gods - the next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> developer Campo Santo that was put on indefinite hold. For starters, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/687440/In_The_Valley_of_Gods/">Steam page</a> is publicly visible, and its developer and publisher are both listed as Campo Santo still rather than Valve.
</p>
<p>
A warning on the search page suggests that search results may exclude some products based on content or language preferences, but even with all filters disabled, Valve's second upcoming project does not appear. So, what gives?
</p>
<p>
This year will mark the fifth anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>, Valve's most recent entry in its legendary shooter series that was designed specifically for VR. But Half-Life has certainly been on Valve's mind more recently than that. 
</p>
<p>In November, Valve made a big deal out of celebrating <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>'s 20th anniversary, with a big update that added a director's commentary, a documentary, and packed in the game's two episodes of DLC. We even learned a bit more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">why Valve never made Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a>, as well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's probably not a huge surprise to hear at this point, but Sony has confirmed The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will - like numerous other single-player PlayStation games before it - require a PSN account in order to play when it launches for PC this April.
</p>
<p>
Sony, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">faced a major backlash last May</a> when it announced it would be making PSN accounts mandatory for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> on PC - a move that meant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">players in the 177 countries where PSN is unavailable</a> would no longer be able to play the game they'd purchase. Ultimately, the outcry was significant enough that Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">relented</a>, but that hasn't stopped it from implementing PSN requirements for an increasing number of PC ports since then.
</p>
<p>
It's a decision that's continued to draw criticism given the requirement - which was originally justified as being necessary for the "safety and security" of online play - is now being implemented across both multiplayer and single-player games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, for instance, <em>does</em> have a multiplayer component, despite being a predominantly single-player title, while other PC releases requiring PSN - such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War RagnarÃ¶k</a>, and Until Dawn - are purely single-player experiences.

<p>
And now The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered (as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-on-pc-will-require-a-psn-account/">spotted by VGC</a>) has joined the steadily expanding list of predominantly single-player PlayStation titles - online leaderboards <em>are</em> supported in its roguelike No Return mode - requiring a PSN log-in on PC.
</p><p>
For most, that requirement is probably little more than a somewhat irritating inconvenience. But for others - namely, those based in one of the aforementioned 117 regions where PSN is unavailable - it means The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered simply won't be purchasable on PC. And given Sony previously confirmed this month's PC port of the single-player <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> also requires a PSN account, it appears this is a path it's now determine to follow.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">Epic Games Store</a> on 3rd April, the same month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-teases-two-of-the-games-most-impactful-scenes">season two of HBO's acclaimed The Last of Us television series begins airing</a>. Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">called the remaster</a> - which includes the likes of increased texture resolution, increased level-of-detail distances, and improved shadow quality - the "best way to play a genuine classic" when it arrived on PlayStation 5 last year.
