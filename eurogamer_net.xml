WiFi Wars, a live comedy game show spin-off from telly programme Go 8 Bit, is soon coming to a venue that's probably quite near you. 
</p>
<p>
Hosted by Go 8 Bit's Steve McNeil, the interactive show uses clever tech to let the audience play along via mini-games, challenges and quizzes streamed to their smartphones.
</p>
<p>
The format was previously part of the Royal Institution's Summer Programme and the BBC Christmas Lectures, and has also popped up at the equally-eclectic venues of the Edinburgh Fringe and EGX. Intrigued? There's a video with more of what it's all about just below.

<p>
If you fancy popping along, there's a two-week run coming up in London over Easter, sandwiched between dates in March, April and June elsewhere in the UK. The tour is set to visit Bolton, Bristol, Norwich, Wrexham, Mchynlleth, Aylesbury, Cambridge and more. Also, both Southampton and Northampton.
</p>
<p>
The full list of dates are over on the <a href="https://www.wifiwars.co.uk/dates/">WiFi Wars website</a>, and tickets go for around Â£16 depending on location - in the country, and within the venue of your seat.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daves-video-game-tv-show-dara-o-briains-go-8-bit-canned-after-three-series">Go 8 Bit finished up a three-season run on comedy channel Dave back in 2018</a>. Hosted by Dara O Briain, it featured a selection of celebs battling through rounds of video game-based challenges to various levels of success. Famous faces on the show included Jonathan Ross, Sonia from Eastenders, and the wonderful Ellie Gibson - formerly of this website, and now a successful standup comedian and podcaster.
