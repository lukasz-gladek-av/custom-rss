            <p>Get ready to go on the hunt - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> Season 15, Wild Things, is almost here.</p>
<p>Setting out across the sea is about to get even more dangerous as two new ancient Megalodon have arrived, with pirates able to encounter the Feared Redmaw, a huge fanged beast that can release a "devastating" explosion.</p>

<p>Season 15 also lets you sail as the Hunter's Call emissary, flying their flag and building your reputation at an increased rate, as well as embark on Raid Voyages. Complete these, and you'll "net a fine haul of Hunter's Call specific loot, helping you even more reputation".</p>
<p>"As ancient creatures stir in the deep, The Hunter's Call summons scoundrels hungry to test their skills!" the team teases.</p>
<p>"Ahead of its first update on Feb 20th, this Content Update covers all the monsters, Voyages, wildlife and more that's emerging monthly throughout Season 15: Wild Things!"</p>
<p>Sea of Thieves Season 15: Wild Things goes live on 20th February on PC, PS5, and Xbox, including Game Pass.</p>
<p>Don't forget that from now until 20th February, <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/news/this-month-february2025">you can face off with Ghost Fleets and Phantoms in and around Sea Forts</a>. Be cautious, though - these spectral threats won't make things easy for your crew, but for those willing to take on the challenge, "there's plenty to gain: fight your way through waves of ghostly adversaries and you can claim two Vaults filled with valuable loot!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Characters from Mortal Kombat will finally be able to square up against Street Fighter legends such as Ryu, Chun-Li and Guile - within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' ever-popular battle royale will be the first video game to officially feature characters from both fighting game franchises, when Mortal Kombat crosses over with Fortnite next season. 
</p>
<p>
The announcement that Mortal Kombat would feature in Fortnite came via artwork teasing the game's next battle pass character line-up - in which ice ninja Sub-Zero will star.

<p>
Street Fighter characters have already been part of Fortnite for several years, of course - with Ryu and Chun-Li added as Shop skins back in February 2021, before their fellow fighters Cammy, Guile, Blanka and Sakura all arrived a short time after.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite even paid tribute to Mortal Kombat during this weekend's eye-catching mini live event, which featured a fight to the death between antihero Daigo and demon boss Hunter X. 
</p>
<p>
The showdown, a culmination of Fortnite Chapter 6's story so far, included a moment where Daigo appeared to have been skewered by Hunter X's sword - though there was no Fatality here. Instead, the masked fighter fought back, ultimately appearing to defeat Hunter X for good after slicing off his arm. You can watch the full event below:

<p>Fortnite being Fortnite, of course, there is no blood - or any realistic-looking violence at all. So, it will be interesting to see the extent to which Mortal Kombat's famously gory antics get translated here.</p>
<p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 is set to arrive later this week, on 21st February, and feature a criminals theme. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-new-crime-season-will-let-you-play-as-a-giant-pickle">Other new character skins are set to include a giant pickle</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sweden-based developer Liquid Swords has today announced an unspecified number of layoffs.</p>
<p>The NetEase-backed studio was formed in 2020 by Christofer Sundberg, whose name you may recognise from Just Cause's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a>, which he co-founded.</p>
<p>Liquid Swords is yet to launch its first game, and today announced plans to "reduce its workforce as part of an effort to scale back operations and adapt to current business conditions".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.liquidswords.com/news/liquid-swords-announces-proposed-workforce-reduction-amid-business-challenges">message on the company's website</a>, Liquid Swords cited "the present challenges of the video game industry" as a reason for the layoffs. It said this move is "intended to ensure the studioâ€™s long-term sustainability" as it continues to work on its debut game.</p>
<p>"I promised our employees and shareholders success and to build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable work model. While we achieved much of this, shifting market conditions prevented us from succeeding within our timeframe," Sundberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>"As a result, we must part ways with talented individuals who have been instrumental in our journey. This is incredibly difficult, but we remain committed to our vision and will continue to work on our IP and first game with a dedicated team."</p>
<p>Despite changes within its team, Liquid Swords believes these layoffs "will not prevent" the studio from "realising its original ambition".</p>

<figcaption>Liquid Swords celebrated its fourth birthday in December. "From the outside, it might not look like we've done a lot, but for us inside, it's already been a busy four years," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDHEMNqNoJ3/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">the team wrote at the time</a>. <span>Image credit: <cite>Liquid Swords</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>Liquid Swords is not the only NetEase-backed studio to have been impacted recently. In November, Mac Walters - the veteran writer and producer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for almost two decades - announced a "pause" in operations at his NetEase-backed AAA game studio, Worlds Untold. Its team had been developing a near-future action adventure game set "in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration", backed by investment cash from the Chinese game giant.</p>
<p>Then, last month, Jar of Sparks - the Seattle-based "AAA" studio established by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook back in 2022 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">halted work its currently-unannounced first title as it searched for a new publishing partner</a>, stating it's looking to "find all of our team new homes" as a result.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-design-jerry-hook-leading-new-netease-studio-jar-of-sparks">Jar of Sparks was initially unveiled in July 2022</a>, it was described as a first-party developer for Chinese publisher NetEase that would focus on creating the "next generation of narrative-driven action games".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
