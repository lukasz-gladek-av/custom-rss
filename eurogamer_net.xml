            <p>Nintendo has partnered with Samsung to increase production of its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> chips.</p>
<p>The partnership could mean Nintendo has enough stock to sell 20m consoles by March 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/nintendo-turns-to-samsung-to-make-chips-ramp-up-switch-2-output">Bloomberg</a> has reported.</p>
<p>That's higher than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo forecast in its latest financial report</a> - it expects to sell 15m consoles in the first year.</p>

<p>Samsung is aiming to compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in producing chips across the world, and this partnership with Nintendo will certainly boost business.</p>
<p>Still, with increased chip supply, production will depend on the capacity of hardware assemblers such as Foxconn Technology Group.</p>
<p>Further, Samsung is reportedly pushing for OLED panels in a potential Switch 2 hardware refresh. The Korean firm already supplies flash memory and OLED screens for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Despite following its original Switch with an OLED model, Nintendo has opted for LCD for its bigger Switch 2 screen. While some have criticised the decision, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-experience">quality of the LCD screen is excellent</a> - and leaves the door open for new hardware in future.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A following its latest financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">Nintendo was criticised by investors for its conservative forecast</a> of 15m units. The console is expected to be incredibly popular - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Japan alone demand for the console "far exceeds expectations"</a>, the company said.</p>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated the company's sales forecast was not influenced by production capacity or US tariffs. However, he admitted that should US tariffs change, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-considering-switch-2-post-launch-price-rise-if-tariff-situation-worsens">company will consider price adjustments accordingly</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Craig Mazin, the showrunner behind HBO's acclaimed live-action TV adaptation of The Last of Us, has confirmed the team is working to a four season plan, insisting there's "no way" the narrative can be wrapped up in three seasons.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time the magic number four has been floated in regard to The Last of Us' TV adaptation, of course. Mazin started the chatter all the way back in 2023, suggesting the show could "end up being three or five [seasons]. But four seems like a good number. Some seasons, because of the story we're telling, will need fewer episodes and some will need more."
</p>
<p>
Then earlier this year, HBO exec Francesca Orsi mirrored those comments, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbo-expects-the-last-of-us-to-run-for-four-seasons">it was "looking like four seasons" for the adaption</a>, but stressed HBO didn't have "a complete or final plan". Instead, she appeared to defer to Mazin, adding, "I wouldn't want to confirm that, but it's looking like this season and then two more seasons after this and we're done."
</p>
<p>
And now Mazin has seemingly <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/">made that official in an interview with Collider</a>. Discussing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joel-dominates-headlines-but-its-tommy-who-shines-in-the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-two">big Joel moment that kicked off season two</a>, Mazin explained, "It's so impactful. It's such a narrative nuclear bomb that it's hard to wander away from it. We can't really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story. I'm not sure that will necessarily be true for Season 3. I think we'll have a little more room there."
</p>
<p>
"There's a decent chance that Season 3 will be longer than Season 2," he elaborated, "just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different... but certainly, there's no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we'll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That's the most likely outcome."
</p>
<p>
As for season two, there's just one episode to go following this week's sixth instalment. Opinions on the second season have been a little more mixed compared to the widely acclaimed original, with Eurogamer's The Last of Us superfan Victoria Kennedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-six-recaptures-some-much-needed-levity-but-with-only-one-episode-left-have-the-showrunners-bitten-off-more-than-they-can-chew">recently pondering if Mazin and team might have bitten off more than they can chew</a>.
