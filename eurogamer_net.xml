<p>It's a pretty strong line up. Pixelated farming sim Stardew Valley first debuted almost a decade ago, and has since gone from strength to strength. In January of this year, the game's creator Eric Barone revealed that, as of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a>, meanwhile, comes from the always creative minds at Double Fine, and was met with overwhelming praise on its release. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psychonauts-2-review">witty, eccentric and imaginative</a>" in Eurogamer's own review, noting it had a "more developed understanding of mental health" than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have Viewfinder, which is a puzzle game that asks players to "challenge perception, redefine reality, and reshape the world" all with an instant camera. Chris Donlan called it all "magical" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/viewfinders-built-around-a-single-moment-and-its-great">Eurogamer's Viewfinder feature</a>.</p>
