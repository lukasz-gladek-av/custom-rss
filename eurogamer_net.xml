            <p>Videos showing off New Vegas sets created for the second season of Fallout have started making the rounds online.</p>

<p>At the end of the first season, we all saw disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour, fleeing towards the post-apocalyptic locale.</p>
<p>Soon after this episode aired, showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">confirmed the next season will head to New Vegas</a>, and said its now-ruined state was designed to show the audience that "things have happened" to the location since the events of New Vegas the game. The duo then added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunners-confirm-new-vegas-character-involved-with-season-two">New Vegas' enigmatic leader Mr House will be "involved in season two"</a>, although they held back from telling us any more. Oh, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-fallout-set-photo-teases-a-familiar-new-vegas-face-of-jurassic-proportions">Dinky will be around for season two, as well</a>.</p>
<p>Now, we have a pretty decent look at the Fallout show's take on New Vegas, thanks to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@onzo1313/video/7479259030754495787">TikTok user Onzo1313</a>. Onzo1313 has shared several videos showing off the set, including the iconic strip along with - of course - a Lucky 38 casino sign. Lucky 38 is Mr House's citadel from which he reigns over the New Vegas Strip and its various casinos.</p>
<p>One particular video showing off the strip is shaky, but the location itself seems to be in relatively good condition, leading to some speculation this area will feature as part of a flashback sequence.</p>

</span></p><p>Another video, meanwhile, offers a look at New Vegas boards that are showing signs of age and rust, clearly from the 'present'.</p>
<p>There is also a sign for Micheal Angelo's shown off in this video. Michael Angelo's workshop is a location in New Vegas, which is found on the strip.</p>

</span></p><p>Earlier this year, Fallout's Ghoul Walton Goggins provided us all with a little update on the upcoming season, promising that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">while season one was certainly good, the next one is going to be even better</a>.</p>
<p>"This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story," the actor said in February. "It's really gonna be something. I can't wait for people to see it."</p>
<p>New cast members reported to be joining Goggins for Fallout season two include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-reportedly-adds-marvel-actor-kumail-nanjiani-to-its-cast">Kumail Nanjiani as "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel"</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Macaulay Culkin as "a crazy genius-type character"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Konami is hosting a dedicated Silent Hill showcase later this week.</p>
<p>Silent Hill Transmission, as it is known, will take place in two days time, on 13th March at 10pm UK time.</p>
<p>"This Transmission will uncover <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>," Konami wrote on social media. "Excited to finally be able to share what we've been cooking," added the game's director <a href="https://x.com/QQBert/status/1899287454160716275">Al Yang</a>. </p>

<p>Silent Hill f, you may recall, will be the first new mainline game for the series in over a decade. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">It was initially announced back in 2022</a>, with a haunting trailer which will trigger anyone who lives with trypophobia (that's the aversion to the sight of repetitive patterns or clusters of small holes or bumps).</p>
<p>This trailer showed a young girl in what appeared to be rural Japan. As the trailer progressed, she gradually became overcome by flowers, before her face peeled away (shivers and debates delaying breakfast for a little while yet).</p>
<p>As per that initial reveal, Silent Hill f's story will be by Ryukishi07 (who created the When They Cry visual novel series), while its characters and creatures are designed by Kera. The game's producer is Motoi Okamoto, whose name you may recognise from Nintendo. Neobards, meanwhile, is handling the development side of things.</p>

<p>Last year, Konami along with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober released the acclaimed Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">passed a million sales in under a week</a>.</p>
<p>In October, Bloober went on to announce<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-developer-bloober-reveals-next-game-original-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn"> its next game will be an original sci-fi survival horror called Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> head Neil Druckmann has shared more details of the studio's all-new next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was announced at the end of last year</a>, with a trailer which featured a retro futuristic energy and introduced us to Tati Gabrielle's bounty hunter, Jordan A Mun. Other than that, details remained relatively slim on what this game would really be about.</p>
<p>Now, however, Druckmann has shed more light on the studio's sci-fi title, and joked it was a game about religion that will surely get less hate than the divisive The Last of Us Part 2 did on its debut.</p>

<p>"With The Last of Us 2, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckman said during a chat with 28 Days Later writer Alex Garland, to which Garland replied: "Who gives a shit."</p>
<p>"Exactly. But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about. Let's make a game about faith and religion," Druckmann quipped.</p>
<p>The Naughty Dog head revealed he has been working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for four years now, and confirmed the upcoming release won't be set on Earth. "It takes place 2000 years in an alternate future that deviates in the late 80s," he shared.</p>
<p>"So there is not only in this alternate history timeline, we've made this -  where the where the timeline deviates - this new religion becomes pretty prominent and then we spend years just building out this religion like from the original prophet all the way [to] how it gets like changed and sometimes bastardised and evolves over all these years."</p>

<p>Druckmann stated "this whole religion takes place on this one planet", which in December was revealed to be called Sempiria. "And then at one point all communication stops from this planet and you're playing a bounty hunter that's chasing her bounty and she crash lands on this planet," he continued, noting that while he "wanted to make a game about faith and religion" he also wanted to tackle themes of isolation and loneliness.</p>
<p>"So many of the previous games we've done there's always like an ally with you," he said. "I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, [about] who are the people here, what was their history and in order to get off this planet like - again no one has been heard from this planet for 600 years - so if you ever have hoped to have a chance to get off you have to figure out what happened here."</p>

<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is in development for PS5. Last year, Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, including "multiple single-player projects", this being one of them.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Naughty Dog news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">don't hold your breath for The Last of Us Part 3</a>, as last week Druckman told fans: "Don't bet on there being more".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
