            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has had the biggest physical launch of any PS5 game released in Japan so far.</p>
<p>According to the latest sales figures from Japanese magazine <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/35700">Famitsu</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds sold 601,179 physical copies in its first week - so not including digital and PC sales.</p>
<p>While this is higher than other physical sales of PS5 games in Japan, it's lower than previous Monster Hunter games. However, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Monster Hunter Wilds sold 8m copies in its first three days</a> to become Capcom's fastest-selling game ever, these sales numbers suggest a big shift towards digital sales.</p>

<p>What's more, the PS5 hardware itself sold 108,978 units across the base console, digital-only console, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> causing a significant boost in sales.</p>
<p>For comparison, on its Switch release in Japan Monster Hunter Rise sold over 1.30m physical units at launch, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> sold over 1.35m physical units on PS4 in its first three days of release in Japan (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/04/famitsu-sales-3-22-21-3-28-21">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2025/01/30/the-top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2024/">last year's best-selling PS5 game</a> was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> with 358,353 lifetime sales, while <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2024/02/01/the-top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2023/">in 2023</a> it was Final Fantasy 16 with 429,330 and <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2023/02/02/top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2022/">in 2022</a> it was Gran Turismo 7 with 218,013.</p>
<p>As such, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold considerably more in just its first week, with these numbers once again proving the game's rapid success.</p>
<p>At 8m copies sold worldwide, Monster Hunter Wilds has already bested the lifetime sales of Street Fighter 5, Street Fighter 2, and the original Resident Evil 2, as per <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab1">Capcom's Platinum Titles list</a>. In fact it's not far behind lifetime sales of Monster Hunter Rise DLC Sunbreak, which had sold 9.4m units by December last year.</p>
<p>What's more, the game's release in Japan has caused a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-means-japans-ps5-rental-service-is-fully-booked">surge in both PS5 rentals</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">sales of cheese naans</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nexon is ending support for its third-person looter shooter The First Descendant on PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The free-to-play sci-fi-flavoured release came out last year across Xbox, PlayStation and PC. It got off to a decent enough start, and in the first week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-free-to-play-sci-fi-shooter-the-first-descendant-clocks-up-10m-players-in-just-one-week">welcomed 10 million players into the fray</a>. Things have petered off since then, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/">SteamDB</a> data showing an average of 8,227 concurrent players on Valve's platform in February. Its peak concurrent player average was 123,352 in July last year, but this dropped to an average of 54,662 concurrents by August.</p>

<p>Nexon is going to keep supporting The First Descendant, however it has now announced it will be ending support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players from 19th June, which is just shy of its first anniversary. The game will also be delisted from the platforms (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>According to Nexon, it has decided to stop supporting the last generation of consoles in a bid to keep "increasing player satisfaction". The developer said it had "increased the scale" of The First Descendant, and this meant the team was facing difficulties "maintaining the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One builds".</p>
<p>Those who are playing The First Descendant on either a PS4 or Xbox One will still be able to transfer their progress to other platforms via The First Descendant's cross-save functionality.</p>

</span></p><p>On its release last year, Nexon found itself having to respond to claims the iconography of The First Descendant was strikingly similar to icons found in another sci-fi release, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-sci-fi-shooter-the-final-descendants-icons-are-strikingly-similar-to-those-used-in-destiny-2">players identified a surprising number of similarities</a> between the icons and weapons used in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-descendant-developer-responds-to-claims-its-icons-are-too-similar-to-those-in-destiny-2">designs in questions were subsequently removed from the game</a> "with deep affection and respect" for other "looter shooters".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
