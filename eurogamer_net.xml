            <p>Netflix has today confirmed that the fifth and final season of The Witcher will air on the streaming service this year. It follows Season 4 in rapid succession - that series having launched at the end of October last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/new-shows-on-netflix-2026">Netflix listed The Witcher as a 2026 release</a> in the "coming soon" section of a list on its website. A synopsis for the series reads:</p>
<blockquote>"The time of the end is nigh: dark forces are aligning all across the Continent with villainous designs on Ciri. Even if Geralt and Yennefer can save their daughter and fulfill their last wish of reuniting as a family, they’ll have to face obstacles — and enemies — the likes of which they've never faced before."</blockquote>
<p>Season 5 was expected to follow Season 4 quickly, with the two being filmed back to back. Showrunner Lauren Hissrich said the Witcher team treated the two series as "one large story". <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-witcher-season-5-season-4-one-story-schmidt-hissrich-batey-response/">Jaskier actor Joey Batey added, speaking to ScreenRant</a>, "It sort of feels like Season 4, Part 1 and 2. I think that's how I read it."</p><p>Viewing figures for The Witcher Netflix series have fallen sharply since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-tracking-to-be-our-biggest-season-one-tv-series-ever-says-netflix">The Witcher's remarkably strong start in 2019</a>. Even with Henry Cavill, the series was in decline season on season, and the fourth series, which saw Liam Hemsworth replace Cavill, dropped even further. Season 4 had 7.4m views across its first four days of availability, Season 3 had 15.2m, and Season 2 had 18.5m. Season 1 saw 76m households tune in for at least two minutes, Netflix said at the time.</p>
<p>I watched a few episodes of Season 4 but bounced off it after that. Did anyone make it all the way through?</p>
