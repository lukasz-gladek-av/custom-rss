            <p>It's been a while since we last had news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> (beyond talk of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">more crunch</a>), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s newest IP, but boss Neil Druckmann has been able to openly talk about other things, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-three-to-recast-manny">HBO's ongoing The Last of Us show</a>. Next month, however, he'll be found in the open again as he presents former partner Evan Wells with DICE's esteemed Hall of Fame Award.</p>
<p>We've learned the PlayStation veterans <a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/evan_wells_hof_29th_dice_awards.asp">will be meeting again</a> at the Aria Resort in Las Vegas on 12th February, 2026. Those who have been following the renowned studio for decades might remember Wells as one of the key creatives behind the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter series. This led to him becoming co-president of Naughty Dog in 2004. As the studio transitioned into more cinematic and blockbuster-y titles in its post-Uncharted era, he stuck around overseeing the creation and development of that series and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>. In 2023, he announced his retirement.</p>
<p>Ahead of the DICE 2026 summit, Druckmann took some time to praise Wells' leadership and celebrate what he did to make Naughty Dog one of the industry's most respected companies over many years:</p>
<blockquote>"Naughty Dog was able to create some truly incredible games and leave a lasting mark on the industry because of Evan’s unwavering leadership and the trust he placed in all of us... I know I speak for many across the industry when I congratulate Evan on this well-deserved recognition. It’s a profound honor to present him with this Hall of Fame induction."</blockquote>
<p>In the past, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences' Lifetime Achievement award has gone to names like PlayStation's Ken Kutaragi (2007), Nintendo legend Satoru Iwata (2015), and Xbox honcho <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> (2022), among many others.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, The Last of Us co-director and ex-Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/generative-ai-is-a-snake-eating-its-own-tail-says-the-last-of-us-co-director-but-the-term-ai-is-easily-misinterpreted">Bruce Straley is working on the debut game of his new studio Wildflower Interactive</a>: Coven of the Chicken Foot. He's also gone on to explain he left the PlayStation-owned studio after feeling he was "answering the same questions over and over again," which sounds like a nice way to say maybe there's life beyond cinematic action-adventure games. Intergalactic doesn't appear to be substantially altering Naughty Dog's current direction though.</p>

            <p>New games performed really well on Steam last year - notably better than the year before.</p>
<p><a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/who-won-steams-best-of-2025-revenue">Data analysed by GamesDiscoverCo</a> shows that there were more new games (classified as being released this year or the previous year) in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025?tab=2">Steam's Top 100 highest-grossing games chart</a> than last year - 31 to 24, respectively - and that games released in 2025 made collectively significantly more money than games released in other years.</p>
<p>Steam categorises games into Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze tier in terms of the money made. The Platinum tier does feature Steam's perennial juggernauts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, but the eight other Platinum games are all newly released this year.</p>
<p>They are: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Arc Raiders, Marvel Rivals, Battlefield 6, and, surprisingly, drug-pushing game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuUX7qWQvG8">Schedule 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-hit-repo-hides-real-class-and-an-understanding-of-gaming-greats-behind-its-chummy-chaos-and-crude-emojis">co-op horror game REPO</a>. Call of Duty is considered new there courtesy of technical change to using a Call of Duty app.</p>

<p>In the Gold tier, there's Borderlands 4, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Split Fiction, Elden Ring Nightrein, The Elder Scrolls Oblivion remaster, and EA Sports FC 26. In the Silver tier there's Dune: Awakening, Silksong, Civ 7, Inzoi, Delta Force, Dispatch, Assassin's Creed Shadows, Stellar Blade, Peak and Where Winds Meet.</p><p>It's an encouraging result in a market that seems to be dominated by perennial juggernauts. Just yesterday we saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-top-five-most-played-games-of-2025-are-exactly-the-same-as-2024s">PlayStation data highlight that the most played games in 2025 were exactly the same as in 2024</a> - Fortnite, Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto 5, Roblox, and Minecraft. And yes, 'most played' isn't the same as 'highest grossing', but the data paints a picture of apparent stagnation all the same - a market dominated by the endless tails of massive live service games.</p>
<p>In reference to the Steam data, GameDiscoverCo's Simon Carless said: "It's more front-loaded for recency than we expected. Why would this be? It's possible that 2025 was just a super-strong year for new games." It's also possible that perennial sellers had heavy discounts so weren't able to take as much money as full-priced games. "It's probably.. a combo of these things?" he reasoned.</p>

<p>Other tidbits from GameDiscoverCo's analysis show Warframe and Dead by Daylight - both games that are more than 10 years old now - staying strong as Gold-tier revenue-makers for the past four years. Elsewhere, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to show remarkable staying power as a Gold-tier game (the previous two years it was Platinum), as does Cyberpunk 2077, which is still Gold-tier five years after release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">CD Projekt Red announced recently that Cyberpunk 2077 had sold 35 million copies</a>.</p>
<p>Which new games will feature this time next year, I wonder...</p>

            <p>More than five years after its troubled original release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> continues to be one of the most relevant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">open-world RPGs</a> of the modern era. Much of its success comes from the believable relationships it quickly establishes between its key characters and V, but the pre-disaster prologue with preem choom Jackie was never meant to go on for too long.</p>
<p>"It's like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff," said Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27">on his BlueSky account</a> on 5th January, after a few too many comments from the community on how a longer Act 1 alongside doomed partner-in-crime Jackie Welles would've made the game better.</p>
<p>Considering how long <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-walkthrough-main-story-quest-list-main-missions-order-5077">the prologue</a> already felt - though it's topped by other recent sandbox games' early hours for sure - we’re inclined to agree with Sarzynski here, though we also understand where some players are coming from. Cyberpunk 2077 gets quite a bit of their time together out of the way with a quick montage that shows us some highlights of their chaotic gigs and good times at bars before things take a darker turn. And, in case you were wondering, the "half-year montage is not cut content".</p>
<p>"The game cannot be infinite," the creative director also stated. "I think we struck a good balance." After all, Cyberpunk 2077's early beats were never meant to represent the far more open experience that kicks off when the Relic comes into play and we get an unhealthy dose of Keanu Reeves injected into our head. You can roam around for a bit with Jackie, sure, but most players would agree it's more of an on-rails introduction to Night City's underworld and Arasaka's family drama.</p><p>In any case, the fact people are still yapping about whether we should've had more time with Jackie or not after half a decade and many discussions about CDPR essentially finishing the game for real in late 2023 is yet another reminder Cyberpunk 2077 has the staying power we rarely see in the single-player space. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-a-lot-more-copies-than-you-think-and-faster-than-the-witcher-3">it’s performed even better than The Witcher 3</a>.</p>

            <p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded developer 1047 Games has shared some words regarding how its rereleased and repackaged game is doing over on Valve's PC platform, stating: "Steam Charts don't measure fun."</p>
<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded started life as Splitgate 2. However, Splitgate 2 as it was failed to hit the mark, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">1047 Games took the game back to beta in July of last year</a>, which resulted in a number of layoffs at the studio. In November, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-take-two-coming-next-month-as-1047-games-announces-relaunch-for-its-free-to-play-shooter">Splitgate 2 would relaunch in December</a>. A new name - Splitgate Arena Reloaded - was then revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-returning-to-beta-splitgate-2-is-coming-back-with-a-new-name">along with a relaunch date of 17th December</a>.</p>

<p>Since that relaunch less than a month ago, many picked up that Splitgate Arena Reloaded still wasn't bringing in big numbers over on Steam. As our Connor reported just this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-controversial-marketing-campaign-splitgate-2-fails-to-find-an-audience-despite-two-official-launches">the relaunch saw an initial peak concurrent player count of 2,297</a> on the PC platform, before that number dropped down to a relatively stable concurrent count of around 1,000 players in more recent days. It is unclear what its console player base is.</p>
<p>1047 Games has now addressed these Steam figures, saying you can't simply equate player numbers on a single platform with the amount of fun that is being had. "They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment," the Splitgate Arena Reloaded team said.</p>
<p>"They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale)."</p>
<p>Continuing, the developer said: "Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible."</p><p>It went on to thank Splitgate's community of players for their passion and feedback, before closing with an encouragement for others to give the game a go and "form your own opinion" on the relaunch. "To everyone who hasn't played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been... A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it."</p>

<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded is hosting a selection of competitive events in an effort to drum up interest. This includes a $5,000 tournament with Splitgate content creators, as well as a $25,000 community challenge. There's also a welcome back event, in which players can earn the T200 character skin, a popular relic of the original Splitgate.</p>
<p>Will this second go at things still yet be the time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">Splitgate makes FPS great again</a>? We will see.</p>

            <p>Embark Studios' founder Patrick Soderlund has stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, a game initially meant to release as a free-to-play title, launched as a $40 premium price point in part due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s approach.</p>
<p>Speaking to Gamesbeat, Soderlund stated: "It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit'</p>
<p>Soderlund continued: "We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."</p>

</figure>
<p>A further reason why the $40 price point was decided was a desire to sell the game without its cost acting as an "offender" to anyone, given that Arc Raiders is a purely multiplayer game without a campaign. Soderlund remarked: "We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be."</p><p>It appears to have been the correct decision. According to analyst estimates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders recently passed the 12m sales milestone</a>, bringing in over $350m in revenue. It also was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">one of Steam's best selling games over the Christmas period</a>, thanks in part to a well-timed discount as well as an ongoing wave of positive word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>Part of this word of mouth surrounds the interesting social dynamics at play in Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">with a significant portion of the community opting out of PvP gameplay where they can</a>. This, supported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">by matchmaking that takes aggressiveness into account</a>, has resulted in a surprisingly friendly extraction shooter for many players.</p>
