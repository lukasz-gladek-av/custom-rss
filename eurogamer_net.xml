            <p>
Microsoft has walked back on its previous decision to hike the price of its new first-party Xbox games up to $80 USD this 'holiday season', saying it's sticking to a lower price point "in line with current market conditions".
</p>
<p>
Hints of a pricing rethink first emerged earlier today, when Microsoft first-party studio Obsidian Entertainment revealed its upcoming sci-fi action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2, which had previously been given an $79.99 price tag, would now cost $69.99.
</p>
<p>
"We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing," the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obsidian.net/post/3lun6okl2us2q">wrote</a>. "As an organisation devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2."
</p>
<p>
In a follow-up statement <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-concedes-that-the-outer-worlds-2-retail-price-was-too-high">to Windows Central</a>, Microsoft confirmed the pricing adjustment wasn't unique to The Outer Worlds 2. "We're focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore," an Xbox spokesperson told the publication, "and will keep our full-priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99." It didn't provide a precise reason for its strategic U-turn, only saying the move was "in line with current market conditions."
</p>
<p>
Xbox was, of course, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">first major publisher to announced a price increase to $80</a> for "some" of its new first-party games earlier this year, and Nintendo swiftly followed suit, slapping an $80 price tag on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. At the time, however, the company stressed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">would be adopting a "variable pricing" system</a> for its new console and, to date, Mario Kart World is the only Switch 2 game to sport that bumper price tag.
</p>
<p>
And no other publisher has yet followed Xbox's bullish lead. Even Take-Two, which has long been rumoured to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">considering an $80 price tag for GTA 6</a>, has remained firm on its variable pricing stance, pointing to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">upcoming $50 Mafia: The Old Country</a>.
</p>
<p>
While some in the industry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">see rising game prices as inevitable</a>, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-soaring-prices-have-a-cost-beyond-your-wallet-the-concept-of-ownership-itself">took at look at the phenomenon earlier this year</a>, noting that soaring prices have a cost beyond buyers' wallet - the concept of ownership itself.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> has seemingly underperformed, according to a recent <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf">Ubisoft quarterly financial report</a>. This is blamed on a "pricing exploit" allowing players to inflate in-game wallets with more currency than they should have had.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has earned 2.2 percent less than it did this time last year. This drop was blamed on issues tied to Rainbow Six Siege X's launch, "unfavourable exchange rates", and the aforementioned pricing exploit.</p>
<p>Players were able to use pre-paid currency cards to buy more in-game currency than intended, allowing them to buy more items in-game than Ubisoft intended. This exploit has now been fixed. </p>

<p>Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot stated: "Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth."</p>
<p>Guillemot continued: "However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending."</p>
<p>In contrast, Guillemot stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has performed exceptionally well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">pushing past five million players since its release</a>. The Ubisoft president also noted Rainbow Six, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-6">Far Cry</a>, and Assassin's Creed will be handled by the new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">Ubisoft-Tencent subsidiary company</a>, and this new creative house was moving towards "a more agile and focused organisation while ensuring necessary long-term stability and creative vision" with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">the announcement of its new co-CEO Charlie Guillemot</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-underperforms-following-pricing-exploit-according-to-ubisoft]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Developer Sloclap has released its first major patch for Rematch (a bit of unexpected poetry, there).</p>
<p>While this patch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-crossplay-top-priority-future-updates">doesn't add the likes of crossplay</a>, though "good progress" is being made, it does address a swathe of other fixes and improvements for Rematch, which the team has been working on since the last hotfix.</p>
<p>One major change coming with this patch is gamepad remapping, with the developer admitting while this first version is "quite basic", soon it will offer a more advanced version for players to tinker with.</p>

<p>Rematch's first major patch also includes fixes to the camera during goal replays, with Sloclap saying the jitter has been removed. Animations, meanwhile, have received a bit of polish, while the studio has also fixed an issue where goalkeepers were not reacting to opponents' collisions. The team has additionally made "multiple" environment and lighting improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>On the Menus and Interface side of things, Sloclap has added a Colourblind Mode. When this is activated, it will change the colour selection for teams according to deuteranopia, protanopia or tritanopia (the three main types of colour blindness). For now, this mode appears to be the start of a work in progress, with the developer saying the "feature will be pushed further" in a future patch, to apply the filter to the entire screen.</p>
<p>There are still some known issues with Rematch, which Sloclap has acknowledged. These include the ball on occasion emitting "loud wind sounds" until it gets kicked, which honestly sounds to me more like a feature than a bug.</p>
<p>The next patch is expected in the next two to three weeks, Sloclap has said. In the meantime, you can find <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100">further information on Rematch's first major patch here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">Rematch surpassed 1m sales in its first week on the market</a>, with three million "unique" players also joining the pitch thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom was one of those three million Rematch players, and had rather a good old time with it. "I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it. In fact I love it despite the fact that a large portion of the player base is the absolute worst kind of person: a ball hog."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/rematchs-first-major-patch-is-here-adding-colour-blind-mode-gamepad-remapping-and-more]]></content:encoded>
