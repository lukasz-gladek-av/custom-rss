            <p>Fighting game players are up in arms following news that RTS - a gaming talent agency and owner of the Evo tournament series - has been acquired by the Saudi Arabian mega city project Qiddiya.</p>
<p>This news came yesterday afternoon via an official statement by CSO at Qiddiya Muhannad Aldawood, who wrote on Linkedin: "Excited to share that Qiddiya has acquired full ownership of RTS, a strategic step that will further strengthen our esports business and unlock new opportunities across the broader gaming ecosystem. And most importantly, this will enable Qiddiya to keep fueling the continued growth of Evolution Championship Series (EVO), the world's largest fighting game event since 1996, with unlimited [potential]."</p>
<p>The response online from fighting game community members was largely one of disappointment, as various fans of the genre came out to express sadness at the new owners and emphasised the importance of supporting grassroots community-run events. Saudi Arabia has been criticised by Human Rights organisations for its prolific use of slavery,  the death penalty, and more.</p>

<p>Professional <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> player ChrisCCH, who previously refused a place at the Saudi-owned Esports World Cup, <a href="https://x.com/ChrisCCH_/status/1963035397988221121">wrote on X</a>: "Not terribly surprising, but still unfortunate news. Sad for the LGBTQ+ members of the community, and also worried about the scene becoming increasingly funded by money that will disappear as soon as the funders get bored."</p><p>Sajam, a popular commentator and content creator within the fighting game space, <a href="https://x.com/Sajam/status/1963045416716652659">stated</a>: "I think the news personally just makes me want to think about more ways to create cool stuff for the rest of our community. It feels like the pieces that belong to fighting game fans are shrinking all the time."</p>
<p>With a general distaste around Evo following the news, some have looked to other American alternative events to attend, including CEO. One user on X Roycebracket <a href="https://x.com/roycebracketfgc/status/1962914707955699911">summed up their thoughts</a> with: "CEO is about to become the real evo" while LandedIt took a more humorous approach, writing: "Glory to Alex Jebailey ceo 2026 4 jebaillion entrants".</p>
<p>In response to the news, Evo general manager Rick Thiher posted his own statement: "Everything I have worked on in fighting games has been with the ambition of bringing our communities together. Inclusivity, community, and connectivity matter to me. Itâ€™s deeply personal that they remain part of what I work on and that the future of Evo respects that."</p>
<p>Whether or not this uproar on social media actually manifests into a material impact on the future of Evo remains a question mark: there's a big difference between expressing displeasure on Twitter and taking actual action.</p>

            <p>Last month, the beloved PlayStation published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> made its Xbox debut, after months of many asking and developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">Arrowhead joking the move would require "Sony and Phil [Spencer] to duke out" for a port to happen</a>.</p>
<p>And, it seems like this debut has gone down rather well with Xbox players. If you head over to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/browse/top-paid-games?PlayWith=XboxSeriesX%7CS">Xbox website now</a>, you will see that Helldivers 2 is currently listed as the "Top Paid" game on the store.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, according to data from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/augusts-most-downloaded-games-across">Alinea Analytics</a>, Helldivers 2 shifted 926k copies on Xbox six days after its release. To compare, the PlayStation version of Helldivers 2 sold 633k copies six days after its own launch last year.</p>
<p>On the same day that PlayStation's Helldivers 2 arrived on Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">Xbox's Gears of War series also landed on PlayStation</a> thanks to a revamped edition of the original game known as Reloaded. According to Alinea Analytics, this chap has sold 259k copies on PlayStation.</p>

            <p>Stop banging on about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, Bertie. But it's weird, isn't it, when a game you've wondered about the existence for, for a long time, is finally within touching distance, finally nearly here. It's just a game, it's not a magical object, and yet it feels more than a game too. The hype bubble fascinates me.</p>
<p>But enough of that! It's 3rd September and we're back with another daily roundup and chat-a-long of all of today's gaming news. Let's get it, as American people say in YouTube workout videos.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced another game coming to the mature corner of its Switch Online subscription service. That game is shooter Forsaken 64, which first released on Nintendo 64 all the way back in 1998.</p>
<p>When Forsaken 64 arrives on 4th September, it will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-mature-games-selection-starting-with-perfect-dark-and-turok">join the likes of Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Perfect Dark for those members aged 17 and up</a>.</p>

<p>"You are a ruthless mercenary, sent to the condemned remains of Earth as part of a covert operation codenamed Forsaken," the official blurb teases. "Your mission is to infiltrate and destroy the last bastions of the mechanised terror that wiped out all life on the planet. Earth is a death trap riddled with merciless mechanoid adversaries and gangs of rival bounty hunters, and you'll have to brave them all astride your anti-grav pioncycle to make your fortune...or meet your doom." Sounds chill.</p>
<p>As per Nintendo, players will be able to join in either single or multiplayer mode. "Then, select your bike," the company says, noting that each bike has different attributes, and each biker has a "different attitude". So, just find the one you vibe with the most, and drive on into the fray.</p>
<p>"The availability of weapons, enemies, and powerups changes depending on the level you play, so stay sharp," Nintendo closes. You can check out a trailer for Forsaken 64 below.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's Perfect Dark reboot could have been saved from cancellation by Take-Two.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through">Bloomberg</a>, the publishing giant was in talks with Embracer - which owns Perfect Dark co-development studio Crystal Dynamics - and was willing to acquire the project from Microsoft. Had this deal gone through, the plan would have been for Take-Two to then fund and publish Perfect Dark itself.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, according to Bloomberg's sources, this deal was ultimately never realised due to "disagreements over long-term ownership of the Perfect Dark franchise". Crystal Dynamics was therefore forced to abandon the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">lay off staff towards the end of last month</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-announced">Perfect Dark reboot was initially announced back in 2020</a>, with Microsoft studio The Initiative set to lead development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was then brought in to support</a> in 2021.</p>
<p>The reboot did not have a smooth time of things, however, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-made-little-meaningful-progress-since-2020-reveal">it was said "little meaningful progress" had been made</a>. In 2024, it was then said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-reportedly-in-a-very-rough-state-and-a-big-protracted-mess">Perfect Dark had become "a big, protracted mess"</a>, and was in a "rough state".</p><p>Things seemed to be taking a turn for the better later that year, though, and we were treated to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">first gameplay trailer for Perfect Dark</a>. However, this glimmer of hope was soon extinguished, and in July of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Microsoft pulled the plug on Perfect Dark and closed down The Initiative</a>.</p>
