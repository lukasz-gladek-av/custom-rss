            <p>A first look at in-game gameplay of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> has just been shown off during today's State of Unreal stream.
</p><p>
During its time on the stage, we saw some in-game cinematics of a monster attacking a wagon, and Ciri coming across the scene some time later. It then transitioned into gameplay, with Kajetan Kapuscinski cinematic director at CD Projekt Red playing through it.

</p><p>All this while Wyeth Johnson, senior director and project strategy at Epic Games, and Sebastian Kalemba, VP and game director at CD Projekt Red, narrated what we were seeing. This build was running on a standard PS5 at 60fps with ray tracing enabled, according to those on stage.

<p>We see some horse riding courtesy of Ciri's horse Kelpie. Kelpie has realitic muscles and skin movement thanks to the Unreal Chaos Flesh Solver and machine-learned deformations, so the horse will look natural without performance issues. We also see Nanite Foliage in action, which according to senior director Wyeth Johnson allows for fast-rendering high quality shrubbery and scenery.
</p>
<p>Ciri eventually comes to the city of Vargrest, filled with lots of NPCs rushing around and doing their own thing, be it looking at a bear or shopping at stalls. The build shows Ciri transition smoothly from gameplay to another in-game cinematic, leaning on a fence while talking to a quest giver.
</p>
<p>From here, the trio pull away from Ciri and look around the town some more, zooming in at NPCs chatting about fish with various nifty bits of tech at work. The idea expressed by Kalemba is that the difference between Ciri and your regular old NPC isn't too drastic.
</p>
<p>The build then has a circus added, with its crowd ramped up with an increasing number of NPCs reacting to the show without any visual stuttering or lag. Following this, Kalemba pulls back to Ciri one final time stating, "We're making this game to be the most immersive and ambitious open world Witcher game ever, and we're making this a reality thanks to our work on Unreal with the team at Epic."
</p>
<p>Recently in a CD Projekt financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">we learned development progress on The Witcher 4 was well underway</a>. We also know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">The Witcher 4 won't be out until 2026</a>, so consider this an early technical peak at what's to come.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has revealed its next game, which will be published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>'s Pocketpair.</p>
<p>In a change of tone, Dead Take is a horror game about "power and corruption in the entertainment industry", and promises to have a star-studded cast, though few details are yet known.</p>
<p>"We're being secretive for a reason," said Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios. "The subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this'."</p>

<p>A teaser trailer (see above) has been released for the first-person psychological horror game, though it's all quite abstract for now.</p>
<p>Dead Take is set for release later this year, on PC via Steam.</p>
<p>Back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">Surgent and Pocketpair revealed their new partnership</a> on what was then an unknown horror game. Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing following its success with Palworld.</p>
<p>Dead Take isn't the only game Surgent is working on, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">The studio also has Project Uso</a> (the Swahili word for 'face'), which will be an Afrofuturist gothic-horror RPG.</p>
<p>Both games will follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a>, a metroidvania released last year with a distinct setting based on African folklore and exploring themes of grief. The game recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">won the Game Beyond Entertainment award at this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
