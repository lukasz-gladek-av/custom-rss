            <p>
With just days to go until The Game Awards 2024, developers are taking the opportunity to whip fans into a fury of anticipation by revealing ahead of time that, yes, their games will appear - with showings for both Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 now officially confirmed.
</p>
<p>
Mafia: The Old Country's "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily" was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">announced earlier this year</a>, and developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> has now <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406">taken to social media</a> with a simple, "See you at The Game Awards!". This fourth series instalment is due to launch next year, so the timing makes sense for a more substantial look beyond its initial teaser trailer.
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has been yapping excitedly about it since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">unveiling back in August</a>. And he's now popped up to tease the shooter's impending Game Awards appearance. "It's happening, you guys!," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866164877665919396">wrote on social media</a>. "I will be at The Game Awards with a new trailer for Borderlands 4. I can't wait!"

<p>
"Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer!," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733">continued</a>. "Also, in addition to a lot of in-game footage, I will share a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence depicting a moment that occurs about half way between the end of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> and the beginning of Borderlands 4. I AM EXCITE!"
</p><p>
Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocket Pair - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">embroiled in a patent infringement lawsuit</a> with Nintendo - has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1866170665101152345">confirmed a Game Awards appearance</a>, promising fans, "You won’t want to miss it!". And it probably won't surprise anyone to hear <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> will also be at this year's show, his appearance alongside host and pal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> now almost as inevitable as the setting sun. But what might he reveal? A Death Stranding 2 release date? More of his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">intriguing Xbox horror game OD</a>? Only time, and perhaps a 45-minute show segment, will tell.
</p>
<p>
The Game Awards 2024 airs this Friday, 13th December, at 1am in the UK - but especially enthusiastic sorts can tune in half an hour earlier if they fancy a bit of a pre-show. 2023's event went on well into the wee hours, so if you value your sleep like a sensible person, you can always catch up at a more reasonable time via Eurogamer's coverage.

            <p>
Raf Grassetti - principal artist on 2018's God of War and, later, art director on its acclaimed sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> - has announced he's starting a "new chapter" at The Last of Us developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>, following the closure of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s "AAA" studio in October.
</p>
<p>
Grassetti joined Sony Santa Monica in 2013, rising through the ranks to become studio art director in 2022. However, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-god-of-war-art-director-joins-halo-veterans-new-netflix-project">announced his departure</a> last May, revealing he'd joined Netflix Games to work on a new AAA title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-creative-head-joseph-staten-joins-netflix-games">alongside Halo Infinite creative head Joseph Staten</a>, former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> executive producer Chacko Sonny, and ex-Coalition technical director Jerry Edsall.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, that project proved to be short-lived. Netflix announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">pulling the plug</a> on its development - and disbanding the studio - this October, without ever revealing what the team had been working on over the preceding 18 months.

<p>
Since then, it's been speculated Staten has rejoined Halo Studios, given the company closed its job listing for a creative director around the time of his Netflix departure. And Grassetti has now revealed his own return to old haunts as part of a "new chapter", albeit in this instance swapping one renowned Sony studio for another.
</p><p>
"I'm super excited to be joining the amazing crew and project over at Naughty Dog, and to be back to Playstation," Grassetti <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDXFHncpzt3/">wrote on social media</a>. "I'm joining [Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann] and his team as art director, to help create the next big thing! A huge thanks to everybody who was involved in making this happen and all my friends from sister studios. I'm hyped and can’t wait to share more about it! Cheers!"
</p>
<p>
As to what Grassetti'll be working on at Naughty Dog, that remains shrouded in secrecy. The studio hasn't released a new game (discounting remasters) since 2020's The Last of Us Part 2. Its most recently announced project was its standalone The Last of Us multiplayer game - but that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled in December</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Naughty Dog teased it was working on "more than one ambitious, brand-new single player game", and it seems likely one of these will be The Last of Us Part 3, given the huge success of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation and Neil Druckmann's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">recent suggestion</a> there's "probably one more chapter to this story". There's also been speculation the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-naughty-dog-left-a-clue-about-its-next-project-in-the-last-of-us-part-1">working on a fantasy-themed title</a> - but as to where Raf Grassetti might currently be focusing his energies in his new Naughty Dog role, that remains to be seen.
