Nintendo is keen to keep the Switch's dual focus of being both a gaming handheld and home console "to carry over the experience we have already built" and reduce development costs in future, it's said.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors, Nintendo exec Ko Shiota <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf">said</a> the company's current Switch hardware had benefited from the "merging" of software teams previously focused on developing for separate portable and home console platforms - such as in the era of 3DS and Wii U.
</p>
<p>
While still unannounced by Nintendo, it's widely expected that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treat-yourself-with-eight-inches-of-lcd-on-switch-2-report-says">Switch 2 will also be another hybrid console</a> similar to the company's current Switch hardware.

<p>
Discussing Nintendo's development process in more detail, design legend <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> said that the Mario maker must focus on developing polished, original creative ideas that have "never existed before", as its research and development costs increased each year.
</p>
<p>
Rising costs were "in some respects inevitable" as games became more complex and development teams grew in scale, Miyamoto said, but Nintendo was still focused on ensuring original ideas could germinate, with time to properly "nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart".
</p>
<blockquote>"We continue refining our products until we are confident."</blockquote>
<p>
"Our belief is that what we create is more important than the amount spent on development," Miyamoto explained. "We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo must spend time finding the ideas that are worth honing, Miyamoto continued, saying this was a concept that had "not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System", 40 years ago. 
</p>
<p>
"Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing," Miyamoto continued. "However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. 
</p>
<p>
"The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings. We believe that it is important to nurture developers who take this unique concept to heart, allocate funds to development if necessary, and release games only after we are confident in the product – and repeat this process over and over again."
</p>
<p>
Not all gaming ideas needed big budgets, Miyamoto concluded, noting that simple yet intriguing ideas could still become projects with wide appeal "without incurring significant costs". 
</p>
<p>
"With the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time," Miyamoto concluded. "We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's continued silence on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> was broken - briefly - this week with confirmation that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch successor would indeed be backwards compatible</a>. When might we hear more about Switch 2? This week, Eurogamer was told by an analyst that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">"the ship had sailed" on a 2024 reveal for Switch 2</a>.

            <p>
Almost two years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>'s PlayStation launch, Sony Santa Monica has - after introducing the feature in September's PC release - finally made it possible to stop blabbermouth companions from incessantly spewing out puzzle hints on console.
</p>
<p>
Puzzle-ruining companions were one of the most consistent criticisms levied at the otherwise extremely well-received God of War Ragnarök back in 2021, with users lamenting Sony Santa Monica's rather condescending decision to almost immediately shower players with hints on encountering a new puzzle, rather than giving them space to find solutions for themselves.
</p>
<p>
"I am now many (many) hours further into Ragnarök, and yet these 'hints' just keep on coming," a rather exasperated Victoria Kennedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-overly-helpful-characters-create-a-puzzling-puzzle-problem">wrote on Eurogamer at the time</a>, "with varying degrees of abruptness from those delivering them."

<p>
Thankfully, when God of War Ragnarök finally made its way to PC back in September, Sony Santa Monica had taken criticism of the PlayStation version to heart, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc-lets-players-reduce-intrusive-puzzle-hints">introducing an option that specifically reduced the frequency companions doled out puzzle hints</a>. And that option - as Sony previously promised - is now available on console.
</p><p>
The feature arrives as part of Ragnarök's 06.00 update, which also brings a new Audio Descriptions accessibility option for all in-game cinematics, bug fixes, and a range of PS5 Pro-specific enhancements. The latter include a new mode enabling Favour Quality features while running at 60fps, a PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution option, plus the ability to unlock framerates when using variable refresh rate monitors. Full details can be <a href="https://support.sms.playstation.com/hc/en-us/articles/31642737345293-Patch-Notes-v-06-00">found on Sony's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the PC version of God of War Ragnarök, Digital Foundry was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-a-quality-port-with-small-issues-and-here-are-our-best-settings-selections">broadly impressed</a> when it took a closer look back in September, praising some "super-smooth gaming" while criticising "edge case problems that need addressing".

            <p>Activision has unveiled what's coming up in Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>'s first season, which is scheduled to launch on 14th November.</p>
<p>Along with five multiplayer maps - three of which are brand new - players can also expect a "vast amount" of free and premium content, including a new Zombies "experience in-season", plus full integration with Call of Duty's spin-off battle royale, Warzone.</p>

<p>Treyarch has outlined what's coming up in painfully busy infographic below, revealing that as well as the arrival of Racket (2v2 and 6v6), Hacienda (6v6), and Nuketown Holiday (6v6) mid-season, three new maps are also en-route: Hideout, Extraction, and Heirloom.</p><p>Hideout is described as a medium-sized training site featuring signature Black Ops design, whilst Extraction boasts the medium-sized Avalon Heliport "built for a variety of playstyles". Heirloom is more compact and features a "fine art museum built for fast-paced action". All are available for 6v6, with the latter also coming for 2v2.</p>
<p>Players can also expect ranked multiplayer games, as well as the new modes Ransack and Prophunt - the former requires you to loot gold bars and get them out whilst ensuring the enemy can't raid your stash, whilst the latter is "an infamous game of hide-and-seek". Whilst Prophunt launches mid-season, Ransack goes live at launch.</p> <div>

<p>There's also seven new weapons, a new Zombies map, plus fans can expect a festive reimagining of Nuketown for the holiday season, too.</p>
<p>There's more - much more! - so head on over to the official <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement">website</a> for the full details.</p>
<p>The season update comes on the heels of a chunky patch that, along with general fixes to things such as stability and progression, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-gets-hefty-update-with-swathe-of-weapon-adjustments">has also made sweeping adjustments to its multiplayer weapons</a>.</p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty Black Ops 6 review</a>, giving it three out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
