            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has stated its upcoming reboot won't have an offline mode.</p>
<p>This is because "the game and city [known as San Vansterdam] are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox", and both are "always online and always evolving".</p>

</figure>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">recent column by the developer</a>, Skate players will notice changes to San Vansterdam itself as time goes on, as well as "smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities". And, so the studio can deliver on its vision, Skate will "always require a live connection".</p>
<p>Full Circle says this may not be a surprise to anyone who has been part of Skate's playtest, but it may still be a surprise to those who haven't been partaking. After all, the original games were offline. Then again, the Skate revival will be a free-to-play title on its release, so perhaps some were already expecting an online connection as standard.</p>
<p>In addition to chatting about the lack of an offline mode, the Skate team also addressed the playtest's microtransactions. As reported in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-doesnt-yet-have-a-full-release-date-but-already-has-microtransactions">microtransactions were added during the game's closed alpha test</a>.</p>
<p>"We know that using real money during a playtest is a little unusual, but we think itâ€™s the best way to properly assess and adjust the system before launch," Full Circle said today.</p>
<p>"If you see prices or other things changing over time, please understand that this is normal. And of course, you will receive the amount you spent during playtesting in San Van Bucks (SVB) when we reset for Early Access launch."</p>
<p>As to when we will all be able to get our hands on Skate, Full Circle remains committed to its 2025 early access release window, although it hasn't shared a more specific date as yet.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>. On its eventual release, it will have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-becomes-fastest-game-in-the-series-to-sell-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> has now sold more than 10m copies, and has managed to hit that milestone faster than any other game in the series to date.
</p>
<p>
Capcom trumpeted the sales milestone for its spruced up survival horror classic this morning, though revealed its Resi 4 Remake had actually topped that figure as of 31st December last year.
</p>
<p>
That means the game has shifted 10m in less than two years, having first arrived for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2023.
</p>
<p>
Updated sales figures for other previous Resident Evil releases show Resi 7, which released back in 2017, is now up to 15m. Capcom's Resi 2 Remake, released back in 2019, is now also up to 15m.
</p>
<p>
More recent launches such as 2020's Resi 3 Remake and 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> have also continued to sell, and stand on 10m and 11m units respectively.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250425.html">press statement on these updated figures</a>, Capcom described them as evidence it had "successfully executed its long-term catalogue sales strategy".
</p>
<p>
The Resident Evil franchise has now sold a combined 167m units since its first entry released in 1996, Capcom also noted. What's next? Capcom has said it will continue remaking older games alongside newer launches. So, would you prefer Resi 5 or a Code Veronica Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">alongside your Resident Evil 9</a>?
</p>
<p>"Keeping what works while reimagining what doesn't, this is about as good as remakes get," Aoife Wilson wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-review-a-classic-comes-back-to-life">Eurogamer's Resident Evil 4 Remake review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Elder Scrolls 4's 'duplicate items glitch' is alive and well in Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-includes-famous-voice-actor-flub-and-fans-are-delighted">Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda recently said it only wanted to remaster Oblivion</a>, rather than remake it, to ensure players were experiencing the same game they remember playing back in 2006, but with the benefit of today's technology.</p>
<p>And the Oblivion team has indeed remained faithful with its remastering efforts, even including the original's duplicate items cheat (or, glitch, if you prefer).</p>

<p>This Oblivion glitch is a handy and, let's be honest, welcomingly easy way of doing things compared to the more conventional and long-winded method of getting multiple tools and such as you make your way through the fantasy world.</p>
<p>This glitch can be used for items such as arrows or even, for those money hungry players among us, gold.</p>
<p>As our Marie has discovered, the duplicate item glitch in Oblivion Remastered works <em>slightly </em>differently compared to the original game, but it's still very doable, as it is only really the control commands that have been changed up a bit.</p>
<p>If you too are working your way through Oblivion Remastered, but could really do with a few more of a certain item and simply coming across it organically isn't working out for you, you can find out how to use this glitch to your advantage in our handy guide: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-use-duplicate-items-glitch-oblivion-remastered">How to use Duplicate Items glitch in Oblivion Remastered</a>. This guide covers Xbox, PS5 and PC.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Elder Scrolls 4 news, there are<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda"> now over 100 mods available for Oblivion Remastered</a> even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has said it won't offer any official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>For more, earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
