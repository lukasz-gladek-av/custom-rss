            <p>Almost six years on from its debut, Xbox CEO of Gaming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has confirmed that Rare's mysterious fantasy deer adventure Everwild is still in development.</p>
<p>Despite being first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a> with a gorgeous teaser, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">shown again in summer 2020</a> with a slightly-more revealing trailer, we've heard very little about the game.</p>

<p>Talking to the XboxEra podcast, however, Spencer had good news for those who feared the game may have been quietly cancelled, revealing the team was making "progress".</p>
<p>"I was recently out at Rare. It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making," Spencer said, when asked reflect on what first-party games still in development he was most looking forward to (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-provides-rare-update-on-missing-in-action-xbox-exclusive-everwild/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>"It has been [a while]. And we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time."</p>
<p>Earlier today we reported that in the same podcast, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-hes-stopped-trying-to-move-all-players-over-to-xbox">Spencer said he's "not trying to move [PS5 and PC players] all over to Xbox anymore"</a>, acknowledging that players are "all so invested in where our games are", all he wants to do now is "allow more people to play" Xbox games on other systems.</p>
<p>Spencer acknowledged that whilst selling games on competitor devices means Xbox only recoups 70 percent of the sale, that 70 percent still helps Xbox "build great portfolios".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>10:10 Games has initiated redundancies following the "complete commercial and critical failure" of Funko Fusion.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/1010-games-employees-offered-no-severance-laid-off-while-on-holiday-and-more/">Insider Gaming</a>, where sources shared their experiences under the promise of anonymity, the lukewarm reception to Funko Fusion meant the UK studio struggled to secure funding for addition projects, and some colleagues were informed that there "isnâ€™t enough work to give the whole team".</p>

<p>Sources intimate no meaningful severance support has been made available, with only "the bare minimum" entitlement offered, as well as payment of unused holiday. However, this, some speculate, is why colleagues were pressured into using up all their leave ahead of the announcement.</p>
<p>Because of this, some colleagues were notified that their jobs were at risk whilst on leave. In some instances, these staff felt obliged to attend meetings about their future at the studio whilst on holiday, even if they were away in different timezones.</p>
<p>"Management seemed very keen to wrap up the process quickly, and despite saying that they were fully open to suggestions and feedback, none of it has been taken on board," said one source.</p>
<p>Whilst unconfirmed, it's thought around 20 people have been impacted by the cuts, bringing the estimated<a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025"> number of developers who have lost their jobs across the games industry</a> to around 900 in 2025 alone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"There are people - whether it's their libraries are on PlayStation or Nintendo, whether it's that they like the controller better, they just like the games that are there - and I don't want to then look at that and say 'well, there's no way that we should be able to build a business there, [or] find fans of our franchises there'.</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore. We're all so invested in where our games are, let's just allow more people to play. And yes, the 70 percent that we make on games on other platforms is helpful to us being able to build great portfolios, like we showed at Developer Direct, and I hope this will continue to show through the rest of the year."</p>
<p>That said, Spencer was pragmatic enough to admit that position may change, not least because yes, he would very much prefer to be making "all of the money for all the games that [Xbox] ship[s] right now".</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Xbox is about to give up its hardware endeavours, however.</p>
<p>"Obviously we make more on our own platform, it's one of the reasons that investing in our own platform is important," he added.</p>
<p>Spencer's comments follow a recent interview in which he was asked if like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-says-brands-identity-is-evolving-in-response-to-fan-concerns-over-multiplatform-future">continue to have an "exclusivity window" on Xbox systems</a>. He replied with a strikingly simple: "No."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Former Valve writer Marc Laidlaw revealed the news on social media, saying he had no details of Antonov's death, but he had had it confirmed that the "visionary art lead" had died.</p>

</span></p><p>"I didn't want to say much till I felt it was confirmed, but I learned today that Viktor Antonov, our visionary art lead on HL2, has died," Laidlaw said.</p>
<p>"I don't have details. Just sadness. Brilliant and original. Made everything better."</p>
<p>Antonov moved from Bulgaria to Paris when he was just 17 and went on to work or consult on a number of notable games, including Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, Dishonored. Dishonored: Dunwall City Trials, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored-2">Dishonored 2</a>, Doom, and Prey.</p>
<p>After Valve, Antonov joined Arkane Studios, telling our Bertie: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-half-life-2-city-17-creator-viktor-antonov-left-valve">Valve is a great place, but I'm interested in projects, not in companies</a>. I went to Valve specifically for Half-Life 2. I went and I collaborated with Arkane to do The Crossing and Dishonored. I put the project above everything else."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
