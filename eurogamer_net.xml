Nintendo is now "very unlikely" to reveal its hotly-anticipated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> hardware this year, a games industry analyst has told Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
This morning's financial results from Nintendo revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-as-the-wait-for-new-hardware-continues">larger-than-expected drop in hardware and software sales for the current Switch</a>, as the console ages and its release calendar quietens. 
</p>
<p>
The results also passed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">without even a whiff of Switch 2 being shown</a> - and perhaps, with Nintendo's new hardware not due to arrive until sometime in 2025 - for good reason.

<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer today, industry analyst Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy Kantan Games, said any mention of Switch 2 now would only further impede Switch 1 sales during the console's last holiday season.
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo is unpredictable, but I do believe a reveal before the end of the year is very unlikely," Toto said. 
</p>
<p>
"Sales of the current model are cratering, more than Nintendo had already anticipated. They would implode even further if a Switch 2 announcement came before the holidays, so why would they do that?
</p>
<p>
"Instead, Nintendo is a lot more likely to wait until early January to show the new device. For 2024, the ship has sailed."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal plans have been the subject of a frenzied rumour mill of gossip and speculation amongst fans of the company and the video game industry at large. Throughout all this, Nintendo has remained silent, busy launching its final slate of Switch 1 games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-nintendo-museum-a-joyful-celebration-of-machines-magic-and-the-art-of-play">opening a museum</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">releasing a Â£99 alarm clock</a>.
</p><p>For its part, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has stated it will unveil Switch 2 before the end of its current financial year</a> - 30th April 2025. Eurogamer understands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Switch 2 will not launch before that point, either</a> - even if it was revealed on 1st January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As part of celebrations for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a>'s 20th anniversary this November, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> Studios is releasing a recreation of that lost E3 demo from 2003, via a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshopsubmitinfo/">Steam Workshop</a> mod for the Master Chief Collection.</p>
<p>"The buzz and hype going into that event was off the charts and the stakes were higher than ever," reflected Halo's community director Brian Jarrard, in an anniversary blog post.</p>
<p>"I have fond memories of so much playtesting and practising, internal challenges to see who could take out every single enemy in a flawless playthrough."</p>

<p>Jarred spoke about the "electric" response to Halo 2's E3 demo. "None of us ever would have expected that 20+ years later, a group of passionate community modders would bring this demo to life as a full-fledged mission," he continued.</p><p>As for why it has taken so long for the demo to be playable to the wider Halo community, this was due to 'snags with technology'. Thankfully, the original files and assets have now been recovered, although work still needed to be done to make the demo playable today. This was because the 2003 demo was built in a version of the Halo engine that doesn't actually exist any more, and assets weren't compatible with other existing versions of Halo 2.</p>
<p>"This put us in a bit of a quandary," Halo senior franchise writer Kenneth Peters explained. "Even the original executable is difficult to work with, as you need an Xbox developer kit to get it to boot, which is in increasingly short supply even within the studio. But now, in 2024, we have the Digsite-developed tools to analyse and automate up-porting old assets, and the unearthed knowledge to know why Bungie built things the way they did in the demo."</p>
<p>The free Halo 2 E3 demo mod will be released on 9th November, via Steam Workshop, and include gameplay that didn't make it into the final release.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> players will be able to revisit recreations of Halo 2 multiplayer maps and gameplay in Halo Infinite's Delta Arena Playlist from today, 5th November. Further details can be found via <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/04/20-years-of-halo-2-new-maps-e3-demo/">Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>For more, last month a former member of Texas-based support studio Certain Affinity confirmed reports the team was working on a battle royale mode for Halo Infinite, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-halo-infinite-dev-confirms-cancelled-battle-royale-mode-says-it-could-have-been-a-game-changer">calling the cancelled project a potential "game changer"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
