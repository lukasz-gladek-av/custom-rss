            <p>Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves has said he would love to reprise the role of Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">Reeves spoke to IGN</a> while promoting his new film Good Fortune, in which he plays an angel, fittingly. Apparently it's funny. When asked by IGN whether he'd like to be in CD Projekt Red's new Cyberpunk game, Reeves answered, "Absolutely. I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again."</p>
<p>We don't know much about Cyberpunk 2 other than it will feature a new city that Cyberpunk TTRPG creator Mike Pondsmith - who collaborated heavily on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">recently described as "Chicago gone wrong"</a>. We also know the in-development game is called Project Orion and has around 80 people working on it, and is in pre-production.</p>
<p>The question of Reeves' involvement I expect depends on what part Johnny Silverhand will play in the second Cyberpunk game, if any. The entire plot of Cyberpunk 2077 revolved around Silverhand, so his story has been told, and it did have an end to it.</p><p>There's a possibility that Silverhand could still appear in a sequel but it depends which ending CDPR decides is canon in the game - all of which sounds like too fussy a narrative proposition to me. It may be simpler to rule Reeves and Silverhand out.</p>
<p>Ruling Reeves out, though, would mean no more iconic "you're breathtaking" moments on an E3 stage. But sometimes such sacrifices have to be made. Also, it would leave the proverbial door open for CDPR to hire another big name in Reeves' place.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> famously featured actor Idris Elba, and Charles Dance featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>. The Polish studio has a penchant for hiring big-name talent. The question is, who could it pick? My money's Sean Bean. Or Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>

            <p>Controversial and violent shooter Ready or Not has now sold over 13m copies across platforms.</p>
<p>In a press release, developer Void Interactive added that its game - which was released on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in July of this year, following a spell of PC exclusivity - has sold over 3m copies on consoles. That means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-hits-1m-console-sales-in-4-days-despite-censorship-claims-from-its-pc-players">Ready or Not has sold over 2m copies on consoles in under two months</a>.</p>

<p>Ready or Not initially released in early access back in 2021, and soon after this Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Void Interactive said that Ready or Not's console port needed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release">changes "as absolutely required by our first party partners"</a> before it could be released on Xbox and PlayStation. This included tweaks to dismemberment and gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence". This move ignited a certain amount of backlash from the game's community, with some leaving negative Steam reviews citing "content censorship".</p>
<p>Void Interactive sought to quell these concerns soon after, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-developer-seeks-to-alleviate-censorship-concerns-following-community-outcry">stating it had seen "misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes"</a>.</p>
