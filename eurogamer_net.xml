            <p>
Nintendo has pushed out another <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> system update with typically minimal patch notes. But as delightful as the company's endless quest for "stability improvements" undoubtedly are, users have also starting spotting some undocumented backward compatibility improvements affecting the previously broken likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's latest update - officially titled Ver. 20.2.0 - arrived overnight, delivering two specifically documented (if not especially thrilling) enhancements for the console. Firstly, it fixed an issue where parental control settings were not being copied from Switch 1 to Switch 2 during system transfer, and then came those  "general system stability improvements".
</p>
<p>
However, word of some secret sauce hidden amid Ver. 20.2.0's mundane documented fixes started circulating soon after. Prominent Switch data miner OatmealDome, for instance, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3ltxqqi5d4s2h">noted</a> it also addressed "some problems" with Switch 1 backwards compatibility. "I can personally confirm that Portal 2 no longer crashes after updating," they added.
</p>
<p>
Owners had previously found a temporary fix for Portal 2's crashing problem - the issue was seemingly remedied by setting Switch 2 to aeroplane mode before launching the game - but workarounds are needed no more. Alongside user reports of a fix, Nintendo has - as of today, 15th June - now officially <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/portal-2-switch/">updated Portal 2's eShop listing</a> to confirm its compatibility with Switch 2. "Supported," reads the new note. "Game behaviour is consistent with Nintendo Switch."
</p>
<p>
Other previously wonky games have also been hit with the magic fixing stick following Ver. 20.2.0's release - Crypt of the Necrodancer is another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Portal/comments/1ldawwb/do_not_buy_portal_2_for_the_switch_2/?sort=new">highlighted by users</a> and relabelled as compatible on eShop - but the full extent of Nintendo's tinkering is not yet known. At least we've got those stability improvements to enjoy while the investigations continue.

        <p>What's Cory Barlog up to?</p>

            <p>Sony Santa Monica, the studio behind the God of War series, is working on a new game, but reportedly it won't be a new IP though "it might feel like one".</p>
<p>There's been plenty of speculation around what the studio may be working on next, in particular game director Cory Barlog. He was responsible for the God of War reboot in 2018, but on its sequel he was producer.</p>
<p>Now, Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier has addressed the speculation on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">ResetEra</a>, calling Barlog's game "Sony Santa Monica's next big thing" and that "it was going well" at least a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>In a later response, Schreier added it won't be a new IP and it certainly won't be a sci-fi game.</p>
<p>"I'll put it this way: it’s not a new IP but it might feel like one," Schreier said. "Maybe that's why people are confused. Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum. And that the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."</p>
<p>Rumours swirled in August last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">Sony Santa Monica was developing its first new IP in over 20 years</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear if the studio has multiple projects, or if indeed its next game will be part of an existing franchise. The obvious conclusion is a new game in the God of War series, likely with a new direction.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one]]></content:encoded>
