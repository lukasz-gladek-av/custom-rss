            <p>Rebel Wolves, the studio from former CD Projekt director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, has dropped a new trailer giving us our first meaningful look at The Blood of the Dawnwalker's gameplay.</p>
<p>Recorded on PC - and clearly labelled as a pre-beta "work-in-progress" - the trailer presents a bumper-length introduction to some of the game's features and gameplay mechanics. You can check it out below:</p>

<p>As well as watching protagonist Coen in action, and some of the gorgeous environments he'll visit, we also get a good long look at his perks menu, too, and learn a little more about how to balance his human qualities with his superhuman ones.
</p>
<p>"Using hexes consumes his health," explains design director, Daniel Sadowski. "The way our magic system works, there's always a price to pay for manipulating reality."
</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves confirmed its first project would be dark fantasy RPG Dawnwalker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-game-directors-new-studio-confirms-first-project-as-fantasy-rpg-dawnwalker">at the beginning of last year</a>. Described as a "brand-new role-playing saga", it's single-player and open-world, with a "strong focus on story and narrative", casting players as Coen - a "young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night". You must "fight for your humanity or embrace the cursed powers to save your family".</p>
<p>Alongside Tomaszkiewicz, Rebel Wolves counts former CD Projekt scribe Jakub Szamałek as its narrative director and main writer, with other team members including design director Daniel Sadowski, animation director Tamara Zawada, art director Bartłomiej Gaweł, CFO Michał Boryka, and studio head Robert Murzynowski - who have collectively worked on games such as Cyberpunk, Thronebreaker, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-warrior-2">Shadow Warrior 2</a>, and The Witcher series.</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series in 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-gameplay-from-former-the-witcher-developers-fantasy-rpg-the-blood-of-the-dawnwalker]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega is launching a new store in Tokyo, Japan: Sega Store Tokyo.</p>
<p>Sega didn't share any specifics when it announced the news on social media, but the new store is expected to open in Shibuya's Parco department complex, near the official Capcom store, a Pokémon Center, and Nintendo Tokyo, too.</p>

<p>The accompanying 18-second teaser doesn't give much away, sadly, but Sega's transmedia boss Justin Scarpone told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-unveils-plans-for-tokyo-flagship-store-alongside-nintendo/">VGC</a> last year that it was time to put the Sega brand - and not just Sonic - "in front of consumers".</p>

<p>"Our portfolio is very broad, but the common thread is the Sega brand," Scaprone said at the time. "Sega already has a surprising amount of fandom as a brand, and we need to look after those fans and offer new experiences to them, while putting the stamp of Sega on it more proudly.</p>
<p>"It's really exciting, and we need to do a lot more of that, because Sega is a consumer brand that is surprisingly not in front of consumers enough. Sonic is, but Sega isn't."</p>
<p>A second store is also expected to open in Shanghai, but as yet there's no news of an expansion into Europe or America.</p>
<p>Alex recently caught up with Takashi Iizuka, the Sonic series producer who first worked on the franchise just two years into his career and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">stuck with the blue blur for all these years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-reveals-sega-store-tokyo-is-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>
