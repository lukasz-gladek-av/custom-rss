            <p>
Kojima Productions has announced a 10th anniversary celebration to be held in Japan, which promises guest appearances and "a glimpse into future projects".
</p>
<p>
The studio unveiled the event today, on the 10th anniversary of Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain, which doesn't seem coincidental.
</p>
<p>
The Kojima Productions Beyond The Strand event will take place on 23rd September at a cinema in Tokyo, but it doesn't appear to be screened elsewhere. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> himself will host the event.

<p>
Still, keep that date in your diaries if you're interested to know what's coming next from the studio.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we'll see something on OD, Kojima's Xbox horror game first announced back in 2023? In a recent interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-marmite-hideo-kojima-says-you-will-either-love-or-hate-od">Kojima stated OD was "something totally different"</a> and people will either "love it or hate it".
</p>
<p>
Or perhaps we'll see a first look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">Physint</a>, Kojima's return to the action-espionage genre he popularised with the Metal Gear Solid games. Then again, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-metal-gear-like-physint-is-still-so-early-in-development-hes-currently-working-on-it-all-by-myself">recently stated it's early enough in development he's still working on it by himself</a>.
</p>
<p>
Just don't expect Death Stranding 3 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-wont-make-it-himself">Kojima confirmed he has a concept for a sequel</a>, but won't be making it himself.
</p>
<p>
If you're in Japan, you can find details of the anniversary event on the <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/kjp10th_beyond_the_strand">Kojima Productions website</a>.
