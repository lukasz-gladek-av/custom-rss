            <p>Balatro, the poker-themed roguelite, has now passed 5m copies sold.</p>
<p>That's more than double the sales since last August, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">game passed 2m copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>Since then it's released on mobile and has seen a surge in popularity following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">multiple wins at last year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside the mobile release, Balatro was added to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> subscription service, but it would appear those players are not included in these 5m individual sales.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the Balatro social media account, which implored fans to try out more indie games.</p>
<p>"The last few weeks have been pretty wild," the post reads. "To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at thegameawards, we hope you're having an amazing time with it!</p>
<p>"If this is your first time picking up an indie title, try to make it a habit! There's some amazing stuff out there!"</p> <div>

<p>LocalThunk, as the game's solo developer is known, released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-dev-shares-an-excellent-list-of-his-favourite-indie-games-of-2024">list of his favourite indie games</a> at the start of this year, with his top pick being <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>.</p>
<p>Balatro was released in February last year and is available across PC, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>It won best mobile game, best debut indie game, and best independent game at The Game Awards 2024.</p>
<p>Two months after its release on mobile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">report estimated the game had generated almost $4.4m on mobile alone</a>.</p>
<p>LocalThunk has stated he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-creator-sometimes-regrets-its-success-and-wants-to-stay-anonymous">wishes to remain anonymous</a> and, in a previous interview, admitted he regrets the game's success. "Honestly, yeah," he said. "Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways. I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you fancy kicking off the new year with another Xbox controller variant, good news. Microsoft has revealed the latest edition to its Cipher family of controllers, and this one comes in a bright red hue.</p>
<p>The Pulse Cipher Special Edition features a translucent top case, so you can see the controller's inner workings. It follows the same overall design as Xbox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-going-a-bit-90s-with-its-new-transparent-blue-sky-cipher-controller">Sky Cipher</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-ghost-cipher-special-edition-wireless-controller">Ghost Cipher</a> models, but with a different colour palette. It features a colour palette where "modern gaming meets enduring nostalgia", Xbox said.</p>
<p>You can see how it looks - front and back - in the image below.</p>

<p>The red Pulse Cipher Special Edition is available to pre-order today ahead of its launch on 4th February, priced <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/pulse-cipher-special-edition">£70</a>.</p>
<p>In September of last year, Microsoft also revealed some transparent Cipher Series top cases, along with some chromatic D-pad and paddles, for its Elite Series 2 controllers. These top cases are inspired by the "translucent tech of the '90s and early 2000s", and are available via <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-gb/configure/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">Xbox Design Lab</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere in Microsoft news, later this week the company is hosting an Xbox Developer Direct showcase. Things will kick off at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific) on Thursday, 23rd January, with Microsoft promising us a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Doom: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and a mystery fourth game</a> from an unknown studio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
