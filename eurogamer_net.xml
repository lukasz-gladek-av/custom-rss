            <p>A new trailer for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> has been released, showing off 20 mini games and 14 tech demos that'll be playable to those who pick the game up alongside their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Games shown include a timed survival game in which you pilot a little space ship and dodge spiked balls, a match-the-tile memory game, a first-person balloon popping game, as well as a driving game that allows you to lean on two tires by tilting the Joycon controller.</p>
<p>As for tech demos, we see a side-by-side comparison between 20fps and 120fps as a football soars across the screen, alongside a model viewer that allows you to quickly swap between different resolutions to see the shift in visual quality firsthand.</p>

<p>Plus, a macarena shaker demo was briefly shown, which looks to let players feel how the motors inside each Joycon feel with different settings. We don't get to see everything in store of course, but we can assume each demo will be dedicated to a specific use case for the fancy new features.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, there's also an in-game quiz that seems to test you on all the new hardware and software features on the console. Who doesn't love homework with their new video game console?</p>
<p>All in all it looks to be a fairly comprehensive overview of the console, giving eager beavers with a shiny new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> a way to familiarise themselves with its new gizmos without having to pour through a big instructions manual.</p>
<p>However, many still wonder why this game is being sold as its own release, rather than it being included alongside the Switch 2 for free like we saw with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astros-playroom">Astro's Playroom</a> on the PS5. The former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">Reggie Fils-Aime referenced the Welcome Tour being sold for $10</a> by speaking about the past, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> was released for free alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/wii">Nintendo Wii</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo itself has defended selling the game rather than bundling it in with the console, stating that the game is being sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">due to the "amount of care and work" put into it</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be released on June 5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">alongside the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It will cost £7.99 here in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin has said this show will be his "video game swansong", but that hasn't stopped him joking about 19 seasons of something <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>-flavoured.</p>
<p>Mazin has so far been at the helm of two seasons of The Last of Us, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann. A third season is already confirmed to be in the pipeline, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">at least one more season after that is still expected to wrap up the games' narratives</a>.</p>
<p>But, once all that is done and dusted, Mazin won't be looking to head up another video game to TV adaptation, he has said.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.scifinow.co.uk/interviews/craig-mazin-on-the-last-of-us/">SciFiNow</a>, the showrunner was asked which other video game series he would like to adapt, to which he replied: "Well, I'm not ever going to, of course, because where can you go from here?"</p>
<p>That said, he joked that as he is a "masochist", he was tempted to reply with Grand Theft Auto 5, because "I just think that would be like 19 seasons of TV", or even something like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, which is quite the thought.</p>
<p>However, these game adaptations are all just a jokey reply, and The Last of Us will be Mazin's "video game swansong", he said. He would still happily lend a hand to those looking to adapt a video game for TV, though.</p>
<p>"Mostly, I'm excited to watch what other people do, even if I help. I have no problem being a helper. I would love to help produce some good adaptations of video games, just a couple in mind that I actually have," Mazin said.</p>
<p>"But in terms of writing and dedicating myself on a day-by-day basis… this one's my video game swansong."</p>

<p>The Last of Us' second season concluded last week, after seven episodes. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-finale-audience-significantly-lower-than-first-seasons-but-hbo-insists-it-will-grow-significantly">finale welcomed 3.7 million cross-platform viewers in the US</a>, which was significantly lower than the season's opening episode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-debut-viewing-figures-beat-season-one-premiere">which premiered with 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers</a>.</p>
<p>As for its next outing, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-discuss-where-season-three-will-go">The Last of Us' cast and crew shared some insight into where the show will go during its third season</a>.</p>
