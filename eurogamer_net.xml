            <p>Another day, another AI-generated "slop" accusation, this time against Blizzard and its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> x <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a> crossover event.</p>
<p>In a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/diablo_x_hearthstone_colab_is_ai_generated/">Reddit</a>, later picked up by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/">PC Gamer</a>, redditor Ipyreable believes they've spotted an image with telltales signs of generative AI. At the time of writing, over 4,400 people have upvoted the post.</p>
<p>Given Hearthstone's fantasy leanings, it would be fair to presume a make-believe world embodies mystical things that don't align with the real world we live in, but I don't think there's many people who'd be prepared to defend an ear with three conchas (yes, I did indeed have to look that word up. You're welcome).</p>

<p>Appending an image with several questionable features, including a hand that fades into a wall, mirrored/reversed card art, and that strange ear, of course, the OP wrote: "Guess $158 pets aren't enough to pay an artist to draw the image for their colab lmao".</p>
<p>The $158 refers to Hearthstone's first ever cosmetic pet, King Krush, which is locked behind a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQVMosqrrek">gambling mechanism</a>" which requires you to spend your real life money.</p> <div>

<p>"Well, let's keep calling them out for this shit. If they're not going to pay artists, users are going to grumble. That's just how it is as well," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4ewxar/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one player, to which another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4ex6vq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">replied</a>: "Less grumbling, and more 'stop buying things with real money'. Can do both, but the latter is the only thing that gets brought up in yearly budget meetings with the money goblins."</p>
<p>"The sad reality is that most users won’t notice or care much at all," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4fmtb9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> someone else. "It’s better to focus on supporting companies and creators who make their own shit. Easier to get people excited for something new rather than try to diminish their attachment to something comfortable and familiar."</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard has yet to comment publicly on the accusations and, at the time of writing, the artwork remains online.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft announced around 9000 employees would be laid off</a>, including roughly 200 staff from King. Now, in a new report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">sources state King is reportedly replacing laid off staff with AI tools they helped to build</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-once-again-accusing-activision-blizzard-of-using-ai-generated-art-in-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-event-marketing-materials]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former DreadXP and Critical Reflex alum Ted Hentschke has teamed up with Jakub Bałuszek-Sobolewski to form Black Lantern Collective, a new publisher dedicated to horror games.</p>
<p>Described as an "all-new indie publisher leveraging the passion and expertise for established horror savants to bring a curated collection of chills, thrills, and unease to the freaky masses", Black Lantern hit the ground running with ten game announcements, but kicks off its release schedule with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/">Captum Mortum</a>, an atmospheric psychological horror game coming in August.</p>

<p>"Caput Mortum is a short first-person horror experience inspired by retro 3D dungeon crawlers and survival horror games," the team explains. "Delve into a tower of forgotten nightmares, where every step could be your last. Overcome horrors from beyond death and unlock the secrets of forbidden knowledge."
</p>
<p>Also on the way is a first-person narrative adventure "about tagging billboards and watching your house burn down", <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3105190/CHILDREN_OF_SATURN/">Children of Saturn</a>, rogue-like dice build <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3512300/Dead_Finger_Dice/">Dead Finger Dice: A Billionaire Killing Game</a> wherein you take on pole dice against blood-thirsty demon billionaires - as you do - and a "darkly quirky" RPG called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3145370/Muffles_Life_Sentence/">Muffles' Life Sentence</a> set in a prison where innmates are remade to match their crimes. The latter is out now on Steam.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amazon MGM Studios has selected yet another video game series for a TV show adaptation - and this time it's Wolfenstein.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/">Variety</a>, the exact plot details have yet to be disclosed, but the show's official tagline reminds us that "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen".</p>

<p>Jonah Nolan (aka Jonathan Nolan) and Lisa Joy - names you would've seen on the credits of Fallout - are already on board as executive producers, along with Athena Wickham, James Altman, and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson. Patrick Somerville will serve as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner under his production company, chaoticgood.tv.</p>
<p>Variety reports Somerville - who created the shows Maniac and Station Eleven - has reportedly been a fan of the Wolfenstein games "since he was a child".</p>
<p>Amazon is clearly looking to replicate the success of its hugely successful game-to-TV adaptation, Fallout, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime</a>, even though the show's second season's December 2025 debut is still months away.</p>
<p>More than 100 million people have watched Fallout's first season to date, Amazon has revealed, making it one of the streamer's top three launches ever. Amazon is now moving quickly to make more of the show, and begin teasing its second batch of episodes with another longing look at the Las Vegas skyline at the end of the below trailer.</p>
<p>Other in-progress TV adaptations at Amazon include a series based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">God of War</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">Warhammer 40,000</a>. In fact, Amazon is so confident of its God of War adaptation, it has ordered a second season before the first has even been aired.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv]]></content:encoded>
