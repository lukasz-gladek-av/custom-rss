            <p>The Chinese Room, the British studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, has gone independent from previous owners Sumo Digital following a management buyout.</p>
<p>The Brighton-based studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumo-buys-everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-maker-the-chinese-room">bought by Sumo Digital back in 2018</a>, which was acquired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> in January 2022 in a deal worth around Â£919m.</p>
<p>Now, The Chinese Room will continue developing original games independently, following its success with oil rig horror game Still Wakes the Deep that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">won the BAFTA for New Intellectual Property</a> at this year's awards, as well as both performer awards.</p>

<p>"This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision," said studio director Ed Daly.</p>
<p>"This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">Sumo Digital announced it would refocus</a> on "development services for partners", which would "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people". The news followed layoffs in June 2024, where 15 percent of the company were let go.</p>
<p>Sumo Digital put The Chinese Room up for sale earlier this year, but it was likely the studio would be sold to an overseas buyer. This management buyout therefore allows The Chinese Room to remain as an independent British studio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Still Wakes the Deep publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-publisher-confirms-small-number-of-layoffs-as-its-sold-to-investment-firm">Secret Mode confirmed a "small number" of layoffs</a> earlier this year as it was sold to an investment firm.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room's next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, which it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">worked on with Paradox Interactive</a>. It's then working on two further new original projects.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 was previously aiming for a first half of 2025 release, but was delayed back in March. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-troubled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-gets-another-delay">now aiming for an October launch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-goes-independent-to-continue-focus-on-original-projects]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft is no longer selling or renting movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>The change came about abruptly earlier this week, with a FAQ update on both the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/apps-help/troubleshoot-movies-and-tv-on-xbox-one">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/watch-movies-and-tv-shows-on-the-microsoft-movies-tv-app-59328422-053f-30b3-843a-f8774567a85e">Windows</a> pages confirming that as of 18th July, "Microsoft has stopped selling new movie and TV content".</p>
<p>"Existing customers can continue to access their previously purchased content on Windows and Xbox devices," the FAQ explains, "[and] players can continue to play personal videos on Xbox devices. Windows customers can continue to have access to playback and the download functionality."</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/microsoft-abruptly-stops-selling-movies-and-tv-shows-on-pc-and-xbox-but-past-purchases-will-remain-available/">PC Gamer</a> points out, this isn't unique to Microsoft - in fact, both Apple and Google have effectively done the same thing, only earlier - and it appears the megacorp is committed to permitting existing customers access their paid-for content (at least, for the time being).</p>
<p>As per Microsoft's terms of sale, there's no way to get a refund, nor can you switch your purchased content to another service. For anyone who used the service regularly, Microsoft suggests you use "other entertainment services that offer the latest home entertainment releases", such as "Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and Fandango at Home, among others".</p>

            <p>The director behind ICO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> believes the days of creating new and innovative gameplay mechanics "has already passed".</p>
<p>In an interview with To a T and Karamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi earlier this year, Fumito Ueda praised To a T, commending Takahashi for "not relying on unique gameplay mechanics".</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a">Denfaminicogamer</a>, Ueda said he called up Takahashi when To a T was revealed, wanting to know if the unusual game involved any new or complicated mechanics to play. When Takahashi revealed it did not, he responded with a simple: "That's great!"</p>

<p>Reminded of this exchange during his interview with Takahashi, Ueda joked "ah, these are the words of a professional", but then expanded on the comment, explaining that what he meant was that contemporary games felt over-concerned with gameplay (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director-praises-katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-for-not-being-mechanics-based-the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"While I donât know why I replied with 'that's great' back then, I was most likely thinking â the age of gameplay mechanics had already passed," Ueda said. "I guess this is not the age to release new devices or offer new mechanics with each and every new game.</p>
<p>"Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork, he added. "Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is â I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition."</p>
<p>Ueda believes this is why he enjoyed To a T so much; rather than innovating or inventing complex control schemes and mechanics, it instead concentrated on its visuals and story to tell a tale about what it's like to live with a disability.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our Donlan took away a different take. "Over the five or six hours it takes to play To a T, Iâve had a series of revelations that in turn built to one giant revelation: I have had the wrong idea about pretty much everything here," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is">Donlan wrote when he gave To a T a try</a>.</p>
<p>"As a result, I've never played a game where I spent so much of the time simply trying to work out what itâs doing. What's the intent, To a T? What do you want to be? It turns out I wouldn't truly understand any of this until the final credits had rolled. In fact, I'm still thinking about a lot of it."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed-says-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ready or Not, the violent and controversial shooter from Void Interactive, has topped one million sales on console in just four days.</p>
<p>Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7352240956261216257/">LinkedIn</a>, Void's CEO Julio Rodriguez said he was "incredibly proud of the team and what we've accomplished together", saying he didn't take the milestone "for granted".</p>

<p>"When we launched Ready or Not on PC, it took about 36 days to reach one million units sold. On console, it took about 3.6 days," Rodriguez wrote. "Iâm incredibly proud of the team and what we've accomplished together. Itâs a huge moment - and one we donât take for granted.</p>
<p>"Game reviews are holding strong as we head into our first weekend, and the team is already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience.</p>
<p>"To our players, partners, and everyone who believed in the project - thank you."</p>
<p>It's not been a trouble-free rollout, however. When Void Interactive confirmed earlier this month that the console port needed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release">changes "as absolutely required by our first party partners",</a> including tweaks to dismemberment/gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence", some in the game's community hit back with a review-bomb campaign which has seen its "mostly positive" rating fall to "mostly negative".</p>
<p>The negative Steam reviews cited "content censorship", despite Void Interactive's attempts to to quell these concerns, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-developer-seeks-to-alleviate-censorship-concerns-following-community-outcry">stating it had seen "misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes"</a>.</p>
<p>The shooter is currently sitting on a 4 out of 5 score on the Xbox storefront, an average 4.69 on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after it confirmed the game would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access, but in a statement on Twitter shortly after its debut, Void <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was also briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-hits-1m-console-sales-in-4-days-despite-censorship-claims-from-its-pc-players]]></content:encoded>
