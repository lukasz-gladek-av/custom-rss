            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has revealed its next game, which will be published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>'s Pocketpair.</p>
<p>In a change of tone, Dead Take is a horror game about "power and corruption in the entertainment industry", and promises to have a star-studded cast, though few details are yet known.</p>
<p>"We're being secretive for a reason," said Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios. "The subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this'."</p>

<p>A teaser trailer (see above) has been released for the first-person psychological horror game, though it's all quite abstract for now.</p>
<p>Dead Take is set for release later this year, on PC via Steam.</p>
<p>Back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">Surgent and Pocketpair revealed their new partnership</a> on what was then an unknown horror game. Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing following its success with Palworld.</p>
<p>Dead Take isn't the only game Surgent is working on, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">The studio also has Project Uso</a> (the Swahili word for 'face'), which will be an Afrofuturist gothic-horror RPG.</p>
<p>Both games will follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a>, a metroidvania released last year with a distinct setting based on African folklore and exploring themes of grief. The game recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">won the Game Beyond Entertainment award at this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Joining the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">upcoming rush of summer's various showcases and reveals</a> is PlayStation, which has announced its next State of Play.</p>
<p>Those interested in finding out more about what Sony has been cooking up behind the scenes will be able to tune in tomorrow, 4th June, at 10pm UK time. That's 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST.</p>
<p>While the team is remaining coy about what will be shown - this isn't a game specific State of Play a la <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">April's Borderlands 4 showcase</a> - there should be plenty to whet appetites for the coming months.</p>

<p>"Watch live for news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5. The show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe," reads an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">accompanying PlayStation blog post</a>. The show will last for "40+" minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a chance we will hear more about the PS5's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, which is set for release on 2nd October. Developer Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so maybe we will get a taste of that later this week.</p>
<p>The PS5 exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> will also likely be part of the upcoming State of Play even if it is more of a brief teaser rather than anything too chonky, given that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Kojima Productions is hosting its own dedicated On the Beach showcase this coming Sunday</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">a Wolverine release date, perhaps</a>?</p>
