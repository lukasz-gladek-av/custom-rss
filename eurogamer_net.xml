            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has released a statement on the state of its game, as its sequel finally becomes available to play.</p>
<p>Stalker 2 made its debut today across Xbox and PC, but is already the subject of multiple technical issues - these issues are one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's own Stalker 2 review isn't on the site just yet</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on social media platform X, GSC has addressed these issues and acknowledged the game "may" have some "rough edges" now that it is out in the wild. However, the studio has assured its players will address any niggles that arise in the game, as and when it is able.</p>

<p>"We are absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention," the developer wrote. "In the first few days after release, we'll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can."</p>
<p>Following this, GSC will release more substantial updates for Stalker 2, as well as free in-game content. More details on the game's roadmap will be shared in December, GSC said, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>"We have big plans for the Stalker universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey," the team closed. "We're blessed to have you before, we're blessed to have you now. The Zone belongs to you. Have fun."</p>

<p>The studio recently released a documentary all about developing Stalker 2 during a particularly difficult time for GSC. The documentary - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> - touches on the developer's history and details what it has been like to work on the forthcoming sequel during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-on-hold-ukraine-based-developer-confirms">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>Since 2022, GSC has delayed Stalker 2 several times and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-moving-to-prague-to-finish-game">relocated staff</a> to safely finish the project elsewhere, while others have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-harrowing-update-from-gsc-game-world-the-stalker-2-developer-based-in-ukraine">joined Ukraine's armed forces</a>, and dealt with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-says-russian-hackers-have-leaked-test-build-online-asks-fans-not-to-share">Russian hackers who leaked test builds</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s upcoming permanent OG Mode will have its own unique battle pass, developer Epic Games has revealed, separate to that of the game's main Fortnite Battle Royale offering.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games previously revealed that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">hugely-popular original Fortnite map would return permanently in December</a> as a separate mode that looks set to rotate through its various seasonal incarnations. The decision follows the map's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">massive but temporary return 12 months ago</a> that gave the game its best-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december">blog post</a> today, Epic Games revealed that the new OG Pass, as well as the game's main Battle Pass, plus the next iterations of the Music Pass and Lego Pass (each 1400 V-Bucks) will all be included in the existing Fortnite Crew subscription going forward. 
</p>
<p>
That's a big upgrade for anyone currently paying Â£10/$12 a month for Fortnite Crew. The changes mean that this subscription will soon include four battle passes for the same price, instead of just the main Battle Pass.
</p>
<p>
There are a couple of other tweaks today, too. The cost of the main Fortnite Battle Pass is being rounded up to 1000 V-Bucks instead of 950, and new Crew subscribers after 1st December will only be able to claim battle pass rewards while their subscription is active.
</p>
<p>
More details on exactly what will be in the new OG Pass and how much it will cost are still to come ahead of the mode's arrival on 6th December.
</p>
<p>At the same time, Fortnite will also offer an all new Chapter 6 version of its evergreen battle royale, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-map-features-japanese-theme-leaks-suggest">which looks set to have a Japanese theme</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
