            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has sold more than one million copies on PC within three days of its arrival to the platform, <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821">according to Ruliweb</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> would also pass the three million sales milestone across all platforms following its PC release. As of writing, the game reached a peak concurrent player count on Steam of 192,078, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">a substantial increase over the weekend from its initial peak of just under 100,000 in its first day</a>.</p>
<p>This performance marks an all-time record for South Korean single players games, a style of game that ShiftUp has been championing since releasing Stellar Blade in April of last year.</p>

<p>According to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238">Daniel Ahmad at Niko Partners</a>, a majority of these PC sales stem from China, a playerbase who'd benefit from a PC-only Chinese dub and appropriate regional pricing. This market has proven an exceptionally eager one, both with Stellar Blade and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">Black Myth Wukong's own record breaking Steam release last year</a>.</p>
<p>This stunning PC release comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony execs spoke about bringing its games to different platforms in an annual fireside chat</a>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president Hideaki Nishino and Studio Business Group head Hermen Hulst when asked about how to "protect the value" of the PlayStation console noted that Sony's consoles would remain "the best place to play and publish", but that "the team is always looking for "new and innovative ways to broaden [its] reach".</p>
<p>ShiftUp announced back in May in an investor presentation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">a sequel to Stellar Blade was being developed</a>. The only tidbit of information aside from the confirmation present there was that the game was scheduled to be released before 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
