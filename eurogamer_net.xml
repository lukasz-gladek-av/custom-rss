        <p>A BioShock 1 remake has also reportedly been cancelled.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Cloud Chamber, the studio tasked with reviving the decade-dormant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> series, has reportedly failed an internal review with 2K Games execs, resulting in a leadership shakeup.</p>
<p>Anonymous sources speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil">Bloomberg</a> said it was the game's narrative, in particular, that apparently failed to impress, and was "identified as an area in need of improvement [that] will be revamped in the coming months".</p>

<p>Following the review, studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted, and creative director Hogarth de la Plante moved into "a publishing role". The rest of the Cloud Chamber team was told in an all-hands meeting that the company needed "to become more agile and efficient". Colleagues are now worried that cuts may follow.</p>
<p>In response to the report, a 2K spokesperson acknowledged the change at the top of the studio to Bloomberg, saying it remained "fully committed to ensuring we deliver a BioShock game that exceeds the lofty expectations of our fans".</p>
<p>"We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future," 2K Games said in a statement. "Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path."</p>
<p>Sadly, there's even more bad news for BioShock fans. Right at the end of the report, Bloomberg confirmed both the existence - and the cancellation - of a remake of the first BioShock game. It's unclear why the project was cancelled, but sources say it was shelved earlier in the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-bioshock-adaptation-will-be-a-more-personal-film-as-opposed-to-a-grander-big-project">Netflix's BioShock adaptation was similarly "reconfigured" last year</a> to be a "more personal" film with a tighter budget. Producer Roy Lee told fans at a panel at last year's San Diego Comic-Con that changes at the top of Netflix's movie department have seen the budget streamlined, so "we're doing a much smaller version... It's going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive]]></content:encoded>

            <p>GOG has launched an all-new project to raise awareness of censorship in gaming: <a href="https://items.gog.com/freedomtobuy/index.html">FreedomToBuy.Games</a>.</p>
<p>The digital games platform, which has long been campaigning for the better preservation of DRM-free games, said it believes that "if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today – and decades from now".</p>
<p>Consequently, for the next 28-ish hours or so at the time of writing, it is offering up 13 games for free – including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/postal-2">Postal 2</a>, Agony, and House Party – "because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it".</p> <div>

<p>"Thanks to the dedication of developers and publishers, we are launching FreedomToBuy.games," the company said in a statement. "To raise awareness on censorship in gaming, 13 games are now available for free for 48h as a part of stand for creative freedom and preservation.</p>
<p>"We believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today – and decades from now. It’s our statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder."</p>
<p>The campaign comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results on the platform</a> in June. Shortly thereafter, we learned itch.io had "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal">the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam</a>, which similarly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">"retired" unspecified NSFW titles and introduced vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its own PC storefront</a>.</p>
<p>GOG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">announced its Preservation Program last November</a>, when 100 games were part of the line-up. That list has continued to expand since then with a regular influx of new additions - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fear-platinum-joins-gog-preservation-program-to-properly-recognise-monoliths-contributions-to-gaming">Monolith Production's much-loved horror shooter FEAR</a>, which was added to "honour [the studio's] legacy" in February, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith's shock closure</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-offers-13-free-nsfw-games-as-it-launches-anti-censorship-campaign-freedomtobuygames]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has warned Switch owners in Japan not to let their consoles get too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>Spurred by the high temperatures in some parts of Japan, Nintendo posted a statement to Japanese social media informing players that by playing in "high-temperature environments", the device's temperature, too, may rise, potentially causing "malfunctions".</p>

<p>"When using a Nintendo Switch or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in a high-temperature environment, the device's temperature may rise," the statement said, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-warns-japanese-users-about-operating-the-switch-and-switch-2-at-too-high-or-too-low-temperatures/">Automaton</a>.

<p>Interestingly, the statement not only warns about ensuring the device doesn't get too warm, but also warns about low temperatures, too, suggesting playing it in environments where the temp struggles to get past 5°C could also be problematic.</p>
<p>It's caused a number of players who live in colder climates to respond to Nintendo on Twitter, with one player from Hokkaido, where it regularly falls below freezing in winter, writing: "5°C?! [Is Nintendo] telling me not to fight in Hokkaido?!"</p>
<p>"It's midwinter outdoors, so it's naturally below freezing lol," they later <a href="https://x.com/nomin7500love/status/1951243781929574433">added</a>. "But there are times when it's 5°C indoors."</p>
<p>While Nintendo didn't explain why players should avoid playing when it's very hot or very cold, much like using any electronic device in extreme temperatures, it's thought that this can slow the charging speed and degrade the battery, ultimately shortening the console's lifespan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-all-switch-2-users-have-bought-mario-kart-world-as-sales-of-new-console-pass-6m-worldwide">Nintendo sold 5.82m Switch 2 consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of Mario Kart World</a>, meaning the launch title has an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>
<p>The figures came from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Nintendo's latest earnings release</a> as of 30th June, where the company added software sales for Switch 2 reached 8.67m units in that same period. That means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> accounts for 65 percent of all software sales on the new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo added, in the seven weeks since launch, the Switch 2 has sold over 6m units worldwide. Even so, Nintendo has noted demand is exceeding supply in many countries.</p>
<p>Shortly after the console's launch, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 was the company's fastest-selling hardware ever</a>, moving 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale. Last week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-video-game-hardware-device-in-us-history-usurping-the-ps4">Switch 2 is the fastest-selling video game hardware device in the US</a>, beating the PS4.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-warns-japanese-players-not-to-play-switch-2-in-extreme-temperatures]]></content:encoded>
