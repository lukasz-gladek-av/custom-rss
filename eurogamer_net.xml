            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida is being immortalised in pixel form thanks to Bionic Bay.</p>
<p>Bionic Bay is an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-day-of-the-devs-2024-indie-games-showcase">upcoming "precision-puzzle platformer" that casts players as a scientist</a>. It's coming from developers Mureena Oy and Psychoflow Studio, and is all set in an "ancient bio-mechanical world" which has been "hand-crafted pixel by pixel to create a high-fidelity, atmospheric environment". The game is set to release across both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida may have now left PlayStation</a>, his legacy will certainly live on, and the former exec has now been announced as an unlockable character skin. Not only that, he even has his own "special" level.</p>

<p>Writing on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/14/the-making-of-hand-crafted-pixel-art-platformer-bionic-bay-out-april-17-on-ps5/">PlayStation blog</a>, Bionic Bay creative director Juhana Myllys said the team was "ecstatic" to reveal its collaboration with Yoshida.</p>
<p>Yoshida's level will be available via the upcoming game's online challenge mode. "If you take part and beat Shu's score, you can even unlock our Shu skin," the developer wrote.</p>
<p>This skin, once unlocked, will allow players to customise the look of their scientist for Bionic Bay's online leaderboards. You can see how it looks via the image below.</p>
<p>Following a slight delay, Bionic Bay will release tomorrow, 17th April.</p>

<p>Bionic Bay isn't Yoshida's only video game collaboration post-PlayStation. Back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-lands-first-video-game-voice-role-in-promise-mascot-agency">Yoshida was announced to be part of the cast of Promise Mascot Agency</a>. His role is a bright green, bird-like mascot called MonouGe who "just loves games".</p>
<p>Away from starring roles in video games, earlier this week Yoshida made headlines for his thoughts on Nintendo's next console, suggesting that positioning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> as simply a bigger and better follow-up to Switch 1 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-losing-their-identity-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-shares-damning-switch-2-verdict">damaging to the company's brand identity</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It seems some retailers in the US will open up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> pre-orders as soon as next week.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Nintendo made the unprecedented decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">delay its Switch 2 pre-orders</a> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">both the US and Canada</a>, stating this was "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions". Pre-orders in both countries were initially planned to go live on 9th April.</p>

<p>Nintendo did not give details as to when it expected to open pre-orders following this decision, merely stating it would update timings "at a later date". However, the ever-reliable Billbill-kun of Dealabs has now said Switch 2 pre-orders in the US will begin soon, with some retailers starting next week.</p>
<p>According to Billbill-kun, pre-orders for Switch 2 consoles will go live on either 21st April or 30th April, "depending on retailer". They did not specifically mention any outlet by name. Additionally, Billbill-kun reports pre-orders for Switch 2 accessories such as the Pro controller will kick off on 30th April.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has messaged Nintendo for further information. </p>
<p>Yesterday, Billbill-kun reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-delayed-canadian-preorders-reportedly-beginning-next-week">Canadian Switch 2 pre-orders could start from 23rd April</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss Doug Bowser said the US administration's trade tariffs - which had heavily impacted some of the company's key manufacturing locations around the world - had posed a "challenge" for the company, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-tariffs-werent-factored-into-switch-2-price-but-its-something-were-going-to-have-to-address">was something Nintendo was "going to have to address"</a>.</p>
<p>Despite a temporary pause on some tariffs since then, the situation has remained uncertain amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-appears-to-backtrack-on-us-electronics-tariff-exceptions-but-no-one-seems-to-know-exactly-whats-going-on">confusing messaging around potential electronics exceptions</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
