            <p>Arknights: Endfield, a new gacha action game released today, has temporarily halted PayPal transactions after multiple players were charged real money for in-game purchases they didn't make.</p>
<p>Some users quickly took to online community hubs like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/">the Arknight Endfield Reddit</a> show payments made on their PayPal accounts which they didn't authorise. Some screenshots include payments made in various global currencies, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjijsy/random_paypal_account_linked_to_my_account_i_just/">with some claiming that other player's Paypals were being registered to their fresh account</a>. The exact cause of this bug has not been confirmed as of writing by the developer Hyperglyph.</p>
<p>One user, Impossible Clover 818, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/did_anyone_get_refunded_for_the_paypal_nonsense/">created a post</a> on the Endfield Reddit titled: 'Did anyone get refunded for the PayPal nonsense yet? My whole balance got wiped'. They claim that £1,200 was "wiped" from their Paypal account, and less than an hour ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Endfield/comments/1qjs62z/comment/o11d2pt/?context=3">had been prompted to provide real-world identification</a> to access the account, due to 'suspicious activity'.</p>

<p>In a statement made <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888">on the official Arknights Endfield social media account</a>, a statement explains that Hyperglyph is aware of the problem, and that it affects "a small number of purchases" made via PayPal, and that was an "inconsistency between the order and item delivery". It then asks impacted players to contact the company via email, and to provide their account server and ID for a refund.</p>
<p>The statement goes on to assert that all refunds are expected to be resolved "within four hours". Given it was posted 15-minutes ago as of writing, this should hopefully be resolved in short order.</p>
<p>When contacted for comment prior to this social media post, a representative of Hyperglyph provided the following to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to sincerely apologize to everyone affected by the PayPal payment issue that occurred shortly after launch. We understand how upsetting and concerning this kind of situation can be, especially when it involves purchases and personal payment details.</p>
<p>Here's what we want to clearly share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>All affected PayPal purchases will be fully refunded. We've already begun processing refunds for impacted orders.</li>
<li>We do not store players' payment information. Payment details are handled directly by PayPal and are not saved in our systems.</li>
<li>This issue only affected some players on certain platforms when using PayPal. As soon as we became aware of the problem, we disabled PayPal payments within roughly two hours of launch to prevent any further impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment, PayPal payments will remain unavailable while we continue to investigate the root cause together with our partners. We won't re-enable the payment option until we're confident the issue has been fully resolved.</p>
<p>We're truly sorry for the stress and inconvenience this caused, and we're grateful for your patience while we work through this carefully. If you have additional questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly.</p></blockquote>

            <p>Hypixel Studios has detailed the second patch for its Minecraft-like Hytale.</p>
<p>The forthcoming update covers a range of areas, including cosmetics and customisation, world generation, farming, audio and more. Rather excitingly, there is also new magic, the developer has proclaimed, along with a Necromancy grimoire.</p>
<p>For those with an aversion to snakes a la Indiana Jones (why is it always, snakes?), the studio is also going to implement an ophidiophobia accessibility mode.</p>

<p>Ahead of Hytale's release, Hypixel announced its Minecraft-alike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">had already sold enough copies to fund the next two years of development</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," Collins-Laflamme said at the time, "we are looking very strong for the future."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-boss-calls-early-release-the-most-challenging-but-rewarding-experience">Collins-Laflamme called Hytale's recent early access launch "the most challenging but rewarding experience" of his life</a>.</p>
