            <p>Bungie will finally reveal details of its next game, Marathon, later this week.</p>
<p>The Destiny maker released a teaser video for a Marathon Gameplay Reveal, which will take place on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/MARATHONTHEGAME">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarathonTheGame">YouTube</a> on 12th April at 6pm UK time (10am PDT).</p>
<p>The teaser itself shows a character running through a bright jungle chased by some sort of robot or mech, though we don't see a full shot of either. We do, however, see an adorable pink cat curl up next to the (presumably dying) figure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">Bungie first announced it was reviving Marathon back in May 2023</a>, but very little has been heard about it since.</p>
<p>The original Marathon first-person shooter was released in 1994 and received two sequels. Now, Bungie is reviving the series as a "sci-fi PvP extraction shooter" featuring "evolving, persistent zones" that's set in the same universe as the original games.</p>
<p>Marathon will be the first new project from Bungie since Halo and Destiny, set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV where players will take on the role of cybernetic mercenaries Runners.</p>
<p>It's aiming for release across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">Marathon game was released on Steam for free</a>.</p>
<p>Then in October last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">Marathon game director Joe Ziegler gave an update to explain the gameplay loop</a> but stated it was too early to show gameplay and more would be shown next year.</p>
<p>Now it's next year and, true to its word, Bungie is finally set to show off the game in action.</p>
<p>News of the game has been tainted by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">dismissal of former project lead Chris Barrett</a> following alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A number of Switch 2 listings have popped up on the likes of eBay, as retailers run out of stock following pre-orders going live.</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo gave us all a much closer look at its upcoming Switch successor. Along with an overview of games and such, it also gave us a release date and retail price - Switch 2 will be released on Thursday 5th June, with a retail price of £395.99 for the console, or £429.99 should you opt for the Switch 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle.</p>
<p>However, once pre-orders went live, stock soon ran out, with places such as Argos already out of stock. "Sorry, this item is just too popular! But we may get more stock, so do check back at a later date," reads a <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7550333?clickPR=plp:1:9">notice on Argos' website</a>.</p>

<p>And, as to be expected, given this high demand, listings for the Switch 2 are now popping up on eBay, above that recommended retail price. At the time of writing, there are multiple Switch 2 listings via the online auction site in excess of £600.</p>
<p>On the completed sales side of things, one Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle was sold for £634.02, which is £204.03 more than the recommended retail price. A Switch 2 console without Mario Kart World included, meanwhile, has sold for £554.45.</p>
<p>While retailers such as Argos and Smyths have opened pre-orders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo itself is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own store in a bid to reduce scalping by implementing an invite-only system. Emails have started going out for those fortunate to be selected.</p>

            <p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney has snuffed out reports that a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> movie is the "next" video game to get a silver screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Sweeney was responding to a tweet from movie industry insider Daniel "DanielRPK" Richtman, who'd suggested in a since-deleted post that whilst some studios had already "passed" on a Fortnite movie, the recent success of game-to-film adaptations like A Minecraft Movie and Super Mario Bros. Movie meant a Fortnite movie was likely to be "next".</p>

<p>"You just know Fortnite is next," Richtman wrote in the deleted tweet. "There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now."</p>
<p>Sweeney shot down the speculation with a succinct "False".</p> <div>

<p>Despite trying to clarify which specific part of the statement was incorrect, at the time of writing, Sweeney has yet to respond to Richtman's follow-up tweet (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/epic-games-ceo-fortnite-movie-response-video-game-adaptations/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Sweeney wouldn't be blamed for considering it, though; earlier today, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie has generated $301m worldwide</a> - that's £233m - on its opening weekend. That's the biggest US domestic debut of any video game movie adaptation ever, with an opening weekend of $157m (£121.5m).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adding-the-walking-dead-assets-including-negans-baseball-bat-so-you-can-make-your-own-skull-cracking-mini-games">Fortnite recently returned to the world of The Walking Dead</a> by offering up a cache of assets for players and developers to go build themed mini-games with.</p>
<p>Whilst characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl have previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins, this latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan, as well as his infamous baseball bat, Lucille. A selection of comic book-inspired walkers (zombies) will also be included.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Gatekeeper expansion is also now available. This one includes five new Survivors with unique perks and five new Killers with 10 "hauntingly-detailed miniature figurines" to customise your experience.</p>
<p>As for the video game itself? Most recently, developer Behaviour Interactive confirmed Pinhead - and his Hellraiser Chapter DLC - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylights-hellraiser-dlc-is-getting-yanked-from-sale-soon">would be yanked from sale on 4th April</a>.</p>
<p>As explained in Behaviour's announcement earlier this month, he's only retreating from digital storefronts - existing owners can continue playing with him after 4th April, but no new purchases of the Hellraiser Chapter DLC would be possible. Behaviour didn't explain why the DLC was being removed from sale, but as Matt posited at the time, the answer is almost certainly licensing-related.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I love you, brother. Rest in peace."</p>
<p>Petras worked at Blizzard between May 1997 to February 2005 as lead artist and art director, and then again as senior art director between January 2010 and October 2021.</p>
