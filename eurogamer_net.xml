            <p>
Following recent claims Microsoft's much-rumoured handheld Xbox will arrive later this year in collaboration with an unspecified "PC gaming OEM", hardware manufacturer ASUS has shared a teaser trailer suggesting the machine is real and set to be revealed soon.
</p>
<p>
Word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft was partnering with a third-party company to release an Xbox-branded handheld this year</a> first surfaced via Windows Central, which reported the device was being developed under the codename Keenan and would look "unmistakably 'Xbox'", sporting familiar design sensibilities and even an Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
Skip ahead a couple of weeks and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXzXhezpSF4">ASUS has now shared a teaser</a> for what appears to be its next-generation ASUS ROG Ally gaming handheld - a video that doesn't perhaps <em>immediately</em> scream Xbox with its magenta hues and weird dabbing robot. However, at one point during its brisk runtime, a ROG Ally and Xbox-style controller are seen hurtling through the air before disappearing into a machine where some sort of fusing process unfolds.

<p>
The inference is clear enough, but Microsoft's involvement in the project was seemingly all but confirmed when Xbox's official social media account <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708">replied to ASUS' teaser post</a> with the side-eye monkey meme. Obviously, all this stays in the 'speculation' bucket until either party is ready to go beyond memes and teases, but the pieces are undoubtedly starting to fall into place.
</p>
<p>
According to Windows Central's previous report, this year's Xbox-branded handheld will be something of a stop gap while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Microsoft continues developing its own Xbox gaming handheld</a> internally. The company's said to be targeting a 2027 launch for this other machine, which will reportedly arrive alongside an Xbox Series X/S successor and "several new controller options".
</p>
<p>
However things pan out, it's a pretty exciting time in the world of handheld gaming - not least because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is reportedly also working on its own handheld device</a> in the form of portable PS5, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo's hugely anticipated Switch 2 is just days away from its big reveal</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been an massive success for publisher Capcom, but not everybody's happy on PC, where the game has been repeatedly lambasted for its poor performance. Finally, however, a month after its release, Capcom has revealed a first round of performance-related PC improvements is coming later this week.
</p>
<p>
Capcom shared the news in a <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter/">lengthy post from Monster Hunter Wilds game director Yuya Tokuda</a> over on the official Monster Hunter website. After thanking players for their support amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">Wilds' impressive 10m sales milestone</a>, Tokuda began detailing some of the improvements the developer is targeting in response to player feedback.
</p>
<p>
The big one, for PC players at least, is the promise of improved game stability. "The team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements where possible," Tokuda wrote, "especially on the Steam version. This will be an ongoing process, where we'll aim to make continual steps forward in this area and respond to critical issues."

<p>
The good news is Capcom's first round of performance-related PC improvements is set to arrive very soon - as part of Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1 this Thursday, 3rd April. This'll include a promised reduction in VRAM usage, as well as an upgrade to the DirectStorage version on Steam - both of which "should result in an overall improvement in stability for our PC players", according to Capcom.
</p>
<p>
Notably, VRAM usage and DirectStorage issues were both highlighted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry's review of Monster Hunter Wilds on PC</a>, in which Alex Battaglia detailed the games "profound performance problems" and "substantial" technical issues. At the time, Alex advised "caution" for higher-end GPU owners, but flat-out recommended anyone with lower-end graphics cards "avoid" Wilds until Capcom could improve the situation - so hopefully this week's update will bring meaningful changes ahead of promised "continued improvements" in future patches.
</p>
<p>
Away from PC performance, Tokuda highlighted some other areas the team is targeting. There's talk of weapon balance adjustments, for instance, which are set to be implemented "gradually" with each new title update. As for quality of life changes, Capcom says it's currently looking to make it easier for players to access information they require through UI/UX improvements, alongside "additional adjustments... to further enhance the overall feel of the game to curate an even smoother gameplay experience."
</p>
<p>
Capcom says to expect changes making it easier to restock items, check skill information, participate in multiplayer quests, and use the Seikret. Additionally, improved camera behaviour during hunts is also on the developer's to-do list. More generally, the team is planning to "take a wider look at overall gameplay flow, which encompasses a range of things, such as the in-game economy, balance and other areas." This, it says, will "require more time for preparation".
</p>
<p>
Alongside the aforementioned PC performance improvements, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">this week's Monster Hunter Wilds title update</a> introduces a new social hub and a range of new monsters, including bubble dragon Mizutsune, a High Rank version of Zoh Shia, and the arch-tempered Rey Dau. Notably, Tokuda's blog stresses additional tough monsters are on the way, following criticism of Wilds' low difficulty at launch. May's update, for instance - which previously appeared to be relatively small in scope - will bring tempered variants of Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad. Additionally, more "challenging monsters will also appear in future updates".
</p>
<p>
"We will continue to add new elements and content to make Monster Hunter Wilds even more enjoyable for all hunters through our free content updates," Tokuda concluded, "while at the same time making further improvements and adjustments to the game."
