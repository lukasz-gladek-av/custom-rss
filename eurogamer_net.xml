            <p>FromSoftware owner Kadokawa hopes the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>, as well as the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, will offset a projected decline in gaming profits this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The company has forecast a 60 percent decline in profits for its gaming segment for FY2025, owing to the huge success last year of Elden Ring and its DLC <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, according to the company's latest financial results.</p>
<p>However, the company hopes to "exceed the forecast with new hit titles and expanded sales of past titles" as it maximises the long-term value of Elden Ring.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is an online multiplayer co-operative spin-off with roguelite elements that sees players join forces to beat a host of Nightlord bosses. It releases on 30th May across PC, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition will release later this year on Switch 2, though is currently without a firm release date, and will mark the game's debut on a Nintendo console. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">It will include two new classes</a>, new looks for the Torrent mount, and other additions that will also come to existing platforms in an update.</p>
<p>However, even with these releases, Kadokawa is expecting a big decline in profit.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">hands-on with Elden Ring Nightreign</a> earlier this year and came away impressed with its twist on familiar Soulslike gameplay, despite not being a big fan of multiplayer in the past.</p>
<p>Despite positive criticism, excitement seems muted compared to the success of the base game. Yesterday, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-director-promises-difficulty-tweaks-following-beta-feedback-and-updates-for-nightlord-gladius">director promised tweaks to its difficulty following the network test</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Kadokawa also points to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods</a>, announced for Switch 2, as part of its longer term plan. It's a completely new game exclusive to Nintendo's new console that's expected to "further expand the global fanbase", although its multiplayer focus has raised concerns with fans alongside Nightreign's online play.</p>
<p>FromSoftware boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">Hidetaka Miyazaki confirmed the studio hasn't shifted to focus on multiplayer games</a>, despite that appearing to be the case with both Nightreign and The Duskbloods.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mafia: The Old Country will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 8th August, publisher 2K has now officially confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
This is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-inadvertently-revealed-by-publisher">the release date previously listed by 2K on Steam, before it was swiftly removed</a>. Still, it's nice to know the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">GTA 6 delay by fellow Take-Two company Rockstar</a> hasn't changed anything.
</p>
<p>
In a press release issued today alongside a gameplay trailer, below, 2K also revealed a £45/$50 price point for the game. Meanwhile, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> set expectations that Mafia: The Old Country would be a "focused, linear" experience - in other words, relatively short - and easily digestible alongside players' usual live-service diet.

"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments," said 2K president David Ismailer. "We're excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis." 
</p>
<p>
In other words, don't stop playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> yet!
</p>
<p>
Set in Sicily - the aforementioned Old Country - back in the 1900s, this latest entry in the Mafia series has been angled as something of a return to franchise's roots after the more modern-era open-world <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>. First <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">announced last year at Gamescom 2024</a>, it's the next entry in the series from Mafia 3 and Mafia: Definitive Edition studio Hangar 13, and the first to make use of Unreal Engine 5.
