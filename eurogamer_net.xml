            <p>Word on the street is that Rockstar is getting ready to release a GTA 4 port for modern consoles.</p>
<p>According to the latest rumours from known Rockstar insider Tez2, a spruced up version of the open-world action game could release later this year, followed by a remaster of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne-3">Max Payne 3</a>.</p>
<p>Writing on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1001944-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2/page/90/#comment-1072547918">GTA Forum</a>, Tez2 said someone at Rockstar had "hinted" at a GTA 4 port, and "by now it should've gone up a year in development". The insider added that this port was one of the reasons <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">Rockstar put the stoppers on the fan-made Liberty City Preservation Project earlier this year</a>. This project would have added a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a>.</p>

<p>"If [Rockstar] still follow their plan laid out from the pandemic days, they'll do an MP3 port after 4. So that is an opportunity to do a bundle or a Definitive Edition. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remakes, and a Max Payne 3 port," Tez2 wrote.</p>
<p>GTA 4 is set in Liberty City - Rockstar's version of New York - and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">where GTA 6 protagonist Lucia Caminos hails from</a>. So, a GTA 4 port ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s release may be a nice way to tide players over until next May, while also offering a bit of background on Lucia's once home.</p>
<p>Haven't played GTA 4 for yourself yet? Well, on its release Eurogamer called it "a genuinely ground-breaking blockbuster" in video game history back in the day.</p>
<p>"There were moments playing GTA 4 that I thought back to my initial experiences with games, and realised exactly how far we've come. There's never been anything quite like GTA 4in the world. That there makes me genuinely happy to be a gamer," Kieron Gillen wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-iv-1-8">Eurogamer's GTA 4 review from 2008</a>. "Also, beating up people and taking their money and stuff."</p>
