            <p>Rockstar has released a second trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>
<p>"Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida - forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive," reads the official trailer blurb.</p>
<p>Fancy a watch, you can check it out for yourself below.</p>

<p>Rockstar has also updated its <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">official GTA 6 website</a>. Here, the studio has given us more information on its leads, Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos.</p>
<p>Poor ol' Jason just wants an "easy life", Rockstar has shared, but this isn't going to plan.</p>
<p>"Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new."</p>

<p>Lucia, meanwhile, was taught by her father "to fight as soon as she could walk", and "life has been coming at her swinging ever since". This has seen her landed in prison, even though she just wants to "live the good life" Lucia's mother once pictured for her.</p>
<p>"But instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands," Rockstar has said.</p><p>

Both Jason and Lucia hope that together, things will finally work out for them. However, at least as far as Jason is concerned, "meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him". Ooooh...

<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Rockstar announced it was delaying the release of GTA 6 from this autumn to May next year</a>.</p>
<p>"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve," Rockstar said at the time.</p>
<p>Publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-publisher-take-two-still-expects-record-revenue-this-year-despite-shock-delay">Take-Two went on to say the expectation is that "the company will achieve sequential increases in, and record levels of, net bookings in fiscal 2026 and 2027"</a> even with the delay of, let's be honest, one of if not the most anticipated upcoming games out there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>On its release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: Tarnished Edition will include two new classes for players to choose from when they set off for the Lands Between.</p>
<p>This upcoming edition of the game was first revealed last month, when developer FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring would be coming to Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, the team said new armour, a new Torrent appearance customisation feature and "more" would be available for Elden Ring players, and while this edition was announced for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, FromSoftware confirmed the additional content will also be available on other platforms as DLC.</p>

<p>And now, we have a better idea of just what that previously teased "more" is, with the news that two new classes are coming to Elden Ring.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423">Famitsu</a>, these classes are Knight of Ides and Heavy Knight (via machine translation). At the present time, the developer hasn't said what kind of stats these two new classes will have, so something else to keep an eye out for. Heavy Knight suggests quite a burly class, though.</p>
<p>According to the publication, in addition to these new classes the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will also include three new looks for Torent, along with four new types of armour, weapons, and combat techniques.</p>
<p>As to when we will be able to get our hands on this edition of Elden Ring, we are still awaiting a release date. Later this month, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">co-op spin-off Elden Ring Nightreign will make its debut</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> will be released on 30th May across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC. You can check out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-pc-requirements-for-elden-ring-nightreign">PC requirements for Elden Ring Nightreign here</a>.</p>
<p>The studio also has a brand-new title known as The Duskbloods in the pipeline. Announced as part of Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct, The Duskbloods is a PvPvE title with online multiplayer, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">our Matt noting it looked like "Bloodborne meets Sekiro meets Dark Souls, with jetpacks and dinos thrown in"</a>. </p>
<p>Last week, FromSoftware announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">Elden Ring had shipped over 30m copies worldwide</a> since its release three years ago.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
