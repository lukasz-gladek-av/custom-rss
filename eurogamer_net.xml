            <p>
Ubisoft has finally given an update on its plans to add an offline mode into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and The Crew Motorfest, which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">first confirmed back in September 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
This decision was prompted by the acrimonious situation with Ubisoft's original The Crew game, which was shut down and nuked from orbit, removing all players' access and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-states-players-dont-have-unfettered-ownership-of-games-as-the-crew-lawsuit-continues">prompting a still-ongoing legal challenge</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, Ubisoft has said that development is progressing "smoothly" on The Crew 2's offline option - which will ensure the game remains playable if and, let's face it, ultimately when Ubisoft does decide to pull the plug again.
</p>
<p>
The first user tests for The Crew 2's offline mode will begin next week, on 30th April, when a select group of fans will be invited to test the option on PC. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtX3oXj9yng&amp;ab_channel=Ubisoft">video message to fans</a>, producer Grégory Corgié confirmed the mode would roll out fully to all platforms at some point "before the end of 2025".
</p>
<p>
An offline mode for The Crew:  Motorfest, meanwhile, sounds further off - but is still coming.
</p>
<p>
"Regarding The Crew: Motorfest, our teams are currently focused on the live-service, and support for the game for years to come," Corgié said.
</p>
<p>
"But rest assured, The Crew: Motorfest will receive an offline mode. The Crew 2 will be first, allowing players to enjoy and switch between the online and offline mode whenever they want, when we will deploy the version before the end of 2025."
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/privacy-firm-files-ubisoft-legal-complaint-over-data-collection-forced-online-in-single-player-games">privacy firm revealed it had launched a fresh lawsuit against Ubisoft over data collection and forced online in single-player games</a>.
</p>
<p>Last year, one group of modders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">set to work recreating the server-side software needed to play The Crew online once again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hot off the heels of the news she is attached to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">produce a movie based on Sega's OutRun series</a>, Sydney Sweeney is again making headlines for another video game to big screen adaptation.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/">Variety</a>, the Euphoria actress is set to star in the film adaptation of Josef Fares' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. She will also executive produce the upcoming film, which is being directed by Jon M Chu. Chu's previous works include last year's musical hit, Wicked.</p>
<p>Joining Sweeney and Chu on the film are screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, known for Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it has not been decided whether Sweeney will play Mio or Zoe in the Split Fiction film.</p>
<p>It was first revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> earlier this year, when sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>
<p>But, it's not the first Hazelight game reportedly getting a film adaptation. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>. However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>
<p>As for Split Fiction, the co-op caper shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">another million copies in its first week</a> - and now it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">officially record-breaking, too</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
