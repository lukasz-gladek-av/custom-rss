            <p>Call of Duty is coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. That we know for sure. Key Xbox and Activision figures have underlined how important Nintendo's hardware is for the brand moving forward, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">their last comments on the matter</a> happening last year following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a>'s reveal.</p>
<p>The more important question, now, is <em>when</em> that's actually happening. We've heard all sorts of rumblings over the last few months, with insiders and other industry figures pointing to a big release coming at some point in 2026. Now, a datamine (via Reality <a href="https://x.com/realityuk">on X/Twitter</a>) could point to it happening sooner rather than later.</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>

<p>The account has a history of looking through Call of Duty files and the latest updates, and shared this new finding on 11th January. Several lines added with a recent Call of Duty HQ (the dreadful multi-game launcher the series has been using for years now) reference the Nintendo "platform family" and "account type" along consoles and PC platforms that have access to the games already.</p><p>Though the news isn't a shock, it's still good to see work on whatever Call of Duty game is coming first to Nintendo Switch 2 (and maybe the original Switch, too) hasn't stalled. Other live-service hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> have enjoyed a great deal of success there, and with a handful of recent Switch 2 ports raising the bar for ambitious third-party efforts, it's not hard to see Call of Duty finding gold on Nintendo's hybrid console(s), too.</p>
<p>That said, we'd recommend proceeding with caution for now, as the shared datamine also references the Ubisoft Connect platform, which (at least right now) isn't selling the Call of Duty games. Activision's devs could be including those references and tags in the files for whatever reason, and the same could apply to the Nintendo lines. We know that CoD is taking aim at Nintendo straight from the horse's mouth though, so we're just sitting here waiting for the Direct stream that finally confirms what's been in the works for a very long time. Watch this space.</p>

            <p>Pocketpair has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> Official Card Game, which is, yes, an official card game based on the developer's monster catching survival game, Palworld.</p>
<p>It's coming on 30th July in collaboration with Bushiroad, and has been designed as a two-player competitive card game.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As you would expect, Palworld Official Card Game has been created with many of the core ideas which made Palworld so popular on its debut (remember, this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">chap managed to become only the second game to pass two million concurrent Steam players on its release in 2024</a>). Players will be able to "enjoy strategic and tactical battles" in the upcoming card game, and this will be done by deploying Pals.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.palworld-official-cardgame.com/news/post-1">official website</a>, those who take Palworld Official Card Game for a spin will have to fight alongside the Pal companions while also gathering resources and building up their bases. The Pals, meanwhile, will have "unique traits" which will help lead players to victory.</p><p>"Team up with your trusty Pals and experience the thrill of overcoming formidable enemies through this exciting trading card game," the site reads. At the time of writing, the team hasn't yet released any pricing or specific card details, though on the Palworld Discord server, Pocketpair has said to stay tuned for more updates.</p>
<p>You can check out a short teaser for Palworld Official Card Game below.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, Palworld and Pocketpair continue to march along all this time after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-xbox-us-player-numbers-briefly-surpass-fortnite-as-steam-sales-hit-8m-in-six-days">the game's explosive release almost two years ago</a>. Not all headlines have been positive, though, and the developer has been in the midst of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">a legal battle with Nintendo over alleged patent infringement</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, this has actually been leaning in Pocketpair's favour, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-palworld-triumph-over-pokemon-in-lawsuit-japans-rejection-of-nintendo-patent-might-make-things-more-interesting">with a rejection of Nintendo's patent</a> in October throwing a spanner in the works for Nintendo.</p>

            <p>With the first expedition window for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> concluded in December, Embark Studios has revealed that just over a million players opted in to reset their characters in exchange for various rewards. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Having sold over 12m copies according to analyst estimates</a>, that's under 10 percent of all players.</p>
<p>Expeditions, for those unaware, allow players to send off their levelled up character (alongside all the goodies stored in their stash) off on a grand adventure. In return your account gets cosmetics, an XP boost on your next character, expanded stash space, and for those able to gather up to five million credits additional skill points above the cap on their next character. A powerful boon!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/first-expedition-wipe-statistics">In an interview with PCGamesN</a>, design director Virgil Watkins stated that of that roughly one million players, around 35-40 percent of them managed to scrape together the five million credits required for the full spread of skill point boosts during the expedition window.</p>

</figure>
<p>Watkins also shared learnings from the game's first expedition window, stating: "One of the bigger topics [of feedback] was the requirements for the final stage to get the skill points, and probably going out a bit too late with that information, because we wanted to hold off until we could calibrate it around the actual economy of the player base, rather than trying to guess really early on.</p><p>"So then, when we chose the number, which was the five million credits for the full thing, [we set] that as an aspirational goal that some players might achieve. But then I think a lot of players took that as like, 'Well, now I have to do that to get it.'"</p>
<p>With just over a month until the next expedition window, it looks like the next opportunity for a reset will work largely in the same fashion as this initial run, though as PCGamesN points out changes to the final rush for credits can absolutely change. Watkins said that the team is looking at ways to "bring a little more variety" to the system, poring over player data.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders, unlike many other extraction games, have an opt-in reset mechanic rather than a forced progression wipe. As such, those not especially concerned with extra stash space or a few extra skill points don't <em>have</em> to worry about it too much. Given how hard it can be to build up a hoard of loot, one wanders if casual Arc Raiders players will be inclined to cash it all in for such bonuses.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders itself appears to be maintaining momentum going into 2026, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-sure-sounds-keen-to-make-an-arc-raiders-film">with Hollywood seemingly keen to chat about a theatrical adaptation of some sort</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-arc-raiders-cheaper-than-most-triple-a-games-thanks-to-helldivers-2-mostly">its cheaper price point</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">some well-timed holiday discounts</a>, it doesn't appear to be going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
