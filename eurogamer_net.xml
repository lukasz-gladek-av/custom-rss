            <p>
Eternal Strands, the well-received action-RPG from Dragon Age boss Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has shared its latest roadmap, promising - among other things - free DLC created in collaboration with Final Fantasy concept artist Yusuki Mogi and, separately, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a> studio Grasshopper Manufacture.
</p>
<p>
Eternal Strands, if you're in need of a refresher, launched last month, inviting players to follow the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, it borrows bits from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, with a bit of Monster Hunter thrown in - a mix Christian Donlan reckoned made for a "combustible and hilarious sandbox" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-strands-review">four star Eurogamer review</a>.

<p>
And now, with Eternal Strands' first month of release almost behind it, Yellow Brick Games is ready to start discussing its post-launch plans. And that begins with a "Day 30 Patch" coming in March and promising a range of enhancements. There's talk of improved character movement to reduce its "slippery" sensation, for instance, as well as improved combat responsiveness, reduced Umbral Darter presence in certain areas, bug fixes, and more.
</p>
<p>
Then it's onto the fun stuff. Sometime this "spring", Eternal Strands will receive its first free DLC. This'll see Yellow Brick teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and XVI concept artist Yusuke Mogi to design and introduce a new in-game epic, a new armour set, and new weapon skins. Eternal Strands' spring update also promises a new map and magic power, a weapon and armour dying system, Oria's tips and tricks, plus further bug fixes.

<p>
That'll eventually lead into summer, when Eternal Strands' second free DLC update arrives. This is a collaboration with No More Heroes studio Grasshopper Manufacture, and is set to deliver currently unspecified "new content", among other things.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of March's first major patch release, Yellow Brick has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1491410/announcements/detail/506195909797741133">shared developer notes</a> outlining its key changes in more detail. Additionally, the studio is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalStrands/comments/1iuunkp/ama_with_the_devs_feb_27_11am_et/">set to hold an Eternal Strands Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> this Thursday, 27th February at 4pm GMT, where it'll be nattering about everything from the game's lore to the future features and content it has planned.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance has been hit with more layoffs, parent company Krafton has confirmed, amid claims "most of" its developers have lost their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Word of job cuts at Striking Distance began surfacing earlier today as employees took to social media. Former director of concept art Jesse Lee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/">wrote</a> that "most of the devs were laid off", while former cloud devops engineer Seth Spitkoski <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seth-spitkoski-b0316b68_opentowork-activity-7299777905088217091-fDCU/">said "many" had been impacted</a>.
</p>
<p>
Krafton later confirmed layoffs at the studio in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-callisto-protocol-studio-lays-off-more-employees-but-remains-operational/">statement shared with PC Gamer</a>. "Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile," the company wrote, "which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development."
</p>
<p>
"The studio remains operational," the publisher added, "and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time." Krafton did not reveal the reveal the number of staff impacted by its job cuts.
</p>
<p>
Striking Distance was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield in 2019, and the California-based studio would go on to release sci-fi horror game The Callisto Protocol in 2022. However, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">disappointing sales</a>, Schofield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">parted ways with Krafton</a> in 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">32 employees were laid off</a> amid efforts to "realign the studio's priorities".
</p>
<p>
Since then, Striking Distance has released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-gets-a-roguelike-spin-off">roguelike The Callisto Protocol spin-off</a>, titled [REDACTED], but no additional projects have been announced.
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of layoffs at Krafton comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone has seen seen the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, Warner Bros. Games San Diego</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Swords</a> shut their doors, with layoffs confirmed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">Marvel Rivals' US development team</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>.
