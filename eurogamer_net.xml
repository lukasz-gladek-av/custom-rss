            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> (Yoshi-P) intends to work on the game "for at least a good while", even as he works on other projects within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zydl9wAQuc">Noisy Pixel</a> at Pax West, Yoshida discussed what keeps him working on the MMORPG after 12 years, to which he described himself as "more of a businessman" than a creative person.</p>
<p>"People tend to say we're creators or creative, but I am an employee at Square Enix and I receive money to make games," he said, "and I think my primary purpose is to make games so that we are delivering it to gamers out there, fans, players that want to consume our product. I think that is fundamental or a minimum requirement that I have because I belong to this company."</p>

<p>He continued that designers working in a company and feeling bored should remove themselves from a corporate environment, but he doesn't "have that strong personal desire to go into my own creative things".</p>
<p>"So when asked, do I ever get bored with Final Fantasy 14?" Yoshida concluded. "I don't think so, because there are a lot of things that I have yet to actualise in 14, things that I want to do, things that I must do, things that require to be taken care of. And so I think for at least a good while, I should be ok."</p><p>Yoshida added he wishes to do less "management or operational things", joking he may be scolded for his response. "I already do a lot of game developing and I've sacrificed some sleep sometimes," he said, "but perhaps if I were to have a choice, I would like to focus in on the game development design."</p>
<p>Yoshida is best known for his work on Final Fantasy 14, but in recent years has been pulled into other projects. Yoshida heads up Square Enix's Creative Business Unit 3, responsible for the MMORPG as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>: The Ivalice Chronicles. He was also co-producer on Fantasian: Neo Dimension.</p>
<p>In another interview at Pax West, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-naoki-yoshida-wants-players-to-stop-sending-developers-demoralising-abuse">Yoshida requested players stop sending developers demoralising abuse</a>.</p>
<p>"I want to emphasise here, there is a person behind the games," he said. "While I understand some harsh criticism might be necessary sometimes, there's a person behind the games that you enjoy and if you have that harsh criticism, I think we would want to have it be constructive.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has argued mods shouldn't be recognised as "prior art", and therefore are irrelevant to its ongoing lawsuit with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> creator Pocketpair.</p>
<p>As part of its defence against alleged copyright infringement of the Pokémon games, Pocketpair has pointed to mods as an example of prior art that would invalidate Nintendo's patent claims. Specifically, it highlighted the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/690?tab=description">Pocket Souls</a> Pokémon mod for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>, which allows players to capture and battle with enemies in the game.</p>
<p>Now, in a response spotted by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">Game Fray</a>, Nintendo is disputing the defence because it believes mods don't stand on their own as they require an original game to run on. As such, mods shouldn't be subject to patent infringement in the same way Palworld is.</p>

<p>As Game Fray points out, game makers often look to mods for inspiration, so Pocketpair's defence should be valid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/nintendo-reportedly-gets-even-more-obnoxious-about-patent-law-by-taking-a-mods-arent-real-games-stance-against-a-dark-souls-3-mod-that-could-invalidate-its-palworld-lawsuit/">PC Gamer</a> reported Japanese courts have a history of siding with patent lawsuit defendants able to present examples of prior art. That's why Pocketpair is using Pokémon-themed mods as such an example, which Nintendo is now attempting to invalidate.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">Nintendo was granted a patent in the US</a> based on the gameplay mechanic of summoning a sub-character to fight another, which covers whether the summoned character battles on player input or automatically.</p>
<p>Games industry lawyer Richard Hoeg told Eurogamer the patent is "enforceable in so far as it has been granted, but Nintendo likely knows it 'got away with one' here and would prefer not to make a court actually sign off."</p>
<p>Don McGowan, former chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company, meanwhile, believes the patent will likely be ignored.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">Pocketpair has disputed Nintendo's claims</a> as part of the ongoing lawsuit, but has already accommodated changes to Palworld.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">Palworld is also heading towards a 1.0 release</a> next year as it aims to fix "jank".</p>

            <p>Zach Cregger's forthcoming Resident Evil film will be an "entirely original story", so won't feature fan-favourite character Leon Kennedy.</p>
<p>The director of recent horror-hit Weapons spoke with <a href="https://ew.com/resident-evil-movie-entirely-original-story-set-game-world-zach-cregger-exclusive-11812968">Entertainment Weekly</a> about his next film, based on Capcom's game series.</p>
<p>"When you watch it, you'll be like, 'This is very Zach'," he said. "It's just [that] it takes place in the Resident Evil world. I don't think fans of the games are gonna be bummed."</p>
<p>Weapons star Austin Abrams will lead the Resident Evil film cast, with actor and professional wrestler Paul Walter Hauser also confirmed. Cregger has co-written the script with Shay Hatten.</p>
<p>"I'm not gonna steal Leon and put him in an original story. I think that would be presumptuous," said Cregger. "But I respect the games enough where I'm gonna like tell a Resident Evil story in the Resident Evil canon that still leaves everything they love intact from the games, you know what I mean?"</p><p>He added: "I think that when you see it, you'll understand how I can be obsessed with original ideas and still make a movie that is an IP-based thing. I know that doesn't make a lot of sense now, but I hope that it will later."</p>
<p>In a previous interview, Cregger stated the film "lives" in the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 3, but "adheres more to the tone of 4". What's more, the viewing experience will be akin to the journey players take in the game, following a protagonist from A to B "as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into hell".</p>
<p>Cregger's Resident Evil film is set for a release on 18th September 2026.</p>
