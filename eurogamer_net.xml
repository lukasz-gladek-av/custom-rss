            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2 is not being considered by FromSoftware, though the franchise will still continue.</p>
<p>Creator Hidetaki Miyazaki spoke to Japanese outlet <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/1644616.html">Game Watch</a> after this year's PlayStation Awards, for which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree won the grand award.</p>
<p>When asked about the future of Elden Ring, Miyazaki stated the studio is not considering Elden Ring 2, but that doesn't mean the IP won't be developed further.</p>

<p>He added FromSoftware is working on multiple projects, though did not specify if some form of Elden Ring game is one of them.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, shortly after Elden Ring's release, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-described-as-start-of-a-new-franchise-following-enormous-12m-sales-milestone">phenomenal sales</a> were described as "a fantastic start for the new franchise".</p>
<p>However, despite the critical and commercial success of DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, it seems a direct sequel won't be happening.</p>
<p>So what's next for FromSoftware? At present the studio's plans are underwraps, though now-deleted job listings earlier this year included mention of robot characters, leading to speculation of another Armored Core game.</p>
<p>The company's future is uncertain too, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">reports Sony is looking to acquire FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>. That <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">takeover interest was acknowledged by Kadokawa</a>, lending it credence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> raked in over $200m during its first month of launch, according to recent estimates by <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">AppMagic</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-skyrockets-to-200m-in-first-month/">PocketGamer</a>, the mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly £164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>The report added Pokémon TCG Pocket's average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p>

<p>The game saw a boost on 22nd November, when it recorded $8.4m thanks to the start of the Fire Pokémon Mass Outbreak event. A comparatively reserved $2.7m was spent in the game on its first day, 30th October, which remains its lowest level of player spending as its success has soared.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket reached its highest weekly earnings on its third week post launch, with $51.1m. This declined by three percent the following week, to $49.7m.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived at the end of October, and within its first four days reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">earned $12.1m</a>. That number of course soon swelled even more, and Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a> in its first three weeks.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> has begun testing Reward Road, a new in-game scheme to provide additional bonuses when players spend real-world money on virtual items.
</p>
<p>
The reward program is live now to some players in Australia and New Zealand while developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> gathers feedback. So far, players on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h54bog">reddit</a> report that the scheme offers 30 Points for this month's £5 "Eggs-pedition" event ticket. The top reward from the scheme requires 3000 Points, suggesting this will be unlocked when players spend an eye-popping £500.
</p>
<p>
So what are these rewards? Well, for 50 Points (so not quite enough from spending a fiver) you'll get one Premium Battle Pass. That's not terrible, but it's not great either.
</p>
<p>
Hit 750 Points and you'll also have claimed a couple of Incubators, plus a Lucky Egg, a Star Piece, a couple of incense and some stickers. This is all stuff that you could get in-game relatively easily (by winning a Showcase, for example) or purchase in a box with PokéCoins for a lot less than it would cost to hit the 750 Points mark with real-world money.
</p><p>
Reward Road only awards points when you spend cash - not PokéCoins which can be earned for free in-game, and also not if you buy tickets to real-world events like in-person Go Fests, presumably because Niantic uses its own web platform for those. Oh, and your points reset each month, so the race will always be on to spend more every 30 days.
</p>
<p>By the time you've hit 3000 Points, you'll have unlocked around 15 Battle Passes and 16 Incubators, as well as a smattering of other rewards. This might cost you around a tenner normally if buying in an in-game bundle. But is it worth spending more to hit £500? Nowhere close.</p>
<p>
It's hard to see anyone but Pokémon Go's true whales deliberately spending more money per month to unlock these rewards. But perhaps they are the target market here. It'll be interesting to see whether Reward Road is tweaked further and makes it out of testing to a wider release.
</p>
