            <p>
Open world pocket monster survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> will gain a major new update in December, that adds its largest new landmass yet. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld has also announced the game's first big brand crossover, too - a tie-up with hit indie crafting game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>. Exactly what this will entail remains to be seen, but artwork posted to social media this week shows characters from the two games interacting ahead of the crossover happening at some point in 2025.

<p>
Before that, December's content update will add a new island to Palworld, that's "the largest, harshest, and most mysterious new island" yet, according to a social media <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656">post</a> by developer Pocketpair. </p>
<p>For scale, the area will be "about six times more than Sakurajima!!!" the company continued. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld is also currently 25 percent off, presumably in time for Black Friday, and before Nintendo's lawsuit risks the game getting shut down.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>2024 isn't finished yet for Palworld and we have some exciting news about the next update coming VERY SOON...</p><p>But first, we want to tell you about something happening in 2025!</p><p>! ! !

<p>
Of course, all of this is happening while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo readies its legal might to take on Palworld and developer Pocketpair</a> over claims the latter has infringed on a number of gameplay patents. These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">patents include recently-filed designs that cover the throwing of a Pokéball-like object to capture a creature</a>, something that both Pokémon (obviously) and Palworld both contain.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">seeking injunction against Palworld's sale (at least in Japan) plus a fine and damages</a>, Pocketpair itself stated earlier this month. Pocketpair has said repeatedly it will fight the case.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, we highlighted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">new Tencent open world game that looks like it has ripped off both Horizon: Forbidden West and Palworld</a>.

            <p>It is time to dig out the blanket, and curl up with a steaming mug of cocoa (with some added Baileys if you are like me) while enjoying some lovely savings, thanks to the Steam Autumn Sale.</p>
<p>Valve has promised patrons plenty of deals to harvest up, now the days are shorter and the nights are cooler. The sale itself is live now, and will run until 4th December, culminating at 6pm for those of us in the UK.</p>
<p>"You know the drill - thousands of discounts, new Point Shop items featuring the delivery duo, and goodies for completing your Discovery Queue," the dream team that is Steam wrote on social media platform X, kicking off the sale. It also shared a trailer, giving those interested a taste of some of the games included in the sale, which you can see below.</p>

<p>So, as you can see, the sale itself covers a range of genres, with everything from wholesome farming sims like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> to the more violent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> all included.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">Game of the year nominee Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> is currently available to pick up for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2679460/Metaphor_ReFantazio/">£44.99</a>. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">five star Metaphor: ReFantazio review</a> called it "the quintessential Japanese RPG, with Atlus in epic, operatic form".</p>
<p>Another favourite here at Eurogamer, the acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake is also on sale, for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/">£47.99</a>. "Against the odds, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has delivered a remake that both expands Silent Hill 2 in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">five star Silent Hill 2 remake review</a>.</p><p>On the indie side of life, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> is also on sale. It's currently going for £16.79. We called Animal Well an "astonishingly rich Metroidvania" on its release earlier this year, awarding it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-well-review">five out of five stars in Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>
<p>You can see all deals currently on offer in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam Autumn sale here</a>. Happy hunting!</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the news, following last week's report <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-reportedly-reviving-its-divisive-steam-controller-trackpads-now-different-sizes-and-shapes">Valve is working on a new iteration of its Steam Controller</a>, a leak just yesterday has offered what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-image-suggests-valves-rumoured-new-steam-controller-taking-design-cues-from-steam-deck">might well be a first look at its refreshed design</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> development studio Polaris Quest has announced Light of Motiram, an open-world survival crafting game with mechanised animal-like creatures which - no matter which way you shake it and squint - looks remarkably similar to Guerrilla's Horizon series, but with some additional <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> elements thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>"In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses," reads the game's official description.</p>
<p>"Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with Mechanimals."</p>

<p>Light of Motiram itself promises realistic physics-based building, co-op and cross play, precise combat and "epic" fights. But, there is no denying its overall look is incredibly 'Horizon'. One image shows humans in tribal gear using bows and spears to fight off an advancing Tremortusk-like creature.</p>

<p>These similarities have not been missed by the wider gaming community. "I am colossally amused," wrote video games industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1862013988038681065">Serkan Toto</a>. "There is no shame left."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Sony, Tencent and Pocketpair for further comment on today's announcement. Light of Motiram doesn't have a release date yet, but is coming to PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/light-of-motiram-094dff">Epic</a>.

<p>As for Guerrilla, the Sony developer seems to be done with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>, instead now favouring its Horizon series.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, art director Roy Postma said Guerrilla's decision to start working on the Horizon series was a conscious choice by the studio, and one which would see it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">move away from the darker and more violent Killzone games</a> the team was initially known for.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft says its plans to let users buy and play games directly via the Xbox app on Android are being held up by a new legal issue.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Xbox chief Sarah Bond blamed the hold-up on "a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts". 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-will-soon-be-available-to-purchase-in-the-xbox-app-on-android-in-the-us">previously said it would launch the functionality</a> before the end of the month.

<p>
"At Xbox, we want to offer players more choice on how and where they play, including being able to play and buy games directly from the Xbox app," Bond <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bondsarahbond.bsky.social/post/3lbxhvgggek2k">wrote</a>. "I recently shared our ambition to unlock these features first with the Google Play Store on Android devices in the US while other app stores adapt to meet consumer demand.
</p><p>
"Due to a temporary administrative stay recently granted by the courts, we are currently unable to launch these features as planned. Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision. We are eager to launch and give more choice and flexibility to players."
</p>
<p>
The legal issue in question appears to be <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/epic-games-verdict-appeal/">Google's 16th October appeal</a> against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-wins-major-google-lawsuit-further-opening-up-android-phones-to-third-party-stores">changes to Android and its Google Play store ordered as a result of the Google vs Epic Games lawsuit</a>.
</p>
<p>
Epic Games successfully argued that Google operated an illegal monopoly via its smartphone app store. Last month, a judge ruled that Google would now have to allow third-party storefront apps in the US next year other than the Google Play Store, and that Android users be able to pay via alternate means, rather than just Google Play Billing.
</p>
<p>
Google said it would appeal the decision as it appeared to contradict the ruling of Epic's less-successful Apple trial, that because Apple existed it did not have a monopoly, and because the changes would make Android less safe and secure for users.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Google for more.
</p>
<p>Separately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft is also working on its own web-based Xbox mobile game store</a>, which was set to launch in the summer. In August the company stated testing had begun, but it's still unclear when it will properly launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
