            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>'s eighth season will release a "couple of weeks" later than scheduled after Blizzard decided to serve "the game, not the plan".</p>
<p>Writing on social media, general manager of Diablo Rod Fergusson revealed development was taking a little longer than originally anticipated, but did soften the news by teasing "an old 'friend'" was making a return.</p>

<p>"In the spirit of serving the game, not the plan, Season 8 will take a couple of weeks longer to bake than we initially anticipated," Fergusson wrote.</p>
<p>"The team is hard at work on some great updates coming in the next season, so stay tuned. Looking forward to seeing an old 'friend'."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hey everyone - In the spirit of serving the game, not the plan, Season 8 will take a couple of weeks longer to bake than we initially anticipated. The team is hard at work on some great updates coming in the next season, so stay tuned. Looking forward to seeing an old "friend".</p>— Rod Fergusson (@RodFergusson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RodFergusson/status/1895218822615048571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>That "old 'friend'" has got players excited - and speculating. Whilst Fergusson couldn't be drawn on who that friend - or foe, as the case may be - is, fans have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1izvosa/an_update_on_season_8_from_rod/">suggesting</a> all kinds of characters, from to Cain to Covetous Shen to Lyndon. Others posit it could be the return of Lorath, Tyrael, Zoltun Kulle, Eirena, or Kormac.</p>
<p>Right now, it's unclear exactly how long the season will be delayed for, but we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ed reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">Diablo 4's next expansion won't arrive until 2026</a>, marking a change in its annual plans.</p>
<p>Fergusson made the announcement at a DICE panel event, saying: "In 2025, or just before Season 8, we will have a 2025 roadmap for Diablo 4.</p>
<p>"Now, our second expansion won't be on that roadmap, because our second expansion is coming in 2026, but at least players will have the road ahead."</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> CEO Dan Clancy has published an <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/">open letter</a> detailing the company's plans for 2025, including new ways of collaborating, mobile improvements, and more monetisation.</p>
<p>After thanking the streaming community for an "amazing" 2024 - "More than ever, in today’s world, we all want and need to find belonging and connection with other people," said Clancy - the CEO listed new tools and opportunities for streamers, as well as new ways of building connection.</p>
<p>Collaboration is a "core part of Twitch", so following the Stream Together feature added last year, the company is working on shared hype trains and shared sub goals to drive revenue collaboratively. In addition, shared chat will be manageable in the mobile app for IRL streamers.</p>

<p>Speaking of mobile, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitchs-revised-mobile-app-will-arrive-this-summer">Twitch re-launched its mobile app</a> (as announced at TwitchCon Europe), adding a Discovery Feed to find streamers based on recommendations. This year it will continue to revise the app, adding the ability to stream in both landscape and vertical video, and investing in the feed to aid discovery. Clips - short videos of a streamer's best moments - will also be easier to edit.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, Twitch is opening up monetisation for "most" streamers, such as subscriptions and bits. Usually streamers need to reach Affiliate status before monetisation tools kick in, but this year streamers will be able to start earning immediately. Of course, Twitch takes a cut of all monetisation, so it's as much of a benefit to the company as to streamers themselves.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the company is launching a new tool for streamers to let brands know they want to collaborate (sponsored streams are often more lucrative to streamers than subscriptions), and will also launch more promotional events.</p>
<p>Importantly, Twitch is continuing to focus on safety. This month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">Twitch updated its enforcement rules</a>; next it's looking to provide more detail on violations, and will expand moderator tools to make it easier to protect streams.</p>
<p>Lastly, Twitch will expand more of its Guilds (such as the Pride Guild) to a global community and include Ambassadors from around the world.</p>
<p>It's been a quieter start for the year for Twitch compared with 2024. It began last year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">over 500 layoffs</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-isnt-profitable-admits-ceo-in-wake-of-recent-layoffs">Clancy admitted the platform isn't profitable</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-staff-concerned-about-more-layoffs-later-this-year">report later in the year claimed staff were concerned about more layoffs</a> on the way and the future of the platform.</p>
<p>At TwitchCon Europe last year, I spoke with VP of product Jeremy Forrester about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-twitch-safety-growth-and-the-importance-of-finding-community">sustainability of the platform</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
