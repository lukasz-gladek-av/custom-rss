            <p>
July is here in a waft of warmth (your meteorological mileage may vary), meaning a fresh batch of games has arrived for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. And it's a pretty exciting month, with CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> making its service debut, alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> studio Don't Nod's well-received Banishers.
</p>
<p>
That's not everything, obviously, and July brings a total of 10 new games across PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers. Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 15th July (with the exception of Cyberpunk 2077, which arrives a little earlier on 9th July), and you'll find the full list of this month's additions below:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Abiotic Factor (PS5)</li>
<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden | PS5</li>
<li>Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Planet Zoo: Console Edition (PS5)</li>
<li>Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>New World: Aeternum (PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So there you go! Cyberpunk 2077 is obviously the biggie, but there's a bunch of other good stuff too. Planet Zoo's a rock-solid management sim, taking Frontier's usually rather lightweight formula and adding some welcome depth (it's also a treat if you just want to build stuff and stare at the beautifully realised animals), and the sun-kissed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tropico-6">Tropico 6</a> is a fine time for genre fans too. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, which we called a "poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">our four star review</a>. Also worth a look: Abiotic Factor's chaotic co-op survival in the depths of a paranormal research lab, and some similarly frenzied co-op action in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>. As for this month's Premium-exclusive retro titles, there's cult-classic driving mayhem in Twisted Metal 2 and 3, which launched for the original PlayStation in 1996 and 1998 respectively.
</p>
<p>
And that's your lot! As a reminder, the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June (aside from Cyberpunk 2077, which is out today) meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-your-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-june">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention shifts elsewhere. And as for July's Essential tier offerings, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-games-for-july">can read about them here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> team has released a new patch, with those who are part of the Steam Beta getting first dibs.</p>
<p>This patch, known as update 1.2, addresses a number of fixes for areas such as quests, gameplay, and performance. It also adds the ability to customise your difficulty settings even further than before.</p>
<p>"Players can now select from Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Journeyman, Expert, and Master options in the Gameplay menu," the Oblivion Remastered team explained. "We hope the Journeyman setting, specifically, will act as a better bridge between Adept and Expert for players."</p>

<p>In addition to these changes, Oblivion Remastered players who are part of the Steam Beta will also see that map markers should no longer disappear, while those NPCs that started floating about after being knocked down during the Priory of the Nine quest should have stopped doing that now. They really weren't meant to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, helmets should no longer clip into the player character's head, and Snak gra-Bura should no longer be missing those all important facial animations.</p>
<p>Bethesda and co have also addressed a sizable number of other fixes and changes as well as the above. You can check out the <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1942948713220932042">full patch notes for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered update 1.2 here</a>.</p>

<p>Like I have said, the above update will be in the game's Steam Beta. The Oblivion team has laid out how to be a part of the Beta, which you can see below:</p>

<li>Right click on "The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered" and select "Properties"</li>
<li>In the new properties pop-up window, select "Betas"</li>
<li>In the beta drop down to opt into, select "[beta]"</li>
<li>Wait for app to download new build and launch</li>
</ol>
