            <p>A number of would-be customers across the pond in the United States have experienced unexpected <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> cancellations.</p>
<p>Posts on the likes of reddit and social media platform X show several patrons have had their Switch 2 orders cancelled from retailers such as Walmart and Target.</p>

<p>"Just checked because I [saw] a post on X from Wario64 and it was about [making] sure payment is and all is good to go for when they are ready to ship.. I [checked] and my order got cancelled two days ago," reads one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1kylszy/target_canceled_my_order/">reddit post titled Target cancelled my order</a>. According to replies, the original poster is not the only one this has happened to.</p>
<p>Another post - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1kzkboe/did_anyone_elses_switch_2_preorder_get_cancelled/">Did anyone else's Switch 2 preorder get cancelled out of nowhere?</a> - shared on the Walmart subreddit said the same thing. "I just got an email saying it was canceled due to a payment error even though it was the same card I preordered it with," it reads.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://x.com/MechaPaddington/status/1928635220070150169">more examples of these Switch 2 cancellations</a> can be found on X. "Walmart you have failed me for cancelling my switch 2 preorder when my payment method is valid and has funds available, give it back," <a href="https://x.com/Bumbles1593/status/1928607013644165162">one poster wrote over the weekend</a>.</p>
<p>While Walmart and Target seem to be the main retailers in the US to have cancelled Switch 2 orders, <a href="https://x.com/noggin_chomper/status/1929273279459594600">GameStop has also been namechecked online</a>, although the problem doesn't appear to be as widespread.</p> <div>

<p>These reports follow last week's news here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-cancels-some-switch-2-online-pre-orders-a-week-before-launch">which saw retailer GAME admit it had cancelled a number of Switch 2 online pre-orders</a>, with just days to go before the highly anticipated console's release. At this time, GAME said it was aiming to "reinstate as many affected pre-orders as possible".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is set to release later this week, on 5th of June. Eurogamer's former EIC Tom Phillips has already been hands-on with Nintendo's upcoming console. You can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">read his Switch 2 impressions here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new trailer for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> has been released, showing off 20 mini games and 14 tech demos that'll be playable to those who pick the game up alongside their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Games shown include a timed survival game in which you pilot a little space ship and dodge spiked balls, a match-the-tile memory game, a first-person balloon popping game, as well as a driving game that allows you to lean on two tires by tilting the Joycon controller.</p>
<p>As for tech demos, we see a side-by-side comparison between 20fps and 120fps as a football soars across the screen, alongside a model viewer that allows you to quickly swap between different resolutions to see the shift in visual quality firsthand.</p>

<p>Plus, a macarena shaker demo was briefly shown, which looks to let players feel how the motors inside each Joycon feel with different settings. We don't get to see everything in store of course, but we can assume each demo will be dedicated to a specific use case for the fancy new features.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, there's also an in-game quiz that seems to test you on all the new hardware and software features on the console. Who doesn't love homework with their new video game console?</p>
<p>All in all it looks to be a fairly comprehensive overview of the console, giving eager beavers with a shiny new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> a way to familiarise themselves with its new gizmos without having to pour through a big instructions manual.</p>
<p>However, many still wonder why this game is being sold as its own release, rather than it being included alongside the Switch 2 for free like we saw with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astros-playroom">Astro's Playroom</a> on the PS5. The former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">Reggie Fils-Aime referenced the Welcome Tour being sold for $10</a> by speaking about the past, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> was released for free alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/wii">Nintendo Wii</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo itself has defended selling the game rather than bundling it in with the console, stating that the game is being sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">due to the "amount of care and work" put into it</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be released on June 5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">alongside the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It will cost £7.99 here in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
