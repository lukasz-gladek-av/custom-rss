            <p>
A union for UK-based video game developers has launched its first manifesto, with ambitions to improve conditions for its 1500 members.
</p>
<p>
In particular, the Independent Workers of Great Union (IWGB) says it wants to improve job security and the industry's reliance on enforced overtime, often known as crunch.
</p>
<p>
The manifesto launch comes at a time when countless companies are laying off workers, with 900 UK game developers laid off across the country last year. Globally, that number is currently <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">estimated</a> at around 13,000 in 2024 alone.

<p>
Originally founded five years ago, the IWGB says its membership has grown as a result of the layoffs of the past few years, with a spike in membership of 50 percent over the past 12 months. 
</p>
<p>
"The games industry has reached a tipping point," Austin Kelmore, chair of the IWGB Game Workers Branch said. "After another year battling this relentless onslaught of layoffs, workers are realising that things urgently need to change, and are unionising on a scale never seen before. 
</p><p>
"The people who choose to work in the games sector are some of the most passionate, creative, dedicated people you'll ever meet, and studio bosses rely on that passion to exploit us without fair pay, conditions or job security. Together, we can make sure the games industry's future looks very different. Stable work, fair pay, a balanced work schedule - all these are well within reach if we stand together to demand them in unison."
</p>
<p>
The manifesto, <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/manifesto/">which is now available online</a>, lists the following key initiatives. On working hours and overtime, it wants to ensure "no overtime" rules cannot be enforced, and any voluntary overtime is properly compensated. There's also mention of a push to a four-day work week, and a guarantee of mental health days as part of sick leave. 
</p>
<p>
On pay, the manifesto asks that annual increases keep pace with inflation, and compare more favourably to other countries with equal costs of living. There's mention of ending the gender pay gap via submission of data to the Gender Pay Gap service, plus equal parental leave and ownership models or bonus schemes to more equitably share company profits. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, the manifesto calls for transparent pay, particularly for management teams, notice periods for fixed-term contracts, and guarantees for being credited on projects - even if you are no longer at the company. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-not-the-result-of-corporate-greed-and-those-affected-should-drive-an-uber-says-ex-sony-president">Sony's former president suggested games industry layoffs were not the result of corporate greed</a> and anyone affected was free to go "drive an Uber".

            <p>Today is 31st October, which means one thing: It's Halloween!</p>
<p>To honour the occasion, Google has come over all bewitching with a spooky little mini-game to help while away the time before we can shut down our computers and head out trick or treating.</p>
<p>The game itself pops you into the shoes, or paws, of a little witch cat in a space helmet, who needs to ward off a number of creepy evils by drawing spell runes with their wand. This is done with your mouse, and let me tell you, it is all quite engrossing and more than a tad tense.</p>

<p>I gave the game a whirl myself (I want to be thorough with my reporting, it has nothing to do with frivolous fun I promise...) and managed to get to the final level before my hearts were all depleted. My top score was 16000, which was better than Tom's so I can sleep easy tonight knowing I am clearly <strong>The Best Gamer</strong> on the news team.</p>
<p>I do want to finish the final level, however, so I will go back again later to try again.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you want to give the game a go yourself, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?ddllb=1&amp;doodle=306734893&amp;hl=en-GB">you can try it out here</a>. Have fun!</p>

            <p>
Nintendo's leftfield launch this month of Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock, was something of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
Less of a surprise is the fact that enterprising electronics fans are now taking it to pieces, and trying to work out how it... ticks.
</p>
<p>
Alarmo has a relatively robust set of security protocols under the hood, though Wii U reverse engineer GaryOderNichts has gotten far enough to run custom code on the alarm clock via a USB (thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/random-someones-figured-out-how-to-run-custom-code-on-nintendos-alarmo">Nintendo Life</a>) and display... a photo of a cat.

<p>
Getting to this stage looks (relatively) straightforward - there's no taking Alarmo to pieces needed for this. (And indeed, <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">he did previously take Alarmo to pieces</a> to try and make more progress that way.)

<p>
There's no practical use to any of this at the moment, but work by Gary and others is continuing. What games would you like to see working on Alarmo's 2.8-inch LCD screen? With two buttons and a rotational dial, I reckon Tetris might work. And you wouldn't even have to leave bed!

            <p>Toby Fox has assured fans that the next two <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> chapters will be released next year. In fact, the developer is "100 percent" on that.</p>
<p>Deltarune charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World. It's a spiritual successor to retro-style RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, though it takes place in a different setting.</p>
<p>Its first chapter launched as a free download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">towards the end of 2018</a>. A second free instalment then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">arrived in September 2021</a>, and the promise of more to come followed. We are still to actually get our hands on the next chapter, however, but Fox has now shared a small morsel of an update on its arrival.</p>

<p>After sharing a Deltarune image for Halloween on social media platform X, the developer went on to state that he was "very eager" to share what's being worked on.</p>
<p>Fox said chapters three and four would "100 percent come out in 2025". However, the developer couldn't give a more specific time frame right now, due to "localisation and console porting" on the development side of things. In October of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-release-strategy-altered-will-be-available-to-purchase-sooner">Fox said chapter three was "content complete"</a>.</p>
<p>"Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in," Fox's post closed. Well, it is Halloween.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">previous plan</a> was to release chapters three, four and five of Deltarune together, and make the game available to purchase. Last year, however, this plan changed, as Fox said chapter 5 was still a way off.</p>
<p>"And I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything. Especially me," Fox explained at the time.</p>
