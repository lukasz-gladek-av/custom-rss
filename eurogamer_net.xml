            <p>A new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> game has been revealed, which will release exclusively on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p>Katamari Damacy Rolling Live will be the first original game in the series in almost eight years and will arrive on Apple Arcade on 3rd April. Once again, players will need to roll the Katamari to "roll, stick, and grow" and please the King of All Cosmos.</p>
<p>The game promises "unique and whimsical gameplay" and a "captivating soundtrack" as players energise the king's "live stream".</p>

<p>Katamari Damacy Mobile 2 (2012), Tap My Katamari (2016), and Amazing Katamari Damacy (2017) were all released on iOS. They were followed by the remake <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy Reroll</a> on Switch and PC in 2018 (later released on PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia in 2020) as well as its sequel We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie in 2023 across PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The first game in the series, Katamari Damacy, was released in 2004 for the PS2 and was a surprise hit for its quirky gameplay where players roll a ball to collect elements from the world and gradually grow larger.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s next crossover is with Crocs, the ugly clog brand whose socks-and-sandals sense of fashion can now be seen on every high street.
</p>
<p>
Starting tonight, at Fortnite's next shop refresh, you'll be able to snap up a set of classic Crocs for 1000 V-Bucks (£7). These digital shoes can then be worn by most in-game skins, customising their look.
</p>
<p>
Several different pairs of Crocs will be available, and they come with the option to disable their "Jibbitz" - the accessories you can buy and snap into the Crocs' holes.

<p>
Fortnite first began flogging virtual shoes last year, and has so far offered a few dozen Nike and Adidas trainer varieties, as well as a smattering of original designs. (I bought the Meowscles slippers, and know I'm part of the problem.)
</p>
<p>
Would it be funny to see Peely the Banana dressed in Crocs? Possibly. Should you spend £7 of your money on this? I leave that judgement call up to you.

<p>
In other Fortnite news, today's big update sees Black Market backrooms open up with access to Exotic items. The game has also briefly resurrected <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/getaway">The Getaway</a>, its pretty fun heist-themed Limited Time Mode from a few years back that you can play in Duos or Squads in Zero Build or with building enabled.
</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-epic-games-sued-for-deceptive-practices-employed-on-a-massive-scale">Epic Games responded to a newly-proposed class-action lawsuit that alleged it operated Fortnite's in-game store using "the illusion of scarcity" and "FOMO"</a> in regards to its store items. "This complaint contains factual errors and does not reflect how Fortnite operates," Epic Games said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
