            <p>Atari has shared a sneak peek at its upcoming "iconic" handheld console, Gamestation Go.</p>
<p>Whilst the company has given very little in terms of detail, it does reveal the handheld's final look with the accompanying text: "An icon, reimagined".</p>

<p>The teaser shows off the console's button layout, and it all looks very much what you'd expect from a handheld console released in 2025. But it also confirms the system will come with both a paddle and a Trak-Ball, plus a number keypad on the right-hand side.</p>

<p>That's it, though - we don't get a release date or anything else concrete, but with CES 2025 just around the corner commencing 7th January, hopefully we'll discover some of the finer details next week.</p>
<p>On the plus side, we also had a cheeky glimpse of My Arcade, which will hopefully include some Intellivision goodies after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-buys-intellivision-brand-ending-longest-running-console-war">Atari purchased the brand last year</a>, ending what Atari claims to be the "longest-running console war in history".</p>
<p>Atari's home consoles went head-to-head with Mattel's Intellivision in the late 1970s and 1980s, long before Nintendo and Sega competed in the 1990s. Intellivision even enlisted actor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYLly625cXE">George Plimpton for an infamous series of adverts</a> comparing the two consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> studio Arrowhead has shared a number of former pitches, including a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>-style game based within the Helldivers universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/pilestedt/status/1874226763913715938">In a New Year's post on X</a>, Arrowhead CCO and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director, Johan Pilestedt, asked players to share their "expectations and desires for what the next Arrowhead game will be", hinting that he was "working on the high concept" to the studio's next release.</p>

<p>Responding to comments from the community, Pilestedt then opened up about a number of "high concept" pitches previously considered, including the Star Fox-esque game tentatively called "Eagles of Democracy".</p>
<p>"We made a prototype in unreal," Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Yurka_Shaman/status/1874267225554903448">added</a>. "It would basically try to capture Starfox. So arcade... but still simulated.</p>
<p>"The title was 'Eagles of Democracy'."</p>

<p>Pilestedt also shared that the team had previously worked on a concept for a top-down reimagining of the 1990 arcade game, Smash TV, too:</p>
<div>

</span>
</p></div>

<p>"Smash TV is a top-down reimagining of the classic arcade game of 1990," the pitch began which was reportedly written around 12 years ago. "The game pits up to four contestants in a violent game show set in the distant future of 1999. The game focuses on the source inspiration for Smash TV to create a game filled with brutal action, death traps, and gladiator-inspired game shows.</p>
<p>"The game plays homage to 80s action movies such as The Running Man, Total Recall, RoboCop, and Escape from New York, tying everything together with cheesy music, 'cool' visual effects and over-the-top storytelling."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost">Arrowhead recently responded to criticism from players of the high cost of its Killzone 2 crossover</a>, eventually deciding to gift all players the planned second set of the collaboration items for free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-designer-reveals-next-game-and-its-already-got-the-idol-creators-seal-of-approval<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If you, like me, rather enjoyed The Rise of the Golden Idol - a game we called "a compelling modern mystery thriller that's bigger, better and more ambitious than its already brilliant predecessor" - then this news may be right up your alley.</p>
<p>Will Ackermann, one of The Rise of the Golden Idol's game designers, has today unveiled his next game: City of Voices. He's working on it in collaboration with pixel artist Matt Frith through his own studio Kini Games.</p>
<p>Described as a "Golden Idol-like" release, City of Voices takes place in suburban England, and focuses on a young girl who on her first day at secondary school gets bullied. If that wasn't enough to deal with, she is soon "thrust into a fantastical adventure", putting even more on her plate.</p>

<p>Like the Golden Idol games, City of Voices will similarly challenge players to "investigate a series of moments frozen in time, examining clues and solving deduction puzzles to uncover a rich story". However, in a change from the Golden Idol games, players will instead need to answer questions by choosing from a selection of images (see below), rather than dragging and dropping words into place.</p>
<p>If this sounds like City of Voices is still treading <em>a little too closely</em> to the Golden Idol formula, don't worry. Ackermann made sure he got the blessing from their creators before cracking on with his own game.</p>
<p>"I was quite nervous about asking Andrejs and Ernests, who co-created those games, for permission to essentially steal their mechanics," Ackermann admitted, "but luckily, they were flattered!"</p>
<p>Frith added: "Since then, they've both been really supportive, and have even said they 'loved every minute of the demo' we've made, which means so much to us. We hope other players will feel the same way."</p>
<p>There isn't currently a release date for City of Voices, but it is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3342470/City_of_Voices/">Steam</a>. You can check out a trailer for it above.</p>

<p>As for The Rise of the Golden Idol, we awarded it four out of five stars on its release.</p>
<p>"This is a brilliantly plotted thriller story stuffed with an enormous cast of memorable scoundrels, buffoons and quietly tragic onlookers, and it's all backed up by wonderfully devised puzzles that really give your brain a good runaround before you're able to prise open its hard-won secrets," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">Eurogamer's Rise of the Golden Idol review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
