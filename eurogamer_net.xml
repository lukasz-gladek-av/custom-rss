            <p>Crimson Desert, Pearl Abyss' visually impressive action game, will be at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> in Cologne next week, but if you aren't going you can see how it's shaping up in this new gameplay trailer.</p>
<p>In the 13-minute video you get a solid slice of action and exploration, plus a look at the rather splendid visuals. From large-scale fights to boss battles, you'll get a little taste of what Crimson Desert will be offering.</p>
<p>The gameplay jumps in following the protagonist being ambushed by the Drunken Black Bears.</p>

<blockquote><p>FEATURES</p>
<p><strong>Large-Scale Warfare Setting </strong></p>
<p>The video immerses viewers in epic-scale warfare, with countless NPCs battling in real time across every corner of the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>Missions</strong></p>
<p>Kliff undertakes a variety of battlefield missions, from firing cannons to destroying enemy watchtowers and aiding allies in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Traversal Methods </strong></p>
<p>Kliff can call and ride his horse to increase mobility and use the "Crow's Wing" ability to glide across the air in the most efficient route. His skill "Axiom Force" also allows him to not only travel with more maneuverability but to execute strategic maneuvers in combat.</p>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<p>As Kliff advances through missions and the questline, he faces a wide range of combat scenarios, each offering multiple strategies that allow players to adapt and showcase their own combat style. Kliff can strategically use not only his wide array of offensive abilities but also execute well-timed dodges and blocks to gain advantages and switch between multiple weapons.</p>
<p>Kliff's "Axiom Bracelet" enhances attacks with elements of fire, lightning, and ice, with each attribute resulting in different effects on the enemies.</p>
<p>Kliff also uses "Artillery Whistling Arrows" — an arrow that calls in allied forces to take fire on a designated location.</p>
<p><strong>Graphics </strong></p>
<p>Behind the battlefield, magnificent natural environments and terrains, such as rock cliffs and mountain ranges unfold in the background, witnessing the realistic graphics implemented through Pearl Abyss' proprietary "BlackSpace Engine."</p></blockquote>
<p>Crimson Desert was set to release at the end of this year, but recently got pushed into a Q1 2026 release window. We might get more details at Gamescom next week.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> for PlayStation 5 edges closer and closer to its October release date, but if you are finding the wait hard to take then this short but sweet gameplay trailer might ease your suffering.</p>
<p>While this gameplay snippet is only a mere glimpse at just 30 seconds, it does show off the combat you'll be treated to in the full game. As the lead character Atsu dispatches foes on a bridge, you'll see how she can utilise sand to startle and disable foes, and also send enemies to their deaths by pushing them off the edge of high platforms.</p>

<p>Key to this gameplay clip is the Yari spear, one of the many weapons you'll be able to use in the game. As well as being lethal in its own right, the Yari spear can also be used as a way for Atsu to propel herself forwards into enemies.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei from Sucker Punch is set to release exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2. The game follows the 2020 PS4 game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, which went on to release on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>
