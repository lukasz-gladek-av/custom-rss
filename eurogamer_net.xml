            <p>
There've been strong hints a new Tony Hawk project is in the works for some time now, but it looks like an official announcement could finally be looming - based on a sneaky tease that's appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s latest map.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Activision might be looking to revive its dormant skating franchise first emerged last September, when Tony Hawk <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">revealed he'd "been talking to [the publisher] again"</a>. That was followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">pro skateboarder Tyshawn Jones' claims earlier this month</a> that he was "in a Tony Hawk coming out... a new one they're remastering".
</p>
<p>
And it now looks like Activision may finally be readying to make things official. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 02 Reloaded update went live earlier today, introducing a remastered version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-2">Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</a>'s skatepark-themed multiplayer map, Grind.

</a>

<figcaption>And there's a Black Ops 6's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collaboration too.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FeOzkKmOtY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Although the skatepark serves as Grind's focal point, the map also hosts several other notable areas - including a skate-themed store that appears to be teasing some big things. To the rear of the unit hangs a large TV screen showing the date 03.04.25, alongside the unmistakable branding Activision used for 2020's well-received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> 1+2 remake.
</p>
<p>
The obvious inference is that Activision will be announcing its new Tony Hawk project on 4th March this year (or possibly 3rd April, if it's suddenly come over all European). And as to what it'll be revealing, it's hard not to suspect - given the branding and Tyshawn Jones' previous talk of "remastering" - we could be looking at an announcement of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a>+4.

Tony Hawk himself previously revealed a Pro Skater 3+4 remake had been in the works at one point following the success of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2. However, plans were reportedly scuppered when Activision merged developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard, turning it into support studio for the Diablo franchise and other Blizzard games.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Activision is teasing, it doesn't look like we'll have too long to wait before everything is revealed. And in the meantime, there's always Black Ops 6's Season 02 Reloaded update, which - alongside its new Grind map - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-calling-on-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">playing host to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.

            <p>
Developer MachineGames' steady finessing of last year's stellar <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> continues today with the launch a third major update for the acclaimed third-person action-adventure. This time around, there's support for a range of new graphics features on PC - including DLSS 4 - as well as the usually array of bug fixes and more.
</p>
<p>
Starting with those graphics features, there's that DLSS 4 support, giving PC players access to the likes of transformer-based Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and updated versions of DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution - provided their hardware supports them.
</p>
<p>
Update 3 also includes a new option for ray-traced shadows that utilises all light sources within a player's surroundings (as opposed to just the sun) when Path Tracing is enabled. Additionally, Path Tracing is now available on Intel and AMD GPUs, and there's support for AMD 3.1 upscaling and frame generation, as well as Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.

<p>
Away from the PC-specific new features, all platforms get an <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/19eQtJoGEbNeavznlgvNMH/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3">extensive helping of quality of life improvements and bug fixes</a>. Repair kits can, for instance, now be used directly from the inventory, rather than only after selecting a broken weapon or tool.
</p>
<p>
And as for what's next, other than Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's still undated PS5 release, MachineGames says Nvidia RTX hair support is coming in a future update, and it's also looking into adding support for community requested features such as HUD modification.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you've read all this and somehow still don't know what an Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is, allow me to point you toward <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's five star review</a>, which called it a "stealth action tour de force" and a "bold new era for MachineGames". That was before we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">crowned it our Game of 2024</a> too. And finally, Update 3's patch notes (spoilers ahead):

<li>Fixed an issue where the main Sukhothai main map could be lost if you put it down after inspecting it (instead of collecting it)</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where Gina would repeat her lines from the ambush (“That was too close”) while you are in the boat. Please note this will, unfortunately, not correct the issue for players who are currently experiencing the bug, but it will prevent it from happening again</li>
<li>Improvements to combat and stealth music transitions, to make them more seamless</li>
<li>Added sound for heavyweight enemies breaking out of a clinch</li>
<li>Raised the volume of the enemy mounted machineguns in Sukhothai hotel shootout</li>
