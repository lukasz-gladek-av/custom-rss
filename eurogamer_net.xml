            <p>
After last week revealing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">Grand Theft Auto 6's delay to May 2026</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">Rockstar has today released the second trailer</a> for its highly-anticipated open world game. 
</p>
<p>
Much of the new footage focuses on co-protagonist Jason Duval, glimpsed in Rockstar's first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> trailer alongside his partner in crime Lucia. Today's trailer expands on his life, the couple's relationship, and introduces a few more faces from the game's cast. 
</p><p>

Alongside the trailer, Rockstar has also released a brief synopsis of the game's plot: "Set in Vice City, Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida - forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive."

</p><p>
Let's dive in.

<p>The trailer opens with a look at this picturesque seafront area - vastly different to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s Los Santos.</p>
<figure>

<p>
It's here we meet Brian Heder, who Rockstar desrcibes as a "classic drug runner from the golden age of smuggling". He owns the property where Jason's living, rent-free, in exchange for help with his schemes.

<p>
Brian's vaguely upset that Jason is living easy, when he should be off collecting rent from Brian's other, paying tenants. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Jason's line here, "love you, Jason" is the first time his name has actually been confirmed - previously we just knew the name of his partner, Lucia. Jason's name now gets said a bunch more times in the next 30 seconds, just so you definitely know what it is.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Indeed, Jason is shown to be something of a popular guy around these parts. Jason doesn't seem too bothered.

<p>
As you'd expect, rent collection requires a bit of convincing from some folk. Here, Jason slaps a weed store owner and helps himself to the money from the cash register.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
I can hear the GTA 6 mapping enthusiasts scribbling notes from here. We're headed along the freeway with a left turn to Vice City airport and Ambrosia, a location beyond the city fans have suspected may represent Orlando. Straight ahead lies Vice City's Downtown area. To the right is the city's Southside, and then Peacock Bay. Bumper stickers on the car in front read "MyWays" and "#Unbuckled".
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Yep, Jason is definitely buff.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But he also likes beer! His T-shirt here reads Leonida Marine Center, reflecting his former service. The slogan reads "We support all marine life!", while the design sports a cigar-smoking eagle brandishing a gun with each wing. You can also buy lottery tickets for a prize draw declaring "a new billionaire every week!" And finally - note the cat on the right. Cats in GTA 6 confirmed.

<p>
Jason's off somewhere - past cops pushing people around - to the jail we saw Lucia inside during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Grand Theft Auto 6's first trailer</a>. "I'm here for Lucia Caminos," Jason says. "She's supposed to be getting out." The prison guard recognises Jason, establishing that he has visited Lucia often. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
And here Lucia is, GTA 6's other main character. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's safe to say Lucia and Jason have some things to catch up on. 
</p>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>
Is this a flashback, or does Lucia get straight back to work? Masked, we see her threatening two men in suits. Jason is involved too.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"To new beginnings," Jason says, finally cracking open that beer with Lucia. (They're drinking a brand of cerveza named "Dayho".) The pair reminisce at sunset, seemingly remembering an occasion where one of them broke someone's nose. 
</p>

<figure>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Contrast that talk of new beginnings and bright sunset with two nighttime shots of reality. Back at Brian's, Jason helps load something (presumably drugs) onto a small plane. Meanwhile, Lucia sports a fluorescent jacket picking up litter by the side of the road.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Trust me, this place is just a start for us," Lucia tells Jason, who looks unsure. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"Ring the bells!" shouts Cal Hampton, a friend of Jason's, in a seedy-looking bar where the pair do shots. Cut to Lucia, now in a gold sequined dress, at a far more upmarket establishment, showing off her outfit to Jason.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
"If we're doing this, we do it right," says Jason, as we see our characters holding hands, partners in... crime? A new life? Cut to Jason and Lucia, presumably later that night, dancing in a club. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In another scene, Jason and what looks to be new character Dre'quan Priest approach a contact. "Yo D, this fool a Fed?" the contact asks. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It's unclear what happens next, but these gentlemen do not look happy. Is this the easy score that goes wrong? Jason and Lucia are shown escaping from a window, as Brian remarks that their name and address are now known. But by who?
</p>

</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
We're introduced to a cop character, prowling through a building toting a gun. "Us cops, we gotta protect each other," he tells someone in a boiler suit, presumably undercover.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
A succession of quick shots shows, among other things, Jason shoving someone into a car while Lucia fights in a kickboxing match. "You and me Lu, we got this," says Jason. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Cut to a police convoy exploding after someone fires a grenade launcher. It's safe to say they have not got this as much as they expect. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
More quick shots, including someone (Lucia?) wrestling someone else on the open cargo doors of a taxiing plane, a car chase where someone steals an ATM machine that was mentioned in an earlier leak, and various shots of people dancing/showing that Vice City is aptly named. 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
In the trailer's final sequence, Jason sits on the couch watching a commercial for Phil's Ammu-Nation, beer bottles and a fake PS5 in view. Lucia's just home from her litter picking job (her vest sports the letters LDC, presumably Leonida Department of Corrections). 
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar.</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But there's no time to sleep. Jason's on a jetski! A motorboat shooting at a helicopter! A motorbike! 
</p>

<p>
"Hey, if you got friends can you hook me up please?!" shouts Cal - a question hopefully the audience is also now saying of GTA 6, before we're reminded that the game is still over a year away. 
</p>
<figure>

<p>And that's it - what did you think?</p>
<p>
Accompanying the trailer, Rockstar has today also released new information further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-cast-and-locations-revealed-troublesome-rappers-vice-city-and-beyond">detailing GTA 6's large cast of charaters and some of the various regions you'll visit around Vice City and beyond</a>.
