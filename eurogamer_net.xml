            <p>The vibes are rotten out there if you work anywhere near video games. 2026 is yet another year off to a terrible start when it comes to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-laying-off-40-devs-at-studio-working-on-splinter-cell-remake-but-confirms-the-game-is-still-in-production">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">project cancellations</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-closes-acclaimed-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-studio-bluepoint-despite-acknowledging-it-had-delivered-exceptional-experiences-for-the-playstation-community">studio closures that often don't make a lick of sense</a>. Despite all this, though, US consumer spending on video games has gone up year-on-year.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/us-video-game-spending-rose-3-in-january-driven-by-596m-from-subscription-services-us-monthly-charts">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, we've gotten a quick look at Circana's latest data on console and PC content spending during January 2026. The year-on-year rise was of 3% (getting it to $4.3 billion by last month). "This growth was driven by a 23% increase in non-mobile subscription services, generating $596 million in revenue." We'd been hearing for a while that, even after price increases across the board, premium subscription services were driving a lot of growth these days, and the data continues to back those assessments up.</p>
<p>"Hardware spend reached $248 million, up 16% compared to January 2025" despite PS5 (down 17%), Xbox Series X/S (down 27%), and Nintendo Switch (down 79%) all seeing substantial year-on-year declines. It's all explained by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>'s strong launch period and hold despite a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">slower-than-desirable Christmas season</a>. PS5 continued to be leading in the US market, though.</p>
<p>Perhaps more shocking (at least to disgruntled Call of Duty fans and outsiders) is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> has been topping the charts during the January 2026 period. Its initial launch was well below Microsoft and Xbox's high expectations, but we're talking about CoD here, and the IP continues to be <em>the</em> rival to beat in the FPS space. It was followed by NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and Minecraft. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6</a> dropped from No. 3 to No. 5" but continues to perform strongly after its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch">killer launch</a> back in October.</p><p>Other highlights include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> sneaking into the Top 10 (from way down at No. 255!) after the release of its fantastic Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S ports. Shocking few gamers, "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> just made it into the Top 20, rising from No.68 after the second season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-showrunner-teases-ron-perlman-role-in-future-seasons">Prime Video's adaptation</a>." Chances are the modern RPG classic will get another boost after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-and-indiana-jones-switch-2-release-dates-leak-ahead-of-nintendo-direct">Switch 2 port</a> arrives tomorrow, 24th February.</p>

            <p>Microsoft's new gaming CEO Asha Sharma has responded to concerns surrounding her background in AI, as well as her lack of previous gaming-related roles.</p>
<p>Sharma was announced to be taking over from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> following Friday's shock news that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/today-marks-an-exciting-new-chapter-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-retiring-amid-major-leadership-shakeup-that-sees-microsofts-coreai-president-taking-over-roll">Xbox head would be retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years with the company</a>. Sarah Bond, who many had presumed would eventually succeed Spencer, also announced she would be leaving Xbox at this same time.</p>
<p>When word came out that Sharma would be taking over as Xbox's head of gaming, many raised concerns about her background in AI (Sharma was previously Microsoft's president of CoreAI). However, Sharma has now seeked to calm these concerns, stating to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/new-microsoft-gaming-ceo-asha-sharma-xbox-games-ai-1236668829/">Variety</a> she has "no tolerance" for what she classifies as "bad" AI.</p>
<p>"AI has long been part of gaming and will continue to be," Sharma told the publication, stating that industry needs new "growth engines". That said, the new Xbox head added "great stories are created by humans", and not by machines.</p><p>As for her lack of professional roles within the gaming sector specifically, on the announcement of her new position Sharma made "three commitments" to the Xbox community: "Great games", the "return of Xbox", and the "future of play". She has since affirmed that she wants Xbox to tell stories that make people "feel something" when they play, complete with "deep emotional resonance" and a "distinct point of view". Sharma cited Campo Santo's 2016 first-person mystery <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as a game that had this kind of impact on her.</p>
<p>Sharma admitted she had "a lot to learn" in her new role within the gaming industry, however she is committed to "being grounded in what the community is telling" Xbox. "I'm coming into gaming as a platform builder," she said, with her goal to "earn the right to be trusted by players and developers". She will do this by demonstrating "consistency" over time, Sharma added.</p>
<p>We can expect to hear more about what Xbox has in store next month, during the annual GDC conference, Sharma said, before teasing some bigger announcements to come during an Xbox Games Showcase this spring.</p>
<p>For more, over the weekend <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-president-sarah-bond-bids-farewell-to-xbox-staff">Sarah Bond shared her farewell to Xbox staff</a>, where said she will "remain on as a Special Advisor to Asha to help ensure a smooth transition," but stressed, "this is the right time for me to take my next step, both personally and professionally".</p>

            <p>Grok, the generative AI chatbot on X (formerly Twitter), reportedly had an update delay because it wasn't a good enough expert on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. This came from its owner Elon Musk, who apparently was dissatisfied with his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce8gz8g2qnlo">non-consentual nude creating</a>, formerly <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g8r34nxeno">Hitler-praising</a>, tool.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-leadership-style-big-year-grok-ipo-spacex-2026-2">Business Insider</a>, which published a report into xAI following Musk's shift from head of the US Government's Department of Government Efficiency back to his prior role as CEO at various tech-based companies.</p>
<p>Business Insider wrote: "a model release was delayed for several days because Musk was dissatisfied with how the chatbot answered detailed questions about the video game '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>,' according to people familiar with the matter."</p>
<p>Sources also told Business Insider that Musk had requested Grok learning about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> - one of his favourite games - a priority. To achieve this, Musk brought together a group of staff into a "war room", as Business Insider claims he does whenever there's a problem he deems urgent. One of these war room groups was dedicated to getting the impressionable AI chatbot to play perhaps the most toxic game of all time.</p><p>What is the purpose of having an generative AI chatbot play a game for you, who knows? Years ago, before the generative AI boom, <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172612-ai-trained-on-3500-years-of-games-finally-beats-humans-at-dota-2/">one program was able to beat Dota 2 players after training on 3,500 hours of gameplay</a>. So it's not like this idea is particularly novel either.</p>
<p>If you're in the UK, your parliament recently <a href="https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/65027/grok-ai-generation-and-dissemination-of-sexually-explicit-and-nonconsensual-images-of-women-and-children-on-x">discussed the dissemination of sexually explicit and non-consensual images due to Grok's recent behavior</a>. This may lead to expansions of the Online Safety Act, so that it covers the output of AI chat bots.</p>

            <p>It's been a while since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unmade-bioshock-movie-had-two-game-endings-says-director">BioShock movie</a> was revived... only be stuck in limbo again. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">Slow progress is being made on a script</a>, however, and like many suspected, it seems that director Francis Lawrence's busy agenda has been the main thing preventing it from happening.</p>
<p>Since Netflix's take on the cursed project <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-bioshock-movie-announcement/">was announced</a> in February 2022, Lawrence has been busy working on two different Hunger Games prequels, The Long Walk, and even the tentative sequels to I Am Legend and Constantine. Now, via <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">Collider</a>, producer Roy Lee has teased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> <em>could</em> be the filmmaker's next big project after he's done with The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping's post-production later this year.</p>
<p>"We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being The Long Walk and the other being The Hunger Games prequel, which comes out this December. We're just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he's going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it," Lee openly admitted during a chat with Collider's Steve Weintraub. Many cinephiles and video game fans figured this could be the case, especially with the I Am Legend and Constantine sequels being far from locked, but it's reassuring to get a proper update from BioShock's producer.</p>
<p>Netflix and rights-holder Take-Two might also be pushing hard to get the ball rolling on the long-in-the-works adaptation pronto, as the fourth game in the series might get a nice boost after former Gears of War and Diablo head <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">Rod Fergusson joined Cloud Chamber</a> last year to rework and fast-track its troubled development. Fergusson is no stranger to coming in hot to fix and finally release troublesome games, and it seems the powers that be are betting on the game being ready in the coming years, which is why the movie needs to get going soon: "I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game," Lee added.</p><p>After last year's creative shakeup at 2K and Cloud Chamber, we also learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive">a remake of the original BioShock was in development</a> and ultimately binned according to reports. That would've been the perfect thing to release alongside a live-action movie, but now all eyes are on the all-new fourth BioShock... even if we don't know anything about its nature yet.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last week gave us the announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-releasing-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-on-switch-consoles-but-youll-have-to-buy-them-as-they-are-skipping-nintendo-switch-online">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen coming to the Switch</a> systems. This would've been celebrated under normal circumstances, but Nintendo and The Pokémon Company chose to skip the Nintendo Switch Online service in favour of a paid re-release of the original games at £16.99 (or $20) each. A silver lining was mention of support for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-home">Pokémon Home</a> service, but now that's up in the air.</p>
<p>From the get-go, the official return of FireRed and LeafGreen to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary felt a bit barebones. With no new content or graphical upgrades to speak of or online play/trading (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">only local wireless</a>), the only thing that was half-justifying putting down the cash many would rather spend on an indie was the Home functionality, which allows players to freely transfer Pokémon between games, even those of different generations.</p>
<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/">pointed out by fans</a> shortly after the announcement, mentions of such a feature have been scrubbed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">eShop listings</a> for both versions of the game. Maybe that simply wasn't meant to be announced before <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/watch-the-new-pokemon-presents-this-pokemon-day-on-february-27-2026">this week's Pokémon Presents stream</a>, or maybe it's only planned to arrive post-launch and the powers that be aren't ready to fully commit yet in case development hiccups happen. As it stands, a potential Pokémon Home integration would be the only new feature being added to the FireRed and LeafGreen ports, so the information could've broken containment earlier than planned.</p>
<p>In any case, it's worth underlining that, at the time of writing, Pokémon Home isn't officially locked for this re-release of the GBA classics, which are priced at £16.99 each and only include a single language per purchase (pick yours carefully if you're biting the bullet). All this hasn't stopped FireRed and LeafGreen from climbing to the top of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html">eShop's charts</a> ahead of their launch on 27th February though.</p>
