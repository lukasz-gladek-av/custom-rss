            <p>While Neil Druckmann has previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog won't be known as The Last of Us studio forever</a>, the team sure does seem to be making the most of the franchise by churning out different editions of both Part 1 and Part 2.</p>
<p>Now, just days before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-pc-specs-and-features-detailed-as-sony-reiterates-no-psn-account-required">The Last of Us Part 2 makes its PC debut</a>, it's been reported another "PS5 special edition" for the series is on the way.</p>

<p>This comes from the ever-reliable Billbil-kun, although they admit they aren't sure which game in the series it could be. "Could it be for Part 1, Part 2, or something entirely new?" they <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1906684709146366140">mused</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-mysterieuse-edition-physique-dun-jeu-de-naughty-dog-est-en-cours-de-preparation-60078">Dealabs' report</a>, this mysterious special edition is set for a physical release on PlayStation 5. As for pricing, Billbil-kun stated it will retail for €119.99 EUR or $109.99.</p>
<p>"Everything seems to indicate that the officialisation of this edition, as well as the opening of pre-orders, would take place very soon, in a time window that we estimate within two months," Billbil-kun wrote (via Google Translate).</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to PlayStation for further comment.</p>

            <p>Jagex is stepping beyond the realm of MMORPGs with the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>: Dragonwilds - an open world survival crafting game. Best known as the developers behind the long running MMORPG RuneScape 3 and its spin off, Old School RuneScape, Dragonwilds will be mechanically different to these games but is set within the RuneScape universe.</p>
<p>Alone or alongside three players, RuneScape: Dragonwilds will see you venturing to Ashenfall - a forgotten continent on Gielinor (the planet where RuneScape is primarily set), where you'll use magic and level up skills to carve out a life for yourself in the wilds. </p>
<p>Here we find echoes of the MMORPGs, as it wouldn't be a game in the RuneScape universe without skills and the progression system will be on hand to supply you with new skills, crafting recipes and abilities to aid in your survival.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to wield Anima - also known as the living energy of the universe, source of all magic and what the Wilder Gods eat to sustain their eggs. </p>
<p>Outside of what I'm sure you'll agree is very interesting RuneScape lore, Anima has a variety of uses in Dragonwilds, such as summoning axes for instantaneous tree cutting or repairing armor after a tough battle.</p>

<p>Survival won't be easy though. Ashenfall is home to forgotten secrets and legendary RuneScape monsters, which means there be dragons. Where there's dragons you can also reliably find fire, chaos and the increased chance of being eaten. The task of defeating the Dragon Queen is on your shoulders though, so best to get over any fears about the last fact pretty sharpish. </p>
<p> Luckily, there does seem to be some popular RuneScape characters on hand to help (or at least, people who resemble them). Pretty sure I spotted the Wise Old Man wearing his definitely legally acquired party hat…</p>

<p>On the development of RuneScape: Dragonwilds, Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy has said: "From the very beginning, community feedback has been at the heart of RuneScape: Dragonwilds."

Bellamy added closed alpha tests have already been conducted and Jagex will be "listening to player feedback when building the game throughout Early Access". </p>
<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds will launch in Early Access in Spring 2025. Though you can add it to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">Steam wishlist</a> today and, if you'd like to learn more, there will be a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/RSDragonwilds">Twitch livestream</a> covering the game at 5pm (BST) on Tuesday 15th April.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has launched an official <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> 25th anniversary website, ahead of the game's quarter century milestone in July.</p>
<p><a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th">The website</a>, which is in Japanese, says the team is busy "preparing various projects", including merchandise and other collaborations as part of its anniversary celebrations. Some of the already announced Final Fantasy 9 collaborations include a <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5482">picture book</a>, an <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5481">anniversary vinyl</a> and <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th_news/5480">some cute little figurines of both Garnet and Zidane</a> among other collectables.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000793.000002864.html">collaboration with eyeglass brand Zoff</a> has also been announced, and within this release the company notes Final Fantasy 9 has sold 8.9m units worldwide.</p>

<p>But, what of those projects that are yet to be announced? Well, I for one am now very hopeful for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-reportedly-real">that long rumoured remake of</a> - in my humble opinion - one of the best Final Fantasy games yet. My goodness, how I wanted to be Garnet. I hold her and April O'Neil responsible for my love of yellow clothing.</p>
<p>And, I am not alone in hoping that a Final Fantasy 9 remake will soon actually materialise. "I beg you square enix please let there be a remake," <a href="https://x.com/SiKthYEXP/status/1906662931061784939">reads one comment on social media</a>. Plenty of others echo this sentiment, with variations on the begging and praying post found scattershotted in replies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some are now speculating we will hear more about this hypothetical Final Fantasy 9 remake during Nintendo's dedicated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Direct, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">scheduled for this Wednesday</a>.</p>
<p>Well, now I've really got my hopes up…</p> <div>
