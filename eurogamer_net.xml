Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> has announced the sale of its indie-focused publishing label Private Division. Additionally, the company has finally confirmed the closure of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/roll7">Roll7</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a>'s Intercept Games, six months after CEO Strauss Zelnick insisted, "We didn't shutter those studios."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidians-new-rpg-is-being-published-by-take-twos-new-label-private-division">announced the formation of Private Division</a> back in 2017, specifically to publish games from smaller independent teams. Since then, it's released the likes of Obsidian Entertainment's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> and Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked, set up a new development team - Intercept Games - to create a sequel to Kerbal Space Program 2, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-division-buys-olliolli-developer-roll7">acquired Roll7</a>, which later released OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome.
</p>
<p>
However, 2023 brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-confirms-layoffs-reported-to-affect-private-division-and-more">word of layoffs at Private Division</a>, and a flurry of reports this May suggested a major shift in strategy for the label. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-is-working-with-take-two-to-develop-a-brand-game-based-on-a-new-ip">previously announced publishing agreement with Silent Hill 2 Remake developer Bloober Team</a> was cancelled, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">mass layoffs were reported at Roll7 and Intercept Games</a>, as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-laying-off-550-people-weeks-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-to-do-so">five percent reduction in staff</a> company wide, effectively bringing an end to the studios. That's despite CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-claims-publisher-hasnt-shut-down-olliolli-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">later insisting</a>, "We didn't shutter [them]". Shortly after, it was reported Take-Two was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-is-reportedly-set-to-close-roll7-and-intercept-and-sell-off-private-division">looking to sell Private Division</a> amid word only a skeleton crew was left at the label to work on No Rest for the Wicked.

And now, as part of its Q2 2025 earnings report, Take-Two has confirmed the sale of Private Division. "We recently made the strategic decision to sell [the] label to focus our resources on growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term," Zelnick said in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">prepared remarks</a>. "As part of this transaction, the buyer purchased our rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles." However, Take-Two - which hasn't revealed Private Division's buyer - will continue to support No Rest for the Wicked despite the sale.
</p><p>
"The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Zelnick said in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits">separate comments made to GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits." Additionally, a Take-Two spokesperson confirmed that Roll7 and Intercept Games were closed prior to the sale of Private Division.
