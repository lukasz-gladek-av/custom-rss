            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s privacy policy featured a disclaimer indicating users' voices were being used to train AI. This privacy policy, last published this January, has since been quietly updated to remove this clause.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ohpsksibwwtlsfe3n4dp6p2j?ref_src=embed">Spotted by user Cevian on Bluesky</a>, section 1 subsection xviii of the Policy, 'what data we collect and process' prior to the clauses' removal stated: "Where applicable, our services may offer voice-based chat functions that allow users to communicate with others in real time using voice. If you choose to use such features, we may process voice communication data for the purposes described in section 2 and section 13 of this Privacy Policy, including providing communication services, maintaining service security and stability, content moderation, and complying with applicable laws and regulations." This subsection has since been removed entirely</p>
<p>Section 2 of the Privacy Policy, titled 'why we collect and process your personal data' states, among many other uses: "Like many AI-powered experiences, we may use your user-generated input such as chat data to train and improve the model that we use to provide our Services. You can opt-out of model training anytime in your Service-related settings. Opting out will not affect your existing gameplay."</p>
<p>It is worth noting that this was just once clause of Section 2, and other clauses including providing customer support and preventing malicious content to "ensure a harmonious and healthy online environment" are included. This same policy states that users must opt out of model training through service-related settings.</p><p>MiHoYo has been open about its embrace of generative AI in the past. It  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hoyoverse-releases-first-tease-for-new-unreal-engine-5-fantasy-mmo-and-yes-it-uses-ai">released a teaser for an upcoming Unreal Engine 5 MMO project that used generative AI late last year</a>. This game, while largely still a mystery, will feature: "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System", All-Terrain Battle AI, and "Intellectual NPC".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted MiHoYo for comment on exactly what users' voice communication data is being used for, and why the subsection related to the gathering of such data was removed from the Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p>As triple-A releases begin to swarm us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> continues to shine bright as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-sets-huge-steam-concurrent-player-record-taking-a-crown-previously-worn-by-hades-2">one of 2026's most popular indie releases so far</a>. After its massive success, we've already received confirmation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-mewgenics-rolls-out-its-latest-patch-the-creators-have-been-mapping-out-dlc-1-and-theyre-getting-a-little-bit-excited-about-it">a first DLC is in the works</a>, but what about user-made content?</p>
<p>Well, there's been no official announcement yet, but we can be optimistic, as co-developer Tyler Glaiel has been answering questions via X and confirmed modding is on the team's mind:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Eventually. I want to add an official launcher and workshop support. I was originally planning on using the same ones I had for TEIN, but I think that launcher would not be steamdeck verified so it's gonna have to wait a bit for me to have the time to do a new one. Busy with… <a href="https://t.co/KSUYxpIw8c">https://t.co/KSUYxpIw8c</a></p>— Tyler Glaiel (@TylerGlaiel) <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerGlaiel/status/2025723507376836914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>"Eventually" is the key word here. We know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">even the first DLC could take more than a year to arrive</a>, so this isn't a "stay tuned for concrete news in the coming months" situation. We could completely forget about Glaiel and Edmund McMillen's immediate post-launch words, only to be surprised by the arrival of Steam Workshop support a few years from now. These developers took their time with Mewgenics, and there's no reason to believe new content is going to be rushed out.</p>
<p>The official launcher, which could be a first step towards modding support, <em>could</em> happen a bit earlier though, potentially laying the foundations for Workshop integration. Glaiel brings up work done on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-end-is-nigh">The End Is Nigh</a> back in the day as being useful at first, but since they also have Steam Deck verification in mind, an alternative might need to be built from the ground up. He's currently working on language support and more pressing fixes at the moment, so be patient.</p><p>In any case, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">Mewgenics is a massive roguelite, XCOM-inspired game</a> full of possibilities and replayability that you won't be done with anytime soon if you enjoy its central loop, so it's not like we're in a rush to get more content. Let them cook, I say.</p>

            <p>All eyes are on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-3-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-move-to-multiplatform-release">third Final Fantasy 7 Remake entry</a> now, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-still-excellent-on-xbox-and-switch-2-even-if-its-beginning-to-show-its-age">fantastic Xbox and Switch 2 ports</a> of the first game plus a new Steam re-release of the 1997 original, fans haven't been neglected recently. That new OG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">FF7</a> version hasn't landed as well as the powers that be at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> had hoped for though.</p>
<p>After a surprise announcement a few weeks ago, the new Steam version of FF7 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3837340/view/498346952550779352?l=english">arrived on 24th February</a> alongside a first-time launch <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gog.com/post/3mfmnsrfj762m">on GOG</a>. The problem? Midgar veterans are blasting it online, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3837340/FINAL_FANTASY_VII/">Steam reviews</a> are currently "mostly negative" despite new QoL improvements like a 3x speed mode, the ability to turn random battle encounters off, and autosaves.</p>
<p>"The FPS limit has been increased from 15 to 30, doubling the speed of fights and actions but without adapting the animations, so the actions desyncs with the audio," one negative review from a disgruntled player explains. "The filtering for the background looks god awful," another veteran with "over 1400 hours" in the original added. Tech woes are to be expected with each new re-release of a classic, especially when things are touched up, but after the removal of the previous 2013 release (only previous owners can access it now), this could be seen as very worrying and yet another sign of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-asks-for-support-regarding-game-preservation-efforts">how important game preservation is</a>.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/og-final-fantasy-7-re-release-sends-steam-user-review-rating-plummeting-to-mostly-negative">IGN</a>, a quick patch has already dropped to fix the speed in battles and other unspecified bugs. Combat encounters running at twice the intended speed is a huge oversight though, and makes us wonder about Square Enix's QA process when it comes to these small re-releases and updates.</p><p>Regardless, even after the patch, other odd choices and terrible changes remain, such as the removal of resolutions which aren't in the original 4:3 format. Even worse, some players can't get into the game: "Still can't get the game to launch. just crashes on clicking play." The same people are reporting that, meanwhile, the 2013 version they own works fine. At least, it has been added to their libraries at no extra cost.</p>
<p>While angry, some fans are still giving valuable feedback in hopes they can recommend this iteration of the game at a later date: "All backgrounds and FMVs are blurry from whatever upscaling they did... Any SFX that should play rapidly or cut itself off... These need to be fixed for it to be possible to recommend this version."</p>
<p>Looking at Square Enix's actions following the disastrous launch, chances are it'll be in good shape sooner rather than later, but all this mess made us wonder why the 2013 version had to be delisted in the first place and how much money publishers put into some of these awful re-release and remastering efforts. It's not a good look!</p>
