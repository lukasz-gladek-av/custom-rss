            <p>
A little over week after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>'s launch, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> is back with the post-apocalyptic shooter's first patch, promising over 650 fixes for Xbox and PC.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2 recieved a solid critical reception last week, but rare was the review that didn't acknowledge its significant technical issues. "There are many instances where that bugginess still affects quests, gets you killed, or leaves you befuddled," we noted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">our three star review</a>, "and it all hurts the game's natural playability quite badly, even if it is often funny."
</p>
<p>
GSC Game World <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">moved quickly to acknowledged concerns</a>, however, promising a first batch of fixes was on the way. And that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474602?l=english">initial patch is now here</a>, bringing "over 650 fixes, including quest blockers, memory leaks, crashes, and minor bugs."

<p>
There are AI improvements, "approximately 100" crash fixes, audio and sound adjustments, balance changes, as well as a whole sweep of tweaks intended to enhance everything from combat and the open-world experience to character models and cutscenes. GSC's release notes are pretty lengthy, but you'll find the full breakdown below.
</p><p>
Concluding its Patch 1.0.1 announcement, the studio thanked fans for their "feedback, passion, and support", adding that "work on the game and future patches" continues. It also noted it's already tackling A-Life bugs, with those fixes coming at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has, of course, got off to an impressive start despite its technical issues. Earlier this week, GSC Game World revealed the shooter has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">already sold 1m copies</a> - and that figure doesn't including all those players exploring The Zone via Game Pass.
