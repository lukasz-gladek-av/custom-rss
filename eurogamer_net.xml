            <p>Borderlands 4 will dial down the toilet humour compared to the previous game, so don't expect any "skibidi" quotes.</p>
<p>Narrative director Sam Winkler described Borderlands 4 as Gearbox's "most ambitious game yet" and said he's happy to "work with some of the funniest people I know".</p>
<p>A response to Winkler's post asked if, judging by trailers, the game will have darker humour, to which he replied: "Not at liberty to talk much about the content of BL4, but I remain firm in my criticism of BL3's overabundance of toilet humor."</p>
<p>He added, in a further response: "I'm not gonna say there's no toilets but if the word skibidi ships in the game under my watch I'm gonna cry real tears. Paul Tassi joked that we were gonna have a gun called Hawk 2A and a fellow dev asked me if it was real and I wanted to put my hand down the sink grinder."</p>

<p>The Borderlands series isn't exactly serious in its tone, but the third game was criticised for its humour. For some, though, this didn't detract from its shooting mechanics.</p>
<p>Reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Eurogamer Borderlands 3 review</a>: "No, it's not a particularly cerebral experience, but nor is it trying to be; while stuffed with gore and violence and frankly infantile humour, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> is a solid shooter with a meaty 30-ish hour campaign, plentiful - if repetitive - busywork, and a colourful cast of hard-to-forget characters."</p>
<p>At last week's The Game Awards, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">new trailer for Borderlands 4 was shown</a>, which revealed its new planet and four playable vault hunters.</p>
<p>It's looking plenty outlandish, but the lack of poop and fart jokes will make for a more satisfying release once the game launches in 2024.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-made-using-half-life-2-assets-reportedly-in-talks-for-michael-bay-movie">Skibidi Toilet</a> (lucky you), it's a very silly internet animation made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off game Nightreign will feature enemies from Dark Souls, its director has confirmed.</p>
<p>Souls fans certainly spotted some familiar enemies in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">Nightreign's reveal trailer</a> at last week's The Game Awards, most notably The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> who rides atop a dragon firing lightning bolts.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477">Famitsu</a>, director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed that a "small number" of enemies from across the Dark Souls series will appear in Nightreign thanks to the "influence of the Night King".</p>

<p>He added this is to add to the sense of "chaos" that the night brings. It's all part of the parallel universe of Nightreign, which is clearly allowing FromSoftware to nod to its past.</p>
<p>As the Dark Souls social media account teased: "In the Night, ancestral foes await - remnants of a fire that once burned bright."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>And while Ishizaki specifically mentioned only the Dark Souls series, perhaps Bloodborne and Sekiro enemies could make an appearance too.</p>
<p>Indeed, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse">IGN</a> spotted, the trailer includes player characters battling a three-headed creature with an exposed ribcage that appears to be the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls. Further, an official screenshot released by the developer includes a giant spider who could well be The Duke's Dear Freja from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-ii">Dark Souls 2</a>.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption>Is this Freja? | <span>Image credit: <cite>FromSoftware</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Further, fans have likened the playable character the Duchess to Bloodborne's Lady Maria thanks to her quickstep ability, while Wylder's claw shot resembles the grappling hook of Sekiro. This is certainly more speculative, but judging by the increased mobility of the playable characters in Nightreign, there does seem to be some influence from across FromSoftware's previous games.</p>
<p>Ishizaki also described Nightreign to Famitsu as a dense but short game that condenses RPG fundamentals into a single mission.</p>
<p>Communication with others, meanwhile, will be with pins and gestures to continue the "loose connection" with fellow players established in previous Souls games. There won't be PvP this time, though, and there's no invasion method.</p>
<p>Lastly, within the roguelite structure, if players successfully pass all three days of the game's day and night cycle, they will obtain relics for various boosting effects.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also revealed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">new sales total for Elden Ring</a>, which has now sold more copies than the entire Dark Souls series had prior to its release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has been released to finally tackle issues with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> performance.</p>
<p>A new Balanced graphics mode has been added to combine Quality mode settings (and raytracing) with Performance mode resolution, targeting 40fps. It requires a display capable of achieving 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<p>The Performance mode has been adjusted for a more consistent framerate, while raytracing in Quality and Balanced modes will have a less noisy image. Perhaps more damning is the ability to switch off the PS5 Pro's PSSR entirely.</p>

<p>PSSR, or PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, is Sony's AI upscaling technology, but it appears to be causing issues for some developers - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/improvements-to-alan-wake-2s-ps5-pro-patch-still-not-ready">Remedy included</a>. Bloober also appeared to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">issues with it for its Silent Hill 2 remake</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">latest patch</a> is available on PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S and PC. On those other platforms, a couple of minor fixes have been implemented as well as other optimisations.</p>

<p>Ahead of the PS5 Pro's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">Remedy detailed the visual improvements the console would bring</a>, though initially the results were not as expected. With this latest patch, it's hoped the game now runs as intended on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>For more on Sony's more powerful console, Digital Foundry has been testing the machine with multiple games - most recently a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-resident-evil-on-ps5-pro-every-title-tested">how the Resident Evil games run on PS5 Pro</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has stated the company's belief that unique creativity is more important than development costs.</p>
<p>Discussing the rising cost of game development in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106_2e.pdf">investor Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto admitted the company's development expenses have increased each year. "Since our scale of development has grown, a corresponding increase in costs is, in some respects, inevitable," he said.</p>
<p>However, creative and intriguing ideas are most important, a view shared by other members of the Nintendo board.</p>

<p>"We continue refining our products until we are confident that we have created something that our consumers will be satisfied with," said Miyamoto. "With that in mind, what is important is to find ideas that are worth honing, and this has not changed since the era of Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>"Everyone has different interests, so we cannot make sweeping statements about what ideas are worth pursuing. However, one thing we are sure about is that it should be something which has not existed in the past. The more you polish something that has never existed before, the more value it brings."</p>
<p>As a result, Nintendo aims to nurture developers who "take this unique concept to heart", allocate funds as necessary, and release games "only after we are confident in the product".</p>
<p>Miyamoto added it's "possible to create appealing products based on intriguing ideas, without incurring significant costs".</p>
<p>"We believe that not all products require large costs," he continued. "Even in the case of video games, with the current technology it is possible to create fun games with a small number of developers in a short period of time. We believe it is important not to lose sight of this perspective."</p><p>Senior managing executive officer and corporate director Shinya Takahashi commented: "I believe unique titles that are small in scale, but worth polishing can be created by expanding on the ideas of a small number of developers, rather than spending large sums of money on every game. While overall research and development costs are rising, there are certain products for which expenses remain relatively stable, depending on our approach."</p>
<p>Ko Shiota, senior executive officer and corporate director, added the merging of home console and handheld console for the Switch allowed Nintendo to integrate its development environments, which will continue with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Because we are already familiar with Nintendo Switch, maintaining a similar basis for development environments in the future will allow us to carry over the experience we have already built, which should lead to a reduction in research and development costs over time," he said.</p>
<p>The investor question follows high profile and expensive flops from the past year, including the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a> from Warner Bros. and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-initial-development-deal-was-reportedly-200m-though-its-financial-and-human-cost-was-far-higher">cancelled Concord</a> from Sony.</p>
<p>Nintendo, meanwhile, is gearing up for its Switch 2 launch. While reports have suggested its graphics could be comparable to the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S with the ability to run Unreal Engine 5, its specs are likely to be less powerful.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
