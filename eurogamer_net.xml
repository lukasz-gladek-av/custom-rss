<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</a>, the newly remastered edition of developer Revolution Software's classic point-and-click puzzle adventure, finally has a Switch release date following its recent delay, and will launch next Thursday, 7th November.
</p>
<p>
Shadow of the Templars first released in 1996 (a Director's Cut remaster arrived in 2009), charting the adventures of American tourist George Stobbart - later with assistance from photo-journalist Nicole Collard - as he becomes embroiled in a global conspiracy after witnessing a bombing on the streets of Paris, perpetrated by a man dressed as a clown. It deftly weaves historical fact and fiction into a thoroughly engrossing, occasionally thrilling whole that quickly earned it fans, and it's been considered a classic of the point-and-click genre ever since.
</p>
<p>
Revolution Software's Reforged edition of the game launched for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation back in September, introducing a variety of upgrades, including "beautiful" re-drawn 4K backgrounds, re-animated sprites, enhanced audio, and other quality of life improvements. Its Switch release, however, got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-shadow-of-the-templars-reforged-delayed-on-nintendo-switch">last-minute delay</a> in order to "ensure the quality of play remains equally high across all versions of the game".

<p>
Six weeks later, and Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged finally has a release date of 7th November on Switch's eShop, where it'll cost £24.99/€29.99/$29.99. In a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/revolution-software/broken-sword-reforged-collectors-edition/posts/4238562">message shared on Kickstarter</a>, Revolution noted the Switch version will include all fixes and enhancements made to the PC version since launch, with other Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 set to receive them "very soon".
</p><p>
As for what's next, a sixth game in the Broken Sword series, Parzival's Stone, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/broken-sword-parzivals-stone-is-a-new-entry-in-the-classic-point-and-click-adventure-series">announced last year</a>. It sees George and Nico caught up in a terrifying conspiracy featuring Nazi treasure hunters, brutal mediaeval histories, and Quantum Physics, where ruthless technology entrepreneurs, corrupt government agencies, and billion-dollar global energy corporations are battling for possession of a manuscript pointing to the secret location of the mythical thousand-year-old Grail - just perhaps not the one we're used to hearing about. Parzival's Stone was originally due to launch in 2024, but was delayed to an unspecified future point earlier this year.

            <p>
PUBG Studios, the studio behind, yup, PUBG, has unveiled Project ARC, a new 5v5 PvP shooter viewed from a top-down perspective and featuring 'shared real-time line of sight'.
</p>
<p>
Project ARC is officially described a "realistic and fast-paced top-down shooting experience inspired by PUBG: Battlegrounds" that promises "skill-based, thrilling" gunfights - utlising the likes of assault rifles, submachine tunes, shotguns, snipers, grenade launches, and more.
</p>
<p>
Its shooting action is built around what publisher Krafton calls "widely-known bomb mission rules" (and, yes, I had to look that up), with teams either attempting to hack or defend a hidden crypt each game. The hacking team must blow up the walls surrounding the crypt to gain access and install a Decrypter device, while the defending team tries to stop them.

<p>
All this is viewed from a top-down perspective, with Project ARC also touting a shared real-time line of sight. "Modern warfare," explains Krafton, "[is] based on disrupting the enemy's line of sight, securing your view quickly, and attacking before the enemy notices you... Real-time line of sight shared with your teammates... creates immediate, non-verbal cooperation, allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates".
</p>
<p>
Project ARC's characters are all said to have their own preferred weapons and distinctive gadgets, with the latter including grenades, recon drones, grenade launchers, proximity explosives, and throwable items including flashbangs and smoke grenades.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release for Project Arc just yet, or even platforms <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/Project_ARC/">beyond Steam</a>, but you can take a look at its action in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hTTvybcp7o">announcement trailer</a> above.
