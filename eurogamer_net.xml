            <p>Sony says that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on sales.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1854839684054368505">Genki_JPN</a>, Sony president, COO, and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the system was "targeted" at "hardcore users", not casual players.</p>

Sony says the growth in its game and network services division can be attributed to rising sales of its third-party games, DLC, and PlayStation Plus subscriptions.</p>
<p>131.3m games shipped in the first half of the financial year, of which 11.3m were first-party games. 1.5m of those alone come from Astro Bot, which only debuted in September.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has filed a new lawsuit against a streamer who broadcast 10 pirated games ahead of their release, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/789755286/Nintendo-vs-Keighin"> papers filed</a> on Wednesday and reported by<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/476472/nintendo-lawsuit-pirated-games-streamed"> Polygon</a>, Nintendo has taken legal action against streamer Jesse Keighin - streaming as Every Game Guru - who allegedly played 10 unreleased Nintendo games over the last decade.</p>

<p>Nintendo further alleges that as well as broadcasting unreleased games, he also instructed others on how to obtain pirated games via "circumvention devices" Nintendo calls "trafficking".</p>
<p>When Nintendo moved to shutdown Keighin's streams via copyright notices on YouTube, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and other streaming platforms, he reportedly told them he "could do this all day" and had "a thousand burner accounts".</p>
<p>The Japanese megacorp says Keighin's conduct has cost it "millions of dollars" in "lost video game sales". It's seeking £11,600 ($15,000) for each alleged violation of its Copyright Act, £1900 ($2.5K) for each contravention of its anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions in the Copyright Act, and further "actual damages" for the revenue it says it has lost, the amount of which Nintendo says it will "prove at trial".</p><p>"Streaming leaked games prior to their publication normalises and encourages prerelease piracy - Defendant is signalling to viewers that they too should acquire a pirated copy and play the game now, without waiting for its release and without paying for it," Nintendo's lawyers wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>"Prerelease piracy harms law-abiding Nintendo customers who may have been waiting for a particular game release for months or years, and then may see gameplay and spoilers online that ruin their own surprise and delight when experiencing the game."</p>
<p>"We can confirm that we filed a lawsuit against an individual who has engaged and continues to engage in clear infringement of Nintendo’s IP rights, as well as violations of our Game Content Guidelines," Nintendo told Polygon in a subsequent statement.</p>
<p>"Nintendo is passionate about protecting the creative works of game developers and publishers who expend significant time and effort to create experiences that bring smiles to all."</p>
<p>Keighin did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Nintendo is also suing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair. The monster battling and catching game had frequently been compared with Pokémon since its launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in January,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents"> Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit was filed</a> just weeks before<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation"> Palworld's PlayStation 5 version launched at the end of September</a>.</p><p>Yesterday,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says"> Pocketpair revealed that the lawsuit relates to three patents filed between February and July this year</a> - after Palworld's launch. However, they relate to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in December 2021, preceding Palworld's launch, meaning they could indeed still apply to Palworld now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If it's charity speed runs you want, then it's charity speed runs you'll get; Awesome Games Done Quick organisers have announced the annual seven-day event will return in January 2025, and its full speedrun schedule is available to peruse now.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 runs from 5th-12th January next year, featuring over 130 speedruns across its duration. And as per its <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/52">newly released schedule</a>, the line-up is a typically eclectic one, covering everything from triple-A blockbuster titles and indie games to retro classics and other assorted oddities.
</p>
<p>
Proceedings get underway at 4:30pm GMT on Sunday, 5th January, with an introductory pre-amble ahead of an All Parts speedrun of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> on Switch by RayOken. Things then come to a close seven days later with a Map Randomizer Race speedrun of Super Metroid - starring Andy, Eddie, imyt, and Oatsngoats - at 4:10am on Sunday, 12th January.

<p>
Inbetween, there's everything from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine</a> to The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, as well as the traditional Awful Games Done Quick block - which this year kicks off with Superman 64 at 3:24am on Thursday, 9th January, before forging onward with the likes of Golf With Your Grandmother, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing, and the superbly named Doronko Wanko. Also of note is the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a> speedrun on Saturday, 11th January, which will be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sjLtAk3EU">accompanied by a live rock band</a> playing renditions of its in-game tunes.
</p><p>
If you're looking to attend Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 in-person, it's being held at the Wyndham Grand in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the second time in a row, and <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox/FMfcgzQXKDWWRRbtgZMmlScwxxFHLgbX">registration is now open</a>. Of course, if that's too much of an impractical trek, the whole thing is also being streamed online <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">via the Games Done Quick channel on Twitch</a> as it happens.
</p>
<p>
Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 is once again raising money for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, after this year's event amassed £1.9m for the charity back in January. Its sister event, Summer Games Done Quick 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-games-done-quick-2024-raises-19m-taking-its-lifetime-charitable-total-to-40m">raised £1.9m for Doctors Without Borders</a> in July, taking the organisation's lifetime charitable total to over £40m.
