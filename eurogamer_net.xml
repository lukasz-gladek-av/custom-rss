            <p>Now <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is up and running again after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">surprise downtime last weekend</a>, Second Dinner has outlined what US players can expect in their "welcome back packages and compensation".</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement posted to social media, the studio said it could not "thank [players] enough" for their patience and support.</p>

<p>By way of a thank you - and an apology for the unexpected downtime - Second Dinner said it realised "many of you missed out on time-based content, rewards, and missions" during the outage, acknowledging the disruption was "more than just an unfortunate blip", and now the game was back online, it was now ready to make it up to its stateside players.</p>
<p>In recognition that the downtime "impacting" everyone, not just those in the US, Second Dinner also revealed <em>all</em> players will get an "additional bonus" for their support, too.</p> <div>

<p>Interestingly, players will still receive the package even if they kept playing through the outage via a VPN, or, indeed, are non-US players who fancy firing up a VPN just to "try and receive the US downtime package".</p>
<p>Second Dinner <a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/status/1882949189463949462">said</a> it is "still working on" how it'll deliver the rewards, but players should expect them next week.</p>
<p>"Your outpouring of support to all of us at Second Dinner was heard and greatly appreciated. Marvel Snap isn't just our job but it's our passion," the team added. "It's a passion that we share with many of you all around the world. It's not something we take for granted, so thank you again for your dedication, patience, and support."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
