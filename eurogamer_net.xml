Somehow, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth">The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</a> celebrates its tenth anniversary this week, and, to mark the occasion, developer Edmund McMillen has announced the poop-obsessed roguelike's long-awaited online co-op mode is getting its full release on 18th November.
</p>
<p>
Online co-op for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (that's the 2014 remake of McMillen's 2011 original, if you're unfamiliar), was <a href="https://x.com/tyronerodriguez/status/1707522206358761705">initially announced</a> in September last year. Since then, a number of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/3645131352093069363?l=english">beta sessions</a> have been held for owners of Isaac's Repentance expansion.
</p>
<p>
But now, a little over a year since online co-op was confirmed, McMillen has <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">announced</a> the mode will fully launch for everyone on 18th November. It'll support 2-4 players online, with its own completion markers, and arrives for free as part of a "considerable" balance update.

<p>
According to McMillen, this update "heavily focuses on buffing items [players] believe are lacklustre/bad." And while no additional details have been shared as yet, McMillen <em>has</em> posted some old Isaac-related design documents - including ending storyboards, boss designs, and enemy treatments - beneath his <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/1853502568863031303">social media announcement</a>.
</p><p>
But if that's still not enough to get you into the celebratory spirit for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's tenth anniversary, the game and all its expansions are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250900/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Rebirth/">currently discounted on Steam</a> until 11th November. There's 50 percent off the base game, and 41 percent off the Complete Bundle, which you'll need to get if you want the DLC.
</p>
<p>
As for what's next for McMillen, his long-in-the-works <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">cat-breeding roguelike adventure Mewgenics</a> (initially announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/edmund-mcmillen-details-his-upcoming-cat-lady-sim-mew-genics">all the way back in 2013</a>) is expected to arrive next year.

This year's N7 Day - the annual celebration of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> held on 7th November - will be a "quieter" one than usual, developer BioWare has said. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on X, BioWare has told fans that N7 Day 2024 will still host "a little fun", but its attention was currently still focused on last week's big launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. 
</p>
<p>
Past years have seen BioWare release a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mass-effect-teaser-shows-series-will-return-to-milky-way">trailer</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-teaser-image-revealed-and-analysed">concept art</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">audio snippets</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">logos</a> for the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> - now the studio's next project.

Details of Mass Effect 5 remain thin on the ground, though we know it will see a return to the series' home turf of the Milky Way galaxy, and pick up the action several hundred years after the conclusion of the original trilogy.

Dragon Age: The Veilguard, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-off-to-solid-start-on-steam">off to a strong start on Steam</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metacritic-responds-after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-review-bombing">the game has been hit by user review bombing</a>.
</p>
<p>"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. "The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
