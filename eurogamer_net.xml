            <p>Classic FM is launching a new video game music radio series presented by Minecraft YouTuber DanTDM.</p>
<p>Next Level with DanTDM launches on Saturday 11th January at 9pm for an hour, and will run each week until Easter.</p>
<p>The first episode will focus on legendary soundtracks from games such as The Legend of Zelda, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, The Elder Scrolls, and of course Minecraft.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.classicfm.com/music-news/dantdm-next-level-video-game-music-series/">Classic FM</a> has championed video game music for quite some time, with entries in its Hall of Fame from 2012. It then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-fms-video-game-music-show-is-back-for-a-second-series-in-november">launched High Score in 2017</a>, a radio series presented by BAFTA-award-winning composer Jessica Curry, who also co-founded Everybody's Gone to the Rapture studio The Chinese Room.</p>
<p>It seems clear, though, the radio service is aiming for a younger audience with the hiring of Daniel Middleton, aka DanTDM.</p>
<p>The YouTuber has 29 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS5Oz6CHmeoF7vSad0qqXfw">his channel</a>, with more than 20bn views across his online content.</p>
<p>"Teenage me wouldn't be able to believe I have my own radio show!" he said. "Having studied music production at university and then worked in video games for the past 15 years, being given a show that celebrates the meeting of these two worlds feels totally surreal.</p>
<p>"Classic FM is such an iconic station and I'm really grateful and excited to have been given this opportunity."</p> <div>

<p>"Across three months, he will not only showcase the greatest video game music to our loyal listeners, but with Dan at the controls, we're looking forward to welcoming VGM fans to Classic FM for the first time too," added Classic FM managing editor Philip Noyce. "We have always championed new forms of classical music, from film scores to gaming soundtracks, so I'm pleased to announce this next chapter in our support of video game music."</p><p>DanTDM has recently been involved with charity work, <a href="https://x.com/dantdm/status/1859288096098898244">donating gaming carts to Great Ormond Street Hospital</a> for Children. Additionally, he's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV-DiKWne8s">admitted he was invited to see the set of the Minecraft film</a>, with some fans speculating he has some form of cameo.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movies-second-trailer-brings-deep-steve-lore-tree-punching-square-bee">Minecraft film's second trailer</a> released in November, with the full film launching on 4th April this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony's upcoming Until Dawn film adaptation will feature both a new cast of characters and a new story.</p>
<p>This titbit was shared during a presentation at CES by Sony's president of film division Screen Gems Ashley Brucks, who stated that while the film would - clearly - be different in some ways to the original Until Dawn game, it would still respect the series' source material.</p>
<p>"The key to [successfully] adapting these games comes down to one thing: respecting the source material," Brucks said (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-film-adaptation-features-a-new-story-and-cast-of-characters">IGN</a>). "Our close collaboration with PlayStation Productions gives us and our filmmakers the advantage of working directly with the creators of the game."</p>
<p>The Sony exec said it was a "careful balance of trying to identify and incorporate what the fans love about the game and the experience as well as offering something fresh and exciting to entice newcomers".</p>
<p>"In adapting Until Dawn, filmmaker David F. Sandberg, who is a big fan of the widely acclaimed game, took the essence of what makes the game great and selected elements we think are the most important to the fans and paid homage to it in the right way," Brucks continued. "We then built out Until Dawn's universe, using the core premise of a group of friends who encounter a variety of terrifying threats to tell a new story that is truly visceral and horrifying."</p>

<p>Actor Peter Stromare, who is said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-adaptation-sees-peter-stormare-reprise-his-role-as-dr-hill">reprising his role as psychiatrist Dr Hill in Until Dawn's adaptation (so, perhaps there is at least one returning character after all)</a>, added the film will "honour the spirit of the game".</p><p>"I have been lucky to be part of Until Dawn since the original, incredible, super terrifying game, and what's why I'm so excited to be part of this film, because the whole thing is a love letter to horror, and it completely honours the spirit of the game," Stormare said.</p>
<p>"The movie is going to be full of fresh characters and victims in a brand new story loaded with twists, so whether you're a longtime fan or discovering it for the first time, get ready for Until Dawn like you've never seen it before."</p>
<p>The Until Dawn film is set to arrive later this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-horror-until-dawns-live-action-movie-adaptation-arrives-next-april">on 25th April</a>.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, the recently released PS5 remake introduced a new ending for Until Dawn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">which hints towards a sequel</a> (please be aware of story spoilers for Until Dawn if you follow the link).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to a damning report of mental and physical abuse at Indonesian support studio Brandoville.</p>
<p>The studio provided assistance to Ubisoft on the forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, though it closed in August last year, after which reports of abuse emerged.</p>

<p>Yesterday a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horrific-abuse-of-workers-at-indonesian-external-development-studio-revealed-in-new-report">report from People Make Games detailed allegations of abuse by Brandoville commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai</a>, who ran day-to-day operations of the studio.</p>
<p>Before its closure, the studio provided art and animation support for games like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Age of Empires 4.</p>
<p>However, reports allege from 2019 to the studio's closure in 2024, Lai abused multiple employees. This ranged from imposing a strict work schedule and daily Christian worship, to forcing an employee to write lines like a schoolchild, humiliating her in front of colleagues, and demanding a video of her slapping herself a hundred times as punishment.</p>
<p>Other abuse includes controlling the finances of employees and overworking a pregnant employee, whose prematurely born son sadly died after four months in intensive care.</p>
<p>You can watch the full report in the video above, though be aware it contains harrowing content and footage.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has also contacted Age of Empires publisher Microsoft, though a response is yet to be issued.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch next month, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">delay in November</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> have been shown off at the CES 2025 trade show in Las Vegas by accessories manufacturer Genki.
</p>
<p>
French website <a href="https://www.numerama.com/tech/1877968-la-nintendo-switch-2-se-devoile-en-avant-premiere-au-ces-2025.html">Numerama</a> went hands-on with one of these models and was told by Genki representatives that it was based on access to the actual Switch 2, which it expected to launch in April this year.
</p>
<p>
Incredibly, the report states that access to an actual Switch 2 unit via the black market is also now possible, "if you put up the money". 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is still to announce Switch 2, but at this point it feels like there's little left to learn about how the next-generation handheld will look.
</p>
<p>
Still, these latest images - and video, below - of the Switch 2 dummy unit that Genki is showing off give us our best view yet of the hardware.

As we've seen in images of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">multiple previous</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">Switch 2 accessories</a>, and as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">reported separately</a> prior to that, Switch 2 will be a slightly larger version of Nintendo's current hardware, with an additional "C" button on the right Joy-Con, magnetic attachments for the controllers, and an additional USB-C port on the device's top. 
</p>
<p>
Videos shown on Genki's stand, and also now on the company's website, show a highly-detailed look at the new Switch 2 Joy-Con - including its previously-rumoured optical sensor.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for more.
</p>
<p>
Separately, yet another accessories manufacturer has begun advertising its own add-ons via Amazon in Japan. Images of a Switch 2 console cover from third-party company Laziro offer yet another look at what the handheld is expected to look like:

"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense,"  industry analyst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">Serkan Toto told Eurogamer last month</a>. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them."
</p>
<p>Nintendo has itself revealed little about Switch 2. Officially, we only know for certain that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">the console will be announced before 31st March</a>, and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">it will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has kicked off the new year by announcing a second open beta test.</p>
<p>This beta will include the content from the first beta - so Character Creation, Story Trial and the Slay Doshaguma Quest - as well as the chance to hunt down Gypceros, a returning monster for the series. If you took part in the first beta, you can transfer your character to the second beta. This data, Capcom said, can also be transferred to the full game on release, however it stressed the same isn't the case for any game progress made.</p>
<p>Those interested in giving the second open beta a go will be able to do so between 6th February, with things getting going from 7pm Pacific time - that's actually 3am on 7th February, for those of us in the UK. This wave of the beta will run until 9th February, culminating at 6.59pm Pacific (so, 2.59am on 10th February in the UK). Another beta weekend will take place the following weekend running between 13th February and 16th February. Timings remain the same.</p>
<p>The beta is available for those Monster Hunter Wilds' players on PC via Steam, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Those who take part will get some added bonuses in the full game, such as a decorative weapon charm.</p>
<p>"Please note that adjustments including performance, weapon changes, Hitstop, quality of life improvements and more will not be present or reflected in the second Open Beta Test build," Capcom added in a video announcing the beta, which you can see below.</p>

<p>The first Monster Hunter Wilds beta test took place towards the end of last year, and you may recall that while it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">pulled in an impressive number of players</a>, it was a little rough around the edges. Many of those partaking shared screenshots of angular, almost Nintendo 64-looking graphics during the beta's run, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">creatures looking more akin to animated origami rather than the fully fledged monsters</a> they were meant to be.</p><p>However, Capcom has said it has listened to all of the feedback and requests that have come its way since that first beta, and are "working hard to improve the quality of the game for launch" (which is set for 28th February).</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is one of the Eurogamer team's most anticipated games of the year. Want to know our full list?

<p>Total games revenue for 2024 dropped by 4.4 percent to £4.6bn - compared to other media, that's behind video (£5bn) but double music (£2.4bn).</p>

<p>The news comes courtesy of the <a href="https://www.eraltd.org/streaming-and-vinyl-drive-music-to-twenty-year-high">Digital Entertainment and Retail Association</a> (ERA), based on data from Nielsen/GfK, India, and GSD.</p>
<p>Year-on-year, PC downloads dropped by five percent, digital console sales were down 15 percent, and physical games sales plummeted by 35 percent. Mobile and tablet gaming grew by 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason for this is the comparison with 2023, which saw huge physical sales of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>2024's biggest selling game in the UK was, unsurprisingly, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>. It generated 2.9m sales, 80 percent of which were digital.</p>
<p>"After the breakneck growth of recent years, it is no surprise that the games market has slowed down, but it remains a giant," said ERA's CEO Kim Bayley. "Despite the attractions of digital business models to developers, we believe physical still has a role to play."</p>
<p>Despite year-on-year decline between 2023-2024, 2025 is predicted to bring growth to the industry, due to the expected release of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console and Rockstar's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.</p>
