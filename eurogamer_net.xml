            <p>The Project Windless team isn't using gen-AI for "content creation or narrative elements", Krafton has confirmed.</p>
<p>Last night, Krafton announced Project Windless, an open-world PlayStation 5 game based on an acclaimed series of South Korean high fantasy novels known as The Bird That Drinks Tears.</p>
<p>Soon after its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">trailer debuted at last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>, many began to wonder if generative AI had been used during development. So, I decided to go to the source and find out, and while the Project Windless team has used AI "internally during exploratory phases" for efficiency's sake, it is not "a central, player-facing feature" of the upcoming game.</p>
<p>"Krafton's studios operate with a high degree of creative independence, enabling each team to select the tools and methods that best suit their projects," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. </p>
<p>"For Project Windless, the Montreal team is taking a traditional, craftsmanship-driven approach to single-player development. The team primarily uses AI internally during exploratory phases to support iteration and efficiency rather than as a central, player-facing feature of the game. </p>
<p>"Project Windless uses traditional game AI systems to drive NPC behaviour and bring the world and its characters to life beyond combat. These systems govern how characters react, move, and behave in the environment. We are not using generative AI for content creation or narrative elements."</p>
<p>So, there you have it. </p>

<p>You of course don't need me to tell you how much of a hot topic AI is these days, and many studios have said they use the technology during development. Most prominently in recent months, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Larian came under fire when founder Swen Vincke suggested the Divinity team was using gen-AI to develop concept art</a>.</p>
<p>Following backlash to this statement, Vincke said "to ensure there is no room for doubt", Larian had decided to "refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development" for its upcoming game.</p>
<p>"That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Vincke said in January</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A former Wildlight developer has shared their thoughts on Highguard's release after its announcement at The Game Awards last year, stating due to "false assumptions" around its debut trailer, "we were turned into a joke".</p>
<p>Highguard closed out The Game Awards 2025, with a trailer introducing us all to a world of battling Wardens and their magical mounts. The game then launched in January, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">quickly had a large influx of players on its release</a>. However, there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format. The studio sought to address these issues with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguards-latest-update-includes-new-warden-ekon-who-can-ride-himself-yes-really">a number of content updates and patches</a>, while also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-gets-permanent-5v5-mode">making its once-limited-time 5v5 mode a permanent feature</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this effort to regain favour, though, yesterday it was announced that multiple Wildlight developers had been laid off, only a matter of weeks since Highguard made its free-to-play debut. But according to Highguard's former lead technical artist Josh Sobel, the team was doomed from its announcement, and it was "all downhill" after the game's reveal at the The Game Awards.</p>
<p>Writing in a <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2022003361059631301">lengthy post on social media</a>, Sobel said internal feedback on Highguard prior to its reveal "was quite positive", and the team felt confident it had a hit on its hands. Where feedback was negative, Sobel said, "it was constructive, and often actionable". He added those "who played the game, including us, had a blast. And since we were an independent, self-published studio built with royalties in mind, many of us were hoping this could finally be the thing that broke the millennial financial curse".</p><p>But that positivity left after its The Game Awards trailer. "Content creators love to point out the bias in folks who give positive previews after being flown out for an event, but ignore the fact that when their negative-leaning content gets 10x the engagement of the positive, they've got just as much incentive to lean into a disingenuous direction, whether consciously or not," Sobel said. "The hate started immediately."</p>
<p>Sobel soon locked his X profile after Highguard's trailer, stating videos were then made about his "cowardice", with people laughing at him for "being proud" of Highguard. "All of this was very emotionally taxing," he said.</p>
<p>"There is much constructive criticism that can be and has been said about Highguard's trailer, marketing, and launch, but I don’t think it’s my place to commentate on that. I also don't think there’s any way to know whether the launch would have fared better or worse without the massive spotlight that was thrown onto us in response to The Game Awards' trailer placement. But we never got that chance," Sobel continued.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wildlight</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"We were turned into a joke from minute one, largely due to false assumptions about a million-dollar ad placement, which even prominent journalists soon began to state as fact. Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival, and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as 'Concord 2' and '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> 3 died for this'. At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn't even finish the required tutorial."</p><p>Sobel remarked that in online discussions about games like Highguard, Concord and 2XKO, people tend to say developers blame their failures on the gamers. However, Sobel says that is a "silly" notion, as gamers still have the power to inform discourse.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role," Sobel said. "All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering Highguard. And it worked."</p>
<p>There is no denying the sting and hurt in Sobel words, but while he may sound bitter about how things have ultimately panned out, it is undeniably a shame to see a game stumble out of the starting gate. To be clear, Highguard itself has not been shut down, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">with a "core group" of developers still working on it</a>. For how much longer, who can say. But whatever the end result, it is never nice to see a game 'fail', and hear about layoffs across the industry.</p>

</figure>
<p>As for Sobel, he said that "even though this adventure has come to an abrupt and emotionally challenging close" for him, he doesn't "regret one second of it".</p>
<p>Following its rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry also voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating:</p>
<p>"No game is perfect on day one."</p>

            <p>Yesterday was a big day for new video game trailers, courtesy of the Sony State of Play. But a little earlier, away from the limelight, came another lengthy showcase of an especially cool looking game you might have missed.</p>
<p>Screamer, the story-driven arcade racing game, released its career walkthrough gameplay trailer, showcasing roughly 34 minutes of cinematics, racing, and early narrative. This game has JRPG-inspired storytelling, and an opening intro cutscene paired with music from Jpop group WAGAMAMARAKIA. It's just a tease of the full game, but even so it shows some promise I reckon.</p>
<p>This trailer also highlights a variety of different racing teams, all entering the Screamer tournament. With a billion dollars on the line, drift-heavy futuristic racing lies at the heart of this underdog release. You can check out the full trailer yourself below if you fancy.</p>

<p>First revealed in 2024 and recently popping up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">at The Game Awards </a>too, Screamer is a reboot of an old MS-DOS game from all the way back in 1995. This new iteration comes from the same hands at Milestone, albeit with a healthy amount of experience since then. If that developer sounds familiar, it's the same company behind games like MotoGP 25 and Hot Wheels Unleashed: Supercharged.</p>
<p>Screamer is set to launch this year, on the 26th March on PC and consoles. If you're a racing fan, or love a bit of genre-blending in your games, maybe it's one worth keeping an eye on?</p>

            <p>Last night, we got a flurry of PlayStation-flavoured announcements thanks to the most recent State of Play. From the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-biggest-surprise-of-the-night-a-brand-new-aaa-john-wick-game-coming-from-the-developer-of-space-marine-2">gun-fu of Jon Wick</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">the hench chicken man in Project Windless</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-developers-beautiful-neva-gets-new-prologue-and-its-coming-sooner-than-youd-think">the serene colour palette of Neva: Prologue</a>, it was a pretty stacked show.</p>
<p>But, something you may have missed, is that when the next title from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a> developer House House makes its debut later this year, it will be available on PS Plus (the Essential tier) from day one. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Big Walk, as the studio's upcoming game is called, is a cooperative multiplayer adventure all about teamwork and talking.</p>
<p>"Set out with your friends through a wide-open world full of challenges, puzzles, and discoveries. You'll need to work together to find your way around, stay in contact using an assortment of tools and toys, and figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless," reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Away from these adventures, there will still be time "to just hang out" with your friends. Hanging out can include watching the sunset, or if that sounds too serene, you could instead "steal your friend's binoculars and kick them into the ocean". I mean, sure, why not. In the words of House House, "spending time with friends is the best part of a big walk".</p>
<p>You can check out Big Walk's PS5 trailer below. On its release later this year (exact date TBC), Big Walk will also be coming to PC.</p>
