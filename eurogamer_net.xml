            <p>A few details on Hazelight Studios' next game have leaked ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733">Dealabs</a>, we will be seeing a release of the studio's upcoming game - reportedly known as Split Fiction - as soon as 6th March, 2025. The game will reportedly be available on PC and unspecified consoles.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Hazelight (best known for its couch co-op platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>) will share a trailer for Split Fiction this month, likely at The Game Awards next week. The awards are scheduled to take place on 12th December, or for those of us in the UK, at 12.30am on Friday, 13th December.</p>

<p>Hazelight founder Josef Fares shared a tease for the studio's yet-to-actually-be-announced game earlier in the year, with an enigmatic post on social media which promised "a BRAND NEW IP called S*** ******N".</p>
<p>At this time, our own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-developer-teases-next-project-s-n">Matt Wales suggested the game could be called 'Sexy Bassoon'</a>, and to be honest, I am slightly disappointed it is looking less likely that this is its name. Anyway, not much longer until we find out more about what Hazelight has been cooking up since It Takes Two.</p>

<p>Back in October, Hazelight announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marital-platformer-it-takes-two-sales-pass-20m">It Takes Two has now sold a rather impressive 20m copies</a> since its release in 2021. This meant the game had sold a further 4m copies since March of this year, when the developer announced the game had sold 16m.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft is continuing its talks with Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> over a possible buyout deal that would take the Assassin's Creed maker  private, a new report states.
</p>
<p>
The move - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">first mooted last month</a> - would see Ubisoft take back control of its company from shareholders. Today, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/">Reuters</a> reported that Ubisoft is seeking a deal which would see its French founders, the Guillemot family, retain control.
</p>
<p>
However, the same report states that Tencent - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.

<p>
Talks remain ongoing between the two companies on how to move forward. Ubisoft stock spiked 14 percent today as a result of the report.
</p>
<p>
"We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders" a spokesperson for Ubisoft told Eurogamer today. "In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options."
</p>
<p>The buyout talks come after a particularly rocky year for Ubisoft, which has suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, staff walkouts, and disappointing sales of key titles. </p>
<p>Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delayed its biggest upcoming launch Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until 14th February 2025, after seeing "softer than expected" sales for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the company announced the closure of several studios, with the loss of 277 employees, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulls the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
