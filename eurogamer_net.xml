            <p>Nintendo has shared fresh details on its next entry in the Mario Kart series.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game was first teased back in January</a>, during the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">Switch 2</a> console announcement. At this time, though, Nintendo kept details pretty slim. Sure, we had some fun speculating about what was shown in that very brief clip, with fans pointing out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">Donkey Kong had a new look</a>, there were 24 places on the starting line and what also appeared to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-9-fan-speculation-points-to-fuel-tank-gameplay">suggestion players will need to conserve fuel while navigating the chaos that is Mario Kart racing</a>. But, actual concrete details from Nintendo itself, well, there really wasn't much.</p>
<p>That has all changed today, though, thanks to Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct. Rather than just being a little teaser to round out a different teaser, today's presentation gave us a full-fat look at what is now officially called Mario Kart World.</p>

<p>Along with returning faces such as Mario, Luigi, Toad and Peach, this upcoming game will also include chaning weather, and - rather excitingly - the ability to drive basically anywhere. There will also be grinding, and wall running (of sorts, you are still in a vehicle).
</p>
<p>As for the courses, there is a healthy dose of all new raceways, and the abilty to just roam about. As for that roaming, the trailer showed jet skis and snowmobiles for getting around on. Also, mistake me if I am wrong, but was Peach on a bike in a dress?
</p>
<p>Mario Kart will release on the same day as Nintendo Switch 2, but I guess that date will come later.</p>
<p>
A dedicated Mario Kart World Direct is also coming on 17th April, at 2pm UK.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> has shared a few thoughts about modding ahead of The Last of Us Part 2's PC debut.</p>
<p>As we all know, PC gamers love a mod or two. Often within moments of a PC release, we are soon being met with the likes of Shrek and Thomas the Tank Engine taking centre stage, be it in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baby-chris-lady-x-and-dante-lead-the-early-days-of-resident-evil-village-modding">horror flavoured series like Resident Evil</a> or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-thomas-the-tank-engine-starfield-mod-gave-me-quite-a-freight">space bound Starfield</a>.</p>
<p>But, what do developers think of mods in their games? Well, in the case of The Last of Us Part 2 Remaster’s game director Matthew Gallant, he is all for them and appreciates mods can make an experience more "comfortable" for players. Additionally, he understands that with games, unlike with films or books, "there's kind of like a gradient of authorship within the medium".</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/04/01/naughty-dog-and-nixxes-on-the-pc-port-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii-we-take-the">GameInformer</a>, Gallant said The Last of Us Part 2's PC release will open up "the game in a way that wasn't previously possible".  He added it will be "an interesting journey to see what players do with the game now that it's kind of on this very, open-ended ecosystem" which means Naughty Dog will have "a lot less control" over it.</p>
<p>"But I feel like, in general, where we're at is wanting to meet players where they are. We’re interested to see what players modify in the game. And, I think, [Naughty Dog head of techTravis McIntosh] said this in an earlier interview - sometimes that's a clue to us to say, 'Oh, we should have thought of that. Oh, that's an interesting option,' that sort of thing," Gallant said.</p>
<p>"But that's maybe the kind of the balance between, like, 'Yes, we're very, concerned about creating a player experience'. You coming along with a story. And we really want to tell you that story in the best way possible. But we're okay if telling that story in the best way possible means you're tweaking a bunch of things to make it the right experience for you."</p>
<p>The developer said simply, if players need to make some changes that allow them "to have a good, comfortable time", then the team supports them.</p>
<p>When further asked if this frame of mind would still apply if players decided to turn The Last of Us Part 2's Ellie into Shrek, Gallant said the team just enjoys seeing the community engage with titles "in whatever way that expresses themselves in terms of funny edits or whatever is going to open up this game on PC". So, if that means Shrek Ellie, I guess that means Shrek Ellie.</p>
<p>"I think part of what's interesting with games as a medium is that we actually don't have total complete authorship in the way that someone writing a book or directing a movie – there's kind of like a gradient of authorship within the medium," the game director explained.</p>
<p>"Games are pretty extreme, where the player [brings] a lot of themselves to the experience and how they play and the experience they have where they choose to go, completes the story that's told through the medium of video games. I'm maybe stretching the metaphor a little bit here, but that's kind of where my head goes to people taking any of our games and appreciating it or engaging with it in some way that maybe to us is strange, or to us is, maybe we wouldn't want to do that… We're just thrilled the players love these games or want to engage with them at the end of the day."</p>

            <p>Today's the day. This afternoon, Nintendo will air a Switch 2 dedicated Direct broadcast from which we expect a release date and price for the new console, as well as a look at some of its upcoming games. And as ever, we'll be watching, reporting and reacting to the broadcast live, as it happens, right here.</p>
<p>Set your Alarmo clocks for 2pm BST / 3pm CEST / 9am EDT / 6am PDT. The show is expected to be an hour long.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo, remember, has already unveiled the form factor of Switch 2</a>, which surprise surprise, looks a lot like the existing Switch, only bigger. Lurking within, though, are significant changes, such as Joy-Con that magnetically snap to the side of the machine, USB-C ports, a mysterious C button, rumoured mouse-like Joy-Con functionality, and, of course, more powerful innards. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-switch-2s-reveal-what-have-we-learned-about-its-performance-potential">as Digital Foundry noted, while forensically picking over the Switch 2 details</a>, we're still not sure exactly how powerful it is. Questions remain. Will they be answered today?</p>
<p>The previous reveal also gave us a glimpse of a new Mario Kart game, which notably teased the possibility of 24-player races. Will we see more of that game today? And what of Nintendo's other first-party games for Switch 2 - are there any, and if there are, which ones will they be? Big, legacy franchises, or smaller things? I also wonder what kind of third-party support Nintendo has attracted for Switch 2.</p>
<p>But the biggest questions are of course price and release date. How soon will the console come out? There's a widely held belief Switch 2 is imminent, though the console's public hands-on tour runs until June. Is that when it will finally arrive? And how much will it cost? There's talk of a $400 price point, which puts it $100 above what Switch 1 launched at, and talk of $70 games. But will these figures be born out?</p>
<p>There's lots to discover, and we'll be building up to the reveal throughout the day here. Excited?</p><figure>

Super Mario Party Jamboree is aboslutely not the game anyone wanted to see on Switch 2, but it does at least show off some of the new system features. As an update that costs money, I'm not sure.

      <p>Super Mario Party Jamboree upgraded for Switch 2</p>
    <p>
We're hearing about the games we'll be able to play. The first are the new ones, the second are enhanced, the third are the compatible ones. Some Switch games will get upgrades. We're seeing the upgraded edition of Mario Party now.
</p>
<p>
New features are coming including mouse controls, audio recognition, more "expressive" rumble, and gameplay that uses the camera accessory (if you buy it).
</p>
<p>There'll be three new modes. Mario Party mod, which works with a single camera and it'll let you see each other's faces as you play. Or you can do that online (you'll need your own camera).</p>
<p>The next mode is Bowser Live where you have to play mini-games like punch blocks and balance things on your head. Full body movement-related.</p>
<p>Then there's a Carnival Coaster rollercoaster game that uses mouse controls to have you shoot enemies while you feel the bumps of the coaster. Then you start bouldering when you enter a tunnel, for some reason.</p>
<p>It launches 24th July.</p></div>

We also hear that Switch 2 will support backwards compatibility, as we know.
</p>
<p>
Now we're going to see a new game.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour. It's a kind of virtual space that shows you how to use the console? That's what it seems like.
</p>
<p>The game has a golf mini-game that uses the mouse controls and lets you shake maracas and scrape paint off of objects.</p>
<p>It'll be a paid digital download available on day one.</p></div>

The Switch 2 screen not being OLED is kind of expected, but with 1080p, HDR and 120Hz that's a decent upgrade over the standard Switch screen. I'm happy enough, although I expect those of you coming from the OLED Switch might find the transition a little rough.

      <p>The dock now has a fan and 4K res support</p>
    <p>
More tech specs: there's a stand. There's a USB-C port on the top and bottom of the device. 
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 comes with 256GB internal storage - eight times that of Switch 1.
</p>
<p>
Reading and writing data is also faster. 
</p>
<p>
The Switch 2 dock has up to 4K resolution for some compatible games. HDR is also supported in TV mode.
</p>
<p>
The dock has a built-in fan to keep the machine cool - it's a chunkier dock as a result.

      <p>That screen is LCD and supports 120fps</p>
    <p>
Now we're taking a closer look at the hardware itself.
</p>
<p>
It's got a bigger screen but it's the same thickness- we already knew this. It's got approx doubles the pixels Switch does on its 1080p screen. The screen supports up to 120fps. It's an LCD screen and it has HDR support.
</p>
<p>
The new Joy-Con connect magnetically, as we knew. There's a release button to release them. The SL/SR buttons are bigger, so you don't have to shrink your fingers. The control sticks are larger.
</p>
<p>
Mouse controls! Each Joy-Con can be used as a mouse in compatible games. 
</p>
<p>
The speakers are improved, and there's a built-in mic, as we know.

</p>
<p>
It'll only work with compatible games and it's planned to work on several, although there's going to be a free update to enable it on 51 games, Nintendo says.

You'll need a Switch Online membership to use GameChat. The Switch 2 Camera, incidentally, will launch on the same day as Switch 2.

So the C button takes us back to online gaming from about 20 years ago when people could talk to each other, but the Switch 2 does have a magical microphone that doesn't allow the noise of a blender to come through over your voice. Looks a bit like a MS Teams work call, but with cool people who can be crudely cut out and superimposed over the gameplay. It really is like a work meeting!

In the chat panel, you also see a stream of other people's gameplay, in a low frame and resolution mode, which seems a bit confusing to me, but it's a nice touch.

GameChat. That's what it does? 
</p>
<p>
It - get this - allows you to communicate with people during the game. Incredible.
</p>
<p>
The mic is on the top of the console and even when docked it picks you up, apparently. Nintendo says it'll even work when someone is vacuuming around you. I'd like to see that.
</p>
<p>
I imagine the C button is the chat button then - it opens these features.

The Nintendo team leading the charge on Switch 2 is here to tell us about it.
</p>
<p>
It's exclusively a Switch 2 title. Wow it's got a huge world map. A kind of globe.
</p>
<p>
There are times of day and weather conditions that will change the race experience.
</p>
<p>
You can go off the race track and drive virtually anywhere in the world, Nintendo says.

You'll drive to the next course as part of the traditional competitions. And there's mention of 24-player races. It sounds a bit like Forza Horizon? 
</p>
<p>
There's a Knockout Tour where you race across the world in one non-stop competition. If you're below the placement marker when you reach a checkpoint, you'll be knocked out. 
</p>
<p>
There's a free roam mode where you can explore new areas and routes... for some reason. You can just go for scenic drives with friends.

      <p>"One more thing" tease</p>
    <p>The "one more thing" reveal to end a showcase is a great way to end a show on a high, especially when very little has leaked beforehand. If Nintendo was to do something like this to cap off its Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, what would make sense? Probably not a game coming this year, but something not too far off. The next major Zelda game would be brilliant, but that's perhaps asking too much. Animal Crossing, perhaps? A new Luigi's Mansion?</p>
<p>Or maybe they'll casually drop a new trailer for GTA 6 and the internet will explode.</p>

      <p>Wow moment</p>
    <p>The only game we can more or less guarantee seeing at the Switch 2 Direct later today is the new Mario Kart, but is that likely to wow people? It's possible, Mario Kart 8 looked great, but I'd be surprised if it turned heads like Breath of the Wild did. So, if there is to be a wow moment, what game will cause it?</p>
<p>An impressive port of a current-gen game would do wonders to sell people on what the Switch 2 is capable of, but would Cyberpunk 2077 make you spill your coffee? Would Assassin's Creed Shadows cause you to spit tea all over your monitor (hopefully not if you're at work)? What game would surprise and delight you if it appeared during the Direct?</p>

      <p>Surprise us</p>
    <p>
I watched the Switch 2 reveal with a slight tinge of disappointment because I had hoped - even in the face of all the pragmatism - that Nintendo would surprise us. But the Switch 2 form factor, beyond a mysterious button and probable mouse-like controller usage, did not.
</p>
<p>
Thats fine, of course - slightly disappointing but fine - because it allows games to now come and do the talking, for Nintendo to show us that the creativity it's famed for still crackles through the halls of this celebrated game maker. Toy maker.
</p>
<p>
What I don't want to see today, then, is a reliance on iterative franchise updates. That's what the hardware is: iterative. I want to see new ideas. I want to see Nintendo reaffirm itself as the company thinking beyond the boundaries of gaming that we're used to, taking apart the concept of play and rethinking it.
</p>
<p>
And yes I understand that Mario Kart 9 won't necessarily be that - though I'm still holding out hope for some reinvention there - but there's plenty of space for something else to surprise us. Please, Nintendo, surprise us.

      <p>Will Switch 2 enhance original Switch games?</p>
    <p>If the Switch 2 does anything to improve original Switch games, there are a few I'd love to see enhanced. BotW and TotK both stand out as games that I'd love to play at 60FPS at a decent resolution on my TV, but who knows if this level of upgrade is possible - well, Nintendo knows, and will hopefully tell us later.</p>
<p>I have a soft spot for Yoshi's Crafted World, which is super soft looking and would benefit from a res boost. But, my biggest wish is that Bayonetta 3 is spruced up as it feels like a game struggling to shine on the OG Switch. What are your hopes?</p>

      <p>Lots of Ninten-dough</p>
    <p>There's lots of speculation about the price of the Switch 2, but whatever it comes in at we're looking at a chunky spend for day one buyers. If we make some reasonable guesses for the prices of the hardware and games, well, it won't be a good day for the credit card:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switch 2 console: £400</li>
<li>Switch 2 Joy-Con Pair: £65</li>
<li>Switch 2 game: £60</li>
<li>512GB Micro SD Card: £40</li>
</ul>
<p>The console, a second set of Joy-Con, memory card, and two games would be £625. Ouch!</p>

      <p>Joy-Contentment?</p>
    <p>Nintendo loves a new colour Joy-Con almost as much as it loves making money (maybe the two are linked?). At the OG Switch launch buyers had to choose between the sleek grey or the more fun blue and red. It's hard to believe Nintendo won't launch a whole range of different colours for its Switch 2 Joy-Con range, but I wouldn't be overly surprised to see day one buyers limited to the black we've seen shown off already. They are starkly un-kiddy, which would make sense given early adopters are likely to be kids only at heart, not age. Still, I'd expect some red ones for Mario, green for Pikmin, and blue-ish for Zelda(?) at some point.</p>

  </time></p><p>Another great point: Nintendo's Switch 2 does face more competition than the Switch 1 did, with the likes of the Steam Deck and Asus' Rog Ally being out there, and the prospect of whatever <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-2025-gaming-handheld-teased-in-new-trailer">the Xbox handheld</a> will be. It's a busier market now.</p>

Some great questions cropping up in the comments. Will legacy games get a boost if played on Switch 2? Back compatibility is a feature here, remember. Also, what are the chances of a new 3D Mario being teased today, or more? As Tom pointed out in his comment, Switch 1's first year brought us Odyssey - what will Switch 2's first year bring? And where on Nintendo's list of priorities is a new Animal Crossing, as Will rightly wonders?
</p>
<p>A new generation does tend to be a great time to introduce new IP, as well, as we saw Nintendo do with Arms on Switch 1 and Splatoon on Wii U. Is there a new franchise waiting in the wings for Switch 2?</p>

      <p>The missing Link?</p>
    <p>There's always excitement around a new console, but there's something extra special about a Nintendo console reveal because you can't help but expect something a little different. I'm sure we'll hear something about the system offering something we didn't expect (or at least already know about), but I'm most interested in finding out what games Nintendo has planned.</p>
<p>The original Switch had a brilliant first year, notably launching with the possible game of that decade, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. We also got Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Arms. My concern is that Switch 2 won't be able to better that, mainly because there won't be a new Zelda any time soon (barring a monumental surprise). Will the new Mario Kart be able to carry online discussion like Zelda did? We'll see.</p>

      <p>The mysterious "C" button</p>
    <p>
Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-final-switch-2-tease-shows-mysterious-c-button">Nintendo has lifted the lid slightly on the mysterious "C" button on the Switch 2</a>. A new video posted on the Nintendo Today app shows it being pressed and sounding a little jingle and then... Well, that's as much as we were allowed to see. Could it be a shortcut button to capture gameplay, or to get to social features on the console, and what might they be if there?

      <p>Good morning</p>
    <p>
Good morning! Are you feeling aflutter with excitement? The time is nearly here. I suppose more to the point: will you be immediately pre-ordering one if, as Rogueywon points out, the opportunity immediately opens following the Direct?
