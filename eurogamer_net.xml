            <p>
Relic Entertainment, the studio behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/company-of-heroes">Company of Heroes</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>, has outlined its future plans as an independent studio - including a greater focus on smaller titles and older games - following its separation from Sega last year.
</p>
<p>
Relic was founded in 1997, and become known for its work in the real-time strategy genre as the years went on. In 2013, the studio was acquired by Sega - but the companies last year announced they would be parting ways, with Relic becoming independent once more.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Relic has undergone a period of downsizing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-sega-studio-relic-hit-by-fresh-layoffs-following-sale">laying off 41 staff</a> last year (a move that followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-lays-off-121-employees-at-company-of-heroes-studio-relic-entertainment">major round of redundancies</a> in 2023), but now the studio has reemerged to discuss its future plans, announcing a "bold" vision that'll see it focusing on three key areas.

<p>
Part of the studio's new strategy will see it 'actively pursuing' the development of "smaller-scope, in-house games" alongside the larger, more complex strategy titles it's known for - all in order to "explore new genres and gameplay experiences".
</p>
<p>
It also intends 're-imagine classics', through the likes of re-releases, remasters, and "brand-new franchise experiences that capture the spirit of the originals while appealing to a new generation of players." That's alongside Relic's third focus: a "deepening commitment" to and "robust support" for its existing titles, starting with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
The studio has already announced a new update and new DLC for Company of Heroes 3, both launching this month. Fire &amp; Steel, as the DLC is known, promises four new Battlegroups for multiplayer and co-op/skirmish vs. AI. There's the Heavy Weapons Battlegroup (US Forces), Terror Battlegroup (Wehrmacht), Canadian Shock Battlegroup (British Forces), and Panzerj√§ger Kommand Battlegroup (Afrikakorps), with more to be revealed closer to release.
