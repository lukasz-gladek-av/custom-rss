            <p>Here we are again. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> is clambering out of his cryochamber for another Lord of the Rings-length showcase, in which new games will be announced, people will be given awards, and there'll probably be a lot of adverts. It's The Game Awards 2024 and you can't miss it. Or, well, you can - you can go to bed but don't do that. Don't leave us on our own.</p>
<p>The show begins tonight at 12.30am GMT, and there's going to be a 30-minute preshow followed by a main show of indeterminate length. These things normally run quite long so be warned - I wouldn't expect to be going to bed much before 2.30am, if not 3am. But don't worry, that's why we're here. We'll be keeping you up to date with everything as it happens, just in case you nod off for a bit.</p>
<p>You can either watch The Game Awards 2024 video stream here, embedded in the article, or pop it on the TV and wake everyone else in your house up.</p>
<p>So: what are we expecting to happen tonight? Some pretty exciting things, actually. The Last of Us maker <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> is expected to unveil its big new thing, which I believe is a new IP, and CD Projekt Red is rumoured to be taking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> to the show. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-twos-josef-fares-extremely-confident-about-next-project-stating-its-impossible-not-to-be-cocky-when-you-have-a-game-like-this">Josef Fares is already in full Josef Fares mode about his new game</a>, which is being unveiled tonight, and Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country are on the slate for tonight, too.</p><p>There is the actual awards part of the Awards as well, for which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> lead the nominees. Can Balatro beat its blockbuster brethren to get Game of the Year? We will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>See you later on?</p><figure>

            <p>The anonymous solo developer behind hit poker roguelike Balatro said there's a part of him that regrets the game's success, as he misses when creating games was just a hobby.</p>
<p>LocalThunk, as he's known, wishes to remain anonymous even with the enormous success of the game - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">mobile release alone has reportedly made almost $4.4m</a>.</p>
<p>When asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">GQ</a> if he regrets Balatro's success, he replied: "Honestly, yeah. Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways. I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p>

<p>The developer said he treated game creation as a hobby, but the success of Balatro had brought him a huge amount of attention. He even admitted he could retire after this game alone and just make games for fun.</p>
<p>"This last year has been by far the most stressful year of my life," LocalThunk said. "These days I try and think about, what will get me back to where I was when I was making this - when it was relaxing as a hobby. I want to return there."</p><p>He continued: "If I were to make another game after Balatro, which I'm not really thinking about right now, it would be really cathartic to make it and not show anyone. Put it in a folder on my desktop and leave it there. Just for me."</p>
<p>Still, LocalThunk said he planned to continue updating the game in 2025 and had "a lot of fun ideas for directions" to take Balatro, more than just one update's worth, though he doesn't know how many he'll be able to implement.</p>
<p>More jokers are definite though, as he hasn't added any since the game's release.</p>
<p>Balatro is nominated for the big award at tonight's The Game Awards. It's even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">part of the latest Cyberpunk 2077 update</a> as a secret quest in collaboration with CD Projekt Red.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Payday developer and publisher Starbreeze has officially sanctioned Notoriety, a popular heist shooter in Roblox, that previously existed as a Payday-inspired fan game.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/21532277/Notoriety-A-PAYDAY-Experience-READ-DESC#!/about">Notoriety</a> will now be relaunched within Roblox as Notoriety: A Payday Experience and feature "authentic Payday assets, characters and heists". 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what the terms of this deal involve for both Starbreeze and Notoriety's development teams, though Notoriety is a hugely popular - and lucrative - Roblox experience, with more than 227m visits and 1.3m favourites from players on the platform.
</p>
<p>
"Notoriety was born out of a love for heist games, with Payday serving as a key source of inspiration," Notoriety developer Evan Pickett said in a Starbreeze press release today. "This official licensing partnership allows us to stay true to our vision while incorporating elements that fans of both Notoriety and Payday will recognise and enjoy."

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
For its part, Starbreeze said it "deeply admire[s] the skill, passion, and creativity that Evan has poured into crafting Notoriety" and that licensing Payday out opened up the Payday universe to "a fresh perspective". Hey, 227m visits means a lot of eyes on the Payday franchise. 
</p><p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> launched back in October 2023 and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-gets-new-creative-leads-as-player-numbers-still-dwarfed-by-decade-old-predecessor">struggled to capture the same level of interest as its decade-old predecessor</a>. Various <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3s-second-operation-medic-bag-patch-is-now-available">game updates have followed</a> to try and turn things around, though the project's commercial failure has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starbreeze-ceo-tobias-sjogren-ousted-by-board-following-payday-3-flop">Starbreeze's CEO ousted</a>, its previous game director step down, and one employee describe its launch as "disastrous". 
</p>
<p>
"The whole stage just collapsed and everyone left," Starbreeze community head Almir Listo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/payday-3-developer-likens-launch-to-being-a-rock-band-when-the-whole-stage-collapses-and-everyone-leaves">said back in October</a>. "The game just felt unfinished. It was a bad experience for our players."
