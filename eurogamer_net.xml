            <p>
It's been six long years <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-gets-surprise-sequel-for-switch-and-pc">since Hollow Knight sequel Silksong was confirmed to be in development</a>, and fans - starved of much in the way of news - have managed to reach such a frenzy of anticipation in that time, it's a wonder the whole thing didn't end in mass spontaneous combustion. Some of the pressure was thankfully released last month when developer Team Cherry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">finally confirmed a 2025 launch window</a>, but an exact release date remains elusive. What we <em>do</em> now know, however, is Silksong's set to be playable at an Australian museum this September, suggesting it'll either release before, after, or during that time.
</p>
<p>
Silksong is more specifically due to appear at Australia's national museum of screen culture (ACMI) as part of its upcoming <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/">Game Worlds exhibition</a>, running from 18th September 2025 to 8th February next year. The exhibition focuses on 30 video games - including the seminal likes of The Sims and World of Warcraft - and "charts technical and design innovation to uncover what makes these virtual worlds feel alive." And in among that number is Silksong, which has earned its place in the line-up partly for the sheer magnitude of anticipation surrounding its release and partly to celebrate its homegrown origins, given Team Cherry is based in Adelaide.
</p>
<p>
"Since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s initial announcement in 2019, it has been one of the most anticipated indie games on the planet," Game World co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell wrote in a statement announcing the news, "and we are thrilled to celebrate the design of this South Australian-made game as a centrepiece of Game Worlds in September."

<p>
"From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet's different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game's most challenging boss fights - and of course, having the game playable in-gallery - our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We're so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"
</p>
<p>
It is, of course, tempting to try and divine a narrower Silksong release window from this fresh morsal of news, but that ultimately feels like a fruitless endeavour. ACMI's announcement makes no suggestion Silksong's playable Game Worlds appearance is in any way a first, so there's every chance it'll get a general release ahead of its museum debut. On the other hand, it doesn't say it's <em>not</em> a first, so the opposite might also be true? All we know for certain is Silksong comes Switch, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and PC later this year, with an Xbox and PlayStation release to follow.

            <p>
Somehow we've made it to May already, and with the month of maypoles, mayflies, mayflowers, and mayonnaise upon us, it means there's fresh batch of Prime Gaming offerings for members to enjoy - which this time includes a smattering of Star Wars, Nazi-pummelling in Wolfenstein 2, orifice-clenching horror in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/amnesia-rebirth">Amnesia: Rebirth</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
As is tradition, Prime Gaming's May titles arrive across four scheduled content drops, and Amazon's first batch of games is available to claim right now. It's here we get a little May the Fourth, with Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga and Lego Star Wars — The Complete Saga, both in the initial line-up. That's alongside some old-school goblin stealth in Styx: Master of Shadow and a bit of satirical stock trading simulation in The Invisible Hand.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the days pass and May goes from fresh-faced to increasingly wrinkled, Prime Gaming subscribers can look forward to the likes of MachineGames' very excellent alternate history shooter Wolfenstein 2, Amplitude's stellar fantasy 4X Endless Legend (which arrives in its all-encompassing Definitive Edition form), horror maestro Frictional Games' Algeria-set Amnesia: Rebirth, and wonderfully oddball 90s internet simulator Hypnospace Outlaw. Plus, we get more dark fantasy action in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blood-omen-legacy-kain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a> 2 and some classic stealth with Thief 2.
