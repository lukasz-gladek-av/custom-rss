            <p>
After a year on sale, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is finally close to recouping the money Remedy spent on developing and marketing the game.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's latest <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf">financial results</a>, published today, note the critically-acclaimed Alan Wake 2 is still to "generate royalties", but had now "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses". 
</p>
<p>
The long-awaited sequel has struggled to sell in big numbers since its launch this time last year. The past month has seen Remedy move on from its development, following the launch of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-review">second and final expansion The Lake House</a>, and the release of the game's physical deluxe edition.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Eurogamer Let's Play: Alan Wake 2!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGs1FX3V_vE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
More generally, Remedy said its development costs for the past quarter had increased due to higher development fees for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1&amp;2. Royalties decreased, meanwhile, as sales largely consisted of the aging Control and original Alan Wake.
</p>
<p>
In the long-term, Remedy said it was still committed to growing both Control and Alan Wake brands as "a key part of our future", with Control in particular set to be expanded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">recently-unveiled spin-off FBC: Firebreak</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Remedy's first full multiplayer project is set to launch as a "mid-priced game" in 2025, though will also be offered as part of both Xbox and PC Game Pass, as well as PlayStation Plus. 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what's next for Alan Wake, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Alan Wake 2's Lake House expansion provided what looks to be an intriguing tease for where Control 2's story is headed</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-drops-steam-deck-support-in-bid-to-tackle-impactful-exploits-and-cheats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Electronic Arts has blocked Steam Deck players from its cooperative shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Stating that "the openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers", EA has determined that making its game available on the Linux system - such as Apex Legends - is "a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats."</p>
<p>Developer Respawn said it was left with no choice given there is "no reliable way" to differentiate between legitimate Steam Deck players and "a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck".</p>

<p>"We're sharing today that Linux (and Steam Deck using Linux) will no longer be able to access Apex Legends," <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">said</a> community manager, Mako.</p>
<p>"Our dev team wanted to provide a bit more context into this and share some of the decision-making process that happened along the way. As mentioned in our prior <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/anti-cheat-update-082124">anti-cheat dev blog</a>, competitive integrity is a top priority for our team and there are many ways in which we're battling cheaters - this is one to add to the list.</p><p>"In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game."</p>
<p>"We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of playersâ€™ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Steam storefront for Repawn's free-to-play battle royale, which used to be deemed "playable", now states in no uncertain terms that Steam Deck compatibility is "unsupported". Respawn insists this decision will not impact Apex players on Steam PC.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if any further competitive game makers follow suit.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors earlier this week during the company's quarterly earnings call. Asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends, Wilson said the battle royale is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community", suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-2-not-on-the-cards-right-now-ea-ceo-says">it may be a while yet until we see Apex Legends 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-an-early-mass-effect-easter-egg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Early on in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, BioWare offers a knowing nod to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, its other beloved role-playing game series, via a cheeky line of dialogue.
</p>
<p>
If you're yet to start playing, there's nothing particularly spoilery below - but fair warning if you'd rather encounter the Easter egg for yourself. 
</p>
<p>
You always need someone good at tinkering with tech on your team, it seems - and in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, that's elven engineer Bellara. So, when it comes to sorting out a misfiring Eluvian mirror, she's your girl.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
I spotted that chatting to Belara while she's attempting to repair the Eluvian continued to provide several lines of extra dialogue, and ultimately resulted in her offering up a catchphrase made famous by Mass Effect's immortal sidekick Garrus Vakarian. 
</p>
<p>
"Sorry Rook," Belara can be heard to say, "I'm just in the middle of some calibrations."
</p>
<p>
Garrus' insistence he be left alone to focus on his gun calibrations in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a> became something of a meme, as players continually checked in with the character in the hopes of hearing new banter, only to have the same dialogue about needing to do more calibrations pop up over and over. 
</p>
<p>
Other Dragon Age: The Veilguard players have spotted the Easter egg too - here's a quick recording:

</span></p><p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">new Mass Effect game</a> is still very much on the agenda from BioWare, though is likely still several years away.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has debuted to a peak of 70,414 concurrent players on Steam, setting a new record for a single-player game published by EA.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's long-awaited new Dragon Age installment unlocked last night, and now sits atop the Steam top sellers chart - ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> (though notably this is also available via Game Pass).
</p>
<p>
EA's previous record for a Steam launch was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which debuted to a slightly-smaller peak of 67,855 concurrent players back in April 2023.

<p>
Comparing The Veilguard's Steam performance with past Dragon Age games is more difficult, however. Inquisition, originally released via EA's own PC storefront in 2014, only arrived on Steam much later. As it stands, though, The Veilguard is the franchise's biggest launch on Steam thus far.
</p>
<p>
The biggest story on Steam right now is likely the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">launch of Monster Hunter Wild's open beta</a>, which has hit a peak of 463,798 concurrent players.
</p>
<p>
Steam user reviews for The Veilguard are currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/">Mostly Positive</a>, meanwhile.

Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-a-return-to-what-made-bioware-great-ea-head-says">EA said it had high hopes for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> after it received a positive critical response - and because it has a relatively clear run at the rest of 2024 (especially now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed</a>).

            <p>Despite a PlayStation blog earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">suggested Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater would drop in 2024</a>, Konami still hasn't put a definite release date against the highly-anticipated remake.</p>
<p>According to Konami's half-yearly financial results, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is still listed as "TBD", alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, Silent Hill Townfall, and a couple of games only releasing in Japan.</p>

<p>It's not that publisher Konami is simply refraining from detailing the release dates of games coming in 2025, either - other titles on the list such as Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection have generic "2025" or "Feb 2025" dates appended. It's just Snake Eater and the Silent Hill games that have no hint of a street date at all.</p><p>If you were hoping for a little more information about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>'s financial performance, that too is sadly missing from the <a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/meeting/2024/en1031_4xpuc2.pdf">presentation</a>. For now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">all we know is that it sold over a million copies in just three days</a>.</p>
<p>Konami says the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>: Snake Eater maintains what players loved from the original, such as its story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music, but now it is "presented in an even more immersive experience".</p>
<p>It's been a year since we had got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-remake-in-engine-footage-receives-mixed-reaction">look at some in-engine footage of Konami's remake</a>. While Snake actor David Hayter gave the trailer his stamp of approval, others said they missed the older style of the original game.</p>
<p>"Whisper it quietly, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater looks like the most exciting Konami project in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote after some time with the game earlier this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our Ed has been hands on with the game already, and came away impressed. "For the most part, Monster Hunter Wilds strikes a balance between approachability and depth of combat. It offers a familiar thrill of the hunt, of player customisation (the new armours look awesome), and of extravagant combat, but with a fresh world ripe for a bit of co-op action - even with NPCs," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>.</p><p>"Coupled with some of those smart tweaks to streamline the experience and put as much focus as possible on the action, rather than fiddly menus, and there's a good chance this one'll successfully lure in a new audience of hunters."</p>
