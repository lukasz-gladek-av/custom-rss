<p>Johnny's "integration into the Mortal Kombat story and universe is a big part of what this movie explores," NetherRealm's Ed Boon told <a href="https://ew.com/mortal-kombat-2-first-look-karl-urban-johnny-cage-kitana-shao-kahn-exclusive-11696968">EW</a>. "He's a washed-up Hollywood guy thrown into this magical, ultra-violent thing. Karl, his depiction of Johnny Cage is different than our games in some ways.</p>
<p>"He's adding his own flare to it, but I think it'll feel fresh. There's like a novelty factor in there."</p>
<p>Boon added Johnny's introduction in the film is "ridiculously hilarious", with the game developer stating his debut incited "some of the biggest laughs" during the film's early screenings.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat 2's director Simon McQuoid said the movie team "wanted a character that wasn't just completely silly, comic book… It's a character that could instantly go there and become too light and throwaway if we were to lean too much into the kind of cheese".</p>
<p>The director believes Urban's casting has "allowed that character to have more depth".</p>

<p>In addition to Urban, Adeline Rudolph - who previously starred in Netflix's The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-adds-another-sabrina-star-this-time-as-kitana">will play Princess Kitana</a>. Meanwhile, fellow Sabrina alum Tati Gabrielle is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharteds-tati-gabrielle-set-to-play-jade-in-mortal-kombat-2-film">Kitana's bodyguard, Jade</a>.</p>
<p>This is not Gabrielle's first foray into the video game adaptation scene. She also starred as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-uncharted-film-is-the-treasure-ive-been-looking-for">Jo Braddock in 2022's Uncharted film adaptation</a>, and has been cast in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">The Last of Us' second season as Nora</a>, "a military medic struggling to come to terms with the sins of her past".</p>
<p>Along with these new images, EW revealed new movie-accurate skins of characters including Urban's Johnny, Rudolph's Kitana, and Ford's Shao Kahn are coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> some time later this year.</p>

<p>Eurogamer's former editor Wesley Yin-Poole wasn't overly keen on the first Mortal Kombat film when it came out a few years ago, calling it "boring".</p>
<p>"There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We've been working on something that we hope you'll love -- especially if you're the kind of gamer who has a wishlist longer than a Final Fantasy cutscene (guilty as charged).</p>
