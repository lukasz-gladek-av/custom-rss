Soon, the fairies will be upon us thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-off-with-the-fairies-in-new-enchanted-by-nature-expansion">imminent Enchanted by Nature expansion</a>. But before all that, EA has laid the foundations for its impending pixie dust explosion with a free content update - introducing the likes of glass walls and rooftop plants - that's available to download and muck around with right now.
</p>
<p>
Glass walls - which should delight the exhibitionist Sims in your life - can be located under Misc &gt; Wall Patterns in Build Mode, and do pretty much exactly what you'd assume, offering your Sims all the outdoors they could possibly hope for without them ever needing to go outside. Alternatively, they could be turned into (lethally?) inconspicuous partitions, or paired with glass roofs for that authentic greenhouse look. And those aforementioned rooftop plants? Well, you can now stick a select assortment of plants on top of your house. The end.
</p>
<p>
Away from these new decor bits, EA's latest update also brings Sim inventory improvements and a notebook refresh. Players now have new ways to sort their inventory, for instance, with the default "new" view placing freshly acquired stuff at the top, but your stash can also be filtered by price, name, crafting quality, and rarity. Spoiled foods, meanwhile, get an unmissable red background indicator and are grouped into a new Spoiled stack.

<p>
As for the notebook - which includes a new interface designed to make it easier to keep tabs on your household Collections - it now sports a refreshed layout, category page enhancements, new discovery badges, and more. "Whether you're jotting down notes for your Sim or exploring unique categories," EA writes, "the notebook is now more intuitive and engaging."
</p>
<p>
All that arrives alongside an extensive list of fixes and improvements across The Sims 4 base game and its expansions. With the update applied, for instance, Sims should no longer need to grapple with the inconvenience of having rain and snow do their thing indoors, and children should stop going stretchy when attempting to play the violin. There's plenty more where those came from, though, as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025">detailed in EA's announcement post</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's latest update is available now on all platforms and arrives ahead of the game's next major paid expansion, Enchanted by Nature. This launches next Thursday, 10th July, and introduces emotion-hungry fairies (in both kindly and chaotic forms) as a new supernatural Sim option. That's alongside the new coastal world of Innisgreen, where brave Sims can reside if they don't mind luck heavily impacting the course of their lives. Chuck in new adventures, skills, traits, and a new mechanic based around emotional balance, and it's quite a busy one.
