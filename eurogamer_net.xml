            <p>Octopath Traveller co-developer Acquire is working on three new original games, in a new deal with Middle Eastern publisher Red Dunes Games.</p>
<p>Acquire (owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>) is best known for the likes of Tenchu and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a>, as well as supporting Nintendo's RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> and co-developing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Octopath Traveller games.</p>
<p>The three original games in development will be shown at this year's Tokyo Game Show in September, as reported by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2025/07/14/tenchu-studio-acquire-and-red-dunes-games-unveil-global-co-dev-deal/">Forbes</a>, and will be released on PC and major consoles. The three games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Tremor (featuring "city-shaking kaiju battles")</li>
<li>Project Umbra ("dark fantasy hunts")</li>
<li>Project Shadowcar ("a shadowy espionage thriller")</li>
</ul>

<p>"As Acquire, a studio that has long valued originality from Japan in game development, we are thrilled to have found a wonderful partner in Red Dunes Games and embark on a bold new global challenge together," said CEO Takuma Endo.</p>
<p>"We've always believed in the power of originality. Now, with Red Dunes, we're building something truly international."</p>
<p>Red Dunes Games, based in Abu Dhabi, has until now focused on indie games, but is looking to expand its global footprint.</p>
<p>"Acquire is a legendary studio with a deep creative legacy, and we are honoured to work with them to build the next wave of original games," said Sultan Darmaki, CEO and creative director. "This partnership is a reflection of our belief that the future of gaming lies in global collaboration, where stories cross borders, and innovation knows no region."</p>
<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership released last year. "A relatively minor instalment, but in a series this magical, that's still good news," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">our review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveller-co-developer-working-on-three-new-original-games-coming-to-tokyo-game-show]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">John Wick Hex</a>, a wonderful tactical RPG, is being delisted off digital storefronts on the 17th July.</p>
<p>Developed by Bithell Games and released back in 2019, it will still be playable by those who already own the game. But after the cutoff date on the 17th, those interested in the game will no longer be able to buy it on Steam, GOG, or other platforms. <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/john-wick-hex?srsltid=AfmBOooyer8DpMqd436MKCQe94z8CNMu8sX5TbxfvFXkfbrBB6kRx61z">You can still grab it now on Humble</a> for a fraction of its standard price.</p>
<p>A statement released by the publisher Big Fan Games reads as follows: "After July 17th, 2025, existing owners of John Wick Hex will still be able to access the game via their digital libraries (PC/Console) and/or physical copies (Console), however new purchases of John Wick Hex will not be possible, regardless of platform or storefront."</p>

<p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-wick-hex-review-sweet-economy">reviewed John Wick Hex favourably</a>, as Donlan wrote: "There is a great game lurking in John Wick. This series is so infused with the spirit of games, its world-building is so gamey, how could there not be? I'm still not sure that John Wick Hex is actually that precise game, but who cares when it's pretty great in its own right?"</p>
<p>The story of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-john-wick-hex-ended-up-a-strategy-game-instead-of-a-shooter">how it turned out to be a strategy game rather than a shooter like you'd expect</a> is also interesting, with developer Mike Bithell stating: "I wanted to give players that sense of strategic thinking, that high-level choreography. Then came the process of making that, pitching that, working with them, and then getting all of the filmmakers from the movies involved. They were telling me how John makes decisions, and then we went 'OK how do we make that into a game that explores that', and that to me seemed way more interesting than doing a shooter."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-excellent-john-wick-hex-will-be-delisted-later-this-week-currently-on-sale]]></content:encoded>
