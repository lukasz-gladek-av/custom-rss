            <p>Mobile gamers will soon be able to enjoy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> on their handheld devices.</p>
<p>The 2.5D metroidvania will be released across Android and iOS on 14th April, Ubisoft has announced, with the studio adding the game will run at a healthy 60fps for those playing on "recent generations of mobile devices".</p>
<p>As this is, of course, a mobile release, players will be able to negotiate The Lost Crown's world with Sargon using touch screen controls, although an external controller can also be attached. There will be the ability to remap controls as desired.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has suddenly become unplayable for some PC players on older systems due to a new hard requirement not supported by aging CPUs.</p>
<p>While the minimum PC specs on the Steam page have not changed, the game now requires AVX2 support to run thanks to recent optimisations.</p>
<p>However, many players have been running the game on systems without AVX2 support and, as a result, are now locked out of the game.</p>

<p>AVX2 (or Advanced Vector Extensions) essentially allows for fast and efficient CPU usage and was first supported by Intel in 2013. It means CPUs released prior to this won't have AVX2 and therefore will no longer be able to run Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>The Helldivers 2 Discord server has been awash with players suddenly unable to play the game on PC - a game that's not free-to-play but was previously paid for and playable for the past year.</p>
<p>"Can't believe I can't play a game I've fully paid for and have the required minimum specs for," wrote one player in Discord.</p>
<p>"600+ hours in a game I love just to be locked out is making me so frustrated to the point I just want to ask for a refund instead of fixing their mistakes," wrote another.</p>
<p>"The AVX2 check in the script is experimental, and can throw false positives, which is why it's wise to manually check your processor model for the AVX2 support from the manufacturer's documentation," explained Discord moderator Birby.</p>
<p>Another reply from the moderator reads: "That processor does not support AVX2, which is now a hard minimum requirement for processors. Unfortunately you will require a system upgrade."</p>
<p>Yet despite moderators attempting to reply to all players, the conversation has become decidedly heated from both sides.</p>
<p>"I don't like to have to tell people their 13 year old processor is out of date," wrote Birby. "I have fielded this question hundreds of times in the past week. I sit here and help people in 48hr stints before going to bed. People will piss and moan and argue, not to mention insult and attack us for being the bearers of bad news. I get you're venting, but as I keep saying - it is up to you as the consumer to confirm your system meets spec before purchase, and you should never be surprised if your out of spec machine can't run the game."</p>
<p>On top of sharing a <a href="https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15916898652700--HELLDIVERS-2-Known-Issues">current known list of issues</a>, moderators have shared multiple fixes for a string of current issues, from checking minimum spec requirements, to rolling back AMD and NVIDIA GPU drivers, to purging downloaded mods from the system.</p>
<p>Developer Arrowhead itself is yet to publicly respond to players. Eurogamer has contacted the studio and publisher Sony for comment.</p>
<p>Over on console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-helldivers-2-has-received-a-stealth-ps5-pro-upgrade-and-heres-what-it-does">Helldivers 2 recently received a PS5 Pro patch</a> to boost performance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, creative director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales">Johan Pilestedt discussed "ridiculous" layoffs across the industry</a> at this year's GDC, due to studios' dogged reliance on battle royales.</p>
<p>"We will always go through the cycles of death and rebirth, but now that cycle is unnecessarily brutal because we don't diversify enough," he said. "We need to make more types of games because people are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The new gear comes as part of March's Sea of Thieves update which (as previously announced) expands on the big seasonal update by adding hunting spears, ambient wildlife, and performance improvements, among other tweaks and changes.</p>

<p>The once Xbox console exclusive Sea of Thieves sailed onto PlayStation last year, and went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">top the PS5 sales charts</a> in Europe. Ahead of its move to PlayStation, the Sea of Thieves team revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-sails-across-impressive-player-milestone-ahead-of-ps-debut">40 million of us had embraced our inner pirate</a> and set sail since the game's debut across Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>At this time, executive producer Joe 'Three Sheets' Neate acknowledged the game's "brilliant, positive and welcoming community, who continue to surprise and impress us with your creativity and antics out on the waves".</p>

            <p>Thanks to a little bit of small print, many out there now have hopes that Nintendo may be upgrading some of its OG Switch games for the more powerful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> console.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Nintendo Direct, the company announced a new feature for Switch and Switch 2 that'll let players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">share their digital games with another console or Family Group members in the same way they might swap a physical cartridge</a> known as Virtual Game Cards.</p>
<p>This little announcement was very welcome in itself, but a particular bit in the small print has since caught the attention of many, with the mention of "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games".</p>

<p>The small print on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/">Virtual Game Cards information page reads</a>:</p>
<p>"Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system.</p>
<p>"To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account."</p>
<p>The fact Nintendo has made a clear distinction between Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games has led many to speculate that a select number of original Switch games will be getting a bit of an upgrade for the upcoming console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">which we already know will be backwards compatible</a>. </p>
<p>There have been a number of rather enthusiastic reactions online, with one post reading "WE FUCKING WONNNN OMG".</p>
<p>Others, meanwhile, are remaining cautious about the wording, suggesting that Nintendo is merely suggesting that some games will be released across both Switch and Switch 2 (much like we still see plenty of games debuting on PS4 and Xbox One), while some will be Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Nintendo for further clarification on its wording.</p>

            <p>Cult horror game The Exit 8 is being adapted into a film and has just received its first trailer.</p>
<p>The film was first announced at the end of last year, and will be released on 29th August this year (in Japan at least), distributed by Toho.</p>
<p>It's directly based on the game from Japanese studio Kotake Create, which sees players stuck in an infinitely-looping Japanese subway.</p>

<p>In the game, players must carefully observe anomalies in the environment in order to advance their escape by turning back. Miss a change and the loop begins anew.</p>
<p>With its minimalist aesthetic and creepy atmosphere, The Exit 8 has become a cult hit since its release on Steam in November 2023. It was later released on Switch in April 2024, PlayStation consoles in August 2024, and Xbox Series X/S earlier this year.</p>
<p>A VR version is also available for Meta Quest headsets and has just been released on mobile devices (iOS and Android).</p>
<p>Genki Kawamura will write, produce, and direct the film, following his work as producer on anime film Suzume, directing and writing the 2022 film Hyakka, and even producing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-pokemon-and-ed-sheeran-collaboration-is-coming-out-next-week">Ed Sheeran's Pokémon music video for Celestial</a>.</p>
<p>The film will star Japanese singer and actor Kazunari Ninomiya as the lost man.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> has cancelled a major expansion to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> as part of ongoing restructuring, as the company faces financial woes.</p>
<p>The planned expansion to the company's biggest success in recent years would have added new storylines on its release later this year, alongside a "Definitive Edition" including all content.</p>
<p>However, according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, the expansion has been scrapped - the expansion itself was never publicly announced, but was reported by the outlet last year.</p>

<p>In part, the expansion was cancelled due to the content not being substantial enough to justify its price, anonymous sources told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Developer Avalanche was reportedly working with Rocksteady Studios on the expansion, which would restore a storyline based on a companion cut during development of the original game.</p>
<p>Last year, Rocksteady released its Suicide Squad live-service game, which was deemed a financial failure. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">studio suffered a round of layoffs</a>, but is now reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">working on a new single-player Batman game</a> as it returns to its biggest success.</p>
<p>The news follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation by Warner Bros. of its Wonder Woman game</a>, as well as the closure of its Monolith Productions studio, in addition to Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This was described as a "strategic change in direction", the publisher said.</p>
<p>It's now doubling down on its biggest franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy has sold over 34m copies to become one of the best-selling games ever, but Warner Bros. has been unable to replicate its success elsewhere. A sequel is in development by Avalanche.</p>
<p>"We can rage about the system, the stock market, and the bad luck all we like, and we'd have a good point - it is our purpose, as journalists, punters and just humans, to seek out systemic explanations, to flush out the patterns, when the same things keep going wrong," wrote Eurogamer deputy editor Chris Tapsell about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-hellish-decade-offers-a-valuable-lesson-to-gamings-power-brokers-sometimes-youve-nobody-to-blame-but-yourselves">Warner Bros. Games' decade of mismanagement</a>.</p>
<p>"And systemic issues are real. So are individuals. And this industry will get nowhere without those individuals who make the big calls first taking a long, hard look in the mirror."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like we will be able to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as of next week.</p>
<p>According to a now-deleted post on Best Buy Canada, pre-orders for the Switch successor will go live on 2nd April. That is the same day as Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct.</p>

<p>The post was removed from the website after publication, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-start-april-2">IGN </a>caught a glimpse before it was deleted. "Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 will open on April 2nd at Best Buy Canada," the blog post read.</p>
<p>As IGN noted, it is unclear if it's just Best Buy Canada which has plans to kick off Switch 2 pre-orders next Wednesday, or whether other major retailers will follow suit. It is fair to assume, though, Nintendo will reveal a console release date during its Direct next week, and announce pre-orders at the same time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2 was officially announced in January</a>, with a brief little teaser giving us a glimpse of the console. Here, we got a peek at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Switch 2's rumoured mouse functionality</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">a new Mario Kart game</a>. More will be shared next week, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">the upcoming showcase promising "a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2"</a>.</p>
<p>And, that pre-order release date isn't the only little Switch 2 nugget that has slipped free ahead of the Direct. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-finally-confirmed">console's rumoured 'C' button has been confirmed ahead of schedule</a>, thanks to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">promotional image shared on Google Play and the App Store for Nintendo's new Today app</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
