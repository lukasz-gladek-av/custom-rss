            <p>
As part of its highly anticipated (and heavily leaked) first look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has shared another date for the calendar; the company has confirmed it'll be sharing more information on its new console on 2nd April this year.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">finally unveiled Switch 2 today</a> after weeks of leaks - but its announcement, as expected, was light on detail. It gave a first look at the machine itself - a fairly subtle revision of the original Switch's familiar form factor at first glance - plus a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">tease of a new Mario Kart game</a>.
</p>
<p>
It also reiterated Switch 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">will be backward compatible</a>, and is capable of playing both digital and physical Switch games. Beyond that, though, Nintendo is saving the juicier details for a later date. And unfortunately, it's going to be a bit of a wait, with the company confirming it'll hosting a Switch 2 focused Nintendo Direct on 2nd April this year.

<p>
That'll almost certainly be when the company does its proper deep dive into the console's features (Miiverse 2 please Nintendo, and Street Pass 2 while you're at it, thank you), alongside the full run-down of games coming to Switch 2 at launch and beyond. A new Mario Kart seems a certainty for launch at this point, for instance, and a Switch 2 version of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-in-development Metroid Prime 4</a> appears likely too. Additionally, previous whispers have suggested a new 3D Mario is coming later this year. April's Direct should also provide pricing details and a proper launch date beyond its current vague release window of "2025".
</p><p>

In addition to April's Direct, Nintendo has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">confirmed it'll be holding a Switch 2 "world tour"</a> event, giving the public an opportunity to go hands-on with the console and, presumably, its launch line-up of games. That's due to run from early April to June, suggesting the console won't release until sometime after. Exciting times!
