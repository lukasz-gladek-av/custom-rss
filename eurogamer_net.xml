            <p><strong>UPDATE 2.12pm:</strong> Genki has responded to Nintendo's legal complaint, saying it is "taking it seriously", and is "proud of the work [it has] done".</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Court papers filed in California, USA, show Nintendo is formally suing accessories manufacturer Genki for infringing its trademark, as well as alleging unfair competition and false advertising.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-visited-genki-to-discuss-those-switch-2-leaks-reporter-claims">Nintendo lawyers reportedly visited Genki on the CES trade show floor in January</a> after videos of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">its dummy Switch 2 console went viral</a> before the system was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">formally revealed by Nintendo on 2nd April</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Nintendo has filed its copyright claim against Genki, accusing the company of "capitalising" on demand for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> news and giving "contradictory and inconsistent" statements.</p>

<figcaption>Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uGRs-ispRU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Beginning at least as early as December 2024, [Genki] embarked upon a strategic campaign intended to capitalise on the public interest surrounding Nintendo's next-generation console," court papers <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf">said</a>,</p>
<p>"In January 2025, [Genki] began advertising that it gained unauthorised access to Nintendo's upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console, which had not yet been released or even revealed publicly by Nintendo. Following its initial claims of access to a genuine Nintendo Switch 2 console, Defendant's statements were contradictory and inconsistent, with Defendant later stating that it was never in possession of a console. Nevertheless, Defendant has since maintained its representation to consumers that its accessories will be compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2 upon the console's release."</p>
<p>Nintendo said that "ensuring the compatibility of Defendant's accessories would not be possible unless and until Defendant has access to a Nintendo Switch 2 console" and insists it neither provided nor authorised a Switch 2 to the company. Therefore, Nintendo alleges Genki either misled consumers by pretending to have a "genuine console" when it didn't, or "unlawfully or illicitly obtained an authentic Nintendo Switch 2, or proprietary technical information about the Nintendo Switch 2, prior to the console's release to the public".</p>
<p>"Genki boasted its alleged early access to the unreleased console and allowed guests to hold and measure the mockups," Nintendo's lawyers said, adding the videos, renders, and images Genki displayed at its CES booth and on its website infringed Nintendo's copyright and "garnered significant attention from the media and public resulting in confusion among consumers as to the validity of Genki's statements and association with Nintendo".</p>
<p>"Public discourse and confusion over Genki's announcements were so significant that on January 10, 2025, Nintendo issued a statement to reporters about the incident, clarifying that 'the gaming hardware that Genki presented as Nintendo hardware at CES is unofficial and was not provided to the company by us'," Nintendo added.</p>
<p>Then, on 20th January, Genki posted a picture of its CEO, Edward Tsai, on its official Twitter account with the caption: "Genki ninjas infiltrate Nintendo Kyoto HQ", which Nintendo said was "an apparent attempt to further confuse the public as to whether Genki had access to a Nintendo Switch 2 and/or an affiliation with Nintendo". It then updated its website and advertisements "to boast about its early access to Nintendo Switch 2 information", saying: "Can you keep a secret? We can’t..."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>On 1st April, 2025 - the day before Nintendo's Switch 2 Nintendo Direct - Genki allegedly "mass-emailed its marketing list and posted on social media an announcement of its own 'Direct' presentation to be held on the same day as Nintendo's highly anticipated presentation". Nintendo then took issue with the name of Genki's broadcast - Genki Direct - and its branding materials.</p>
<p>"Genki's claims of compatibility would be impossible to guarantee without unauthorised, illegal early access to the Nintendo Switch 2. Thus, Genki has misled and is misleading the public as to its ability to guarantee the compatibility of its products with the Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
<p>Nintendo is asking for Genki to be stopped from using "Nintendo Switch" in its marketing, destroy any products or marketing that does use Nintendo's copyright, and "recover all damages it has sustained as a result of Defendant's infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, and that said damages be trebled".</p>
<p>Interestingly, the court papers also revealed that Nintendo wasted no time designing the Switch successor, saying: "Shortly after the release of the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo began planning its successor console, with formal hardware development beginning around 2019."</p>
<p>The Switch 2 will release on 5th June and cost £396. Nintendo is gearing up for the launch of Switch 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">by releasing a chunky update for the original Switch</a>. Update Version 20.0.0 adds a number of features to the console, including the new Virtual Game Card system, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-cards-thatll-let-you-share-you-digital-switch-and-switch-2-games">allows players to share their digital games with another console</a> or Family Group members in the same way they might swap a physical cartridge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Half-Life 3 is not just in development, but it's now "playable, end-to-end".</p>
<p>That's according to Valve insider Tyler McVicker, who posits the eagerly-anticipated sequel could be announced as early as this summer (Q3), with a possible release before the end of 2025, probably winter (Q4).</p>
<p>We already had strong evidence - if no specific confirmation - that Valve is once again working on a major new Half-Life project of some kind, codenamed HLX, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">a trustworthy report last summer detailing datamined assets and code snippets</a> backing up a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">leak from an actor</a> likely involved.</p>
<p><strong>I'll go into some of the details after the video embedded below, but please be mindful there may be spoilers for this new game… if it's real, of course.</strong></p>

<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/half-life-3-is-reportedly-playable-in-its-entirety-and-could-be-announced-this-year-183030499.html">Engadget</a>, McVicker gave a livestreamed Q&amp;A packed with explosive clues and hints about what's to come, and he has once again stressed: "The game is not VR. Half Life 3 is not a VR title."</p>
<p>"HLX is being playtested so religiously and so widely that there are individuals who will just talk," McVicker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=1300s">said</a>. "I personally have a policy of avoiding any story-related questions or information wherever possible, so I currently have avoided all of them. But I've been offered it by people whom are trustworthy and I know some of my contemporaries have been given it so there is information out there about the plot..."</p>
<p>That said, he did tease that he "actually do[es] think [Portal's] Chell may turn up in Half-Life 3", and stressed: "Erik Wolpaw wants to do Portal 3 so fuckin' bad". McVicker also opined it was possible Portal 3 could be the next single-player project developed at Valve, but that may depend upon who is "gonna retire" after Half-Life 3.</p>
<p>"This is the furthest (HLX) has ever been. Period," he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=8230s">added</a>. "The game is playable - end to end. Period. [Other HL3/Ep3 projects have] never been that far. And they're optimising, polishing, and they're probably content-locked and if they're not then they're mechanic locked."</p>
<p>He also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Z9IOIWKHg&amp;t=2310s">addressed</a> the procedural generation system, saying it has been "misunderstood" by the general public.</p>
<p>"The way Valve is going about that is akin to taking the [AI] Director from Left4Dead 2 and making it significantly more powerful. It's not changing geometry. It's instead changing entity placement, right [... like] doors, physics props, enemies, items. NPCs of any kind." He also disputes claims the story will be procedurally generated.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-cancelled-a-lot-of-games-over-the-last-10-years-including-half-life-3-and-left-4-dead-3">What we <em>do</em> know for sure is Half-Life 3 was in development 2013/2014</a>, and was set to be a procedurally-generated, replayable game that fused <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>-inspired gameplay with scripted story moments. It was cancelled because it was built on the unfinished Source 2 engine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As fans come to terms with the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> delay - from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kd7oq8/i_built_a_gta_6_countdown_website_because_therapy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">creating countdowns "that are cheaper than therapy"</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1kdp5pp/i_think_we_need_to_calm_ourselves_about_the_delay/">pleas to "calm ourselves"</a> - at least one person is delighted by the news: Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 actor, Luke Dale.</p>
<p>Dale, who portrayed Hans Capon in the game, took a glass-half view on the delay, writing on X/Twitter: "WE'RE IN WITH A SHOT! GOTY!", appending the hashtag #KCD2.</p>

<p>You see, while players have been salivating for the next instalment of the universally-acclaimed series - so much so that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick acknowledged the fervor for GTA 6 is "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the greatest anticipation [he's] ever seen for an entertainment property</a>" - developers and publishers of other games targeting a similar release window were understandably worried about accidentally butting up against GTA 6's launch. Even Gearbox's Randy Pitchford was forced to strenuously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">deny that bringing Borderlands 4's release date forward</a> had anything to do with GTA 6 (which turned out to be true).</p>
<p>And of course, Luke Dale is <em>not</em> the only person in the games industry to have puffed out a sigh of relief yesterday - he just chose to do so publicly. The silver lining now is that games that have already released in 2025 - and those that had been holding back on solidifying release dates until  GTA 6'a launch was confirmed - can feel more confident about securing an accolade or two in award ceremonies or best games of 2025 lists (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/with-gta-6-delayed-to-2026-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-celebrates-were-in-with-a-shot-to-win-game-of-the-year-2025/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p> <div>

<p>We gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 three out of five stars</a>, writing: "This gorgeous medieval RPG continues to be just as divisive, prickly and abrasive as its predecessor."</p>

The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026. Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track.</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
