            <p>
Microsoft has announced its line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for the latter half of February. 
</p>
<p>
This begins with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, which Microsoft also noted down in its list for the first half of the month too. Hmm! Otherwise, there's a thin selection of other titles on offer. Well, you're probably still playing with your fungus hero anyway.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full line-up of Xbox Game Pass titles for the rest of February:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Avowed - 18th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>EA Sports F1 24 - 20th February (Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader - 20th February (Standard, Ultimate, PC)</li>
<li>Watch Dogs: Legion - 20th February (Standard, Ultimate, PC)</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>
All Game Pass subscribers, including those on the service's Standard tier, get post-Brexit London simulator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs: Legion</a> to play around with on 20th February. Enjoy its sunnier version of Britain's future, complete with crime-loving grannies and even more drones. Tactical turn-based isometric RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> is available then, too.
</p>
<p>
Other than Avowed, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC subscribers this month also get EA Sports <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24">F1 24</a>, should you prefer cars to magical combat.
</p>
<p>
As ever, whenever Microsoft giveth, it also taketh away. Nine games are set to leave Xbox Game Pass on 28th February, including several Yakuza titles and PAW Patrol World. Hopefully there's no tears:
</p>
<ul>
<li>F1 22 (Console and PC) - EA Play</li>
<li>Gris (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Maneater (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>PAW Patrol World (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Space Engineers (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Wo Long Fallen Dynasty (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 3 Remastered (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 4 Remastered (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.
</p>

            <p>Wizards of the Coast has unveiled the first four of its forthcoming Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy cards, and confirmed legendary artist Yoshitaka Amano is involved.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy crossover will launch on 13th June and consists of four decks based on Final Fantasies 6, 7, 10, and 14. It's the lead card from each of these decks that's now been revealed: Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola.</p>
<p>Each deck will consist of 100 cards, including both reprints of existing cards with new Final Fantasy art and brand new cards, and will tell the story of that particular Final Fantasy game.</p>

<p>"Final Fantasy games are so rich with flavor, beloved characters, and unique settings that choosing a single game as the theme provided more than enough material to design a full deck of cards around," Magic's senior game designer Daniel Holt told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">IGN</a>. "Approaching each deck as a single game also provided the opportunity to dive deep into the lore of each, capturing even more beloved moments from across the game's storyline that we may not have been able to achieve otherwise."</p>
<p>Holt said the development team has "so many passionate Final Fantasy fans", with the four games partially chosen because they're favourites among the team. However, each brought its own unique challenges in adaptation. For instance, how will the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> deck balance the original game with its Remake trilogy?</p>
<p>"Our core approach to Final Fantasy 7 was to capture the original PS1 game's narrative, while using <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>'s modern aesthetics to push the fidelity of each character design, story moment, and memorable location to the next level," said principal narrative game designer Dillon Deveney. "With that in mind, if a scene existed in both games, we had our choice of showing it as the original game did, how the modern version interpreted it, or a unique fusion of both. Hopefully, this deck feels familiar and nostalgic to players of both the original game and the modern series!"</p>

<p>And while each deck has the lead character from each game as its Commander, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> is an MMORPG without an equivalent lead.</p>
<p>"For Y'shtola, it came down to a mix of popularity of the character as well as being a spellcaster, her story and character development offered a wide range of abilities and moments to pull from to lead the deck," said Holt, adding the deck specifically reflects her story arc in expansion Shadowbringers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the official Magic: The Gathering account stated the crossover has "brought together esteemed artists from around the world" - and confirmed legendary Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano is involved.</p>

<p>More details on the crossover are expected later today, with a reveal on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/magic">Magic: The Gathering Twitch channel</a> at 10am PT (that's 6pm UK time).</p>
<p>All four decks will be available individually as a regular version (MSRP $69.99) or as a collector's edition (MSRP $149.99).</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a video game has been adapted into Magic cards, following the likes of Fallout, Tomb Raider, and Assassin's Creed in recent years.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-announces-magic-the-gathering-film-and-tv-series-wants-it-to-be-the-next-cinematic-universe">Hasbro announced a Magic: The Gathering film and TV series</a>, which it aims to be a "multimedia universe that thrills longstanding fans and creates a broad wave of new ones".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you are looking for a recommendation, I played The Past Within with fellow Eurogamer puzzle enthusiast Matt, and rather enjoyed my time with it. In fact, Matt and I called it an "imaginative co-op experience that demands communication and teamwork, and conjures something memorable and unique as a result," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-past-within-review-rewarding-co-op-teamwork-with-a-fascinating-spin">Eurogamer's The Past Within review</a>.</p>
<p>I was also taken with Little Kitty, Big City (in my opinion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-campfires-unexpected-cat-games-and-northern-lights">it was a better 'cat game' than Stray</a>) and Nobody Saves the World.</p>
<p>Has anything caught your eye?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
