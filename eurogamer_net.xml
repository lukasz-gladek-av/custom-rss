            <p>
The end is nigh for developer FuturLab's endlessly hypnotic original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>, but before the studio packs away its nozzles in anticipation of an upcoming sequel, there's one last free update featuring a couple more spaces in which to unleash your hose.
</p>
<p>
"The time has come to reach our final destination for PowerWash Simulator," FuturLab <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">wrote in an update on its website,</a> "and what a journey it has been!... Whether you've been with us busting the grime from early access, or hopped aboard the PowerWash hype train somewhere down the line, we'd love to say a huge thank you for enjoying this adventure with us."
</p>
<p>
And as a final farewell to the original game, FuturLab has released Muckingham Files 6, which features two more locations in desperate need of a clean. The first will be immediately familiar to old hands, taking players down into the Muckingham subway station for one last spray. However, rather than demanding a repeat of the harrowing tunnel clean-up job featured in the base game, this time you'll be aiming your nozzle at an extremely grubby train that's pulled into the station, washing away the grime from its outers and innards.

<p>
After that, there's one last stop in the form of Sculpture Park, where players will be working at the behest of Darcy d'Arcy to restore the area's collection of "fine" art - including a large Monolith and The Man of A Thousand Faces - to its former glory. And, of course, there's a giant gnome, because what sort of send off would it be without one?
</p>
<p>
"We hope you enjoy this final PowerWash Simulator update as much as we have enjoyed creating it," FuturLab concluded in its update. "The team have poured their hearts and souls into creating a world for you all to escape to and clean, somewhere for you to relax and solo clean, or a place to gather with friends and catch up over a satisfying wash." 
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's free Muckingham Files 6 update - which follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/have-another-peek-at-powerwash-simulator-2-then-hose-down-an-ice-cream-parlour-in-the-original">April's inclusion of Muckingham's Dessert Parlour</a> for a cleaning - is available now on all platforms, and FutureLab has taken the opportunity to squeeze in a couple more bug fixes, as detailed in its <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Next up, of course, is PowerWash Simulator 2, which is currently expected to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">possibly Switch 2</a> later this year. It promises new jobs, new dirt to blast, and a new hub-like HQ. And if you're a fan of PowerWash Simulator's ridiculous narrative, don't fret - FuturLab has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-powerwash-simulator-2-is-bringing-back-the-ludicrous-brilliant-lore">also confirmed plenty more Muckingham lore</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, developer Unknown Worlds' exquisite deep sea survival game, is making its way to iOS and Android devices this July, meaning you'll finally be able to play it <em>actually underwater</em> (as long as your phone is waterproof, so please do check that first).
</p>
<p>
Subnautica, for some context, originally lauched in 2018 after a couple of years in early access, taking players on a mostly combat-free adventure far, far beneath the waves after crash landing on the ocean planet 4546B. It managed to combine its various strands of exploration, narrative, crafting, base building, and thalassophobia-inducing horror into a deeply satisfying whole, and ended up being a critical and commercial hit. So much so that a standalone expansion - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a> - followed, and a sequel's on the way.
</p>
<p>
But back to Subnautica's iOS and Android release. It's being created in collaboration with mobile developer Playdigious and promises the full-fat Subnautica experience - the one Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-review">called</a> "oppressively beautiful" and "well-wrought" back in 2018 - albeit with some mobile-specific tweaks. It's got an updated UI, for instance, alongside touch controls and support for MFi controllers if you'd rather play with proper buttons. That's in addition to iPhone 15 optimisation, GameCenter achievements on iOS, and cloud save support enabling progress to be share between iOS or Android devices.

<p>
If all that appeals, Subnatica comes to iOS and Android on 8th July (via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subnautica/id6478639011">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unknownworlds.subnautica">Google Play</a> respectively) for the entirely reasonable price of $9.99 USD. In fact, it'll be even cheaper for a limited time, given the 10 percent launch discount that'll bring it down to $8.99.
</p>
<p>
As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, that's currently set to launch into early access later this year. Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">shared a tiny bit of first gameplay back in April</a>, showing off a handful of new environments, some new aquatic creatures, and even a bit of base-building and co-operative swimming. Co-op is, of course, the sequel's big new feature, and it'll support up to four players. Subnautica 2 will initially be available for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and GamePass, and is expected to stay in early access for "about two to three years."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has received a day one patch ahead of its release tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ready across all platforms, the update "aims to improve gameplay and stability" according to the (very minimal) <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>The changes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of playable characters</li>
<li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li>
<li>Text adjustments</li>
<li>Balance adjustments</li>
<li>Added character scenarios</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>No further details are provided in the notes, so I hopped into the game to check out the changes.</p>

<p>Testing a single player expedition, it would appear the balance adjustments have made it slightly easier. While enemies are still aggressive, their health seems lower and my character stats appeared to be higher.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be my skill level has increased over the review period. But even a half-arsed run got me two thirds through the first Nightlord boss, which wouldn't have happened previously, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn't take this as a sign that solo play is a viable option to complete the game. It's still very much intended to be a multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>One obvious improvement, though, is the "improved handling of playable characters", which relates to the game's parkour movement. It's now much cleaner jumping up the side of cliffs.</p>
<p>The remaining changes will need to be tested over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">30m selling game</a>. It's out tomorrow across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam). Note that crossplay between platforms is not included.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
