            <p>A recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> update has added an inventive new solution to the problem of players breaking into locked rooms. If you manage to break into one of these locations full of valuable loot, but without using the required keycard, you're cooked alive.</p>
<p>This was first teased cheekily <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-4-0">in last week's patch notes</a>, describing it as "a very hot fix" to locked room exploits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p7ytbc/locked_rooms_now_turn_you_into_a_fireball_if_you/">Videos of this measure</a> quickly spread across the internet like wildfire, with the Arc Raiders community celebrating the apparent death of one of the game's more frustrating quirks.</p>
<p>If you don't know, locked rooms are few and far between on each map, and generally require a keycard to open. By using the keycard, you unlock the room for everyone, allowing you to get in there and loot through a space saturated with high-rarity gear.</p>

</figure>
<p>This can be dangerous though, not only because keycards are themselves rare, but other players can wander in and kill you while you scavenge, or while you make your way to the extraction. It's a core part of the risk and reward loop present in Arc Raiders and extraction shooters in general.</p><p>However, exploiters were finding inventive ways into these rooms without the keycard. This could be clipping through the locked door, hopping through open windows, dropping through the ceiling, etc. Not only does this keep the door locked while you loot, it also means if another player goes to the locked room with the keycard as intended, they could find it barren, wasting their keycard for nothing. This, as you can imagine, sucked.</p>
<p>This new anti-exploit measures detects whether or not players are inside the locked room <em>while</em> the door is keycard locked. If they are, it kills them without a hope of escaping in slow, scorching fashion. Then, if a player does turn up with a keycard and opens the door, they'll find a bonus body alongside their locked room loot. Nice.</p>
<p>This is far from the only major fix made to Arc Raiders in recent days. In the same patch as this locked room exploit measure, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-removes-weapon-swap-exploit">Embark Studios killed double pumping</a>, a technique terrorising innocents across Stella Montis. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-cameo-in-south-park">The game also recently made an appearance in South Park</a>, of all things.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, a very small amount of animated footage widely believed to be from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> was featured in a demo reel by a Rockstar employee, which highlighted their work for the company.</p>
<p>The Rockstar footage itself appeared to come from animator Benjamin Chue and was pretty minimal in the grand scheme of GTA 6 things. However, along with clips from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, there was also a short montage of incomplete work showing a character taking a bike out from a rental kiosk, and then riding it.</p>
<p>The background from this footage was entirely grey, and the bike itself, which was yellow, also looked to be in the early stages of animation. On its frame, the word LomBike could be seen, likely a play on the real-world micromobility company Lime, <a href="https://www.electricvehicleshq.com/post/micromobility-fleet-expansion-lime-launches-limebike-and-limeglider-to-grow-electric-fleet">and its own LimeBike rental</a>. This trend would, of course, follow earlier GTA 6 leaks. Back in September, a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-leak-reveals-potential-in-game-sites-that-parody-uber-and-more">leaked in-game websites and apps appeared to parody the likes of Uber and WhatsApp</a>.</p>

<p>Another two incomplete clips featured within the demo reel showed a female character – which was likely one of GTA6's dual protagonists Lucia– with a pickup truck. In the first snippet, the character could be seen sitting on the back of the truck before swinging her legs around to jump out. In the second clip, the same character started off on the roof of the truck, before she jumped into the boot, and then onto the road beside the vehicle.</p><p>And, that's it. So, what's the big deal? Really, the footage doesn't show us anything <em>that </em>major. However, the fact that the footage was once available online and has since been removed has garnered attention from the GTA 6 community. You see, in removing the footage from the internet, developer Rockstar has essentially confirmed it was a legitimate leak from its upcoming game, rather unlike the AI efforts that have been making the rounds recently.</p>
<p>One of these supposed 'leaks', for example, showed a character meant to be GTA 6's Lucia making her way around Vice City. Another AI 'leak' showed Lucia getting up and out of a pool, before cutting to scenes in a bar. All of this sloppy AI footage is still available online, and is clearly no threat to Rockstar.</p>
<p>Chue's footage, meanwhile, has been removed from Vimeo where it was initially hosted. If you try and find it on that platform now, <a href="https://vimeo.com/1115554961/purgatory">you will be met with the message: "Sorry, we couldn't find that page"</a>.</p>

<p>Along with leaks and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">GTA 6 game delays</a>, developer Rockstar is currently making additional headlines following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">firing of staff members in a move seen by many as 'union busting'</a>. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">over 200 employees from Rockstar North signed a letter to management</a>, in which they condemned its actions. Rockstar's controversial dismissal of its employees has since been brought up in UK Parliament, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine urging "Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again"</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, a report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">former Rockstar Games staff were fired due to internal company messages being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>CD Projekt Red has reaffirmed plans to release an entire new trilogy of The Witcher games within six years.</p>
<p>Joint studio <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">CEO Michał Nowakowski told investors as much during a recent financial call</a>.</p>
<p>"In a way, yes, I do believe that further games should be delivered in a shorter period of time," Nowakowski said. "As we had stated before, our plan still is to launch the whole trilogy within a six-year period, so yes, that would mean we would plan to have a shorter development time between [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>] and [The Witcher 5], between TW5 and TW6 and so on."</p>
<p>That means, assuming The Witcher 4 launches in 2027 (I'll come back to this point), that this entire new trilogy of Witcher games could be released by 2033 - perhaps one in 2027, one in 2030, and one in 2033. Note, we do not know when The Witcher 4 will launch. The only concrete date-related information we have is that the game will <em>not </em>be released in 2026.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHuw6gZxqcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>As Nowakoswki said during the investor call: "As we have already stated, The Witcher 4 is in the full-scale production phase. We're not disclosing any details regarding the target release date, so there's not a point in time I could refer to when answering such a question. The only thing we're commenting is that we're not launching in 2026..."</p><p>The Witcher 4 <em>could </em>launch in 2027, then - that's the earliest it could appear. But it could be released in 2028 as well, or later. Perhaps CD Projekt Red will take longer to release the first game of the trilogy to ensure the foundations are laid for smoother and speedier development of games two and three.</p>
<p>Remember, one of the biggest challenges with this new trilogy is transitioning the studio to Unreal Engine 5. The Witcher 4 is the first game in decades that CD Projekt Red has used an engine other than its own to make; the last time was using BioWare's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a> Aurora engine to make The Witcher 1. Since then, the studio has used iterations of its own internally made Red engine.</p>
<p>"We've been using UE5 for The Witcher 4 for almost four years now and we're very happy with what we've achieved," Nowakowski said during the investor call. "I think you could have seen some of that with your own eyes with our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">tech demo reveal at Unreal Fest a couple of months ago</a>, and we're very happy with the results of that as well – we've already said that, but I'm always happy to say it again – and we're happy with how the engine is evolving through the Epic team's efforts, and how we are learning how to make it work within a huge open-world game, as TW4 is meant to be."</p>

<p>CD Projekt Red is also using Unreal Engine 5 to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-1-remake-will-be-open-world-modern-reimagining">remake its first Witcher game</a> - a project inextricably linked to The Witcher 4, given the shared engine, and the up-front work that needs to be done tailoring it for the studio's needs. Because of that, most of the Fool's Theory team - the studio handling The Witcher 1 remake; a studio made up of former CDPR developers (which made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-thaumaturge-review-a-refreshingly-different-polish-rpg">The Thaumaturge, a pretty decent original RPG</a>) - has been shuffled to help with The Witcher 4, which presumably takes precedent over The Witcher 1 remake.</p><p>"I think we stated in the past that the majority of the team is currently involved in the other project, and also support for The Witcher 4," Nowakowski said, "so there is some limited team working on TW1, but since it's very much tied with TW4 development, this is also why we made this move, and we have explained that in the past. So, for TW1 per se, it's a smaller group of people."</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure which other project he's referring to, by the way. It's an unannounced project, but whether it has anything to do with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">Hadar, the codenamed new IP</a> that a small team is working on, I don't know.</p>
<p>To return to the question in the headline: can CD Projekt Red release three Witcher games in six years? We haven't seen another RPG studio do a similar thing since BioWare released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> trilogy in five years. Typically, most projects of this size these days suffer delays. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-delayed-again-now-due-may-2015">The Witcher 3 was delayed three times</a> until it eventually came out in May 2015, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-delay-necessary-for-last-minute-work-on-current-consoles-dev-says">Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed four times</a> until it arrived in December 2020. Even assuming CD Projekt Red doesn't delay The Witcher 4, 5, or 6, those previous games highlight lengthening development times - five years between Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and seven years between Cyberpunk and The Witcher 4, assuming it releases in 2027. To believe CD Projekt Red can suddenly narrow that gap to three years between games is a leap of faith to make.</p>
