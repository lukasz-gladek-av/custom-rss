            <p>
Sirens of the Deep, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s latest animated The Witcher movie - which is perhaps most notable for the fact it'll see Doug Cockle reprising his video game role as the gravelly voiced Geralt of Rivia - now has a release date, and is streaming from 11th February.
</p>
<p>
Sirens of the Deep is based on The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski's short story A Little Sacrifice, and begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. One thing leads to another, however, and everybody's favourite white-haired grump soon finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.
</p>
<p>
"He must count on friends â€” old and new," Netflix teases in its announcement, "to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war."

<p>
Geralt will be joined by Anya Chalotra and Joey Batey, reprising their live-action TV series roles of Yennefer and Jaskier respectively, and the whole thing is being directed by Kang Hei Chul - who helmed Netflix's previous animated Witcher movie, 2021's surprisingly decent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-best-look-yet-at-the-witchers-animated-prequel">Nightmare of the Wolf</a>. And if that's whet your appetite, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYzqa1CDTik">new two-minute trailer</a> to view.
</p><p>
As for what's next for Netflix's The Witcher, that'll be season four of the streaming service's divisive live-action adaptation, which sees Liam Hemsworth taking over the role of Geralt of Rivia following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Henry Cavill's departure</a> in 2022. But if it's more Cockle you want, he'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">be back</a> in CD Projekt's recently unveiled next Witcher game - although not as the protagonist, given <a href="hhttps://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Ciri is officially the focus this time around</a>.

Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders, the ski-based sequel to developer Megagon Industries' acclaimed biking game Lonely Mountains: Downhill, now has a release date and is launching for Xbox, PC, and Game Pass next Tuesday, 21st January.
</p>
<p>
As was the case with 2019's Lonely Mountains: Downhill, Snow Riders is all about getting from the top to the bottom of those gorgeously low-poly peaks as stylishly or as speedily as possible - albeit with those mountains now festooned with ice and blanketed in thick snow.
</p>
<p>
Snow Riders' meticulously crafted mountains feature the usual deluge of craftily concealed shortcuts to seek out in a bid to shave precious seconds off descent times, and there's a new tricks system too. But the big difference is the introduction of online multiplayer, turning what was previously an occassionally serene solitary pursuit into a decidedly more chaotic affair.

Solo play is still available, of course, but it's joined by team-based co-op - which sees players sharing their limited checkpoints - alongside competitive races. And that's on top of challenges to complete, plus new equipment, outfits, and tricks to unlock along the way.
</p><p>
Lonely Mountains: Downhill was an absolute treat (Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-lonely-mountains-downhill-is-a-magic-game-of-pure-sensation">called it</a> "magic" when it made Eurogamer's top picks list in 2019), and Snow Riders' recent Steam demo suggests Megagon Industries has another winner on its hands. All will be revealed when it launches for Xbox, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545360/Lonely_Mountains_Snow_Riders/">Steam</a>, and Game Pass in exactly one week's time, on 21st January.
