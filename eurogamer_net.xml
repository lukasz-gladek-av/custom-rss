            <p>
Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veteran Trick Weekes is among a group of BioWare veterans who have announced they are now looking for work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-many-staff-moved-elsewhere-in-ea-as-core-team-focuses-on-mass-effect-5-in-downsized-studio">following the news that BioWare is downsizing</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Posting on social media, Weekes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lgw2zbjhfc2v">said</a> they were now seeking a fresh writing position after two decades at BioWare, culminating in work on last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, BioWare publicly confirmed what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">former studio veteran Mark Darrah had previously noted</a> - that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> was still early in development and that the studio had therefore shifted a large number of its staff onto other projects within publisher EA while a small "core team" continued to build the project up. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-5-bioware-doesnt-require-support-from-the-full-studio-ea-moves-some-staff-to-other-teams">IGN</a> later reported that a smaller group of BioWare employees had been told their roles had been terminated, and been given time to apply for new positions within EA.
</p>
<p>
This was reflected in half a dozen posts on social media from staff impacted by the redundancies, who had held senior positions on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
"I'm now looking for a new writing/narrative position," Weekes wrote. "It's been a privilege to work with so many amazing devs over my 20 years at BioWare, and I will cherish the memories of the wonderful folks in the community I've met along the way. Thank you all."
</p><p>
Weekes served as a writer on Mass Effect 1 and 2, before being promoted to a senior writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>. Weekes contributed to that game's brilliant genophage story arc, and also wrote for many of the series' best DLCs, including Lair of the Shadow Broker, Leviathan and Citadel.
</p>
<p>
More recently, Weekes served as a writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, and then as a lead writer on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
Other BioWare staff who have publicly said they are looking for work include editor <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/karinww.bsky.social/post/3lgw2z5u3js2z">Karin West-Weekes</a> and narrative designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ryancorm.bsky.social/post/3lgw7ga2li22x">Ryan Cormier</a>, as well as producer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jencheverie.bsky.social/post/3lgw5mb2srs27">Jen Cheverie</a> and systems designer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kaieta.bsky.social/post/3lgvksfm67k2v">Michelle Flamm</a>. 
</p>
<p>
According to a social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tflvwodepuhh3xoi43fvvjua/post/3lgw5bffuqc26">post</a> by former BioWare writer Ann Lemay, who worked at the studio between 2011 and 2016, the studio now no longer employs any writers or editors from that period, following this week's cuts and a number of previous departures.
</p>
<p>
For better or worse, then, it looks like Mass Effect 5 will be written by a completely separate team of people from those who worked on Dragon Age: The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's next big project is being helmed by Mass Effect veteran Mike Gamble, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-developer-bioware-highlights-crack-team-of-trilogy-veterans">alongside a team of returning staff who worked on the original Mass Effect trilogy</a> such as Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts and Parrish Ley.
</p>
<p>
This group is now set to continue BioWare's early work on Mass Effect 5, which - despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">numerous teases of what's in store</a> - is still several years away.

            <p>
The Japanese Nintendo eShop and My Nintendo Store will stop accepting card payments and Paypal from foreign accounts next month.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo made the announcement today, and said the decision had been taken "in order to prevent fraudulent use". 
</p>
<p>
As of 25th March, overseas customers who wish to continue using the Japanese eShop or My Nintendo Store will need to use an alternative payment method.

<p>
"Thank you very much for your continued patronage of our products," Nintendo wrote in a <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/information/2025/0130.html">statement</a> on its customer support website.
</p>
<p>
"For customers who have previously used overseas-issued credit cards or PayPal accounts opened overseas, we ask that you please use other payment methods, such as credit cards issued in Japan, from now on."
</p>
<p>
The removal of foreign cards and Paypal payments makes for a significant barrier for anyone wishing to make purchases from the Japanese eShop - for instance to buy a game not released elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo may be looking to cut down on the number of people with multiple accounts on their console, with the ability to then browse different country's eShops and compare prices, ahead of the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
An easier option than obtaining a Japanese credit card remains the ability to purchase pre-paid Nintendo eShop vouchers - although these will need to also be for use in Japan.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-loses-trademark-fight-against-super-mario-supermarket">Nintendo had failed to stop a supermarket named Super Mario</a> from officially registering its name.

            <p>
A TV series based on Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beyond-two-souls">Beyond: Two Souls</a> is in development, with Elliot Page's production company attached.
</p>
<p>
Despite the swathe of film and TV projects based on video games in the works right now, this one is something of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
First released for PlayStation 3 way back in 2013, Beyond: Two Souls is another stylish but somewhat nonsensical narrative adventure by the maker of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and, later, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>.

<p>
Page starred in the game as Jodie, a girl with special powers and a mysterious connection to a ghostly presence, alongside Willem Dafoe, who plays a creepy government researcher/father figure.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, Page's time working on the project was notable for the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ellen-page-explored-legal-action-154256357.html">legal action lodged in response to Beyond: Two Souls' gratuitous shower scene</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Upon the game's launch, it was discovered that Quantic Dream had made a detailed nude model of Jodie's character for use in this scene (to the apparent surprise of Page, as the scene itself does not show any actual nudity). 
</p>
<p>
The model was quickly found  within the game's files and then spread online, prompting Page to explore the possibility of a lawsuit. Sony, the game's publisher, later sent takedown notices to websites hosting images of the character model.
</p>
<p>
"Filming the game was one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of my career," Page said in a fresh statement to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/beyond-two-souls-video-game-television-series-elliot-page-pageboy-1236267129/">Deadline</a>, which was first to report news of the game's TV adaptation. 
</p>
<p>
"The story's rich narrative and emotional depth offer us a fantastic foundation. We want to create a unique vision of the characters and their journeys that resonates with fans and newcomers."
</p>
<p>
Beyond: Two Souls writer and director David Cage said he was "absolutely thrilled to collaborate again" with Page. "I know that Elliot has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV," he added.
</p>
<p>
"Beyond has epic scope, preposterous premise and high-octane action," former editor Oli Welsh wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-two-souls-review">Eurogamer's Beyond: Two Souls review</a>. "But perhaps what David Cage and his dream need are limitations - limitations that Sony's blank cheque has singularly failed to impose on this sprawling, over-reaching game."

            <p>
Microsoft is celebrating having the best-selling game on both Xbox and PlayStation platforms over the last quarter, thanks to its new ownership of the Call of Duty franchise.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launched last October and has been a success for Microsoft, which namechecked the title during its latest financial results.
</p>
<p>
"Black Ops 6... saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in franchise history," Microsoft boss Satya Nadella boasted during a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q2">call</a> with investors.

<p>
"We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140m hours streamed this quarter," he continued.
</p>
<p>
Nadella also called out the brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and gave our first indication of how well MachineGames' globe-trotting adventure is doing.
</p>
<p>
"We saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than four million people," Nadella said.
</p>
<p>
Both of these statistics will reflect players who bought either game outright, as well as those who have played via Game Pass on both PC and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, of course, the PS5 launch of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is still to come - sometime in the first half of this year.
</p>
<p>
Revenue for Xbox's gaming and content division, which includes Game Pass, rose two percent over three months of 2024 thanks to a surge of subscribers on PC. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-sales-slump-but-game-pass-is-surging">Microsoft's wider gaming revenue was still down year-on-year overall, offset by the continued slump of Xbox hardware sales</a>.
