Destiny: Rising, the free-to-play mobile version of Bungie's long-running sci-fi shooter series, has been given a release date. It'll officially be whisking players away for some alternate-timeline shenanigans when it comes to Android and iOS on 28th August.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-neteast-unveil-free-to-play-mobile-shooter-destiny-rising-with-closed-alpha-coming-soon">last October</a>, Destiny: Rising is a collaboration between Bungie and Chinese publisher NetEase, and is officially described as a "shared world" adventure set in an "alternate Destiny timeline, exploring a narrative in the post-Dark Age era". It's a result of a partnership the two companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-moves-to-reassure-destiny-fans-after-securing-usd100m-for-new-game">initially announced</a> - albeit in vague terms - back in 2018.
</p>
<p>
After a period of closed alpha testing that began last November, Destiny: Rising is almost ready for its full launch, which'll see players - in the role of a "fully customisable" Lightbearer named Wolf - embarking on a sci-fi adventure stretching from the sanctuary of Haven to the "icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift."

<p>
Destiny's familiar looter-shooter action is said to remain at the heart of the experience, and there's talk of "dynamic and challenging" single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer gameplay, plus various open-world objectives, missions, strikes, PvP battles, and six-player PvE activities. That's alongside customisable Primary and Power Weapons, the ability for characters to share compatible weapons across their arsenal, a new Mythic rarity gear tier, and more.
</p>
<p>
In a bid to encourage pre-registrations ahead of Destiny: Rising's 28th August release, NetEase is holding a pre-launch event that'll provide special in-game bonuses to anyone that registers their interest ahead of time. More rewards unlock as new registration milestones are crossed, and if that sounds like the sort of thing you want to support, you should direct your attention to <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/c6f53fla">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/kxdnllj3">App Store</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Daddy Destiny (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, if you must), Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">recently announced its next major multi-year story arc</a>, the Fate Saga. It begins with a new paid expansion, titled The Edge of Fate, that arrives on 15th July alongside a free "core game update" for all players. Weirder is this year's second paid expansion, Renegades, which launches on 2nd December and promises to be "integral" to Destiny 2's new Fate Saga, despite its Star Wars theme.

            <p>If the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem is not enough newness for all you zombie-loving fans, then I have some good news. Today, a new strategy game based on Capcom's Resi series has been announced.</p>
<p>It's known as Resident Evil Survival Unit, and is set for release across mobile devices. While Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, Capcom is working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality".</p>

<p>Details on what the game will look like and involve for now remain somewhat mysterious, though we can look forward to finding out more later this month, with a showcase planned for 10th July. It will take place at 11pm UK time.</p>
<p>The studios have said Resident Evil Survival Unit will "appeal to both longtime fans and new players". While we don't yet have a release date, it will be available globally across Japan, South Korea, North America, Europe, and Asia whenever it does arrive.</p>
<p>Along with this info, some artwork for Resident Evil Survival Unit was shared, showing a car driving down a road as a lightning storm rages. To one side, a sign for Umbrella - yes, that rather questionable corporation - declares that "our business is life itself…". The two people on the sign smile away. Oh, what poor sweet fools.</p>
<p>In terms of the Resi timeline, Umbrella itself went defunct in 2003, following the Raccoon Trials. Given this, we can perhaps surmise from the artwork that Resident Evil Survival Unit at least takes place before that time.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the series,  we got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p>
<p>Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dying Light developer Techland has confirmed there have been no staff reductions following the reported cancellation of two in-development games.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">Pulz Biznesu</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/dying-light-developer-techland-cancels-two-upcoming-games-including-its-new-fantasy-rpg-ip">GameWatcher</a>), the developer published record losses of 135m zl (£27.4m) for 2024, as per the <a href="https://ekrs.ms.gov.pl/rdf/pd/search_df">Polish National Court Register</a>. While the two projects have not been named, it's presumed one is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-working-on-open-world-fantasy-action-rpg">fantasy RPG revealed in May 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement to Eurogamer, a spokesperson for Techland said: "Game development is never a straight line, and sometimes fresh approaches are necessary to make great games. What's important here is that none of the reported changes have resulted in staff reductions. Developers were moved to other projects and are working on a number of games in our pipeline.</p>

<p>"Our primary focus right now is to release Dying Light: The Beast for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. After the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, we will share more about future titles in due time."</p>
<p>Little is known about the fantasy RPG, though the company recruited top talent from the likes of CD Projekt Red, Arkane, and Guerrilla Games.</p>
<p>"We're very happy with what we have accomplished with the Dying Light franchise so far," said Paweł Marchewka, Techland CEO, at the time of the game's announcement.</p>
<p>"At the same time, our ambition is to introduce a brand new IP that is vastly different from what we have been doing for the past several years. We want to create a fully next-gen experience. A new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world, fueled by the skills and experience we have gained as a team over the years, infused with new ideas, passion, and creativity."</p>
<p>Although the record losses are significant, Techland's most recently released game was Dying Light 2 back in 2022. The first Dying Light, released in 2015, was a massive hit for the company, selling 20m copies as of 2022. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">sequel sold 5m in around two months</a>.</p>
<p>The company's next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, coming 22nd August.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">Techland announced it would be releasing multiple projects in the Dying Light series</a>, including board games and a webcomic. Following these new cancellations, it seems the company is focusing on its most successful franchise.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions]]></content:encoded>
