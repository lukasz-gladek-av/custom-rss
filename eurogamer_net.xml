CD Projekt Red is still updating its sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, now releasing Patch 2.31 across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Mac, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The patch updates AutoDrive so vehicles drive smoothly, overtake blocking vehicles, and won't stop at traffic lights. There's also an adjustment to Photo Mode so that poses work with any gender and NPC collision has been disabled.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere there are a number of fixes and tweaks, including some specific to PC and Mac. You can see the full patch notes below.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Vehicles</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updated AutoDrive. When driving to a selected point, the vehicle now drives smoothly, overtakes blocking vehicles, and no longer stops at traffic lights. Free Roam mode has also been upgraded to follow traffic rules and navigate the city more reliably.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Johnny always spawned in the passenger seat when using the Delamain Cab service.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where applying CrystalCoat to the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru caused its wheels to flash in different colors.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Photo Mode</strong>
<ul>
<li>Most of the new poses introduced in Update 2.3 now work with any gender.</li>
<li>Disabled NPC collision, which will make it easier to position NPCs on top of other objects with collision (e.g. on car hoods).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where some of the poses didn't work for Royce.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Quests &amp; Open World</strong>
<ul>
<li>Freedom - Fixed the journal entry that appears when the player chooses not to steal the Rayfield Caliburn "Mordred."</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Fixed an issue where, after V fails to pursue and stop Semimaru and receives a text from River saying he'll contact V soon, the follow-up message never arrives.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Fixed an issue where the Yaiba Semimaru could flip over during the chase, preventing the player from entering it.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - It's no longer possible to trigger the quest if River died during The Hunt.</li>
<li>Motorbreath - Players can now acquire the Yaiba ARV-Q340 Semimaru through AUTOFIXER even if they failed The Hunt, which normally unlocks the side quest where the vehicle is obtained.</li>
<li>Nitro (Youth Energy) - Fixed a game crash that could occur in certain circumstances after leaving the Yaiba showroom event.</li>
<li>Nitro (Youth Energy) - Fixed an issue where the proxy interface UI in the Yaiba showroom is cut off when the "Larger HUD Elements" setting is enabled.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed several localization and lipsync issues in various languages.</li>
<li>Added a toggle to disable vignette. It can be found in Settings → Graphics → Basic.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on PC and Mac where Ray-Traced Reflections might not display correctly when enabled under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with displaying text messages from Delamain.</li>
<li>Various fixes for fluff vendors.</li>
</ul>
<strong>PC-specific</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where NVIDIA Reflex could be disabled while DLSS Frame Generation was enabled, causing the screen to turn pink.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Path Tracing didn't activate properly in certain scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Mac-specific</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where changing graphics presets on Mac set Screen Space Reflections to a higher setting compared to the equivalent presets on PC.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing a permanent white screen when Frame Generation is enabled while entering the braindance in The Information.</li>
<li>Selecting "Defaults" in Video Settings no longer turns HDR Mode off.</li>
<li>Fixed the inverted behavior of the "Mute Game in Background" toggle in Settings.</li>
<li>Removed the outdated "(Requires Game Restart)" disclaimer from the mouseover description of the "Disable Spatial Audio" setting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue on the App Store version that caused the game to become stuck on the “Press Space to continue” breaching screen.</li>
<li>Various stability and performance optimizations.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Really it's remarkable CDPR is still so committed to updating the game years after release - it's better now than it's ever been.

        <p>And its director is now busy elsewhere.</p>

            <p>
Three years after Netflix announced it was turning Irrational Games' acclaimed underwater shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> into a live-action film, its producer has suggested its still some way off, confirming that work continues on its script.
</p>
<p>
The streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-turning-bioshock-into-a-live-action-film">first publicly discussed a BioShock movie back in February 2022</a>, when it was accompanied by grandiose talk of developing a whole cinematic universe around the BioShock games. After a lengthy silence, producer Roy Lee last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-bioshock-adaptation-will-be-a-more-personal-film-as-opposed-to-a-grander-big-project">confirmed plans had changed</a> and that budget cuts at Netflix meant it would now be a "much smaller" film told from a "more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project."
</p>
<p>
Another year on, and Lee is chattering again, this time offering an update on the project's progress in conversation with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/bioshock-movie-story-game">The Direct</a>. As to why it's taking so long, he explained in part that's down to the BioShock movie having been delayed a "little bit" so the team could do "some more script work". Amid all this, director Francis Lawrence has been busy with the movie adaptation of Stephen King's The Long Walk, and he'll remain occupied helming the upcoming The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping. "So it's just waiting for him whenever the Hunger Games is completed," Lee added.

<p>
Additionally, Lee confirmed the BioShock movie's script is still "being worked on right now". But the hope seems to be it'll be ready by the time Sunrise on the Reaping is done. As to what the movie will focus on, Lee remains cagey, saying, "Netflix wants us to keep everything under wraps". He did, however, reveal it'll definitely be based on Irrational's first BioShock game.
</p><p>
Netflix isn't the first company to attempt a BioShock movie. Back in 2008, Universal announced its own adaptation with Pirates of the Caribbean director Gore Verbinski onboard - but it never came to fruition. Explaining the project's demise in 2013, BioShock creator Ken Levine <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why">revealed publisher 2K had given him the option to cancel it</a> after Verbinski's departure - and so he did.
</p>
<p>A fourth BioSchock game, originally announced in 2019, is currently in the works at developer Cloud Chamber, but 2K recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-studio-reportedly-facing-layoffs-as-former-diablo-boss-takes-over-amid-development-turmoil">confirmed</a> it was "reducing the size of the development team" as it looks to "rework certain aspects" of the purportedly troubled project.
