            <p>
Three former senior Ubisoft employees - including one-time chief creative officer and second-in-command Serge Hascoet - have received suspended prison sentences and fines from a French court after being found guilty of harassment prior to their departure five years ago.
</p>
<p>
Hascoet - along with Ubisoft's former editorial boss Tommy François and game director Guillaume Patrux - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ubisoft-execs-stand-trial-in-france-accused-of-harassment">appeared in a French court earlier this year</a>, accused of psychological and sexual harassment during their time at the company. All three left Ubisoft in 2020, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">wave of resignations and dismissals</a> among senior employees and executives, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-on-ubisoft-reveals-more-shocking-sexual-harassment-allegations">serious allegations of sexual misconduct become public</a>.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">reported by the Guardian</a>, Francois has now received a three-year suspended prison sentence and a €30,000 fine after being found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment, and an attempted sexual assault. During the trial, it was alleged Francois had restrained a female employee while trying to kiss her on the mouth. He was also accused of forcing a female co-worker to do handstands while she wore a skirt, alongside other incidents.
</p>
<p>
Hascoët - who faced accusations of racist comments and other behaviour during the trial - was found guilty of psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment by the court, receiving an eight-month suspended sentence and a fine of €45,000. Patrux has been handed a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €10,000 after being convicted of psychological harassment. During the trial, it was alleged Patrux had punched walls, mimed hitting staff, and set fire to a colleague's beard with a cigarette lighter, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2020, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-weeks-of-devastating-sexual-harassment-allegations-ubisoft-boss-yves-guillemot-is-asked-how-much-he-knew">asked how much he knew of the issues taking place in his company</a> prior to the sexual misconduct allegations becoming public, Ubisoft CEO and co-founder Yves Guillemot said, "I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will" in a carefully worded statement. "It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and did not live up to Ubisoft's shared values," he added.
