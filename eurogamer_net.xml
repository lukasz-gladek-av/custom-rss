        <p>But company is confident player account information remains secure.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works has suffered a "data leakage due to unauthorised access".</p>
<p>In a brief <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/notice-regarding-data-leakage-due-to-unauthorized-access/">statement</a>, the company said that while its systems had been illegally accessed by a third-party and data was leaked, it didn't believe the leak included any "personal information or player account information".</p>

<p>"We regret to announce that we have discovered that our systems were illegally accessed by a third party and that data held by us was leaked to outside parties," the statement read.</p>
<p>"As of May 12, we have not confirmed the leak of any user personal information or player account information due to the unauthorised access. We are working diligently to determine the cause of the unauthorised access and the extent of the impact with the help of outside experts, and we will inform you if any new facts are discovered as a result of the investigation.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologise to all for any inconvenience and concern this may cause. We are truly sorry."</p>
<p>The statement closed on imploring people not to try and access the data that was allegedly leaked, "as there is a possibility that it may cause malware infection".</p>
<p>What information, exactly, the leakers <em>did</em> manage to access remains to be seen. Arc System Works hasn't said if it was employee data or information pertaining to unreleased or unannounced game projects, but <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-source-code-leak-explained-season-5-characters-discovered-3193826/">Dexerto</a> reported earlier this month, before Arc's statement, that Guilty Gear Strive's source code was leaked, including "new data" about the game's story and characters.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first time a studio's plans been hacked and prematurely leaked. In December 2023, PlayStation-owned Spider-Man developer Insomniac had detailed plans of future projects published online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">stolen from the company by hackers</a>, and then ransomed for $2m. The files include a project roadmap for the next decade and beyond including an array of unannounced projects, plus production details, art assets, and personal information on Insomniac employees.</p>
<p>Perhaps more famously still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">90+ videos and screenshots from Rockstar's then-unannounced GTA 6 also leaked online early in September 2022</a> after a hacker managed to access its internal systems.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Developer Shift Up said it was "closely discussing the region lock issue" with Sony after it became apparent yesterday, Friday 16th May, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">Stellar Blade Steam's release on 11th June has been blocked in over 120 countries</a> without explanation.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/stellarblade/status/1923430874391118044">brief statement</a> posted to social media, the developer stressed it was doing its "BEST" to resolve "most of" the issue as soon as possible and would come back to players "as soon as [it] has more to share".</p>

<p>After players also discovered that Denuvo has been incorporated in the PC version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, much to the annoyance of some, the studio also took the opportunity to provide a chart to demonstrate DRM had been "hard-tuned to maintain the same average frame rate, with even higher minimum frames in some cases".</p>
<p>"Mods are fully supported without any restrictions. PSN connecting entirely optional and NEVER required. Both the PC and PS5 versions offer the same content. We will make sure that early buyers are never at a disadvantage through future updates," the studio stressed.</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement, which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">company quickly u-turned its decision</a> following the backlash. It would appear Stellar Blade is experiencing a similar issue, although Shift Up has stated a PSN account is only optional and not required.</p>
<p>We gave Stellar Blade four stars out of five in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's Stellar Blade review</a>, writing: "Stellar Blade has a fair bit of weirdness, but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Just a year after release, Activision is "streamlining" and ending support for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, ceasing all seasonal content.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447">statement</a>, the developer said while it understood "this news may be disappointing", the mobile shooter had "not met [its] expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences."</p>

<p>"We deeply appreciate your dedication and passion for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Going forward, we will be streamlining the scope of the game. This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," the statement began.</p>
<p>"As a result, we will no longer be delivering new seasonal content and gameplay updates to the mobile version. Effective immediately, players will no longer be able to purchase Call of Duty Points or Black Cell using real currency in Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile. Sunday, May 18, 2025 will be the last day the game can be downloaded from the Google Play and Apple‚Äôs App Store and social features across both mobile platforms will be retired."</p>
<p>Players who install the game before next Monday, 19th May, will still be able to play, complete with cross-progression and shared inventories. They'll also be able to use unspent COD Points. After Monday, however, the game will no longer be downloadable from mobile stores, nor will players be able to spend any further real currency on COD Points or Battle Passes.</p>
<p>It's not clear how long the game will stay online, but Activision <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes">stressed</a>, "refunds are not available for previously purchased in-game content on unused COD Points".</p>
<p>"We know that this news may be disappointing, and we truly appreciate the support, passion, feedback, and dedication from our community," the statement added. "We have special incentives for Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile players in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-mobile">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> and encourage our players to try it for free."</p>
<p>Activision's sibling Call of Duty mobile game, which is different from Warzone, is seemingly faring much better. In May 2022, the publisher revealed<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-mobile-reaches-650m-downloads"> the mobile title had reached an impressive 650 million downloads</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/PlayCODMobile/status/1853527640516293059">a billion by November 2024</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
