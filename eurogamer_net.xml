            <p>The creator of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> VR mod, as well as a variety of other R.E.A.L VR mods, has taken his works down from Patreon after receiving another DMCA strike. This time, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> developer 505 Games.</p>
<p>Luke Ross, the creator of many VR mods for games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> and others, issued a post on his Patreon explaining the situation to his supporters.</p>
<p>It reads: "DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they 'believe' their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like -- and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process."</p>

<p>The post continues: "In light of the above facts, I'm being forced to take immediate action. I'm making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims."

"And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time." Ross also stated his Patreon account is at risk of termination due to repeated DMCA strikes, resulting in his decision to strip his account of all of his VR mods."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-removed-by-cd-projekt-after-its-creator-wouldnt-release-it-for-free">This comes following a previous DMCA strike from CD Projekt Red</a>, which claimed Ross' Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod broke its fan works guidelines and as such was a breach of its intellectual property. Ross kicked back at the claim, but nonetheless took the mod down. He then felt he was being punished by pirates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-creator-says-hes-being-punished-by-pirates-after-mod-take-down">who were sharing around his work without contributing to his Patreon account to "punish" him</a>, according to Ross.</p>
