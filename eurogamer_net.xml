            <p>A mobile version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> has officially been revealed.</p>
<p>The in-development game was announced by Final Fantasy 14 director and producer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-owned Lightspeed Studio behind development. The studio previously developed PUBG Mobile.</p>
<p>"This is our latest MMORPG title specifically tailored for the mobile platform," said Yoshida in a video announcing the project. "Despite these adjustments Lightspeed Studios is working with tremendous enthusiasm and dedication to faithfully recreate the story, duties, battle content and other aspects of the original game."</p>

<p>He continued: "I hope both current FF14 players and those who are interested in exploring its story will look forward to what's coming next."</p>
<p>The video provides a first look at gameplay, which shows a fully-realised version of Eorzea from the cities of Ul'dah and Limsa Lominsa, to the Gold Saucer and even a battle against the Primal Titan.</p>

<p>As noted on the <a href="https://ffxivmobile.com/web202409/index.html#/">game's website</a>, nine jobs will be available at launch out of the full game's 22 battle jobs. While these aren't listed, imagery suggests the likes of Black Mage, Warrior, Dragoon, Bard, and White Mage will all be playable.</p>
<p>What's more, all 11 crafting and gathering jobs will be included, as well as side activities like Triple Triad, chocobo racing, and home customisation.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 has already received over 30 million registered players and has proven a huge success for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>. It's no wonder a mobile version is in development to boost that further.</p>
<p>This mobile version, along with the Tencent collaboration, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-reportedly-coming-to-mobile">rumoured back in July this year</a>. A month later, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-game-is-approved-in-china">approved in China</a>.</p>
<p>While a release date is unknown, a demo through multiple play tests will soon be available in China, with a global launch planned afterwards. Fans can pre-register now.</p>
<p>The expansion to mobile is part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's "aggressive" push to multiplatform releases</a> to "diversify earnings opportunities".</p>
<p>For current players of Final Fantasy 14, the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9b42b2425f3a680caea3281ccd65c99677cb00e2/">latest Patch 7.1</a> was released earlier this month, bringing the Final Fantasy 11 themed raid series as well as new story content.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's update time for the PlayStation Portal, and Sony's latest release offers something markedly more exciting than usual: cloud streaming is coming to the handheld device if you're a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus Premium</a> member, albeit initially as a beta.
</p>
<p>
Since its launch last year, the £200 PlayStation Portal - a PS5 peripheral rather than a standalone device - has enabled owners to stream games from their console to the smaller 1080p screen, with Sony pitching it as a way to share a living room TV or play PS5 games in another room of the house. Its uses were somewhat limited then, but Sony's latest update marks the great untethering, enabling PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to play "select PS5 games" from the PS Plus Game Catalogue via the cloud, even without a PS5.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">Sony's announcement post</a>, over 120 games will be supported during the beta, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>. Games can be streamed at up to 1080p/60fps (requiring a minimum internet connection of 13 Mbps) with major DualSense wireless controller features supported alongside cloud-based saves.

<p>
"Since Cloud Streaming (Beta) on PS Portal is still an experimental offering," Sony notes, "the features available during the beta period may change over time and may not reflect the final experience." Game Trials, the ability to stream games purchased on the PS Store, system features such as Party voice chat and game invites for select games, the Create button, 3D audio, and in-game commerce are all unavailable at these "beginning stages of publicly testing", for instance. Furthermore, players will initially only have access to PS5 games, with PS4 and PS3 games remaining unsupported for the time being. 
</p><p>
Once the beta is available, it can be accessed via an updated PS Portal by going to Quick Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Cloud Streaming (Beta), and then turning the toggle to 'on'. And if that all goes as planned, players should then see a new option on their PS Portal home screen enabling them to access games via cloud streaming. Alongside cloud streaming, Sony's latest PlayStation Portal update - which is available from today - introduces various "refinements in the audio experience", as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">detailed on the PlayStation Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">called the PlayStation Portal</a> an "interesting gadget" when it launched last year, despite the sense "Remote Play itself isn't as good as it should be." Richard also explicitly called out the lack of cloud streaming support on the device, so it'll be interesting to see Digital Foundry's response to Sony's latest news.

It'd be fair to say the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">live-action Minecraft movie's first trailer</a> didn't exactly arrive to rapturous applause. But now Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures are back for a second try, this time unleashing the deep Steve lore, tree punching, teleporting Ender Pearls, an unfortunate incident involving a chicken, and even an adorable square bee.
</p>
<p>
It all kicks off with some backstory for Jack Black's gloriously bejumpered Steve, detailing how he chiselled his way to a "wonderland where anything you can imagine is possible, as long as what you imagine can be built out of blocks". One brisk dance sequence later, and we're reintroduced to our cast of more recent newcomers to this strange world: Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (played by Jason Momoa), Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen), Natalie (Emma Myers) and Dawn (Danielle Brooks). Sadly, there's still no sign of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-adds-jennifer-coolidge-to-its-star-studded-cast">Jennifer Coolidge</a>, which is where my primary interest in this whole endeavour lies, but I can wait.
</p>
<p>
But even without everybody's favourite yacht evacuator, it all looks like a harmless bit of enjoyable fluff, featuring Jack Black as his usual effervescent self, some energetic CGI (although the art style is still a little jarring), and - in this second trailer at least - enough Minecraft easter eggs to sate even the most militant eight-year-old fan. It even finds time for a bit of ye olde mild peril - complete with zombies and arrow-launching skeletons - when night falls at the end.

<p>
"Four misfits," explains the official blurb if you're looking for more context, "find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve."
</p><p>
"Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world." And if we can somehow ignore that second paragraph until it pops right out of existence, it doesn't actually sound that bad.
</p>
<p>
The Minecraft movie arrives in cinemas on 4th April next year, and there's also an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">animated Minecraft series on the way</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>, if the whole live-action thing doesn't appeal.
