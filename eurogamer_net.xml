            <p>A number of NetEase Games employees have reportedly been arrested on charges of bribery and money laundering.</p>
<p>As picked up by Chinese site <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html">Leifeng.com</a> and reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/netease-says-police-detained-executives-for-alleged-bribery">Bloomberg Law</a>, NetEase Games' general manager, Xiang Lang, was detained along with NetEase's esports lead, Jin Yuchen, and several other staff on anti-corruption charges.</p>

<p>In an internal memo to staff, NetEase Games - which develops Marvel Rivals and Destiny: Rising - announced it has since dismissed a total of nine staff for alleged bribery. It's thought the case impacts 28 suppliers to the Chinese megacorp in a case worth roughly one billion yuan - that's ¬£107.5 million / $139.3 million.</p>
<p>The names of those implicated have seemingly been removed from NetEase's internal systems and shortly after the arrests, staff still employed at the studio reported that their usual computer screensavers had been replaced by reminders of NetEase's compliance protocols.</p>
<p>This is reportedly the second internal anti-corruption investigation NetEase has organised since September 2023.</p>
<p>A NetEase spokesperson said police were now investigating alleged corruption charges but would not disclose more details at this time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As people continue to get stuck into Dragon Age: The Veilguard this weekend, developer BioWare has shared a number of interesting statistics about its playerbase, including confirmation that High Dragon Corius The Icetalon is the game's "deadliest" enemy.</p>
<p>So far, it looks pretty evenly split across classes - 40 percent of us are playing as Mages, whereas the other 60 percent is spread evenly across Rogues and Warriors. However, the lineage delineations are interesting with 43 percent of us choosing to be human and 40 percent as elf.</p>
<p>The final 17 percent splits across Dwarf and Qunari, at 6 percent and 11 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>Factions are also a little uneven: 24 percent of players opt to play as both Grey Wardens and Shadow Dragons, whilst 16 percent are Antivan Crows. 15 percent of us joined the Veil Jumpers, 11 percent the Lords of Fortune, leaving just one in 10 of us opting to become a Mournwatch.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, more of us have died during the Sea of Blood mission than anywhere else.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>. "From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has filed a new lawsuit against a streamer who broadcast 10 pirated games ahead of their release, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>.</p>
<p>In<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/789755286/Nintendo-vs-Keighin"> papers filed</a> on Wednesday and reported by<a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/476472/nintendo-lawsuit-pirated-games-streamed"> Polygon</a>, Nintendo has taken legal action against streamer Jesse Keighin - streaming as Every Game Guru - who allegedly played 10 unreleased Nintendo games over the last decade.</p>

<p>Nintendo further alleges that as well as broadcasting unreleased games, he also instructed others on how to obtain pirated games via "circumvention devices" Nintendo calls "trafficking".</p>
<p>When Nintendo moved to shutdown Keighin's streams via copyright notices on YouTube, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and other streaming platforms, he reportedly told them he "could do this all day" and had "a thousand burner accounts".</p>
<p>The Japanese megacorp says Keighin's conduct has cost it "millions of dollars" in "lost video game sales". It's seeking ¬£11,600 ($15,000) for each alleged violation of its Copyright Act, ¬£1900 ($2.5K) for each contravention of its anti-circumvention and anti-trafficking provisions in the Copyright Act, and further "actual damages" for the revenue it says it has lost, the amount of which Nintendo says it will "prove at trial".</p><p>"Streaming leaked games prior to their publication normalises and encourages prerelease piracy - Defendant is signalling to viewers that they too should acquire a pirated copy and play the game now, without waiting for its release and without paying for it," Nintendo's lawyers wrote in the filing.</p>
<p>"Prerelease piracy harms law-abiding Nintendo customers who may have been waiting for a particular game release for months or years, and then may see gameplay and spoilers online that ruin their own surprise and delight when experiencing the game."</p>
<p>"We can confirm that we filed a lawsuit against an individual who has engaged and continues to engage in clear infringement of Nintendo‚Äôs IP rights, as well as violations of our Game Content Guidelines," Nintendo told Polygon in a subsequent statement.</p>
<p>"Nintendo is passionate about protecting the creative works of game developers and publishers who expend significant time and effort to create experiences that bring smiles to all."</p>
<p>Keighin did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Nintendo is also suing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair. The monster battling and catching game had frequently been compared with Pok√©mon since its launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in January,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents"> Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company's lawsuit was filed</a> just weeks before<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation"> Palworld's PlayStation 5 version launched at the end of September</a>.</p><p>Yesterday,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says"> Pocketpair revealed that the lawsuit relates to three patents filed between February and July this year</a> - after Palworld's launch. However, they relate to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed by Nintendo and The Pok√©mon Company in December 2021, preceding Palworld's launch, meaning they could indeed still apply to Palworld now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
