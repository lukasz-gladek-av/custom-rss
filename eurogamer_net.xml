            <p>Nexon is ending support for its third-person looter shooter The First Descendant on PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The free-to-play sci-fi-flavoured release came out last year across Xbox, PlayStation and PC. It got off to a decent enough start, and in the first week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-free-to-play-sci-fi-shooter-the-first-descendant-clocks-up-10m-players-in-just-one-week">welcomed 10 million players into the fray</a>. Things have petered off since then, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/">SteamDB</a> data showing an average of 8,227 concurrent players on Valve's platform in February. Its peak concurrent player average was 123,352 in July last year, but this dropped to an average of 54,662 concurrents by August.</p>

<p>Nexon is going to keep supporting The First Descendant, however it has now announced it will be ending support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players from 19th June, which is just shy of its first anniversary. The game will also be delisted from the platforms (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>According to Nexon, it has decided to stop supporting the last generation of consoles in a bid to keep "increasing player satisfaction". The developer said it had "increased the scale" of The First Descendant, and this meant the team was facing difficulties "maintaining the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One builds".</p>
<p>Those who are playing The First Descendant on either a PS4 or Xbox One will still be able to transfer their progress to other platforms via The First Descendant's cross-save functionality.</p>

</span></p><p>On its release last year, Nexon found itself having to respond to claims the iconography of The First Descendant was strikingly similar to icons found in another sci-fi release, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-sci-fi-shooter-the-final-descendants-icons-are-strikingly-similar-to-those-used-in-destiny-2">players identified a surprising number of similarities</a> between the icons and weapons used in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-descendant-developer-responds-to-claims-its-icons-are-too-similar-to-those-in-destiny-2">designs in questions were subsequently removed from the game</a> "with deep affection and respect" for other "looter shooters".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Technology giant Samsung has shown off a working concept for a foldable gaming handheld - and it's essentially a Nintendo Switch that you can bend in half. 
</p>
<p>
Ever tried to snap your Switch in rage? Well, now you can do that with the Samsung Flex Gaming concept and (hopefully) not break the device in the process.
</p>
<p>
While just a concept, Samsung had workable units on show at the MWC mobile technology event in Barcelona this week, with foldable OLED screens up and running. Just ignore the big crease down the middle.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps just as notable, the Samsung Flex Gaming concept also includes two giant holes in each of its not-Joy-Con. These are designed to allow the control stick in each side of the handheld to fit snugly inside the other half.
</p>
<p>
Cleverly, the face button and D-Pad have been built into the edges of each hole - again replicating the placement of these buttons on Nintendo Switch.
</p>
<p>
The device even has different colours for each half, as the original Switch had for its model with Blue/Red Joy-Con. Samsung's choices are lime green and yellow though - not as attractive, though very Norwich City FC.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is expected to not offer an OLED screen in its upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> (or allow you to bend it in half). The Mario maker is set to unveil more details of its next handheld in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">special Nintendo Direct presentation scheduled for 2nd April</a>.
