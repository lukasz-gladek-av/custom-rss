            <p>Time flies (like a Javelin suit): there are only 10 days left to play BioWare's ill-fated multiplayer game Anthem before the servers are switched off, presumably forever.</p>
<p>We've had this end-date in the diary <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">since EA announced it last summer</a>. "After careful consideration, we will be sunsetting Anthem on January 12, 2026," the company said. That day seemed far away then; now, it does not.</p>
<p>It's not yet clear whether there'll be a 'switching off event' of any kind. I'm trying to find out.</p>

<p>Because Anthem is an online multiplayer game, once EA switches the servers off, you won't be able to play it, regardless of if you own it or not. This is an aspect of modern live service gaming many people are frustrated by - this disappearance of games they bought but can no longer play. It's led to movements like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-offshoot-confident-eu-petition-will-progress-to-legislative-phase-with-almost-half-of-signatures-now-verified">Stop Destroying Games and Stop Killing Games, which are petitioning governments</a> in the hope of putting protections in place to stop this happening.</p><p>But if a game is not attracting a large enough audience to justify the expenditure of ongoing server costs, which I don't think Anthem was, then what's a company to do - run it at a loss? Or does it release the code to the community to host servers themselves? I'm sure the latter option is not as straightforward as it sounds.</p>

<p>Regardless, Anthem's end seems symbolic in the story of BioWare - a company famed for single-player role-playing experiences that was encouraged and perhaps pressured to make a huge bet on a multiplayer game that didn't work out. It was, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-mass-effect-from-the-birth-of-a-trilogy-to-andromeda-and-beyond">as one of the key people involved in the project once told me</a>, a "dichotomy" - a game that tried to be two things (a BioWare experience and a multiplayer game) but ended up being neither. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-review-shaken-apart-by-its-own-identity-crisis">Oli called Anthem a game "shaken apart by its own identity crisis" in Eurogamer's review</a>.</p>
<p>There were plans to overhaul Anthem - ambitious plans for a 2.0 reboot that would revitalise the experience, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-work-on-major-anthem-overhaul-has-officially-ceased">but these were eventually abandoned</a>.</p>
<p>Anthem's misfortunes in 2019 piled onto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a>'s misfortunes from 2017, leaving BioWare in a precarious and pressurised position after the relative high-point of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> in 2014. The eventual release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> in 2024, after 10 years of topsy turvy development - which included a few years as a multiplayer game - did nothing to remedy this.</p><p>All eyes now turn to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-the-midst-of-eas-controversial-acquisition-bioware-moves-to-reassure-fans-that-a-new-mass-effect-is-definitely-still-in-development">the elusive in-development fifth Mass Effect game</a>, the success of which BioWare's existence may hinge upon. Then again, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA's sports-focused Saudi Arabian acquisition</a> drawing nearer to completion, there's no telling what may happen and what the new owners may want.</p>

            <p>According to a new report, both AMD and Nvidia will raise the prices of their consumer GPUs "significantly" this year. If this report is true, both companies will have pushed these price hikes by next month.</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273#_endPass">This information comes from Newsis</a>, which claims these price hikes will come as a result of the high cost of memory in the computer hardware market right now. This increased cost has been caused by construction of widespread AI data centres, which has resulted in a huge demand for such components.</p>
<p>This price hike will continue to get worse too, according to Newsis industry sources. While an initial price increase will reportedly go into place in January for AMD and February for Nvidia, both companies will continue gradually increasing the price throughout the year.</p>

</figure>
<p>Expectations are that these price increases will impact certain GPUs, including Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50 series and AMD's Radeon RX 9000 series which are already expensive. According to Newsis, the Nvidia RTX 5090 which was released at a price point of $1,999 could eventually increase to $5,000 this year.</p><p>The reasons why these price hikes are coming are clear. Not only are GPus getting more expensive to make due to the increased cost of construction, but AI companies such as OpenAI are hardware guzzling behemoths. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/nvidia-ceo-huang-says-next-generation-ai-will-need-more-compute.html">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that next generation AI will need "100 times more compute" than older models</a>, and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-the-company-doesnt-have-enough-electricity-to-install-all-the-ai-gpus-in-its-inventory-you-may-actually-have-a-bunch-of-chips-sitting-in-inventory-that-i-cant-plug-in">Microsoft's CEO mused that they don't have the electricity to install the GPUs sitting in their inventory</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not you buy into the hype regarding Generative AI and LLMs, the reality is these companies are buying GPUs (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">and RAM</a>) with the expectation that they'll need an absurd amount of hardware for future models, and the consumer demand for those models. Thus, we have a massive demand for GPUs, thus the price increase. Nvidia and AMD know they can charge AI companies more too, as these companies rely on such hardware for continued growth.</p>
<p>What this means for the average consumer of PC parts for gaming purposes is that your PC parts are going to get drastically more expensive over the coming months if this report is accurate, and they'll likely get more expensive due to basic supply / demand problems in the hardware market.</p>
<p>All the while video game companies state their intention to embrace AI through development. Take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">which intends to replace 70% of its QA wit hAI by 2027</a>, and Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">whose CEO believes AI will be as big a revolution as the shift to 3D</a>.</p>
