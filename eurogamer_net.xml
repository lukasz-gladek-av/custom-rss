            <p>Gaming can't escape the shadow of global economic uncertainty, and things are going to get worse following <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/19/microsoft-xbox-prices-tariffs-macroeconomic-conditions.html">2025's price hikes</a> due to the memory shortages caused by the AI and data centre gold rush (which doesn't seem to be producing much gold just yet). What about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> following a strong summer launch <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">but slow Christmas</a>? Will it be safe from the price hikes?</p>
<p>According to an interview for <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> (read and extracted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-monitoring-high-ram-prices-and-tariff-impacts-very-closely-president-shuntaro-furukawa-says/">VGC</a>), Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa isn't ready to sound the alarm yet, but he acknowledges things aren't looking too great at the moment.</p>
<p>"We procure from suppliers based on our medium- to long-term business plans, but the current memory market is very volatile… There is no immediate impact on earnings, but it is something we must monitor closely."</p>
<p>Furukawa also went on to explain Nintendo is trying to reduce the impact of the annoying RAM shortages and fluctuating tariffs (not limited to the United Sates) by "advancing component procurement over the medium to long term." Of course, at some point the company might run out of runway, which could lead to increased prices<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-role-of-the-console-is-shifting-are-rising-prices-the-end-for-games-consoles-as-we-know-them"> in line with PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-could-be-forced-into-raising-the-price-of-xbox-consoles-again-given-global-ram-shortage-leaker-claims">Xbox's</a> unwelcome adjustments.</p><p>For now, Furukawa won't comment on potential price increases, only saying it's hypothetical talk until things get more difficult. He was more open about the impact of tariffs though: "While it's difficult to accurately gauge the future impact, our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost and pass them on to prices as much as possible, not just in the US."</p>
<p>For those unaware, consoles' profit margins have traditionally been lower than you'd expect, which is why they're especially susceptible to sudden shifts in the market conditions around tech components and tariffs. Even before the hiccups caused by the madness around AI services and infrastructure we've seen over the past few months, we'd been facing a tricky decade when it comes to resources used for hardware production, so these are rough waters we'll collectively have to learn to navigate in the future.</p>

            <p>A lot of you are gaming hard, it seems. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> has been on a steady growth trajectory for years now, with the Covid pandemic alone adding five million unique users only in 2020. On 1th January, Valve's platform crossed the 42 million barrier, setting a new record.</p>
<p>As reported and explained by <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/">Wccftech</a>, the PC distribution platform has now more than doubled its concurrent user average since 2020, with new record peaks of activity becoming more and more common in recent years. The previous activity record was 41.6 million users in October 2025.</p>
<p>The full analysis solidifies the feeling that Steam (and PC gaming as a whole) has blown up in popularity in the post-pandemic era: "A quick data analysis reveals distinct growth phases during this period. Before the pandemic, the Steam platform was growing slowly, at a rate of +4.5 percent per year. The lockdown year obviously exploded the platform (as well as all other gaming platforms) with +31.5 percent in a single year, followed by a stabilisation phase and the current phase, which are both between 13.9 percent and 12.6 percent annual growth rate."</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">Last month also was Steam's highest-grossing yet</a>, partly thanks to recent hits like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-expeditions-one-in-ten">Arc Raiders</a> and viral indie sensations like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Peak</a>, on top of everything else. The quality of the more recent Steam sales has also been on the upswing, often countering the deep deals found on other storefronts.</p><p>Another reason behind this growth is the rising popularity of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a>, Valve's portable PC that's cracked open PC gaming for plenty of folks who wanted the benefits of Steam and other platforms without the technical hassles which typically come with gaming computers. Even with its technical limitations, it’s become the go-to "console" for plenty of more casual players.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1q6om9p/oc_epic_games_store_grew_users_by_173_over_6/">Epic Games Store has also seen plenty of growth</a> over six years, but as we expected, most users only show up for the free games given out each week, refusing to spend money on a platform that isn’t nearly as fleshed out as Valve’s beyond the games themselves.</p>
