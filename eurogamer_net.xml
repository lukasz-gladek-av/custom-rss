            <p>
Everyone's now heard of Deadlock, the in-development MOBA from Half-Life maker Valve. Maybe you're even playing it, as part of the game's still-invite-only alpha playtest.
</p>
<p>
But are you playing the top-secret even more invite-only version? Probably not. (Although if you are, feel free to get in touch.)
</p>
<p>
The existence of an even more elusive version of Deadlock was spilled publicly last night when a top Deadlock streamer appeared to load up the wrong version of the game, beaming Valve's more-exclusive version to the world. 
</p>
<p>
This version of Deadlock includes a much larger character roster, as well as updated designs for some of the game's current heroes. New faces include the bellhop-styled Doorman, bespectacled Bookworm, and gothic Vampirebat, among many others. 
</p>
<p>
The streamer in question quickly shut down the game and deleted its archived version - but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">not before the internet inevitably took screenshots</a>.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">Streamer accidentally leaks hero roster of a more "secret" private Deadlock pre-alpha playtest build</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/atahutahatena/">u/atahutahatena</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

Deathlock has been in early playtesting now for over a year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">leaks happening pretty much ever since</a>. Valve attempted to keep the game a secret for as long as possible, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">ultimately dropped its confidentiality requirement last August</a>, when a Steam page for the game finally appeared. 
</p>
<p>
Since then, though, Valve has simply kept working on Deadlock (and seemingly multiple versions) in the background, keeping the game invite-only. When will it publicly launch? There's still no word.
</p>
<p>
Matt Cox previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadlocks-biggest-update-yet-marks-a-threshold-moment-nows-the-time-to-grab-yourself-an-invite">checked out Deathlock for Eurogamer</a> back in February this year, and noted how a recent update felt "like a huge leap towards Deadlock's full release, but there's still plenty of time to go, as Valve makes a great game even greater".

            <p>The surprise release of Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered hasn't impacted the sales of French JRPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, its publisher has said.</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive's game was released last week from publisher Kepler and with support from Xbox, but some feared any success would be overshadowed by the Oblivion release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">leaked ahead of time</a>.</p>
<p>However, Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan has drawn a distinction between the two games, adding "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>

<p>"We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity," Handrahan told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a>. "When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p>
<p>"Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Passâ€¦ so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p>
<p>According to data from Ampere, there's a 35 percent crossover between the two RPGs. On Xbox in particular - the number one platform for both games - 55 percent of Clair Obscur players also played Oblivion. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>
<p>This crossover percentage drops to 22 percent for Steam players, and 16 percent on PS5. However, average playtime on Xbox has been lower - likely due to players dipping in on Game Pass.</p>

</figure>
<p>Handrahan revealed Kepler didn't sign Clair Obscur straight away, but could see the potential of its battle system.</p>
<p>"My CEO, Alexis Garavaryan, had the most contact with them at [an early stage]," said Handrahan. "He saw the potential in it, but thought there were still some parts that needed a little bit more work. So Sandfall went away, did that work, came back, and on the second time of seeing it, our response was extremely, extremely quick."</p>
<p>When another publisher started looking at the game, Kepler had already snapped it up. "We were straight on top of it," said Handrahan. "If you find a game you like, if you find a game that excites you, you really have to act quickly. There's a lot of good games, but the really remarkable stuff comes along relatively rarely."</p>
<p>He also spoke to the game's promotion during Xbox's Summer Showcase alongside the likes of AAA first party games Gears of War and Fable. "It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way," said Handrahan. "Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hit 500,000 sales in just one day, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">quickly rose to a million copies in three days</a>.</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It's been six long years <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-gets-surprise-sequel-for-switch-and-pc">since Hollow Knight sequel Silksong was confirmed to be in development</a>, and fans - starved of much in the way of news - have managed to reach such a frenzy of anticipation in that time, it's a wonder the whole thing didn't end in mass spontaneous combustion. Some of the pressure was thankfully released last month when developer Team Cherry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">finally confirmed a 2025 launch window</a>, but an exact release date remains elusive. What we <em>do</em> now know, however, is Silksong's set to be playable at an Australian museum this September, suggesting it'll either release before, after, or during that time.
</p>
<p>
Silksong is more specifically due to appear at Australia's national museum of screen culture (ACMI) as part of its upcoming <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/">Game Worlds exhibition</a>, running from 18th September 2025 to 8th February next year. The exhibition focuses on 30 video games - including the seminal likes of The Sims and World of Warcraft - and "charts technical and design innovation to uncover what makes these virtual worlds feel alive." And in among that number is Silksong, which has earned its place in the line-up partly for the sheer magnitude of anticipation surrounding its release and partly to celebrate its homegrown origins, given Team Cherry is based in Adelaide.
</p>
<p>
"Since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s initial announcement in 2019, it has been one of the most anticipated indie games on the planet," Game World co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell wrote in a statement announcing the news, "and we are thrilled to celebrate the design of this South Australian-made game as a centrepiece of Game Worlds in September."

<p>
"From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet's different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game's most challenging boss fights - and of course, having the game playable in-gallery - our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We're so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"
</p>
<p>
It is, of course, tempting to try and divine a narrower Silksong release window from this fresh morsal of news, but that ultimately feels like a fruitless endeavour. ACMI's announcement makes no suggestion Silksong's playable Game Worlds appearance is in any way a first, so there's every chance it'll get a general release ahead of its museum debut. On the other hand, it doesn't say it's <em>not</em> a first, so the opposite might also be true? All we know for certain is Silksong comes Switch, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and PC later this year, with an Xbox and PlayStation release to follow.
