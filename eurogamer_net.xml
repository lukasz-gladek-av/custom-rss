            <p>Playtests for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> have been more positive than the first game, but creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> isn't "interested in appealing to the mass market".</p>
<p>The first Death Stranding game was certainly divisive, but speaking to Edge Magazine Kojima discussed how he takes on board player feedback.</p>
<p>"Of course, I want people to play my game, so I must listen to them to a certain extent," he said. "But also, I'm not interested in making something that appeals to everyone."</p>

<p>With the previous games, Kojima explained that in playtests four out of 10 people would love it and six would say it's terrible. "For me, I think that's a good balance," he said.</p>
<p>The sequel, however, is bringing in a more positive response. "Sony is pleased, of course, but I do wish it was a bit more controversial," said Kojima. "Blockbuster films need an 80 percent approval rating - I don't want to make games like that. I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market, or selling millions of copies. That's not what I'm aiming for."</p>
<p>Kojima later admitted a lot of people still expect him to create something like Metal Gear, the series he's best known for. That has resulted in the forthcoming game Physint.</p>
<p>"Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create," he said. "But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That's when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected, and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint."</p>
<p>Indeed, from my own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">preview of Death Stranding 2</a>, there's definitely a strong influence of Metal Gear in the increased focus on combat and stealth mechanics.</p>
<p>"There are so many people all over the world asking me to make another Metal Gear, so I added more options for combat," Kojima said during the preview. "When I was working out those mechanics, I was a little worried because many of the staff that worked with me on Metal Gear still work here, and we kept saying to each other, 'Does this feel too much like Metal Gear?' It wasn't on purpose."</p>
<p>Beyond Physint, Kojima is spending time considering the legacy of his studio, Kojima Productions, and what it will create next.</p>
<p>"I gave a USB stick with all my ideas on it to my personal assistant - kind of like a will," he told Edge. "Perhaps they could continue to make things after I'm gone, here at Kojima Productions... This is a fear for me - what happens to Kojima Productions after I'm gone. I don't want them to just manage our existing IP."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-wont-make-it-himself">creator already has ideas for endless Death Stranding sequels</a>, but won't be making them himself.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will release on PS5 next month, on 25th June.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> is now less than three weeks away from release, which means Nintendo is feverishly filling in the few remaining blanks ahead of the console's arrival. And that finally includes specific details on what each of its previously announced free Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a>, Pokémon, Mario, Arms, and more will do on launch day.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">announced two different types of Switch 2 upgrades for previously released Switch games</a> as part of its big April news blowout: paid upgrades promising substantial new features or content alongside presentational enhancements, plus free upgrades specifically focused on the likes of enhanced performance and GameShare support.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Nintendo announced 12 original Switch titles - including Arms, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, and Pokémon Scarlet - would be receiving free upgrades on its new console, but stopped short of providing specific details. That's all changed thanks to an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/">update on its website</a>, so here's everything we now know owners of the original Switch editions can expect when playing the games on Switch 2 starting 5th June:

        <p>Epic says game now offline on iOS worldwide.</p>

            <p>
Apple has denied <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s return to iPhone in the US.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games announced the news this morning and said the move by Apple would mean its game was now offline worldwide on iOS devices. 
</p>
<p>
The evergreen battle royale had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">back on iPhone in the European Union via the mobile version of the Epic Games Store</a> available in the EU. But this version, too, has now gone dark. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union," Epic Games said in a statement on social media. "Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it."
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-pulls-resubmits-fortnites-us-app-store-request-after-not-hearing-back-from-apple-all-week">Epic Games was forced to pull and then resubmit its application to have Fortnite return on iPhone</a> to ensure it included this week's update for the game - which ended up being delayed until this morning. 
</p>
<p>
According to Epic boss Tim Sweeney, Apple had sat on the submission of Fortnite for days, despite the submission process typically being swift, and had not returned the company's calls. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games and Apple have of course been locked into a long-running feud after the former added in-game purchase options that circumvented Apple's typical store - a move which got Fortnite booted from both the App Store and Google Play on Android.
</p>
<p>
But a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">dramatic legal ruling earlier this month</a> saw a US judge rule that Apple had been wrongly dragging its heels and obfuscating its previously-mandated need to offer a fair payment alternative - something that seemed to pave the way for Fortnite's return. 
</p>
<p>
Last night, Sweeney spent several hours on social media mocking Apple's lengthy submission process - noting that Fortnite knock-offs were available on the App Store (including one titled "Fort Battle Royale Epic Shoot"), then <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923120512189763697">remarking that the aforementioned game had suddenly been removed</a> following his earlier post.
</p>
<p>
"Apple's App Review team should be free to review all submitted apps promptly and accept or reject according to the plain language of their guidelines," Sweeney later <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923214117894029475">wrote</a>. "App Review shouldn't be weaponised by senior management as a tool to delay or obstruct competition, due process, or free speech."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Apple for more.

            <p>Fairgames has reportedly been delayed as Haven Studios founder Jade Raymond has departed the studio.</p>
<p>The live-service shooter, published by Sony, is still in development, but a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> has confirmed Raymond's departure, although a reason hasn't been given.</p>
<p>The report also states an external test of the game took place recently, but some developers were concerned about how Fairgames will be received. The game has reportedly now been delayed from this autumn to spring 2026 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">just like GTA 6</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-shooter-fairgame-has-been-delayed-to-next-year-insider-suggests">Rumours of Fairgames' delay</a> into next year emerged back in February. The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jade-raymonds-studio-haven-announces-heist-shooter-fairgame">first announced in May 2023 at the PlayStation Showcase</a>, but little has been seen of the game since.</p>
<p>Raymond previously saw success at Ubisoft as producer of Assassin's Creed and executive producer of Assassin's Creed 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-bloodlines">Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a>. She then left the company to found EA's Motive Studio in 2015, and then moved to Google Stadia in 2018.</p>
<p>When Google closed its internal game studios in 2021, Raymond launched Haven Studios as one of five co-founders. In 2022 Sony acquired the studio.</p>
<p>Raymond's departure from Haven means this will be at least the third game in a row she's worked on but not shipped.</p>
<p>"Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios," a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg. "We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter."</p>
<p>The spokesperson added PlayStation is "committed to supporting Haven Studios and excited to continue the journey". New co-studio heads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski will take Raymond's place.</p>
<p>The news of Raymond's departure and the delay to Fairgames is yet another hit to Sony's live-service output. Despite the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> last year, which became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">Sony's plan for releasing over 10 new live service games</a> is rapidly failing.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Concord shut down</a> after just two weeks and Firewalk Studio was closed as a result. Then, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">Sony cancelled two further live-service games</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and Bluepoint.</p>
<p>Next from Sony will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Bungie's Marathon</a>, the studio's first new game since being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">acquired by Sony in 2022 for $3.6bn</a>. It's set for release on 23rd September this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Hey everyone,
</p>
<p>
15 years ago, I went for a job interview at a small office in Brighton and quickly discovered I was the only one wearing a suit. After years running a Nintendo fansite, I was keen to join a larger team and learn from the very best in the business, whose footsteps I hoped to follow.
</p>
<p>
My first job on Eurogamer was one that no longer exists - it largely involved returning preview discs at the local post office - and I distinctly remember then-Eurogamer editor Tom Bramwell reminding me during my interview that I wouldn't actually be writing on the website. I nodded along, and thought, well, let's see.
</p>
<p>
I've always believed in, and will always be proud of, Eurogamer's mission and place in the increasingly-turbulent world of video games - one that has held fast due to its firm foundations of trustworthy reporting, definitive reviews, and quality critical opinion. It's these values which drew me to Eurogamer back then, and which I know will continue long after I log off for a final time today.

It has been the honour of a lifetime to serve as Eurogamer's Editor-in-Chief <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hello-from-eurogamers-new-editor-in-chief">for the last two years</a> and carry this mission forward - in particular, to lead the site through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-25">its 25th anniversary</a>, where the affection and respect for what our team does was felt from readers and the wider industry alike.

15 years leaves me with too many people to thank, and too many wonderful colleagues past and present to highlight across Eurogamer's editorial teams, video team, tech team, sales, HR, management and everyone else that running a website requires just to get words on a page. I am phenomenally grateful to everyone I have worked with for their insight, patience, and for believing in what we do - and for letting me fill this site with oranges, Birdos and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
All of that said, please do let me specifically thank three people from over the years: Tom Bramwell for giving me that job and giving in to me writing on the website sooner than I'd expected, Wesley Yin-Poole for his continued belief and guidance, and lastly to Bertie Purchese - Eurogamer's longest-serving staff member - for those days working by the broom cupboard, and for being the heart of Eurogamer ever since.
</p>
<p>
Looking to the future, it's now my turn to pass the baton on. While I am headed elsewhere in the world of games journalism, I shall always continue to be a Eurogamer fan. I'm excited to see what the team does next in the safe hands of Tom Orry, with whom I leave the site knowing he understands the mission and how to ensure its success in the years to come. Look out for more from him very soon.
</p>
<p>
Until then, and for one last time from me, thank you so much for reading. 
</p>
<p>
Tom
