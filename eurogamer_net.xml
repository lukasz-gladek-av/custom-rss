            <p>FromSoftware has pushed back the release of the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> to "allow time for performance adjustments".</p>
<p>In a brief statement, the developer apologised for the delay, but said it was "wholeheartedly [working] toward release", which is now expected sometime in 2026. Sadly, a firmer release window has not been provided.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring's Switch 2 port, Tarnished Edition, was announced at a Nintendo Direct presentation back in April</a>. It's slated to include the base game and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC, as well as new armour and a new Torrent appearance customisation feature.</p> <div>

<p>FromSoft hadn't given a firm release date for the Switch 2 Tarnished Edition in 2025, but it was initially expected to release before the end of the year.</p>
<p>"We apologise to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support," the team said.</p>
<p>As for FromSoftware's Elden Ring spin-off, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-unveils-elden-ring-nightreigns-new-mode-ahead-of-release-tomorrow">New mode Deep of Night mode is now live</a>, adding extra challenge to the multiplayer spin-off game. The world of Limveld will be full of deadlier enemies, and Nightlords won't be selectable, as in the main game, but instead players can traverse multiple depths, with escalating difficulty and challenges.</p>

            <p>Raven Software says its focus for the year ahead and Call of Duty: Warzone comes down to three pillars: "Battle Royale, Resurgence, and the future of the game".</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1981852213581381882">update</a> posted earlier today, the developer said the team was "incredibly excited and there is much more to come", including a "first look" at some of the updates on the way, but insisted "Battle Royale is the foundation upon which we've built every new mode, feature, and memorable moment".</p>

<p>"While we continue to innovate across the entire game, we feel it's important that Battle Royale remains a cornerstone of what we do," the developer stated. "That's why we're expanding Battle Royale to include support for multiple large maps via map rotation. While it wasn't previously realistic for us to host multiple large maps, we've since taken the steps necessary to support it. This won't be a launch feature with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, but it's a key addition slated for early next year."</p><p>Though it previously insisted it would "approach change more deliberately to preserve the original Warzone launch experience" after re-releasing Verdansk last spring, Raven confirmed it's going to "increase how often we release updates and refine the way we surface new features to you".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>"The goal is balance: keep things moving without forgetting about seasonal support and quality-of-life improvements," the team explained.</p>
<p>As part of that, Raven says it's heard you "loud and clear" about Rebirth Island and the broader Resurgence experience, admitting it has "started to feel a bit stale".</p>
<p>"So, to start, we're delivering a full refresh to Rebirth Island in Season 02, which includes new POI updates, a cosmetic pass, and several other upgrades that improve flow," Raven explained. "The launch of the new Haven's Hollow map in Season 01 will be another step in spicing up Resurgence. These past months, we've made changes based on feedback received during early previews of Haven's Hollow.</p><p>"Shortly after launch, we'll be bringing back map rotation to Resurgence, which will swap between Rebirth Island and Haven's Hollow," the statement added. "We are also exploring opportunities to bring back past maps in future seasons: an improved version of Fortune's Keep is underway as we speak. Our goal is to ensure that each map has room to shine without sidelining the ones that you love most."</p>
<p>Moving forward, the developer says it will continue to make "significant, meaningful improvements on multiple fronts", and intends to "deliver a higher frequency of updates, with a larger emphasis on balance changes no less than twice per season".</p>
<p>"Our approach to weapon and attachment balance is fundamentally shifting, which means redefined roles at launch followed by multiple balance passes per season with adjustments entirely unique to Warzone," Raven explained. "Regular updates will extend beyond weapons to include shifts in ground loot, perks, equipment, contracts, and much more throughout the year."</p>
<p>Players can expect a seasonal roadmap next month, and more Ranked Play camos in Season 2, as well as "the arrival of our new Blackout experience on Avalon during Season 2".</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with the seminal shooter, the Halo story kicks off after the Master Chief crash-lands on a mysterious ringworld known as Halo, working alongside remaining humans to help humanity survive against overwhelming Covenant forces. Alongside his AI companion Cortana, he uncovers Halo’s dark secrets and fights to avert the annihilation of all life in the galaxy.</p><p>"We wanted to start where it all began, with the original campaign that defined Halo," executive producer Damon Conn <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">said</a>. "Starting here means people that have never played the game before will be able to understand the story from the very beginning, and that can help us chart a course forward with new Halo stories."</p>
<p>"Focusing on the campaign experience means we can concentrate fully on really capturing the atmosphere, tone - the emotional impact of what made the first campaign so special and iconic."</p>
<p>In Halo: Campaign Evolved, you'll be able to wield nine additional "iconic" weapons from across the Halo series inside the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign, including the Energy Sword, Battle Rifle and Needle Rifle, as well as hijack vehicles and even pilot the Covenant Wraith tank – two firsts for the Halo campaign.</p>
<p>That's not the only big change, either.</p>
<p>"We learned from Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters," director Max Szlagor added. "In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We've added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there's new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out."</p><p>"We're so excited about bringing Halo to those who may not have had chance to play it in the past," Conn added. "At its heart, Halo is about connection, we're thrilled to meet a new generation of players on their platforms of choice to fall in love with Halo the same way we did. We're not trying to rewrite Halo's legacy - we're trying to immerse you in it like never before.</p>
<p>"This is Halo for everyone."</p>

        <p>"We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> CEO Dan Clancy has admitted the company "failed" by both allowing streamer Emiru to be physically assaulted at TwitchCon last weekend, and "in our response following".</p>
<p>Last weekend, streamer<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamer-assaulted-at-twitchcon-slams-event-security-i-think-other-creators-should-seriously-consider-not-attending-in-the-future"> Emiru was assaulted at a TwitchCon Meet and Greet after a man crossed multiple barriers to grab her face and try to kiss her</a>. A viral video that caught the incident suggests TwitchCon's own staff did not prevent the incident from occurring, nor "came to ask what happened or if I was okay" in the immediate aftermath.</p>
<p>In Twitch's initial response, it said "the safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority", and called the behaviour of the man who pushed past the queue to grab Emiru and kiss her "completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting". It then revealed it had "blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>hello everyone, I am okay and thank you for all of the kind messages, sorry I cannot respond to them all 🩷</p><p>Yesterday, the man who assaulted me was allowed to cross multiple barriers at twitchcon and even in front of another creators meet and greet to grab me and my face and try…</p></div>— emi ⭐️ (@emiru) <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Emiru disputed this version of events, however, saying, "Twitch's statement they said that the guy was immediately caught and detained [was] a blatant lie".</p>
<p>"He was allowed to walk away from my Meet and Greet, and I didn't hear he was caught until hours after he attacked me, and it felt like this only happened because of my manager pressing for it, not because TwitchCon staff present thought it was a big deal," she added, later confirming she was pressing charges.</p>
<p>In the days following the incident, Clancy was criticised for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-to-emiru-twitchcon-assault-says-its-a-challenge-in-todays-society-and-not-limited-to-twitc">video interview</a> in which he said, "the challenge we face is a challenge in today’s society. It’s not limited to Twitch, it extends throughout our society.</p>
<p>"Now, what happened yesterday, obviously, was something that we care deeply about securing this environment. We're looking very closely at everything that happened there, and I care deeply about Emi," he added. "She's a friend of mine, and so I want to see how we can support her. This is just something we have to keep working on. I think everyone identifies our tools in terms of trust and safety as the leaders in the industry about helping creators, but that means there's always more work to be done, because that's the world we live in now."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">First, I want to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru’s Meet and Greet.

<p>Now, in a fresh statement, Clancy said he "want[s] to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru's Meet and Greet", saying, "it shouldn't have happened and we take that very seriously".</p>
<p>"We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologise to Emiru for all that took place."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Twitch is now investigating "everything" about how they run Meet and Greets, "from sign-ups to the layout to increased security controls". This includes a review of its teams, production and venue staff, so it is "better equipped" for future events".</p><p>"We're also doing a comprehensive review of overall event safety and security, and will be making updates for future TwitchCons," he added. "While we won't be sharing all security updates for privacy and safety reasons, we will keep our community informed about changes that directly impact attendees.</p>
<p>"You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously," the statement concludes. "We know that TwitchCon means a lot to a lot of people, and it means a lot to us. Be on the lookout for more updates, and thanks for being a part of Twitch."</p>
<p>Clancy said the company has also "hard concerns about IRL" streaming, and though he didn't expand on what those concerns were, added that the IRL category was now "a part of Twitch" and "TwitchCon [should ensure it] meets the needs of a variety of participants". More will be revealed "soon".</p>
