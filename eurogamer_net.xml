<p>Admitting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">game's launch "hasn't been without its challenges" for many players</a>, the studio now says "game performance" is its top priority.

<ul>
<li>Initial CPU and GPU performance improvements, along with memory optimisations</li>
<li>Reduced difficulty for the CPR mini-game</li>
<li>A new setting to disable or modify Depth of Field</li>
<li>A fix for an issue with missing controls for the MineHunter and Run Dungeon mini-games</li>

<p>Build A Rocket Boy said this fix will be the first of a series of updates for MindsEye. Future updates will be aimed at "enhancing your experience," the developer said, promising to keep us up to date with information on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Patches will need to have the internet to load, the team reminded players, asking them to "please ensure [the] game is updated regularly to enjoy the benefits of the latest improvements".</p>
<p>The studio additionally added that Build.MindsEye - that is to say, the game's creation platform designed to help creators share interactive experiences - is now "fully accessible" for those on Steam.</p>
<p>"Thank you again for your incredible support. This is just the start of a long-term vision to make MindsEye the best possible game for you," the team closed.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has announced publicly it has filed a lawsuit against an individual it alleges has developed and sold cheats for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>This latest venture in Epic Game's ongoing war against those who create, sell, and use cheats was announced via <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1932485822445666348">the company's own Twitter account</a>. There, the company posted:</p>
<p>"We filed a new lawsuit against an individual who developed and sold cheating software that helped players see through walls and auto aim. We're also going after people who helped sell this software. Creating and selling software to help others cheat is against the rules and we'll keep fighting to keep it out of Fortnite."</p>

<figcaption>A new Fortnite season was revealed recently. Check it out!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zzh-g2a4M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/606086/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker">According to Polygon</a>, the lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina where the company is headquartered. It alleges Ediz Atas, also known as  Sincey Cheats and Vanta Chearts, has been making and selling cheats since "at least January 2023".</p>
<p>Epic alleges in the lawsuit that after DMCA takedowns were issued to YouTube videos featuring these cheats, "Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to 'formally reverse [its] claim of copyright infringement'" by using fake Epic Games email addresses.
</p>
<p>Epic also claims its has issued tens of thousands of bans against Fortnite accounts that used cheats from Sincey Cheats since 2022, including over 15,000 bans on US-based Fortnite accounts.
</p>
<p>The lawsuit is also asking for compensation for damages from five unnamed individuals who distributed these cheats over platforms like Discord and Telegram. The amount is unknown.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Epic Games has proven especially litigious when it comes to Fortnite cheaters.  In 2022 Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-cheater-forced-to-pay-up-after-epic-lawsuit-damages-will-go-to-charity">forced a cheat creator to pay up in Australian court following a legal victory</a>, donating the winnings to charity.</p>
<p>Epic also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">sued a player who used cheats during a massive multi-million dollar tournament</a> to give back any prize money they won, and make a cathartic public apology to boot!</p>
<p>The company is not alone in its struggle against cheats. Activision has also been fighting against cheats, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-wins-113m-in-lawsuit-against-call-of-duty-cheat-maker">winning £11.3m in court against a Call of Duty cheat maker</a>. Bungie has been in those trenches too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-44m-lawsuit-against-destiny-cheat-seller-aimjunkies">winning a $4.4m lawsuit against Destiny cheat seller Aimjunkies</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
