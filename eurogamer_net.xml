            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a>, the producer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, has hinted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> version of the game could be on the way.</p>
<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-LRoukGVo&amp;t=12158s">livestream update</a> for MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> on Friday, the development team shared release details for the newly available Xbox version of Final Fantasy 16.</p>
<p>Yoshida then commented: "Just Nintendo left" (shared on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/">ResetEra</a>). The game's creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro then replied he "will do his best".</p>

<p>Of course, this could just be a passing joke, but it certainly appears to be hinting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is considering a Switch 2 version of the latest in the mainline series.</p>
<p>Not only would this follow the Xbox version, but it would follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">Final Fantasy 7 Remake games also coming to Switch 2</a> - all as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Two questions remain, though: would Final Fantasy 16 run on Switch 2? And would it sell?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjmzmgeqFYA">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the Xbox Series X/S version of Final Fantasy 16 has issues with a softer resolution implemented in order to secure a stable frame rate. It's unclear how the lower powered Switch 2 would be able to handle the game, especially in handheld mode.</p>
<p>It's also <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/final-fantasy-16-may-have-underperformed-on-ps5-but-its-doing-terribly-on-xbox">been reported</a> Final Fantasy 16 has not sold well on Xbox Series X/S so far, although Square Enix is yet to officially comment.</p>
<p>As such, while Square Enix's multiplatform strategy will certainly open up its games to more sales, perhaps there just isn't enough interest in Final Fantasy 16 specifically at this point, two years after its initial PS5 release. Maybe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-remake-are-finally-on-xbox-but-is-it-too-late">sales would have been stronger with a multiplatform launch</a>, though of course this still would not have factored in Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-third-party-sales-reportedly-very-low-despite-record-breaking-console-launch">third-party games are reportedly not selling well on Switch 2</a> as Nintendo's own games - in this instance Mario Kart World - are dominating the system. We'll have to see how Final Fantasy 7 Remake sells on the system later this year to gauge how Final Fantasy 16 may fare.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Footage of the next Battlefield game is once again popping up online, this time of its single-player campaign.</p>
<p>Despite requiring participants to sign an NDA before they can get involved, playtest players continue to find a way to share all manner of things, from clips of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhifj5/bf6_campaign/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gameplay</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/all_of_the_bf_labs_subfactions/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">factions</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhny43/gear_customization_heading_in_the_right_direction/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">gear customisation options</a>, and details of its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lh7bzp/how_do_you_feel_about_battle_royale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">battle royale</a>.</p>
<p>This leak of the single-player campaign seems to be one of the biggest yet, including locations of where players can expect to travel in the solo campaign, and the environments you can explore when you get there.</p>

<p>Some of this information appears to have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhm017/the_entire_menu_of_the_cracked_bf_labs_build/">datamined from the latest Battlefield Lab build</a>. There's plenty of unfinished images and assets, leading some fans to assert the game "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/comment/mz5eb63/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">looks like AI slop</a>" or "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1lhnpdm/comment/mz5djnh/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">fugly</a>" despite numerous statements from EA and the development teams that this is a work-in-progress with placeholder details that will be replaced when the game releases in full.</p> <div>

<p>The same thing happened with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a>. Despite branding the playtest as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" and requiring participants to sign an NDA, plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">gameplay footage popped up in various corners of the internet</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">EA was not happy</a>, eventually hitting back at a grumpy reddit thread about an unsupported claim about skill-based matchmaking with "Okay, enough".</p>
<p>Pretty much all we officially know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst we don't yet have a release name or date, EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>. We also recently learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-major-battlefield-reveal-still-set-for-summer-as-mass-effect-bundle-takes-fans-by-surprise">Battlefield 2042 is getting a Mass Effect bundle</a>, as a series exec confirmed there's still a big Battlefield (2025) reveal set to come this summer.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Remedy says it's hearing your feedback on FBC: Firebreak "loudly and clearly" and is committed to improving things, particularly the shooter's opening hour, "starting now".</p>
<p>Collating feedback from across social media, Discord, and Steam, the developer - for which Firebreak is its first self-published title - said that while "several things have gone well", "clearly, not everything has". Consequently, its first priority is to improve the game's "first hour experience", making progression faster and more rewarding.</p>

<p>"The game's first hours do not provide a great experience due to a combination of things. Some of this is down to a lack of onboarding (more about that in a bit), explaining the game’s systems, how to take advantage of the tools at your disposal, and a lack of clarity as to what to do in the Jobs and how to do the work effectively," the team <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2272540/announcements/detail/536605349656920275">said</a> in its first patch notes.</p>
<p>"In addition, the power fantasy isn’t great in the first hours of the game as starting (tier 1) weapons feel weak, and unlocking higher-tier weapons requires a bit too much grinding," the studio added. "We can see from the data and are seeing feedback that players who stick around and unlock more powerful tier 3 weapons and Perks, playing on higher Threat levels and Full three zone Job runs, are having a better time."</p>
<p>Because of this, Remedy says it wants to get you "to the fun faster", which also means getting us to the better tools and weapons. With better onboarding, user-interface clarity, and making Jobs easier to access, the studio thinks we'll get a more rewarding start.</p>
<p>That's not all, though.</p>
<p>"We hear you: the grind is too slow," the team added. "You want to try different builds, equip stronger weapons, use Altered Augments and experiment with Perks. Right now, getting to that takes too long.</p>
<p>"The upgrade economy was balanced with players finding a good amount of Lost Assets currency during Jobs, but as the currency (the folders on the ground) does not particularly stand out from the environments, players completely ignore them and are thus earning Lost Assets roughly 3x slower than hoped," the notes admitted. "Then, players do not earn Lost Assets unless they finish a job. If you exit a job midway or disconnect, you'll get nothing. That’s frustrating. We are looking into what we could do about this, but there are no changes to announce yet."</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-review">Eurogamer's FBC Firebreak review</a>, we awarded it 3 out of 5 stars, writing: "A bold approach to the concept of work marks this game out as a singular enterprise".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-hears-your-criticism-loudly-and-clearly-and-is-fixing-things-starting-now]]></content:encoded>
