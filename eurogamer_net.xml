            <p>Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto is "disappointed" the now defunct Ridgeline Games was not credited in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, despite its contribution being "the foundation of the game".</p>
<p>EA's Ridgeline Games, which worked on Battlefield 6's story campaign, was led by Lehto, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-game-director-marcus-letho-leaves-ea-and-ridgeline-games">he departed in February 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-studio-closure-a-gut-punch-marcus-lehto-says">the studio closed</a> shortly after. "Gut punched to see EA lay off my team," he said at the time. "So many very talented devs who were incredibly valuable to the Battlefield franchise."</p>
<p>Now, following Battlefield 6's release, Lehto has commented on the lack of inclusion for Ridgeline in the game's credits. "I'm disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6," he wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marcus-lehto-7378b31_im-disappointed-to-see-that-many-of-my-former-activity-7386081189645885440-Q38B">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>"These talented developers worked tirelessly for one to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered. Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a 'Special Thanks' section at the very end of the credits - and several were omitted entirely, including myself."</p>
<p>Lehto embedded an image in the post crediting his colleagues at Ridgeline "as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits".</p>
<p>He concluded: "Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has requested comment from EA, to ask if staff will be added to the credits in a future patch.</p>
<p>Since release, Battlefield 6 has been regularly updated with tweaks. In particular, EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-developers-u-turn-on-a-multiplayer-adjustment-following-community-feedback">U-turned on an adjustment to the game's multiplayer Conquest mode</a> following criticism from players.</p>
<p>Following his departure from Ridgeline Games, Lehto - who previously worked extensively at Bungie on the Halo series - revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-battlefield-director-doesnt-have-anything-positive-to-say-about-ea">he didn't "have anything positive to say about EA"</a>, in particular due to "industry sweeping layoffs".</p>
