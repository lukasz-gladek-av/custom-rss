            <p>More drastic changes are being made to Highguard as developer Wildlight desperately tries to hold onto a playerbase leaking through its fingers like water.</p>
<p>Yesterday Highguard recorded a high-point of only 694 concurrent players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#1m">according to stat-tracker SteamDB</a>. This number has been steadily declining throughout February, a month Highguard began with approximately 13,000 daily concurrent players.</p>
<p>The latest effort to stem the drainage, and perhaps even reverse it, comes in the addition of a fast-paced game mode called Raid Rush, which arrives tomorrow, 27th February, 5pm GMT. This pits two teams of five against each other in base attack and defense, and does away with the faffy looting phase entirely.</p>
<p>During the match, teams alternate between attack and defence each round, bases will be automatically repaired and you don't need to buy armour (everyone will get the same armour and it will increase in rarity each round). The only admin you'll do is buy things from the Trader, if you want. It's basically all-out action. There are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">various quality of life and balance fixes</a> alongside this.</p><p>Whether the Raid Rush update will affect Highguard's ominous predicament, I don't know, but I'm doubtful. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-reveals-one-final-character-trailer-ahead-of-its-server-slam-test-the-humble-rook">a public Marathon playtest</a> scheduled for this weekend, and likeminded hero shooters such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">Overwatch resurgent</a>, there doesn't seem much air in the space to breathe. A more incisive question might be how long Highguard can hang on for.</p>
<p>Highguard was the show-closing announcement at The Game Awards in December, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">a suspicious silence followed that undermined confidence in the game</a>. Then, when the game was released, it struggled to convince. Wildlight quickly reacted by adding larger team modes to appease players, but by then the direction of travel, away from the game, seemed set. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildlight underwent lay-offs as a result, though the team stoically insisted Highguard would live on</a>. But with only several hundred concurrent players a day, I don't know how long that's feasible for.</p>

            <p>Skate developer Full Circle - which is part of EA's studio network - has announced "changes to [its] team structure", that will result in layoffs at the company.</p>
<p>Full Circle said it is "transforming" the studio, which will see it "reshaping to better support Skate's long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most" to players. This transformation, it said, will include layoffs.</p>

<p>"The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-2025">Skate.</a> Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today," <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">Full Circle wrote in a blog post</a>, stressing the "decision is not a reflection of their impact and we're committed to supporting them through this transition".</p>
<p>As for Skate, which was released in September and proved especially popular on its first day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-players-stuck-in-lengthy-queues-for-online-only-skate-those-who-made-it-in-are-comparing-its-bouncing-belly-flopping-traversal-to-mario-64">leading to lengthy queues</a>, work will still continue. "We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you," Full Circle said. "Our commitment to Skate, and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong."</p>
<p>The studio did not say how many Full Circle employees are affected by the this week's layoffs. Eurogamer has asked EA for a comment and will update when we know more.</p>
<p>"After an absolute age, EA's wheelie classic is back with great handling and a whole world of slightly jarring niceness," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-early-access-review">Skate early access review</a>.</p>
