            <p>Mojang Studios has entered a partnership with theme park operator Merlin Entertainments to introduce real-life Minecraft experiences across the globe, beginning in the UK and US.</p>
<p>Merlin Entertainments - which is also behind tourist hot spots such as Alton Towers and Legoland, to name but two - is investing in excess of £85m in the first two planned Minecraft attractions, marking the company's first global partnership with a gaming brand.</p>

<p>While Merlin and Mojang have not shared specific dates or locations, these "experiences" are expected to launch in the UK and US between 2026 and 2027, and include Minecraft-themed accommodation, along with food, beverages, a themed ride and other "exciting" elements. Following this, Merlin and Mojang will expand this partnership - known as "Adventures Made Real" - further afield.</p>
<p>"This is a significant milestone for Merlin, which reinforces our commitment to reaching new audiences through bold and captivating concepts, and directly supports our ambitions for growth," Scott O'Neil, CEO of Merlin Entertainments, said today.</p>
<p>"Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, and this world-first will see fans experience its thrill and creativity in real life, at theme parks and city-centre attractions in leading tourist destinations."</p>

<p>"Partnering with Merlin Entertainments is an incredibly exciting step for us at Mojang Studios. Merlin's expertise in creating world-class attractions makes them the perfect partner to help us bring Minecraft to life in new and immersive ways in permanent locations around the globe," Kayleen Walters, vice-president franchise development for gaming at Microsoft, added. Microsoft acquired Mojang and Minecraft back in 2014, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buys-mojang-and-minecraft">deal worth $2.5bn</a>.</p>
<p>"Our vast and diverse community is always looking for new opportunities to explore and engage with Minecraft, and we are thrilled to build touchpoints around the globe that will surprise and delight them," Walters continued. </p>
<p>
"These new real-life Minecraft experiences will not only grow our community but also offer fans many more opportunities to immerse themselves in the world of Minecraft in ways they've never imagined."</p>

<p>Along with these upcoming attractions, Minecraft also has a number of other projects in the pipeline, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">live-action film starring Jack Black as Steve</a> (see trailer above) and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series.</p>
<p>Netflix will produce this project alongside Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development. While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of Minecraft in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-syndicate-gets-ps5-pro-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-enhancements.1039245/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-syndicate-gets-ps5-pro-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-enhancements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Blimey guvnor! Ubisoft has only gone and slapped a shiny ol' update on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>, that game set in Victorian London.
</p>
<p>
Ahem. First released in 2015, it's something of a surprise to see Syndicate get an update now. But as Assassin's Creed fans are now waiting until February for the upcoming Japan-set Shadows, it's perhaps a good time to give this enjoyable romp a revisit.
</p>
<p>
Last night, Ubisoft issued a patch that added 60FPS support on Xbox Series X and S, as well as on PlayStation 5 and the newly-launched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Details of the update as <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/5wlBeqYoDHhzrh61xMNj7R">shared</a> by Ubisoft lie below.
</p>
<p><strong>Xbox (~31.8 GB)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox Series X</li>
<li>4K resolution at 60 fps</li>
<li>Xbox Series S</li>
<li>1080p resolution at 60 fps</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PlayStation (~0.75 GB)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>PS5 and PS5 Pro</li>
<li>1080p resolution at 60 fps</li>
<li>4K resolution at 60 fps</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nearly a decade on, Syndicate feels a little overlooked in the Assassin's Creed canon, which is a shame. Its release came at a difficult time for the Assassin's Creed franchise overall - a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">the disaster that was Unity</a>, and while work to softly reboot the series with Origins had already begun.
</p>
<p>
But Syndicate has some great moments, the Frye Twins' co-protagonist mechanic works well, and it hosts a beautiful rendition of London (Big Ben! Leaping between boats on the Thames! A moving steam train hideout!). </p>
<p>
  If you're yet to give it a go, it's a refreshing change from the hardboiled history of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> or the melodrama of Unity. It's also the first time Ubisoft Quebec (the studio behind the upcoming Shadows, as well as the Ancient Greek-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>) got to spearhead a full game for itself.
</p>
<p>
"Syndicate moves Assassin's Creed forward with a solid new adventure, a beautiful London playground and a renewed sense of fun," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-syndicate-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Syndicate review</a>. Cor!

            <p>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka would love to see a similar remake for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>, though there are no "concrete plans".</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dragon-quest-3-remake-interview-hd-2d-final-fantasy-vi">Inverse</a>, Hayasaka discussed the popularity of the HD-2D visual style and whether he'd like to see any other games be remade in this way.</p>
<p>"It’s not that we have concrete plans for this, but personally I would have to say Final Fantasy 6," he said. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> - the first HD-2D title - was developed while referencing FF 6, as it had the highest quality pixel art. I would love to see how the game we referenced would look with the HD-2D art style."</p>

<p>He continued: "Because this art style itself was created while referencing such titles, it’s highly compatible with games originally made using pixel art. This compatibility is probably why people feel this style is a match made in heaven with these types of remakes."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 6 would certainly be a popular choice for a remake in this style, alongside the iconic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. In fact, last year an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/3d-artist-recreates-chrono-trigger-in-hd-2d-style">artist created a HD-2D concept of Chrono Trigger</a> that proved popular on social media.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 6 is already available on modern platforms as part of the Pixel Remaster collection.</p>
<p>Hayasaka also discussed some of the difficulties of remaking classics in HD-2D, comparing the first teaser for Dragon Quest 3 released three years ago to the final product released last week.</p>
<p>"I’m sure you will find everything to be different, from the map size to the characters’ body proportions," he said. "We get asked why things took so long since the first announcement, but the fact that we needed this much time speaks to how intensely involved the process of applying HD-2D graphics to Dragon Quest 3 truly was.</p><p>"Some say that because HD-2D is pixel-based and this game is a remake, it should be easier to produce, but that is far from the truth! In my opinion, this style requires a higher level of artistic sensibility, and a remake faces more project-level limitations compared to a brand-new title, making the difficulty extremely high. After all, the expectations from the fans of the original game are a monumental hurdle we must work hard to meet."</p>
<p>"The HD-2D overhaul is stunning," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review">Eurogamer Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake review</a>.</p>
<p>"Blocky sprites are replaced by ones with much higher detail, and they're placed on 3D backgrounds with a camera tilt that still retains the proportions of the old sprite style. It looks exactly how you remember old games felt to play - the goggles of nostalgia made real - only everything's a little smoother now thanks to its new autosave, a greater number of places to save more generally, objective markers to help direct you, and an easier way to teleport between visited locations."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Kadokawa buyout would also include Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership studio.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
PlayStation maker Sony is currently in talks that would likely see it acquire a controlling stake in FromSoftware, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, Dark Souls and Bloodbourne, as part of a buyout of its owner, the Japanese publishing giant Kadokawa.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/">Reuters</a> report which claims a deal could be signed in weeks, via sources with knowledge of discussions between the two companies. Both Sony and Kadokawa declined to comment on that report.
</p>
<p>
Launched in 2022, Elden Ring has now sold more than 25m copies worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Sony already owns a 14 percent stake in FromSoftware, and already has ownership of both the Bloodborne and Demon Souls franchises. FromSoftware, meanwhile, owns the rights to Elden Ring and Sekiro.</p>
<p>This deal would likely result in PlayStation gaining the 69.6 percent stake in FromSoftware that Kadokawa holds, meaning it would hold a commanding 84 percent of the company. (Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> currently owns the remaining 16 percent.)
</p>
<p>
Kadokawa owns various other studios, too. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and Tenchu developer Acquire, which recently developed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> for Nintendo Switch, Shiren the Wanderer studio Spike Chunsoft and RPG Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games.
</p>
<p>
Outside of video games, Kadokawa is also a huge name in anime and manga, and would be a significant addition to Sony's existing portfolio that includes Crunchyroll and Funimation. 
</p>
<p>
PlayStation's other recent purchases include UK studio Firesprite, plus Housemarque and Nixxes, all in 2021. Most recently, Sony bought the Jade Raymond-founded startup Haven Studios in 2022, currently working on Fairgame$.
