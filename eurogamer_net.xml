            <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he would be "delighted" to visit president-elect Donald Trump and "do everything we can" to help his administration succeed.</p>
<p>Huang was interviewed by Bloomberg following Nvidia's presentation at CES earlier this week, in which he discussed the company's AI technology and how AI will "reinvigorate" the gaming industry.</p>
<p>However, he's yet to receive an invite from Trump to Mar-a-Lago. "I'd be delighted to go see him," said Huang, "and congratulate him and do everything we can to help this administration succeed."</p>

<figcaption>Nvidia CEO Huang New Chips, AI, Musk, Meeting Trump<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOZYI3F1g7c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Huang is the latest tech boss to pay obeisance to Trump's regime, following Apple CEO Tim Cook, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who have all donated to Trump's inauguration fund.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, Huang would have made similar comments had Kamala Harris won the presidency instead, considering he's CEO of not only one of the biggest tech companies in the US but - for a brief time last year - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidias-market-value-surges-due-to-ai-prominence-rather-than-gpus">most valuable company in the world</a>.</p><p>It's perhaps Huang's flattery of Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk that's pertinent. Huang described Musk as "very optimistic" about the future of AI and is working on "some of the most important AI areas". Tesla is in fact a customer of Nvidia, with its AI tech included in vehicles.</p>
<p>AI has formed a major part of Nvidia's latest tech reveals, including its new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-dlss-4-on-nvidias-new-geforce-rtx-5080">GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Huang told Bloomberg: "At the limit, artificial intelligence is the single most important technology force of our time and we're at the beginning of that."</p>
<p>Further, he specified AI will "reinvigorate" the video game industry.</p>
<p>"On the one hand, for developers, it's going to reduce the cost of creating the content," he said. "On the other hand, all of the characters that are in the games are going to be smart characters in the future, so every time you interact with them they're going to be interacting with you in a much more intelligent way.</p><p>"And so the games are going to be more interesting, characters are going to be more interesting, the content development cost is going to decline, and that's going to be really great for the industry. I think the future's really bright for video games and these virtual worlds, and artificial intelligence is going to reinvigorate it."</p>
<p>Huang's comments on AI are a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-boss-we-cant-do-graphics-anymore-without-ai">continuation of last year</a>: "We can't do computer graphics anymore without artificial intelligence," he said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology conference.</p>
<p>Still, not everyone shares his view on AI. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/google-has-developed-an-ai-tool-that-generates-fully-playable-3d-worlds">Google works on new AI tools</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">EA's CEO</a> stated AI is "the very core of our business", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-says-ai-will-revolutionise-gaming-but-must-be-balanced-with-human-touch">PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst</a> was more tentative stating it won't replace the "human touch", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eschewing-generative-ai-in-favour-of-decades-of-know-how">Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa</a> said the company would instead rely on "decades of know-how".</p>
<p>Just this week, PUBG maker Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-unveils-chatty-co-op-buddy-powered-by-generative-ai-thats-designed-to-play-and-talk-like-a-human-teammate">unveiled its new AI companions</a>, while voice actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Jennifer Hale has discussed with Eurogamer the dangers of AI to performers</a> and why it's holding up SAG-AFTRA strike negotiations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following a festive bout of generosity with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-sim-wants-to-put-you-in-the-festive-mood-with-this-free-christmas-update">December's free PowerWash Simulator update</a>, developer FutureLab has announced the squirt 'em up's next blast of paid DLC, this time themed around Lancashire's premier Wensleydale gobblers, Wallace &amp; Gromit.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>'s Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack - which FuturLab <a href="https://x.com/PowerWashSim/status/1875195484605964647">sneakily teased in a social media post</a> earlier this month amid praise for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m0022179/wallace-gromit-vengeance-most-fowl">new movie Vengeance Most Fowl</a> - has been developed in collaboration with animation house Aardman. It'll be whisking players to the duo's home of 62 West Wallaby Street <em>and beyond</em> when it arrives later the year.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, FuturLab promises a "cracking cleaning adventure" that'll take players - hoses in hand and a deep-seated hatred of grime in their hearts - from "charming British suburbs to cheesy celestial bodies." And that's pretty much all we know about the DLC so far.

<p>
PowerWash Simulator's Wallace &amp; Gromit Special Pack - which follows similar DLC collaborations with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-heading-to-shreks-fairytale-world-this-autumn">Shrek</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wash-your-bikini-bottom-in-new-powerwash-simulator-sponge-bob-crossover">SpongBob Square Pants</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/back-to-the-future-cruises-into-powerwash-simulator-next-month">Back to the Future</a> - doesn't have a release date yet, but FuturLab says it's out this year and "coming soon".
</p>
<p>
It'll be available on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, Switch, and PC when it eventually shows up, and should - based on previous DLC releases - cost around £6.50.

Microsoft will once again hold a Xbox Developer Direct to kick off the new year, with deep dives into a small selection of upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> titles.
</p>
<p>
Xbox's next livestream will begin at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific) on Thursday, 23rd January - that's a fortnight from today.
</p>
<p>
On the schedule will be a detailed look at Doom: The Dark Ages, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and a mystery fourth game from an unknown studio. Mysterious! 
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages has been dubbed as an origin story for the series' iconic Doom Slayer from veteran developer id Software, and is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point in 2025. Will we get a date? It seems likely.
</p><p>South of Midnight, meanwhile, is the stylish-looking action-adventure from We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games,  set in a gothic fantasy American Deep South. It looks a treat, though also currently lacks a release date beyond "2025". Here's hoping we find out when exactly it'll arrive for PC and Xbox Series X/S very soon.</p>
<p>Next up, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This is the dark fantasy RPG from French outfit Sandfall Interactive that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">we reckon has shades of Persona and Final Fantasy</a>, plus the vocal talents of Andy Serkis and Charlie Cox. Clair Obscur isn't an Xbox Game Studios title and is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point this year.</p>
<p>And then there's that fourth game. Microsoft still has plenty on its 2025 release schedule that this could be - Fable, The Outer Wilds, even Avowed - which will be just a month away. But the secretive nature here suggests something that hasn't yet publicly been confirmed. It'll be interesting to see if internet rumours of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake bear any fruit.</p>
<p>Join us in a couple of weeks for Xbox Developer Direct, right here on Eurogamer, when we'll be reporting live.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in November, relaxed garden puzzle game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/botany-manor">Botany Manor</a> was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-horticultural-puzzler-botany-manor-comes-to-playstation-in-december">announced</a> as getting a belated launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
An impressive indie 3D puzzling effort, Botany Manor had already shone on PC, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X - including Xbox Game Pass - earlier in 2024. 
</p>
<p>
But in December, publisher Whitethorn Games issued an <a href="https://x.com/WhitethornGames/status/1868687621217473001">update</a> to say Botany Manor had hit a snag, and would now launch in the new year. Well, here we are - and today brings a fresh (and hopefully final) PlayStation launch date for the game: 28th January.
</p>

<p>I can wholeheartedly recommend Botany Manor, as one of the few games I actually got around to fully completing last year. You're given the keys to a National Trust-style estate that slowly opens up over time as you uncover mysteries and grow long-lost blooms through increasingly brain-teasing ways.
</p>
<p>But things never get too taxing, the game is relentlessly chilled out, and the game's gentle story offers just enough of a glimpse at life within its Victorian-era surroundings to keep you intrigued.</p>
<p>
"Perhaps an afternoon in Botany Manor's company will inflame your own curiosity for nature," Matt wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">Eurogamer's Botany Manor review</a> last year. "Or perhaps you'll simply be content to explore its sun-dabbled corners, solve its few clever puzzles, and enjoy the timeless pleasures of an enchanting summer's day stroll."
