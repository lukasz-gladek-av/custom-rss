            <p>Netflix considers Warner Bros.' game studios to be "relatively minor", as it admits they didn't factor into its $82.7bn acquisition deal.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">Netflix announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros.</a>, which would include its game studios as part of the bid. That said, gaming was not mentioned in the press release for the news, while a webcast for the news only included gaming in passing.</p>
<p>Now, in the company's <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters made it clear gaming was not a major consideration as part of its bid. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things," he said.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Warner Bros. has been struggling in the games industry as of late. In its 2025 Q1 earnings report, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">company reported a 48 percent decrease in games revenue due to no new releases</a>. Its most recent earnings report from November reports a 23 percent decrease, again due to no new releases.</p>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">cancellation of a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy</a>; layoffs at Rocksteady after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">Suicide Squad flopped</a>; the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation of Monolith Productions' Wonder Woman game</a>; and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of brawler Multiversus</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it's not as if Warner Bros. isn't capable of success. A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> earlier this year stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> had sold over 34m copies, making it one of the best-selling games ever. A sequel is reportedly in the works.</p><p>"Now we're super excited because some of those properties that they've built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering," said Peters in the Netflix earnings call. "Quite well" is a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>He continued: "They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model."</p>
<p>Though harsh, there's certainly some truth in Peters' comments. Hogwarts Legacy's success alone isn't enough to keep Warner Bros.' gaming studios afloat. And while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">change in leadership came in June as the company doubled down on its biggest franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, Game of Thrones), nothing has been seen yet.</p>
<p>Still, it appears gaming is not a priority for Netflix, which doesn't bode well for the future of these studios. So while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is reportedly working on a new Batman game</a> to follow its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, it's unclear how this may be impacted by the acquisition.</p>
<p>And it's not quite over yet - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramount-to-ruin-the-netflix-party-hollywood-studio-announces-clearly-superior-warner-bros-offer-of-its-own">Paramount has also made a public offer for Warner Bros.</a>, in a bid to outdo Netflix's "inferior" proposal.</p>

            <p>Doom creator John Romero's cancelled game is back, with the developer stating the untitled project has "survived".</p>
<p>Following mass layoffs at Microsoft this summer, Romero Games - the studio set up by the Doom creator and his wife Brenda - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">its publisher had pulled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios"</a>. While Microsoft was not mentioned as being involved, this much was inferred.</p>
<p>Soon after this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">Romero Games assured fans the studio had not been closed</a>, and the team was now on the hunt for a new publisher to handle its cancelled game. And, it seems a new publisher or some kind of deal was indeed found, with Romero recently stating the game had "survived cancellation".</p>

<p>Romero discussed the topic of his studio's cancelled game at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (see video below). Confirming it had been saved, Romero was met with waves of applause from the audience, before he shared a few more details about what we can all expect on its release.</p><p>"There's a really good 110 people working on the game," Romero said, adding it has "been basically completely redesigned". The studio's upcoming game has "nothing" to do with the previous game, he furthered, but "incorporates a lot of the elements" from it.</p>
<p>"We're not starting at ground zero," the developer said. "We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design."</p>
<p>He added it is now a "much smaller game" than before, but it is "more fun" for the team as "the people working on it are all directors from different departments, and they didn't actually get to the code or design or whatever to do it themselves, but now we get to actually do that". Said Romero: "[We get to] do the thing we are really good at, ourselves. And, that's why small teams are great."</p>
<p>The developer still can't talk about the design specifics just yet, but said he has "never played a game like it" before. We do know that it is a shooter, though. "But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was a really new experience," he said.</p>
<p>"It was a very crazy place, and a different world, and it was really cool to explore it and be like 'what is that?'," Romero elaborated. "That's the idea behind what we are doing in this game."</p>

<p>As well as Doom, Romero is also known for Quake and Wolfenstein. These games all pioneered the first person shooter genre, and at GDC in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-romero-memoir-doom-guy-getting-not-one-but-two-screen-adaptations">Romero was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work</a>.</p>

            <p>New trademarks for the Divinity franchise have been spotted online ahead of The Game Awards, leading fans to believe the mystery of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-statue-fromsoftware-lords-of-the-fallen-studio">Geoff's demonic statue in the Mojave Desert</a> has finally been cracked.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">mp1st</a>, trademarks for a Divinity logo and two icons have been <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427">registered in Europe</a>. One icon, with its glowing orb and spindly leg design, certainly resembles the statue. Fans have therefore quickly jumped to the conclusion of Larian announcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 3 later this week.</p>
<p>Yet those hopes have been somewhat dashed by Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse. "There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity: Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will," he responded on social media.</p>

<p>So what does this relate to? Douse's reply is in response to a leak of a PS5 Definitive Edition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, Larian's 2017 RPG it developed before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> that released on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch. "Hey we weren't meant to announce that yet," wrote Douse.</p>

<p>So does that mean the trademarks relate to this new edition of Original Sin 2? Or is Larian working on a new game in the Divinity franchise, just not Original Sin 3?</p>
<p>The Divinity franchise began with Larian's 2002 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, and has received seven entries so far.</p>

<p>Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke previously announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">studio's next game won't be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, nor will it be related to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It will be "still familiar enough, but different," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-will-have-different-tone-style-way-of-doing-it-to-baldurs-gate-3-but-wont-dwarf-it">Vincke told Eurogamer</a>, while the "tone, style, way of doing it, are for us certainly new - and I think very appealing."</p><p>It's unclear what Larian is working on next, though it seems a return to Divinity shouldn't be ruled out. Either way, following the phenomenal success of Baldur's Gate 3, the studio's next game is hugely anticipated - and certainly worthy of a demonic statue.</p>

            <p>Activision's annual Call of Duty series will no longer see back-to-back entries in its Modern Warfare and Black Ops sub-franchises.</p>
<p>The change comes after this year's entry - Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, which succeeded 2024's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">received negative feedback from critics and players</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european-sales-are-63-down-on-battlefield-6-and-50-down-on-black-ops-6">concerning sales reports across the industry</a>.</p>

<p>In a blog post shared last night, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">the Call of Duty team</a> - which includes studios Treyarch, Sledgehammer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> and Raven Software - acknowledged that the franchise had "not met" many players' expectations in recent times.</p>
<p>"With respect to Black Ops 7, we set our sights to deliver a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 and the studios have poured their passion into making a great game that all of us are very proud of. But it's one thing for us to say it, more importantly it's up to you to try it and judge for yourselves," it said.</p><p>As such, the Call of Duty team is going to be making some adjustments to its strategy from now. First off, it is opening up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-zombies-dark-ops-challenges">Black Ops 7's multiplayer zombies mode</a> for a free trial and Double XP weekend next week. This is in order to allow anyone who has been on the fence about Black Ops 7 to "experience the game firsthand and decide" for themselves.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team is also committing to "unprecedented season support" for Black Ops 7, saying it "won't rest" until the game "earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we've ever made".</p>
<p>In addition, the studios said there will be no back-to-back releases of either Black Ops or Modern Warfare (which it did in 2022 and 2023) from now on.</p>
<p>"The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year," the team wrote. "We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren't sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p>
<p>It believes the franchise's future is "strong" and that its "best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent" of its development teams.</p>
<p>"We have been building the next era of Call of Duty, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the franchise and the genre forward," the blog closed. "We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together."</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 recently came under fire for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">apparent use of generative AI</a>. This matter was then brought up by US Congressman Ro Khanna who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-members-of-the-us-congress-are-pushing-back-against-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-ai-use">responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 by highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Connor recently spoke to analyst Rhys Elliott and The Game Business' Chris Dring about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">why Call of Duty Black Ops 7 failed to hit the mark this year</a>.</p>
