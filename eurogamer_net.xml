            <p>Embark Studios has announced it has been quietly testing out duo queue in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> this week, and has now announced the option officially on its official website for pairs of pals to enjoy at their leisure.</p>
<p>In the official post, Embark explains how it'll work as such: "Duo matchmaking will work like this: first, we prioritise Solos and Squads to play separately. After that, we prioritise Duos to play with other Duos, and for Trios to play with Trios. Please note that this is not a 100 percent guaranteed system, so you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own."</p>
<p>In addition to the duo queue rollout, Embark Studios has lowered the price of in-game cosmetics after community feedback. These price changes will go into effect starting tomorrow on the 13th November. For anyone who had already purchased in-game cosmetics, the difference between the old price and the new one will be refunded to their accounts.</p>

</figure>
<p>The team at Embark also emphasised a lack of pay-to-win in its upcoming premium raider decks. For those who don't know, raider decks are essentially progress paths in which players can unlock cosmetics and in-game items through completing challenges. At the moment, there's just a free one. However, paid options will be coming in the future, leading some to worry about potential pay-to-win concerns.</p><p>To this, Embark noted the following: "Gameplay Items are only in free Raider Decks. To help you along the way as a new Raider, we have included some Gameplay Items in the free Raider Deck, which can be unlocked via progression. There are no Pay to Win items in the premium Raider Decks. The focus for premium Decks are based on cosmetics and convenience."</p>

            <p>Nintendo has finally shown the first official trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-2026">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, its follow-up to the phenomenally successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>
<p>The trailer was included as part of a short Direct stream, introducing both Rosalina and Bowser Jr, as well as their respective voice actors Brie Larson and Benny Safdie.</p>
<p>So what little nuggets of Nintendo magic were we able to spot so far?</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct 11.12.2025<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqjMaKQskW8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>The trailer begins with Bowser painting in his castle, though he's in miniature form after consuming a mini mushroom at the end of the previous film. Seeing Bowser with a paintbrush seems to be foreshadowing the inclusion of his offspring later in the trailer.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A closer look at his paintings shows various scenes and characters from across the Mario series, including a Boo, the smiling flowers from Yoshi's Island, and his iconic Koopa Clown Car.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for his "masterpiece for Princess Peach", it's quite something.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We then cut to Mario and Peach witnessing shooting stars over the castle, seemingly instigating the events of the film and hinting at its cosmic, outer space themes.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Peach and Toad are then seen using an iconic star portal from the Mario Galaxy games to shoot into space. Here they fly through a small spherical world, just like the games, this one a water-filled environment with Bloopers.</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

<figure>
 


</figure>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After this we see two characters cloaked in red and green (presumably Mario and Luigi) on motorbikes in a desert. While this may be a nod to Mario Kart, they're then seen leaping over dunes towards an inverted pyramid taken straight from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s Sand Kingdom. So it's not just Galaxy that's inspired the events of the film.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next is Peach battling a load of Ninji's with her umbrella in some sort of neon-lit casino arena, which could be a reference to both Ninji Jump Party in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and the Sirena Beach Casino in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>. Ninjis were first seen in Super Mario Bros. 2, before appearing in multiple games in the series since.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And here he is! Bowser Jr, complete with his Super Mario Sunshine paintbrush, will seemingly be the main villain in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie on a quest to rescue his father. Except he has a more futuristic appearance from his Super Mario Bros. Wonder appearance, including metallic armour, a robotic voice, and a paintbrush that morphs into a morning star on a chain.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the title card, an extra scene reveals Rosalina, the cosmic heroine from the Mario Galaxy games. She sneaks out of Princess Peach's castle and is immediately confronted by Megaleg, a robotic boss familiar to Mario Galaxy players. Rosalina then battles the robot using star magic similar to those portals seen earlier. She's pretty badass. What's more, the music includes a melodic nod to the Gusty Garden Galaxy at the very end.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That marks the end of the trailer, though the Direct showed a little more. Introducing Brie Larson as Rosalina's voice actor, we see a scene with Rosalina sat reading a storybook to a bunch of colourful Lumas. She begins to read a story about Peach, though the Lumas chant for the "one about the plumbers" instead. Both Mario Galaxy games (at least now thanks to the new Switch versions) include scenes of Rosalina reading from her storybook to chronicle events prior to the games' plot, so this scene references that.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A final scene introducing Bowser Jr shows his more familiar getup, so it'll be interesting to see where his futuristic outfit comes from.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And that's it for now. There's no Yoshi just yet, though his inclusion is widely anticipated.</p>
<p>What's more, Illumination's Chris Meledandri hinted the film will have an "incredible range of characters…many for the first time, from iconic favourites to deep cuts that longtime fans will recognise". So who else are you hoping to see pop up in the film?</p>
<p>And most importantly: where is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/who-is-birdo">Birdo</a>?</p>
