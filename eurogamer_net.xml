            <p>Crystal Dynamics has announced the "difficult decision" to lay off more staff, citing "evolving business conditions". It added the decision was not made lightly, but was necessary to "ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">post shared on LinkedIn</a>, the studio thanked those impacted by these layoffs for their "hard work, talent and passion", stating Crystal Dynamics is "committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition".</p>

            <p>
Konami has acknowledged issues with Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater, as the stealth game remake launches today.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of release, some reviews have noted disappointing performance, particularly with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> version of the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am0ER7iW2lo">Digital Foundry</a>, for instance, noted issues due to the console's PSSR upscaling, despite it overall being a beautiful game.
</p>
<p>
In a statement shared on <a href="https://x.com/Metalgear/status/1960740185957917022">social media</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">Steam</a>, Konami said it had "received reports of several issues and are preparing a patch to address them", though general performance is not mentioned beyond a couple of specific points causing crashes.

<p>
The known issues acknowledged by Konami are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>
<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater is available now across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">Eurogamer's five star review of Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</a> describes it as "a surprisingly sensitive remake from Konami" that brings a legend back to life.
