            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a>'s next season is named Dual Destiny, and will kick off next week on Tuesday 3rd December. 
</p>
<p>
Its logo features obvious black and white-themed branding, which should perhaps not be a surprise considering Pok√©mon Black and White region Unova is next on the docket to be featured in the game's Go Tour event series. Dual Destiny finishes on 4th March, around the time we'd expected Go Tour Unova to be held.
</p>
<p>
So, why "Dual Destiny"? In a press briefing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> said the name was designed to reflect "opposites coming together to strengthen one another and celebrate two sides of a whole", which is nice.
</p>
<p>
In terms of content, much of what is to come will be announced over the coming days, but perhaps the headline for now is the early introduction of teacup Pok√©mon Sinistea. This fits the Dual Destiny branding as it has two different types - Antique and Phony - depending on whether it comes with a stamp of authenticity. (Maybe it should have been called Authencitea?)
</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Sinistea - a Ghost-type Pok√©mon that debuted in Pok√©mon Sword and Shield - it looks like a small chipped teacup. Its Pok√©dex entry describes it thus: "The soul of someone who died alone possessed some leftover tea." It evolves into Polteageist: "The tea that composes Polteageist's body has a distinct and enjoyable flavor. Drinking too much, however, can be fatal."</p>
<p>
From the start of the season, Red and Blue-striped Basculin will now be Shiny-possible and available in 7km eggs. Oddly, though, the form you obtain will relate to where the gift is <em>hatched</em>, not from where it was sent. (Here in the UK, you'll obtain Blue Basculin while on the West side of the Prime Meridian line, and Red Basculin on the East.)
</p>
<p>
Gigantamax Lapras will also make its debut in Max Battles, while Go Battle League will feature avatar items based on Unova Elite Four member Grimsley. Dragalge, Bibarel, Glliscor, Starmie and others will receive additional moves.

            <p>Improvements to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> are still not ready, despite Remedy today releasing a new update for the game across all platforms.</p>
<p>As with a handful of games, playing Alan Wake 2 on Sony's more powerful console results in performance issues, which players are waiting to be patched.</p>
<p>"The PlayStation 5 update (1.200.005) does not contain anything PlayStation 5 Pro specific, but we wanted to acknowledge that we are seeing your feedback," wrote Remedy in a post on X. "We are still researching a few things on the Pro when it comes to improved performance. We'll keep you posted. As PS5 Pro support was a work of many months, it will take the team longer than a few weeks for changes and improvements. Thank you for understanding!"</p>

<p>Still, the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">new patch</a> does include a number of improvements and fixes. For instance, Alan's hair now gets messier and when using the Classic Outfit it gets "properly soaked". He also now wears his wedding ring - bit awkward that.</p><p>Other changes include collectibles from DLC The Lake House appearing in Saga's Mind Place; the Night Springs theme is available in the Writer's Room after finishing any Night Springs chapter in the main campaign; gyro controls have been improved; and the "Thrower" enemies are less frustrating thanks to less frequent movement and teleportation.</p>

<p>Ahead of the PS5 Pro's release, Remedy released a detailed blog post explaining all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">improvements the Enhanced label would bring</a>.

            <p>
PlayStation is celebrating its upcoming 30th Anniversary by letting you sit on its logo while riding the Victoria Line.
</p>
<p>
The marketing stunt is the first time in over 25 years that Transport for London has allowed a brand to advertise on its Tube seats. It's also probably the first time in over 25 years that TFL has actually put in new Tube seats.
</p>
<p>
Sony's design includes the classic Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle buttons emblazoned across the Tube's usual moquette seat cushions. (Today I learned that the correct name for this type of fabric is indeed "moquette". Impress your friends.)
</p>
<p>
Here's how it all looks:
</p> <div>

<p>
Somewhat oddly, PlayStation has also suggested people should kiss while sat on these seats. I will continue staring at the ground trying to ignore everyone else as normal, but thank you anyway Sony.

<p>
Keen to spot the PlayStation Tube branding for yourself? You might find it more difficult than it first appears. Reading further, it seems like just one carriage on the Victoria Line has been given the PlayStation spruce-up. With 36 trains operating per hour, that might take a while to find.
</p><p>
This isn't the first time PlayStation has teamed up with TFL. Back in 2020, Sony took over the Tube signs outside Oxford Circus by replacing those with the Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle designs to promote the launch of PS5. Finding these signs was easier than finding an actual PS5 at the time.

And before that, PlayStation memorably stuck its favourite buttons up on London's Oxo Tower back in 2013, to celebrate the launch of PS4.

PlayStation celebrates its 30th anniversary next week, on Tuesday 3rd December, when it will have been three decades since the launch of the original PS1 in Japan. Eurogamer will be marking the occaison here too - stay in your PlayStation-branded seats for much more.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is quietly prepping plans to re-enter the handheld gaming market with a portable PS5</a> that's set to rival <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-x-s.1045413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft will shutdown its Xbox Avatar Editor app on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 9th January due to "low engagement", the company has said. 
</p>
<p>
This means you'll no longer be able to access or edit your Xbox Avatar, and you'll lose any purchased cosmetic items for them. Any money spent on avatar items will be refunded.
</p>
<p>
After 9th January, Xbox Avatars will disappear from profile pages, Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/xbox-avatar-editor-app-faq">said</a>. So, if you want to snap one last Gamerpic using your digital self, now's the time. 
</p>
<p>
The good news here is this solely refers to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-the-revamped-and-diverse-new-xbox-avatars-look-like">newer Xbox Avatars, launched in 2018 for the Xbox One era</a>. Microsoft's entirely separate and confusingly distinct Xbox Original Avatars are unaffected.
</p>
<p>
If you still remember (or use!) your Xbox 360, you'll remember having an avatar there, too. These avatars are what Microsoft now calls Xbox Original Avatars, and they were far more ingrained within Xbox 360's ecosystem. Some Xbox 360 games let you play as your avatar, for example, while others offered cosmetic avatar rewards via a system akin to Achievements.
</p>
<p>
Again, the Xbox 360-era Original Avatars are not going anywhere - hopefully because switching them off would be more of a headache when it comes to game preservation and back compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Back during the troubled times of the Xbox One, Microsoft pivoted back to using avatars and spent time creating an all-new system that offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-avatars-just-got-a-lot-more-diverse">far more diverse range of options and deeper customisation</a>. This included support for prosthetics, wheelchairs and gender neutral clothing, plus colour combinations for that can stretch to "almost eighty octillion", Microsoft said at the time.
</p><p>
"Microsoft is dedicated to delivering great experiences for players, including a variety of options to personalise their gaming experience with Xbox," Microsoft said in a statement now. "Due to low engagement and our shift in focus towards delivering other player experiences, the Xbox Avatar Editor app will no longer be available starting on 9th January, 2025.
</p>
<p>"Players can still personalise their gaming experience with dynamic backgrounds and profile colours on Xbox consoles, and with Xbox Original Avatars, profile themes, and gamerpics on Xbox consoles and PCs."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> and Mafia publisher 2K has killed off its PC  launcher, and uncoupled its top titles from the software.
</p>
<p>
Steam and Epic Games Store versions of BioShock Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-2">BioShock 2</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a> and 6, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a>, XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad and Marvel's Midnight Suns will now run without the 2K Launcher opening first.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9Z24V9Q3426C558WRC173K">blog post</a> on the changes, 2K said its launcher had now been removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam. Last night, an update was sent out to 2K games on Steam to ensure its removal - in case you wondered why BioShock was patched again.
</p>
<p>
From 2K's notes on the subject, the whole thing sounds like it should be pretty seamless. If you're still seeing the 2K Launcher now, be sure you've updated your games and rebooted Steam. 
</p>
<p>
Access to your games, as well as your save files, should continue uninterrupted, 2K says in a Q&amp;A on the subject. 
</p>
<p>
"Can I still use the 2K Launcher if I want to?" a final question asks. "We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest," is the response.
</p>
<p>
2K's next games include Civilization 7 and BioShock creator Ken Levine's mysterious Judas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">whenever that finally materialises</a>. When it does do so, however, it will be without the 2K Launcher.

<p>So what does this mean for Echoes of Wisdom? I'm yet to finish it myself, though in all honesty we all know the timeline is incredibly loose and somewhat meaningless.</p>
<p>Worryingly, though, after Echoes of Wisdom Nintendo specifies a "Decline of Hyrule Kingdom". What happened? What did you do Zelda?</p>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-places-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-outside-series-established-timeline">Nintendo officially listed both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom outside of the established timeline</a>, with no relation to previous games.</p>
<p>Further, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/11/12/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-eiji-aonuma/">The Washington Post</a>, series producer Eiji Aonuma stated Zelda games are developed from a gameplay perspective first, with story formed later. So how much does the timeline really matter?</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom was released on Switch back in September, and is the first game in the series to feature the titular princess as the playable protagonist.</p>
<p>Zelda voice actor Patricia Summersett told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/after-echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-actor-says-having-the-princess-as-the-playable-character-in-a-breath-of-the-wild-style-open-world-game-would-be-amazing/">GamesRadar</a> it would be "amazing" to see the princess as protagonist in an open world Zelda too. "I'm so happy for the fandom that they got Echoes of Wisdom, of course, but I mean, yeah, there can always be more playable Zelda as far as I'm concerned," she said.</p>
<p>"Thanks to playful puzzles and an imaginative reinvention of Hyrule's historic iconography, Echoes of Wisdom emerges as a bold and creative new chapter in Zelda's legend," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present">Echoes of Wisdom review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Is the next big video game company acquisition on the cards?</p>
<p>Last week, news broke that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony was in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>. A day later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged that takeover interest</a>. Should it be accepted, this would likely be the biggest video game acquisition since Microsoft bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> and Sony itself bought Destiny-maker Bungie.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is of course known for its Souls games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, and already has an established relationship with Sony due to exclusives like Bloodborne and Demon's Souls. Yet Kadokawa not only owns other developers, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> developer Acquire, it's a major name in anime and manga too - an area Sony already has considerable claim to with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-set-to-buy-crunchyroll-for-nearly-usd1bn">acquisition of Crunchyroll</a>.</p>
<p>So what's the likelihood of this acquisition being accepted? What does Kadokawa - and by extension FromSoftware - stand to gain from Sony ownership? And does this mean Bloodborne fans will finally get the re-release they so desperately crave?</p>
<p>Joining me to discuss the possible consequences of this acquisition on this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a> are news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake.</p>
