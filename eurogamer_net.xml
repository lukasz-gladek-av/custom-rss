            <p>The showrunner behind Amazon's live-action God of War TV series has shared some new details about what we can expect from Kratos and co on the show's release.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/">Collider</a> at San Diego Comic-Con, series showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore confirmed Amazon's God of War adaptation will remain largely faithful to Sony Santa Monica's 2018 game, though it won't be a frame-by-frame remake.</p>
<p>"This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore explained. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration. </p>
<p>"It's really been interesting."</p>

<p>The showrunner also added that game director Cory Barlog is actively involved with the project, with Moore calling Barlog - who also helmed 2022's God of War sequel Ragnarök - a "genius".</p>
<p>"I've had several meetings with Cory, and you ask Cory, 'Well, tell me about the backstory of this or how this works', and he just can talk because he holds it all in his head," Moore said. "And I usually pride myself about, as a showrunner, I can hold the season in my head. I know what the 10 episodes are, and I can tell you about them. Cory can tell you the whole thing in every possible way - all the mythology, how it connects one to the other, what the puzzles were, why they did this, and what that artifact did. It's really impressive.</p>
<p>"I mean, it is like a gigantic novel, even bigger than the Outlander novels, which is a lot to digest."</p>
<p>
In a separate interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjRM2TFvekQ">IGN</a>, Moore hinted that some of Kratos' previous escapades prior to Santa Monica's God of War reboot may also make an appearance. "You'll have to wait and see," Moore teased. </p>
<p>At the present time, those 10 episodes of Moore's God of War adaptation are still in the "scripts" phase. Filming may begin in 2026 at the earliest, Moore said.</p>

<p>Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">joining the project towards the end of last year</a> following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs">departure of the original team</a>. Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.</p>

            <p>Surprise! A new Friday the 13th-themed video game is on the way.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3890048/new-friday-the-13th-film-and-video-game-in-early-development/">BloodyDisgusting</a>, Horror Inc.'s Robbie Barsamian revealed that not only was a new movie on the cards, but a game - this one a prequel - was also in development.</p>
<p>When I say Barsamian gave us nothing else, I do mean exactly that: <em>nothing</em>. But it should be great news nonetheless for fans of Illfonic's game that died with a whimper after a licensing snarfu shut the 2017 game down at the end of last year.</p>

<p>"I can tell you that a new sequel movie and new sequel game are at the top of our list. It's where most of our energy's going right now. And I can tell you finally we're in a position to deliver on that," said Barsamian.</p>
<p>"While we're not officially announcing with our partners today, both are coming. They're both in the works and they’re both coming."</p>
<p>Illfonic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a> launched back in 2017, and, despite a rocky start, proved to be a solidly entertaining - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-has-sold-over-1-8m-copies">commercially successful</a> - horror experience. Unfortunately, its development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lawsuit-will-block-friday-13th-getting-any-new-content-ever-it-sounds-like">ended prematurely</a> in 2018 as a result of a lawsuit relating to the ownership of the Friday the 13th licence. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-dev-bestows-max-power-on-all-players-ahead-of-shutdown">It eventually shut down on 31st December 2024</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/friday-the-13th-the-game-studio-illfonic-lays-off-staff-as-it-realigns-to-a-refined-strategy">an unspecified number of layoffs as Illfonic "realign[ed] to a refined strategy"</a>.</p>
<p>Gun Interactive, which published the asymmetrical horror, later went on to publish the Texas Chain Saw Massacre game.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/another-friday-the-13th-game-is-on-the-way-and-this-ones-a-prequel]]></content:encoded>
