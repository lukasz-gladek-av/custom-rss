            <p>
Rockstar has at last updated the PC, PlayStation and Xbox versions of its classic GTA Trilogy to receive the same improvements already found in its mobile port. 
</p>
<p>
GTA Trilogy originally launched for PC and consoles exactly three years ago to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">decidedly negative reception</a> due to its various graphical issues and glitches, prompting a sarcastic response from the port's original development studio and an apology from Rockstar itself. 
</p>
<p>
Now, three years later, improvements already found in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-tested-on-iphone">GTA Trilogy's warmly-received smartphone version</a> - launched via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> - can finally be found elsewhere. Most notably, this includes the trilogy's Classic Lighting mode, which restores the brighter and more colourful vibes of the games' original versions.

<p>
As <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/">RockstarIntel</a> notes, you can find the Classic Lighting option now in each games' pause menu - though, somewhat tellingly, the feature has been enabled by default. Other additions include character model improvements, plus visual improvements for heat haze and ambient clouds.

GTA Trilogy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">disastrous launch sparked countless refund requests</a> as the game arrived in a buggy state. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">Rockstar quickly pulled the game offline</a> for three days, albeit with different concerns - apparently to scrub the inclusion of unlicensed music within the game's files, as well as files with developer comments and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-discover-hot-coffee-code-in-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">the infamous Hot Coffee sex mini-game</a>.
</p>
<p>"There are a lot of problems here," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-grand-theft-auto-3-definitive-edition-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">Digital Foundry wrote of the GTA Trilogy</a> upon the package's original launch, "issues that are so blatant and jarring and ridiculous, it's hard to understand how the game made its way through quality control."</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-apologises-for-gta-trilogy-definitive-editions-unexpected-issues-re-lists-classic-versions-for-pc">apologised</a>, offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-remaster-can-claim-an-extra-game-for-free">free Rockstar game</a> for PC owners, and began providing patches. But problems persisted - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-released-on-steam-in-sorry-state">GTA Trilogy's Steam launch in January 2023 drew similar complaints</a> over its poor quality. Here's hoping now, finally, Rockstar has provided.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
