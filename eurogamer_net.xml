It seems <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s divisive Game-Key Cards - physical releases containing a download "key", rather than the full game data - will be a pretty common sight when the console launches this June. The vast majority of third-party Switch 2 physical releases currently available for pre-order in Japan come on game-key cards, and the situation is looking similar in the UK.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2's game-key-card-heavy launch window line-up was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lniuq7ix4k25">first highlighted by Gematsu</a>, which noted all third-party physical releases seen so far in Japan feature box art indicating their game-key card status. The exceptions are CD Projekt's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and all Nintendo Switch 2 Edition titles - that is, original Switch games featuring Switch 2 specific enhancements.
</p>
<p>
The likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bravely-default">Bravely Default</a>: Flying Fairy, Wild Hearts, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-0-review">Yakuza 0</a>: Director's Cut, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, and Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion all feature game-key card branding on their Japanese boxes, with 11 out of 12 Switch 2-specific third-party physical releases opting for the key-on-card approach. Nintendo's own titles - namely Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza - all use standard game cards.

<p>
Furthermore, it looks like the situation will be similar in the west if the handful of third-party Switch 2 games currently available to pre-order are any indication. UK retailer Smyths <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/gaming-and-tech/nintendo-switch-2/c/SM060402">features game-key card box art</a> for Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition, Street Fighter 6: Year 1-2 Fighters Edition, and Bravely Default: Flying Fairy, while Amazon in the US shows Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, Sonic X Shadow Generations, Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, Raidou: Remastered – The Mystery of the Soulless Army Launch Edition (all from Sega) utilising game-key cards.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-physical-releases-will-just-have-a-download-key-on-the-card">unveiled its game-key cards earlier this month</a>, as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">big Switch 2 blow-out</a>. "Game-key cards are different from regular game cards, because they don't contain the full game data," it said at the time. "Instead, the game-key card is your 'key' to downloading the full game to your system via the internet. After it's downloaded, you can play the game by inserting the game-key card into your system and starting it up like a standard physical game card."

The fact many third-party publishers have so enthusiastically embraced game-key cards this early into Switch 2's lifespan isn't likely to delight physical collectors, but the scheme does at least have one major advantage over code-in-a-box releases in that game-key card downloads aren't locked to a specific user account, meaning they can be shared and resold.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 officially launches on 5th June, and pre-orders were available in the UK just days after its big reveal. US and Canada pre-orders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-guide-us">finally went live today</a> after Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">opted to delay them</a> in order to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">assess the impact of the US administration's recent tariffs</a>. But while the console itself has retained its original $450 price tag in the US for now, Nintendo recently confirmed it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raising prices for various console accessories</a> "due to changes in market conditions".

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s second wave of physical Lego sets will include codes for in-game character skins.
</p>
<p>
The next batch of four Lego sets will drop in from the Battle Bus on 1st June - and there's a range of options to choose from.
</p>
<p>
Each contains exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> minifigures, as well codes to unlock at least one in-game skin per set - something the Lego Fortnite range did not include with its first four sets released last year.
</p>
<p>
Joining the range is <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/peely-sparkplug-s-camp-77075">Peely &amp; Sparkplug's Camp, the cheapest option at £18</a> for a 250-piece set. This looks to be based on the Lego Fortnite Odyssey game mode, as it features replicas of its workbench item and wolf enemy. Minifigures included are, unsurprisingly, Peely and Sparkplug. You'll also get a code for the Sparkplug in-game skin.
</p>
<p>
Next up in size is the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/durrr-burger-restaurant-77076">Durrr Burger Restaurant, priced at £54.99</a> for a 546-piece set. This includes a corner of the burger restaurant seen on various older Fortnite maps, plus minifigures for Beach Bomber, Beef Boss and Grimey. You'll also get a code for the Beef Boss in-game skin.

 </a>
</figure>
</figure>
<p>
Splash out a little more and you can buy the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/klombo-77077">Klombo set, priced £89.99</a>, which features Fortnite's lovable purple dinosaur as he appears in Lego Fortnite, plus minifigures for Oro and Adventure Peely. The in-game skin here is for Adventure Peely, which Lego Fortnite fans may have already from an earlier Lego Pass.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, this wave's centrepiece set is the enormous <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/mecha-team-leader-77078">£209.99 Mecha Team Leader model</a>. This is one of those big Lego sets designed to sit on a shelf and look impressive, rather than actually be played with - though at 45cm tall and weighing in at 2503 pieces, you're going to need a big shelf. 
</p>
<p>
Mecha Team Leader has been the star of a few Fortnite live events, most notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-how-fortnites-mecha-vs-monster-battle-played-out">the game's monster vs mech battle</a> that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-remix-finale-event-smashes-14m-all-time-player-record">remixed last year in a fight sequence featuring Eminem</a> (standard Fortnite). Included in the box are two codes each for both the Mecha Team Leader and Mecha Team Shadow skins. But is it worth £210? Hmm. You do get a Mecha Team Leader minifigure too...
</p>
<p>
Lego and Fortnite's collaboration began several years ago, with the launch of its in-game Lego Fortnite mode that has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">grown into several modes</a> and a platform for hundreds of smaller community-made minigames. Nearly all Fortnite skins now also have a digital equivalent (though not Eminem, in this case).
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus">Lego Fortnite's first four Lego sets</a> include a giant Supply Llama, a Durrr Burger, a large model of Peely Bone, and a recreation of the Battle Bus with around a dozen minifigures - that one really is very nice.
