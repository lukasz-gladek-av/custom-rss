            <p>The team over at Halo Studios will be giving us the "official scoop" for what it's been working on this October.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Halo Studios - n√©e 343 Industries - laid out further details for this year's Halo World Championship event. Here, the developer addressed the "fair amount of speculation" that has been making the rounds recently regarding what it has been working on.</p>

<p>"We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event," the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june">post on Halo Waypoint reads</a>.</p>
<p>The studio went on to confirm that, while speculation can be "fun" at times, those looking to get the official word of what is going on "won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship". That is taking place in Seattle, between 24th - 26th October.</p>
<p>In the same post, Halo Studios noted during last year's event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">it introduced Project Foundry</a>, its experimental look at how the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-halo-on-unreal-engine-5-means-for-ps5">Xbox flagship franchise will look developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>As for what the studio could be working on right now, the latest blog post affirmed multiple projects were in the pipeline. One of those projects may well indeed be the rumoured Halo Combat Evolved remaster, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-new-trailer-for-gears-of-war-reloaded">which even Xbox head Phil Spencer teased last month</a>. Then there was the chatter earlier in the year that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter"> Xbox was planning on bringing Halo to Switch 2 at some point</a>.</p>
<p>Who can say for sure. For now, we will just have to sit tight, and wait to see what October's Halo World Championship event has in store for us all. Stay tuned!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-official-scoop-on-whats-happening-with-halo-will-arrive-this-october]]></content:encoded>
