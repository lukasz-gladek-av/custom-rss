            <p>Fighting game Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has been refused a rating by the notoriously-strict Australian ratings board.</p>
<p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has been effectively banned down under by the country's Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications, and the Arts' Classification Board for "implied sexual violence".</p>

<p>Whilst no specific reason was given on the <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hunterhunter-nenimpact">ratings website itself</a> - in "reason for refused classification", it simply invites people to contact the organisation for more information - a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-za/entertainment/other/hunter-x-hunter-fighting-game-refused-classification-in-australia-for-implied-sexual-violence-against-minors/ar-AA1v8DFO">statement</a> from the Australian Classification Board said the game “contains a scene of a visual depiction of implied sexual violence, where an adult male exposes himself to persons under the age of 18 years".</p><p>Hunter x Hunter's first full-fledged fighting game is set to release in 2025, featuring 3v3 Nen ability team battles. It's unclear at this time if publisher Arc System Works will appeal the decision or censor its game accordingly to appease the board.</p>
<p>Just last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-suddenly-pulls-hotline-miami-2-from-aussie-ps5-owners-after-realising-countrys-ratings-board-denied-games-release-a-decade-ago">PlayStation removed Hotline Miami 2 from sale in Australia and refunded PS5 owners</a> who bought the game, a decade on from the infamous kerfuffle over its release down under.</p>
<p>Back in January 2015, designer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hotline-miami-2-banned-in-australia">Jonatan Söderström memorably told Aussie fans to simply pirate Hotline Miami 2 after its release was blocked by the Australian Classification Board</a>, due to its inclusion of a skippable scene that showed simulated sexual violence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has revised its <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/units-discount">loyalty program</a>, allowing players to "exchange units on a wider selection of products".</p>
<p>In an email sent out to players subscribed to the loyalty scheme and seen by Eurogamer, Ubisoft announced that effective immediately, the units collected by players "will now also apply to pre-order and new release purchases made on the Ubisoft store", with 100 units equating to a 20 percent discount.</p>

<p>As well as 20 percent discount on games and DLC for every 100 units - you get one unit for every $/£1 spent - you can also get "exclusive" in-game content and rewards, like legendary weapons, character skins, emotes, and consumables.</p>
<p>If you're interested in signing up, don't forget that new Ubisoft accounts start with 100 units, which is enough for a 20% discount on your first Ubisoft Store purchase.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">Ubisoft is continuing its talks with Chinese giant Tencent</a> over a possible buyout deal that would take the Assassin's Creed maker private.</p>
<p>The move - first mooted last month - would see Ubisoft take back control of its company from shareholders, and yesterday, Reuters reported that Ubisoft is seeking a deal which would see its French founders, the Guillemot family, retain control. However, the same report states that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra has slammed Marvel Rivals, intimating its an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> clone.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted tweet posted yesterday, Ybarra called NetEase Games' free-to-play team-based PVP shooter "Overwatch Marvel Rivals", adding that much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Light of Motiram</a> is "a clear copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>", Marvel Rivals clearly took inspiration from Blizzard's own team-based PVP shooter, Overwatch.</p>

<p>"Looks like Overwatch Marvel Rivals ships tomorrow," Ybarra wrote in the now-deleted tweet. "Much like Light of Motiram (a clear copy of [Horizon Zero Dawn]) out of China.</p>
<p>"I mean, even the character name - Windowmaker in [Overwatch] vs. Black Widow in Marvel Rivals lol - NetEase/Tencent - all the same."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Former Blizzard President Mike Ybarra calls Marvel Rivals "An Overwatch Clone" in a now Community Noted and Deleted tweet.</p><p>We cooked his ass 😋 <a href="https://t.co/IRMxF3tQCE">pic.twitter.com/IRMxF3tQCE</a></p></div>— Marvel Rivals Intel (@MarvelRivalsNew) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivalsNew/status/1864833976562782340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Before Ybarra deleted the post, however, a community note appended to the tweet said: "Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, is a popular Marvel hero who made her comic debut in 1964, more than 50 years before Overwatch and Widowmaker were created."</p><p>Marvel Rivals finally released in full yesterday on 6th December 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-hero-shooter-marvel-rivals-off-to-heroic-start-on-steam">Getting off to a heroic start on Steam</a>, it managed to already reach a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">Valve's platform</a>, with this number likely rising further again over the weekend.</p>
<p>The game itself is described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", and one which on its announcement head of Marvel Games Jay Ong called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-is-a-free-to-play-pvp-shooter-where-heroes-and-villains-fight-together-and-against-each-other">one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects"</a>, and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
