            <p>A patent filed by Sony over a year ago has resurfaced, and shows the company has ideas for an AI 'ghost' that could assist players if they get stuck in a game.</p>
<p>The aforementioned patent, which was recently noticed by <a href="https://www.allaboutai.com/ai-news/sony-ai-ghost-player-patent/">allaboutAI</a> and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">VGC</a>, describes an "overlay" version of a player's character. When in use, this overlay character would be able to demonstrate actions, such as how to solve a puzzle or by providing "example controller input button sequences", which would in turn allow a player to then progress with the game.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>In some cases, an AI 'ghost' could also have a conversation with the player's character and give some "guidance or instruction" about what to do. Other times, the ghost could complete a section for the player. It sounds like an evolution of PlayStation's Game Help on PS5, which offers users tips and guides via videos and images on screen.</p>
<p>An image within the patent also describes mode switching, which would encapsulate four different options for users to be able to choose from. These are: Story Mode, Combat Mode, Exploration Mode and Full Game Mode .</p>
<p>"Although video game technology has seen many advances, some players find themselves in need of assistance. Games become very complicated, so players who are not experts oftentimes quit playing or find it hard to complete tasks," <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025080356">the filing reads</a>. "Players are able to do research for the game or even look up prior gameplays on internet sites, but that process is time consuming and many times not very relevant to tasks and/or scenarios currently being encountered by the player."</p>
<p>Should these AI Ghost helpers become a reality, it appears that they would be trained on existing footage of any given PlayStation game.</p>



<p>Assistance in games is, of course, nothing new. As I have already mentioned, the PS5 has Game Help, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-soon-add-ai-copilot-to-minecraft-offering-real-time-advice">Microsoft has its own Copilot AI feature</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, games more broadly often include a range of features to make them more accessible for as wide an audience as possible. This includes everything from adjustable difficulty levels to controller remapping, colour-blind modes and in-game hint systems (I personally quite liked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returning-to-monkey-island-with-its-legendary-creators">book that Guybrush had tucked away in Return to Monkey Island</a>, but there are plenty of other examples out there).</p>

<p>As for AI, it remains an area of heated debate within the industry. In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">a report by Unity claimed 62 percent of studios using its tools used AI</a> at some point during game development. In this report, Unity noted animation was the top use case. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-third-of-developers-impacted-by-layoffs-in-last-12-months-according-to-gdc-survey">GDC survey from that same year</a>, meanwhile, said that around a third of industry workers reported using AI tools already. That number is now likely to be higher, and a more recent Tokyo Games Show survey reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI</a> in development.</p><p>Last year, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>.</p>

            <p>An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> player calling for help while playing the game had their door kicked in by a concerned neighbour, who thought their wails were a sign of real-world distress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/">User Dreamthorp on the Arc Raiders Reddit</a> was house-sitting for a friend and decided to boot up some Arc Raiders. While playing ,they claim to have been calling to their squadmates for help when a nearby neighbour heard the commotion. Fearing the worst, they came to the rescue, kicking the door.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the door didn't break thanks to the two deadbolts keeping it locked and secure. Dreamthorp claims that the friend they were house-sitting finds the whole situation funny, and the whole story has a happy ending, with Dreamthorp posting a picture of a six-pack of Shiners left at the neighbour's door as thanks.</p>

<p>Arc Raiders continues its hot streak as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">both a top seller over the Christmas holiday</a> and one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">of the most popular games out right now</a>, players remain engaged with its blend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">hyper aggressive extraction-style PvP gameplay</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">the interesting social dynamics present in an otherwise perilous experience</a>.</p><p>As for what's to come in 2026 for Arc Raiders? There's still little in terms of official confirmation on what's coming up for the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-snow-map-condition-flickering-flames">following its winter Cold Snap event</a>. With the year well underway, there's no doubt big news for Arc Raiders is just around the corner.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Rick Lane wrote: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>

            <p>The team over at Xbox has added two previously unannounced games to its Game Pass subscription service.</p>
<p>Game Pass subscribers can now play <strong>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition</strong> and <strong>Brews and Bastards</strong> through the service. These two titles were not previously said to be coming when Microsoft laid out its most recent Game Pass line-up plans.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares">Little Nightmares</a> Enhanced Edition and Brews and Bastards <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-december">join the likes of Dome Keeper and other recent Xbox Game Pass additions</a>.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition is a remaster of the unsettling puzzle platformer, which tells the tale of a yellow-raincoated girl named Six, as she attempts to escape The Maw. That is to say, a strange underwater vessel inhabited by a multitude of bizarre residents.</p>
<p>The adventure was warmly received on release, with Edwin Evans-Thirlwell calling it a "masterpiece of meat and malice" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-review">Eurogamer's Little Nightmares review</a>.</p>
<p>Brews and Bastards, meanwhile, is described as an "intoxicating" dungeon crawler, which developer Mune Studio says is "overflowing with action-packed combat, potent brews and outlandish bosses". Players will need to choose an "inebriated" hero to then make their way through "hordes of drunken demons" as they try to search for the stolen Brew Stone.</p><p>As well as these two new Game Pass additions, Xbox has also detailed five games that will be leaving the service in the coming weeks. These are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>, Road 96, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, The Grinch: Christmas Adventures - Merry and Mischievous Edition and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the most recent game from Tango Gameworks, is getting a special re-release in collaboration with Limited Run Games.</p>
<p>With pre-orders set to open from 16th January up until the 1st March, Hi-Fi Rush Rhythm Edition will feature the deluxe version of the game alongside three special DLC costumes. These costumes are the Bossplay, Traditional Garb, and Teamplay outfits. It'll be available for the Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p>
<p>Extra keen fans go opt for an even grander package with the Hi-Fi Rush Smidge Edition. This features the same Deluxe version of the game and DLC costumes, alongside a special three disc soundtrack, developer notes, and a custom box designed after the tutorial robot present in the game. There's also a bunch of in-game skins and gears for gameplay upgrades.</p>

<p>Then there's an even bolder option, the Project Armstrong Edition. This contains everything in the Smidge Edition alongside an 808 plush, a small replica of Chai's guitar, a Chai Project Armstrong pass, a glow-in-the-dark MP3 player pin, an hard cover art book, and an individually numbered certificate of authenticity.</p><p>Both the Smidge and Project Armstrong Edition will be going up for pre-order during the same period as the regular Rhythm Edition, <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/hi-fi-RUSH">and prices for each are viewable on the Limited Run website</a>. The Rhythm Edition will sell for $39.99, the Smidge Edition for $69.99, and the Project Armstrong Edition for $174.99.</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush has been through something of a journey over the past few years. Dropping suddenly back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">the game proved an exceptional release, receiving ample critical praise</a>. Its developer, Tango Gameworks, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">later shut down by Microsoft as part of widespread cuts</a>, which Xbox executive Matt Booty stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">was partly due to the studio's leadership change</a>, as Shinji Mikami left shortly after Hi-Fi Rush's release.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">The studio would then be saved by Krafton</a>, who acquired the team shortly after. Late last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-and-inzoi-publisher-krafton-declares-itself-an-ai-first-company-placing-ai-at-the-centre-of-problem-solving">Krafton would then declare itself an "AI-first company"</a>.</p>
