            <p>
Dotemu and Guard Crush Games, the studios behind 2020's widely acclaimed beat 'em up sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/streets-of-rage-4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, are teaming up again for something a little bit different: Absolum, a fantasy themed side-scrolling brawler with rogue-like elements that's launching this year.
</p>
<p>
Absolum aims to combine "thrilling arcade beat 'em up action" with "intricate, refined combat" to create what Dotemu is describing as a "rogue 'em up". There's talk of quests, branching pathways, NPCs, unlockable items, permanent warrior upgrades, and combinable character skills - all in a fantasy adventure channeling the spirit of classic brawlers including Golden Axe.
</p>
<p>
Absolum's action plays out across Talamh, a world of wonder and cosmic horrors gripped by warfare following a cataclysmic magical event. That's where the game's four-strong band of rebels comes in, all setting out on an epic quest to oppose the Sun King Azra and liberate Talamh after they're imbued with powerful magic.

<p>
All four rebels are playable (either solo or co-operatively) and feature their own unique skill set and personality, with two having been revealed so far. There's Galandra, for instance - an agile, sword-clad fighter designed to excel in close-quarters combat - while Karl is a tanklike dwarf armed with devastating punches and a rifle that can bring down opponents from afar.
</p>
<p>
"Absolum blends arcade-like melee combat with spells, counters, upgradable abilities and uniquely powerful playable fighters," explains Dotemu, "hosting a grand, high-stakes quest across an array of hand-crafted stages." Those stages - and Absolum's striking visual style - have been brought to life by the artists and animators at animation studio Supamonks.
</p>
<p>
Absolum doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">via Steam</a>) sometime later this year.

Three years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>'s Expanded &amp; Enhanced edition on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the game's next-gen features have - just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-gets-new-pc-version-that-adds-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-features-for-free">Rockstar promised last month</a> - finally made the jump to PC in a free update for all existing users.
</p>
<p>
From today, Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy (as the original PC version is now being referred to) has been delisted from PC store fronts to make way for GTA 5 Enhanced. And as per <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/7551a7k917554a/free-upgrade-for-grand-theft-auto-v-on-pc-now-available">Rockstar's announcement</a>, this new edition introduces a range of features, including new vehicles, new ambient wildlife, and support for Rockstar's GTA+ subscription service.
</p>
<p>
It also adds new graphics options, including the ray traced shadows and reflections first introduced on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, alongside other additions - such as ambient occlusion and global illumination - exclusive to PC. That's in addition to support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates, as well as AMD FSR and Nvidia DLSS support - with Frame Generation support coming at a later date.

<p>
Elsewhere, DualSense controller owners can now use its adaptive triggers during gameplay, and Rockstar is also touting faster loading times via SSD and DirectStorage, as well as enhanced audio - including Dolby Atmos, and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music.
</p>
<p>
And for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">Grand Theft Auto Online</a> players, the updated PC version gets kernel-based anti-cheat protections and proactive voice chat moderation, as well as the lies of new vehicles, Chameleon Paints, and high-performance mods from Hao's Special Works. 
</p>
<p>
All this comes with a higher set of minimum and recommended PC specifications, but anyone unable to meet those increased demands can still access Grand Theft Auto 5 Legacy via the game's launcher. Be aware, though, the two versions are considered entirely separate, meaning friends will all need to be using the same version if they want to play together. Additionally, it's <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/89953o1153a39a/pre-load-the-free-grand-theft-auto-v-pc-upgrade-now">necessary to migrate Story Mode and Online progress to the new edition</a>.
</p>
<p>
To coincide with the launch of GTA 5 Enchanced, Rockstar is discounting the game by 50 percent on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/grand-theft-auto-v">Epic</a> store, bringing the price down to Â£14.99 until 20th March.
</p>
<p>
All this PC activity comes as Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">prepares to release GTA 6 this autumn</a> - although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">publisher Take-Two has hinted the PC version won't arrive until later</a>. That tallies with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recent claims by accessories company Corsair Gaming</a>, which suggested the PC release isn't due until "early 2026".
