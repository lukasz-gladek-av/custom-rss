It's not magic brain science to suggest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> is going to be big, but one investment firm has suggested it's going to be big to the tune of $7.6bn in just two months, while also securing the accolade of "largest gaming release of all time." 
</p>
<p>
That's according to Josh Chapman, managing partner at "thesis driven investment firm" Konvoy Ventures (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/">GameSpot</a>). Chapman shared his predictions <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo/">over on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting GTA 6 will be the "largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Chapman believes Grand Theft Auto 6 will generate $7.6bn USD in revenue in the first 60 days of its launch, and that it'll recoup its development costs in under a month. It's worth noting, however, all this is based on certain unconfirmed assumptions. Chapman's maths assumes the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">base version of GTA 6 will cost $80</a> (neither Rockstar nor publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> have announced a price yet, but there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">certainly</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">precedent</a>), and his predictions are also based on a speculative development budget of $2bn - a figure that's long been rumoured, but never actually confirmed.

<p>
Things then veer away from the financial to the perhaps a little fanciful, with Chapman calling GTA 6 the 'next user-generated platform'. More specifically, he predicts it'll "have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>] and Roblox)", alongside "200-person lobbies [with] higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily."
</p>
<p>
None of that's particularly far-fetched, of course, but neither is it supported by any real evidence, but given Chapman notes, "In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released", there's maybe a bit of room for some enthusiastic wishful thinking.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May next year, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">not exactly unexpected delay in May</a>. And there's little doubt it's going to be big; as Take-Two confirmed earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.
