            <p>Nintendo has revealed the release date of its upcoming Legend of Zelda movie.</p>
<p>According to an image shared on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">newly released Nintendo Today app</a>, the live action film will make its debut on 26th March, 2027.</p>
<p>The image, which you can see via the embed below, confirmed this will be a worldwide release date.</p>

<p>The last we heard regarding a Legend of Zelda movie release date was from Nintendo's Corporate Management Policy Briefing last year. At this time, all we knew was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-film-releases-some-time-within-this-decade-so-thats-something">the film was coming at some point this decade</a>, thanks to its vague 202X wording.</p>
<p>Nintendo's own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie back in November 2023</a>, with a rather casual post on social media. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the movie</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution).</p>
<p>Film producer Avi Arad is also on board. If that name rings a bell, that's because Arad's previous video game to film projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">last year's Borderlands adaptation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-sequel-in-development-sony-pictures-confirms">Tom Holland-fronted Uncharted</a>.</p>

<p>Along with its Zelda adaptation, Nintendo also has a sequel to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">hugely successful Super Mario Bros. film</a> in the works.</p>
<p>The full release date for the animated film sequel will be 24th April 2026, in Japan. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Nintendo also stated it will be released earlier in the US on 3rd April 2026</a>, with "other countries and regions" also during April 2026.</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in Nintendo news, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-order-date-leaks-ahead-of-direct">recent slip by Best Buy Canada suggests we will be able to pre-order a Switch 2 as soon as next week</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mobile gamers will soon be able to enjoy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> on their handheld devices.</p>
<p>The 2.5D metroidvania will be released across Android and iOS on 14th April, Ubisoft has announced, with the studio adding the game will run at a healthy 60fps for those playing on "recent generations of mobile devices".</p>
<p>As this is, of course, a mobile release, players will be able to negotiate The Lost Crown's world with Sargon using touch screen controls, although an external controller can also be attached. There will be the ability to remap controls as desired.</p>

<p>"The mobile version of the game also introduces auto-potion, auto-parry, and slow time options, as well as a host of other quality-of-life features in addition to bringing all of the award-winning accessibility features that saw The Lost Crown win the Innovation in Accessibility Award at The Game Awards 2024," <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6btDjmzXD7EGEBYhkYmzcB/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-coming-to-mobile-devices-on-april-14">Ubisoft shared in an accompanying blog post</a>.</p>

On its release, The Lost crown will be available to try for free, before the full game can be unlocked with a single in-app purchase.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has suddenly become unplayable for some PC players on older systems due to a new hard requirement not supported by aging CPUs.</p>
<p>While the minimum PC specs on the Steam page have not changed, the game now requires AVX2 support to run thanks to recent optimisations.</p>
<p>However, many players have been running the game on systems without AVX2 support and, as a result, are now locked out of the game.</p>

<p>AVX2 (or Advanced Vector Extensions) essentially allows for fast and efficient CPU usage and was first supported by Intel in 2013. It means CPUs released prior to this won't have AVX2 and therefore will no longer be able to run Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>The Helldivers 2 Discord server has been awash with players suddenly unable to play the game on PC - a game that's not free-to-play but was previously paid for and playable for the past year.</p>
<p>"Can't believe I can't play a game I've fully paid for and have the required minimum specs for," wrote one player in Discord.</p>
<p>"600+ hours in a game I love just to be locked out is making me so frustrated to the point I just want to ask for a refund instead of fixing their mistakes," wrote another.</p>
<p>"The AVX2 check in the script is experimental, and can throw false positives, which is why it's wise to manually check your processor model for the AVX2 support from the manufacturer's documentation," explained Discord moderator Birby.</p>
<p>Another reply from the moderator reads: "That processor does not support AVX2, which is now a hard minimum requirement for processors. Unfortunately you will require a system upgrade."</p>
<p>Yet despite moderators attempting to reply to all players, the conversation has become decidedly heated from both sides.</p>
<p>"I don't like to have to tell people their 13 year old processor is out of date," wrote Birby. "I have fielded this question hundreds of times in the past week. I sit here and help people in 48hr stints before going to bed. People will piss and moan and argue, not to mention insult and attack us for being the bearers of bad news. I get you're venting, but as I keep saying - it is up to you as the consumer to confirm your system meets spec before purchase, and you should never be surprised if your out of spec machine can't run the game."</p>
<p>On top of sharing a <a href="https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15916898652700--HELLDIVERS-2-Known-Issues">current known list of issues</a>, moderators have shared multiple fixes for a string of current issues, from checking minimum spec requirements, to rolling back AMD and NVIDIA GPU drivers, to purging downloaded mods from the system.</p>
<p>Developer Arrowhead itself is yet to publicly respond to players. Eurogamer has contacted the studio and publisher Sony for comment.</p>
<p>Over on console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-helldivers-2-has-received-a-stealth-ps5-pro-upgrade-and-heres-what-it-does">Helldivers 2 recently received a PS5 Pro patch</a> to boost performance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, creative director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales">Johan Pilestedt discussed "ridiculous" layoffs across the industry</a> at this year's GDC, due to studios' dogged reliance on battle royales.</p>
<p>"We will always go through the cycles of death and rebirth, but now that cycle is unnecessarily brutal because we don't diversify enough," he said. "We need to make more types of games because people are playing more than ever and still we are unable to stay in business. It's ridiculous."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mighty pirates braving Sea of Thieves' colourful waters are now able to bedeck their ship and selves with some Destiny 2 flavoured cosmetics.</p>

<p>The new gear comes as part of March's Sea of Thieves update which (as previously announced) expands on the big seasonal update by adding hunting spears, ambient wildlife, and performance improvements, among other tweaks and changes.</p>
<p>You can check out <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/release-notes">Sea of Thieves' full release notes here</a>.</p>
<p>The once Xbox console exclusive Sea of Thieves sailed onto PlayStation last year, and went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">top the PS5 sales charts</a> in Europe. Ahead of its move to PlayStation, the Sea of Thieves team revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-sails-across-impressive-player-milestone-ahead-of-ps-debut">40 million of us had embraced our inner pirate</a> and set sail since the game's debut across Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>At this time, executive producer Joe 'Three Sheets' Neate acknowledged the game's "brilliant, positive and welcoming community, who continue to surprise and impress us with your creativity and antics out on the waves".</p>
<p>For more, last year our Matt sat down and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-devs-discuss-surreal-ps5-launch-and-2024s-year-of-the-sandbox">chatted with both Neate and Sea of Thieves' creative director Mike Chapman about the move to PlayStation</a>.
