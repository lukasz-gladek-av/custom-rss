            <p>
PlayStation owners impacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-psn-is-still-down-after-12-hours">this weekend's major PSN outage</a> have criticised Sony's apology offer, as well as the lack of explanation on what went wrong. 
</p>
<p>
The latest period of PSN downtime lasted nearly 24 hours, beginning early Friday evening here in the UK. When the service did return, Sony apologised and blamed a vague "operational issue" as the cause.
</p>
<p>
Compensation for the outage amounts to five additional days for anyone with a PS Plus subscription, but nothing for others who were also locked out of playing digital games.

<p>
Not all online games require PS Plus, of course - including free-to-play behemoths like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Roblox - and access to these was also unavailable.
</p>
<p>
"Everything was down," <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-playstation-plus-members-will-automatically-receive-an-additional-5-days-of-service-for-the-psn-outage.1104324/page-3#post-135525930">one impacted user wrote on ResetEra</a>. "People that game share (like me) were locked out of their entire digital library, including offline games. You didn't need PS Plus to be affected."
</p>
<p>
"I don't have PS Plus but still couldn't play the games I wanted to," opined another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1il7ibh/sony_is_giving_some_compensation/">impacted user on reddit</a>. "Guess I'm a f***ing second class citizen."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Sony to ask if the company plans any other form of compensation, and to ask again about the cause of this weekend's outage. 
</p>
<p>
PlayStation fans have been left in the dark about the root cause of the downtime - and what steps Sony is now taking to ensure it is not repeated again anytime soon.

            <p>Valve has implemented new rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising">new rules from Valve</a> - available online and first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/">Gaming on Linux</a> - confirm that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not.</p>
<p>Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".</p>

<p>"Developers should not utilise paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rules explain.</p>
<p>"If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase 'paid app', or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via Microtransactions or Downloadable Content (DLC)."</p>
<p>Whilst I suspect most of us would associate this kind of behaviour with mobile games more than those available on Steam, Valve clearly thought it necessary to clarify, in clear English, "what is and is not supported on Steam".</p>
<p>Developers are also not allowed to charge other developers for access to Steam features, such as sale pages, bundles, store fronts, or franchise pages.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">Valve quietly implmented a useful new Steam feature</a> warning users - and potential purchasers - how long it's been since an early access game last received an update.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dragon Quest 12 is still in development, series creator Yuji Horii has confirmed.</p>
<p>The latest in the long-running RPG series was first announced back in 2021 but little has been seen since beyond the initial teaser trailer.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, though, Horii held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfikAAlgNsw">livestream</a> with this radio show group KosoKoso Hōsō Kyoku (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-12-is-still-fully-in-development-new-information-to-be-revealed-little-by-little-says-series-creator/">Automaton</a>) where he confirmed the development team is "working hard on Dragon Quest 12".</p>

<p>Further details are expected to be released little by little, though nothing more was revealed at this time.</p>
<p>Back in May last year, <a href="https://x.com/YujiHorii/status/1794984625107832939">Horii also acknowledged Dragon Quest 12</a> on social media, stating the development team wanted to make a game "worthy of the final contributions of the two people who passed away".</p>
<p>Those two people are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tributes-shared-as-dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-passes-away">Dragon Quest character designer Akira Toriyama</a> and composer Koichi Sugiyama, who had worked on every game in the series before their deaths.</p>
<p>Horii's comments came shortly after Dragon Quest series producer <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-yu-miyake-stepping-down-as-producer-on-dragon-quest">Yu Miyake stepped down from his role</a> to oversee <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s mobile game division, putting Dragon Quest 12's development into question.</p>
<p>Now, in his livestream, Horii apologised for confusion around the game's development and denied it had been cancelled.</p>
<p>Little else is known about Dragon Quest 12, though at the series' 35th anniversary livestream Horii stated the classic turn-based battle system will be altered and the tone will be darker and aimed at adults.</p>
<p>In its latest earnings report, Square Enix stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake exceeded sales expectations</a>. Previously it reported sales of 2m copies, with the game becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">2024's biggest game in Japan</a> after just a week on sale.</p>
<p>While similar remakes of Dragon Quest 1 and 2 are expected this year, anticipation is building for the next full release in the series to build on the success of Dragon Quest 3.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Exactly a year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">Walt Disney Company announced it was acquiring a $1.5bn USD stake in Epic Games</a> and launched a multi-year partnership to create an "expansive and open games and entertainment universe connected to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>", the Fortnite x Disney collaboration event has reportedly moved into a "stable" build.</p>
<p>Whilst it remains unclear, what, exactly, the collaboration will be, noted Fortnite leaker HypeX said the status change likely comes because "they probably made a lot of progress and moved into the next roadmap milestone".</p>

<p>At the time the collaboration was announced, explicit mention was made of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and Avatar, with users able to "create their own stories and experiences, express their fandom in a distinctly Disney way, and share content with each other in ways that they love".</p> <div>

<p>Since then, fans have gone on to form their own theories - or wishlists - including the suggestion by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ik9odz/comment/mbkt5e8/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">some</a> that we could see a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-infinity">Disney Infinity</a>-esque mode added to the Fortnite, or some kind of persistent "Disney Metaverse" to explore.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, hopefully we won't have to wait too much longer for the finer details.</p>
<p>HypeX also confirmed over the weekend that Fast &amp; Furious x Fortnite skins are also "coming soon".</p> <div>
