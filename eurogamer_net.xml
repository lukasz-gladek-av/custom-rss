            <p>Far Cry 3: Classic Edition will be getting itself a lovely performance boost later this week.</p>
<p>As shared by Ubisoft, series fans can soon revisit the beautiful Rook Islands once again, but this time with 60fps. Ahh, doesn't the sea look so clear and inviting? Doesn't the sand look so golden? Doesn't that pirate look, errr, a little deadly and terrifying? Yeah, maybe we should run...</p>

<p>Far Cry 3's upcoming frame rate boost will arrive on 21st January, for current gen consoles. You can check out a little teaser for it above.</p>
<p>It doesn't seem that Ubisoft will be stopping with Far Cry 3, though. Last week, the studio appeared to tease that Far Cry 3: Classic Edition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-3-blood-dragon">Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon</a> Classic, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-primal">Far Cry Primal</a> would all be getting those welcome 60fps updates with a cocktail of emojis.</p><p>Then, if these emojis - which included the likes of a palm tree, a dragon and an hourglass - weren't enough to convince fans of the impending updates, when one user replied "Far Cry 3 60 FPS, Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon 60 FPS, Far Cry Primal 60 FPS", Ubisoft itself <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/2012224947603570962?s=20">sent them a gif</a> awarding a gold star.</p>
<p>So, yes, it is a case of when, not if. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>If you haven't played Far Cry 3 for yourself, I would absolutely recommend it. While he is pretty awful and then some, there is no denying that the game's pirate Vaas is one of the best out there. As for the Rook Islands, yes they are hostile but my goddess they are gorgeous (she writes while looking out of her window, with the rain dripping down, the snow melting, and the sky grey).</p><p>"In the past, Far Cry's vision of a first-person shooter RPG where you explore, master and then control your environment has always been more seductive on paper than any of its developers have managed to deliver on disc. Far Cry 3 changes all that. For me, this is the new apex predator of open-world shooters," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/far-cry-3-review">Eurogamer's original Far Cry 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Hunt it down as soon as you can."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Ubisoft news, last week the studio added more flames to the fire that is its Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake. You see, earlier this month, the team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">reuploaded a sizable selection of sea shanties from Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> over on its YouTube music channel, which many assumed was because a remake of the studio's piratical adventure is on the cards.</p>
<p>It then claimed this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">music which was reuploaded due to "technical issues"</a>, however no one really believes that.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> is currently enjoying a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/#1m">boost in its player numbers</a> following the long-awaited debut of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadpool-is-joining-marvel-rivals-later-this-week-and-he-can-pretty-much-do-anything-he-wants">Deadpool</a>, but some players continue to ruin the fun for everyone. Thankfully, the developers of the game are on the case and planning to ult them into oblivion soon enough.</p>
<p>On 19th January, the <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552?s=20">official Marvel Rivals account</a> on X/Twitter acknowledged the annoying situation players are often running into, with some matches being disrupted by farmers who just stand still and farm the required stats to progress through the <a href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Proficiency">hero proficiency</a> track fast.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hey Rivals,</p><p>Recently, we’ve noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points. This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players.</p><p>To address…</p></div>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>The answer will be to introduce a "combat behaviour detection system" which will punish the players engaging in such activities with warnings, short-term suspensions, and even longer time-offs. The worst offenders will face "permanent account bans" which may not amount to much since the game is free-to-play, but will surely enrage anyone fully committed to maxing out heroes.</p>
<p>Though this wave of farming has been partially enabled by Marvel Rivals' slightly convoluted hero proficiency system and its approach to challenges tied to cosmetic rewards, the online shooter isn't the only one that's been affected by exploiters who'd rather mindlessly farm for hours than play the game normally. Sadly, it's the kind of negative stuff that comes with the territory, but NetEase developers have, so far, done well at acting fast on negative feedback pertaining to the game's health and game environment, so we're hoping to see this system live in the game soon.</p><p>For now, players on the game's community subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">are celebrating the news</a>, with the most upvoted comment saying the banhammer "might actually help some of these lord farmers touch grass." If you're wondering what "lord farmers" are, some users are describing them as the people that engage in farming on dead regional servers in the night hours; when they queue at the same time, they face each other and just AFK as DPS, tanks, and healers do their thing taking turns. Proficiency is tied to excelling in those roles, so you can see where the boosts are coming from.</p>
<p>"Great, now do something about throwers," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/comment/o0g90ch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">another user says</a> in the same thread. This is more of a widespread competitive online game issue, but anyone who's spent enough time playing ranked Marvel Rivals matches knows it's easy to run into folks who jump ship as soon as they see things going south. That's an entirely different problem NetEase hasn't properly addressed yet, so don't get your hopes up.</p>

            <p>After almost three months of scavenging and fighting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players have become quite good at dealing with the extraction shooter's PvE foes. Diehards might be worried about that side of the game becoming stale soon, but don't worry: Embark could be about to unleash hell on us.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/will-this-blow-up-the-server-arc-raiders-players-are-so-good-at-killing-arc-that-embark-is-considering-how-to-escalate-pve-dev-teases-a-shredder-escape-and-the-giant-walking-ones-in-the-background/">GamesRadar</a>, Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins stated the team is "pretty happy" with the end-game loop of taking down the imposing Queens and Matriarchs.</p>
<p>The problem is that killing the same behemoths over and over again to get materials to craft better guns that excel at killing the same enemies can get pretty old, pretty quick. Of course, most players have yet to experience what Arc Raiders' later progression stages and threat levels have to offer, but online shooters typically thrive or die based on how well-fed the hardcore crowd that lives in the end-game is.</p>
<p>Instead of coming up with new "giant spidery" robots, Watkins suggests Embark Studios could look at ways to put them to good use in different scenarios and/or events: "I think it's looking toward where we take those types of experiences in the future to something else or something additional, seeing how we can escalate the experience for the player on the PvE side."</p><p>A potential buff to the Arcs or shaken-up world state wouldn't be limited to the boss robots, as drones are also becoming "much less of a threat to them" (that is, in regards to players deeper into the game). Nonetheless, some the smaller Arcs are simply meant to be annoyances we have to deal with as we rush through our favourite loot spots and (if we're feeling naughty) go after unsuspecting raiders.</p>
<p>About the titanic Arc bosses that can often be seen in the background, Embark isn't making promises due to the tech involved, but everything seems to be on the table: "We want to go wherever's practical for us, or wherever feels fun, but then you start running into the practical side of, will this blow up the server? … Our ambitions are definitely large, and I'm not going to say that you're going to meet one anytime soon, but obviously you see the giant walking ones in the background and stuff."</p>
<p>For now, I'd say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-now-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-so-youre-all-getting-a-golden-pickaxe-as-a-reward">more than 12m copies sold</a> and the glowing player sentiment are giving the studio plenty of space and time for experimentation.</p>

<p>"I can confirm that we got a call at 5.02am this morning. We mobilised three pumps and four of our specialist appliances. It's an ongoing incident and we're still in attendance at the moment with other agencies."</p><p>

The Scottish Herald were told, again by a spokesperson from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, that firefighters worked to secure "structural damage" to the building. These crews left after three hours after the area was deemed safe.

</p><p>This piece will be updated as more information on the explosion have been confirmed.</p>

            <p>We've been greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout Season 2</a> so far, and it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-new-vegas-player-numbers-skyrocket-thanks-to-the-unavoidable-impact-of-fallout-season-2">most fans are</a> too, but the change from binge-based season drop to a weekly release schedule has had an impact on the show's ratings. Don't worry, though: this stumble isn't in danger of disappointing the powers that be.</p>
<p>On 15th January, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/streaming-ratings-dec-15-21-2025-1236475572/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> shared the latest report from Nielsen, a leader in media valuation and data analytics. As expected, the debut of Fallout's second season was a sizable one, with the show accumulating 794 million viewing minutes through the week of December 15th through 21st. At the same time, it was well below Season 1's appeal, which earned 2.9 billion for its opening week in April 2024. That one was Amazon's best-ever premiere on the platform.</p>
<p>Those keeping track of what goes down on the TV front might've already noticed what's going on here. Since Nielsen traditionally tracks viewership in minutes watched across devices that send the needed data, the company's numbers never give us the complete picture. It only tracks TV sets, but it's always been a good way to measure the temperature and streaming habits of the populace. The more important bit of info here is that 794 million minutes for a single episode versus 2.9 billion for an entire season that could be binged on Day One is very impressive all the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, we must take into account many viewers who have grown accustomed to Netflix's binge release strategy are just waiting for the entire thing to be available. All in all, Fallout is doing remarkably well still, and nabbed the 7th spot on <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/top-ten/">Nielsen's ranking</a> for the December 15th through 21st period. During that week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stranger-things-final-battle-was-directly-influenced-by-baldurs-gate-3">Stranger Things</a> reigned supreme in the lead-up to its series finale with a massive 2.37 billion minutes watched.</p><p>As it stands, Fallout Season 3 is a go and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">already targeting a production start date for 1st May, 2026</a>. The Prime Video series is among the very few big-IP shows that are sticking to tight pre-production and filming schedules, with S2 arriving only a year and a half after S1. For comparison, we're still waiting for <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/star-wars-ahsoka">Star Wars: Ahsoka</a>'s second season on Disney Plus; the first set of episodes came out during summer 2023.</p>
<p>Are you watching each episode of Fallout Season 2 weekly, or are you waiting to make your trip to New Vegas until it's all loaded up?</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Early indicators that advertisements are coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming service have been spotted by users, with messages stating that "ad-supported playtime" popping up for users when launching games.</p>
<p>One such user, The Verge's Tom Warren, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/2012346097465782273">posted their own experience seeing this message firsthand</a>. Ad-supported Xbox Cloud Gaming has not been confirmed by Microsoft as of writing, nor its scope across the service. However, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">last year an Xbox official confirmed </a>that the company would be experimenting with free ad-supported cloud gaming.</p>
<p>This hint at advertisement rollout across Xbox Cloud Gaming comes at an interesting time too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">with an Xbox Showcase set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. While it's been stated that the show will focus primarily on a handful of games including Fable and Forza, rumours have been circulating that such a shift with the company's cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">could be rolled out this year</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>It's also coming at an interesting time for cloud gaming in general. With the AI boom ongoing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">hardware prices have skyrocketed for consumers</a>. This will, or perhaps already has, curbed the ability of gaming enthusiasts to buy their own machines, potentially leading a new wave to Cloud Gaming services such as what Xbox is offering. While not especially great news for the consumer, there's no doubt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">Microsoft has positioned itself into a leading position as far as cloud gaming is concerned</a>.</p><p>Microsoft too has faced heavy criticism when it comes to its gaming output, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">laying off significant portions of its workforce last year</a> and cancelling several projects as a result. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-suffers-worst-year-on-record-for-console-sales-in-the-uk">2025 was also the worst year on record for Xbox console sales in the UK</a>, though competitors like the PS5 also saw a drop during the same period.</p>
