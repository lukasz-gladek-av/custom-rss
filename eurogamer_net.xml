            <p>Developer 1047 Games will add an Arena Royale mode to Splitgate Arena Reloaded later this week.</p>
<p>Arena Royale allows 24 players to team into six groups of four, and is "built to play at a similar pace and length to a traditional arena match". With this mode, as long as at least one member in a team remains alive, the rest of the squad is able to respawn. Well, at least until the final circle. When that arrives, the respawns end, "and it's all about survival". Ooh.</p>

<p>Arena Royale will allow for a better flow of action when it goes live on 22nd January, 1047 says, while also reducing downtime "significantly".</p>
<p>"Matches take place within a single biome," it explains, "keeping the experience tight and focused. This allows Arena Royale to emphasise constant action, fast fights, and moment-to-moment decision making rather than long stretches of setup or traversal. The result is a faster, cleaner take on battle royale that still feels unmistakably Splitgate."</p><p>Alongside the new mode, Splitgate Arena Reloaded's forthcoming update also adds two new maps, known as Trihard and Runway. Trihard takes players to the clouds, while Runway is set in a neon cityscape "inspired by the energy and density of Shinjuku". There's also a new endgame mastery camo on the cards, as well as a limited-time event - Teabag Takeover. Yes, that's actually what it's called, and yes, it's what you think it is.</p>
<p>"This new Limited Event is a celebration of a long-forgotten sign of respect. Some might even call it an elegant greeting, for a more civilised age," 1047 says. So, basically, players jump into matches and "teabag their opponents to earn points toward unlocking new teabag themed rewards".</p>
<p>Teabag Takeover arrives 23rd January. In the meantime, you can find more details about Splitgate Arena Reloaded's update in the video below.</p>

<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded started life as Splitgate 2, but after the sequel failed to hit the mark, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">1047 took it back into beta last July</a>, resulting in a number of layoffs at the studio. In November, it announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-take-two-coming-next-month-as-1047-games-announces-relaunch-for-its-free-to-play-shooter">Splitgate 2 would relaunch in December</a>, and it arrived with its new name, Splitgate Arena Reloaded.</p>
<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-controversial-marketing-campaign-splitgate-2-fails-to-find-an-audience-despite-two-official-launches">player numbers on Steam haven't been <em>great</em></a>, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-charts-dont-measure-fun-splitgate-arena-reloaded-developer-responds-to-concerning-pc-launch-numbers">developer has said these charts "don't measure fun"</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>As we prepare for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, set to finally launch in May, and celebrate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-all-time-classic">Hitman 3's five-year anniversary</a>, we've received news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> is, at long last, getting cross-progression support.</p>
<p>We figured this would happen at some point, especially after last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port and with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hitman/new-game-after-world-of-assassination-co-op">more content set to arrive this year</a>, but with all eyes on James Bond's game right now, it was hard to predict its arrival. Today, 20th January, <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account">IOI confirmed</a> the feature will be available starting 3rd February. Additionally, a "brand-new, fresh look launches today" for the IOI Account service on browsers and mobile phones.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">full cross-progression guide</a> with FAQ was shared, but the gist of the news is that players will be able to take their Hitman: WoA (the combination of Hitman 1, 2, and 3 under a single roof) progress with them no matter what device they play on. For example, you could launch your PC save on the PS5 in your living room and later continue your killing sprees on the go with the Switch 2 version... as long as you have access to an online connection.</p>
<p>IOI also revealed that a Steam patch (3.250.1) will be arriving next week, which will ensure everything is working for the new cross-progression functionality. Players will have to select, after logging on their IOI Account, a "primary platform" the other devices will follow. Game licences, DLC purchases, and unlocks tied to DLCs aren't shared, meaning you'll have to own all required content on each platform where you want to use cross-progression. That's how the feature has always worked, but it's good to remind the more casual crowd of its limitations.</p><p>On the matter of the saves themselves, IOI also notes "old save games created on a non-primary linked account will not be loadable while Cross-Progression is active." In summary, the system will only recognize saves tied to the IOI Account system, so we recommend making sure everything's properly updated and connected if you intend to embrace this feature.</p>
<p>As a footnote, IOI has also reminded players the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> to 3 "carryover" process will close come 3rd February so all progress is locked to the latest iteration of the three-part sandbox game. The company's approach to progression and upgrades has always been slightly too convoluted and often led to confusion, so it makes sense the devs are being extra careful ahead of this major feature drop.</p>
<p>If you're waiting for news on Hitman's future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-there-will-be-more-hitman-after-007-first-light-io-interactive-assures">IOI hasn't shied away from teasing there are plans in place</a>, but don't expect a reveal until World of Assassination's co-op mode and 007 First Light are out.</p>
