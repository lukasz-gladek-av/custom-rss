            <p>
Discord has announced a new "teen-by-default" approach to its platform, meaning age-verification will be a mandatory requirement for all users around the globe in order to access certain settings, channels, and "sensitive content."
</p>
<p>
Beginning in early March, Discord will implement a "phased global rollout" of a new update designed to give all new and existing users worldwide a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Once live, users will be required to undergo age verification - either via facial age estimation or by submitting a form of identification - in order to access certain features. This builds on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">changes previously rolled out</a> to users in Australia and the UK.
</p>
<p>
Without age verification, users will be unable to bypass sensitive content filters, and will not be able to access age-gated channels, servers, or app commands. Nor can they speak on Discord server stages or access messages sent to their inbox from people they do not know. Additionally, all users will see warning prompts when receiving friend requests from users they may not know.
</p>
<p>
As for the age verification process, Discord is adopting what it calls "privacy-forward age assurance". It says video selfies submitted for facial age estimation will never leave a user's device, and insists all identification documents submitted to its vendor partners for processing will be "deleted quickly" — "in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." It does note, however, that while only one verification method will be required for most users, it may sometimes request multiple methods when "more information is needed to assign an age group." Once age verification is complete, user will be alerted via a direct message from Discord's official account.
</p><p>
"Rolling out teen-by-default settings globally builds on Discord’s existing safety architecture, giving teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility," the company wrote in a statement accompanying the news. "We design our products with teen safety principles at the core and will continue working with safety experts, policymakers, and Discord users to support meaningful, long term wellbeing for teens on the platform."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is off to a tremendous start this year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-update-adds-bastion-tank-siege-breakers-warbond">new batch of heavy weaponry</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-armours-up-for-its-very-own-star-war-as-automatons-have-stolen-plans-for-a-planet-killing-space-station">Automatons stealing a not-Death-Star</a> setting the stage for Super Earth's attack on the Cyborgs of Cyberstan. What can players expect from this next major step in the Galactic War and the game's future?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-helldivers-2-launches-the-battle-for-cyberstan-arrowhead-says-its-already-plotting-to-expand-the-scope-of-the-game">IGN</a> sat down with Arrowhead's Mikael Eriksson, game director on Helldivers 2, to discuss the team's ambitions for these live events and how they're reshaping a previously planned narrative based on the community's performance.</p>
<p>On 10th February (that's tomorrow), the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrfT-ox5lIk">battle for Cyberstan</a> begins, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> will be tasked with taking over the hostile <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leM2NjGmCbY">Cyborg-controlled</a> planet. "Players can win and players can lose, and it's going to be super fun to see that play out," Eriksson said, pointing out past events like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">Super Earth's defence</a> could've gone the wrong way. "Following that was pure fun for everyone at the office except for maybe the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-a-dungeons-and-dragons-style-gm-behind-the-scenes">Game Master</a>, who was sweating a little bit."</p>
<p>How much can the players' performance really affect the admittedly complex plans for the live online game's content and narrative? Eriksson used tabletop role-playing games as a clear example of what Arrowhead is going for, in that there's an overarching story that has been set, but players can choose how they interact with it, leading to smaller changes and deviations. Still, catastrophic failures can lead to, well, catastrophic results: "We know that players will now go to Cyberstan, but we don't know how it will play out. We don't know if they will win. We don't know if they will lose. And there will be impacts on the Galactic War level. So the story that is being written in the Galactic War will change depending on what they do. And it can be quite consequential. Planets can get destroyed to never be able to be played on again. That sort of thing can happen."</p>

<p>In a way, Helldivers 2 is a "forever game" despite it not having an overabundance of FOMO elements. This inevitably leads to more casual players being confused in regards to the state of the in-game narrative and the galaxy. "We are actively working on getting to a point where regardless of if you're new or if you're experienced, you should just be able to get into the game and understand very easily exactly what's happening and why we're fighting the fight that we're doing right now," Eriksson explained. It's hard not to think of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s struggles when it comes to onboarding new players, with the main difference being Destiny 2's stories and universe are far denser.</p><p>Eriksson acknowledged the strength of having a simple fantasy that players can "get into" quickly. That's allowed development on new content and narrative arcs to stay agile, and Arrowhead doesn't "want to stray away from that." The game will evolve and grow, but it appears the team is well aware of the dangers of making the game too big or dense for players looking at it like an uncomplicated form of escapism.</p>
<p>"Working on Helldivers as a live-service game is just bliss, because it’s such an interesting universe, endless possibilities, and we have many, many ideas that have yet to come to fruition," the game director added, promising there's much more to come... as long as the players stick around. So far, I'd say this is one of the few live-service success stories that studios and publishers could learn from.</p>
