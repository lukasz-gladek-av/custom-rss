        <p>Players have until the end of the month to make their requests.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony is discontinuing the PlayStation Camera adaptor for PSVR1 on PS5.</p>
<p>According to a brief update on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/playstation-camera-adaptor/?">PlayStation website</a>, the device will be withdrawn on 26th November 2024, or "until supplies last".</p>

<p>The adaptor was introduced with the PS5. As a camera is required for PSVR the PS5's HD camera is not compatible, it's the only way to play PSVR1 on PS5.</p>
<p>If you have the tech and haven't yet reached out to secure an adaptor, now's the time to do it - especially as the offer's only good for as long as "supplies last".</p>
<p><a href="http://playstation.com/camera-adaptor">Head to the official website to put in a request</a>. You'll need to provide your PSVR processor unit serial number and - depending upon where you are in the world - your name, email, phone number, and shipping address. The processor unit's serial number should begin with the letter C, M, or P.</p>
<p>Find out why our resident VR expert, Ian Higton, says that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-psvr2-working-on-pc-isnt-as-easy-as-it-should-be">getting the PS VR2 working on PC isn't nearly as easy as it should be</a>.</p>
<p>Ian also took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metro-awakening-vr-review">Metro Awakening VR for Eurogamer</a>, awarding it three out of five stars, saying: "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metro-awakening">Metro Awakening</a> VR delivers some terrifying moments in its deep, thought-provoking story, but after a strong start, repetitive levels and pacing issues kill most of its momentum".

            <p>There's a whole generation of video game fans who don't know very much about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, and that's one of the reasons we are getting a remake in the form of Delta: Snake Eater.</p>
<p>This revelation comes from series producer Noriaki Okamura, who told Play magazine the team realised "a lot of the newer, younger generation of gamers aren't familiar with the Metal Gear series anymore" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-exists-because-konami-was-starting-to-get-worried-that-the-younger-generation-of-gamers-arent-familiar-with-the-metal-gear-series-anymore/">GamesRadar</a>).</p>
<p>As such, Konami's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> remake is being created with future generations in mind.</p>

<p>"It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura explained. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p>
<p>As for why we are getting a remake of the third Metal Gear game, Okamura noted it takes place first chronologically. "That's where the original story started," he said, so it just made sense.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">back in May last year</a>, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater retains the 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, despite a PlayStation blog previously suggesting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">remake would make its debut some time this year</a>. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-despite-its-2024-window">Konami's half-yearly financial results simply listed the upcoming game's release as "TBD"</a>.</p>
<p>"Whisper it quietly, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater looks like the most exciting Konami project in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote after some time with the game earlier this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The GTA community is eager to hear more about the next instalment in the series, and once again have theorised Rockstar left a clue about the upcoming game in its GTA Online promotional material.</p>
<p>The material in question shows a character leaning on a car, while looking up at the Darnell Bros Garment Factory. But, it isn't the character or the factory that has caught the attention of eager fans. It is the moon that shines down on the scene from the upper corner.</p>

<p>The moon in this image is a waning gibbous, and the moon here in the real world will be at the same phase on 22nd November. That's a week on Friday, and fans believe this is a sign from the developer, telling them the date of the next GTA 6 trailer.</p><p>While this all may seem a bit of a longshot, this isn't the first time GTA players have turned to the moon for GTA 6 clues.

            <p>
Smash hit smartphone app Pokémon TCG Pocket will add its first big expansion of fresh cards in late January, according to a new leak. 
</p>
<p>
A datamine of the game's event schedule posted by <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855422922384351518">Centro Leaks</a> suggests the game's currently-untitled first expansion will arrive on 29th January - with the caveats that final dates are still subject to change. 
</p>
<p>
That current plan would mean a roughly three-month window between the launch of Pokémon TCG Pocket and the arrival of a flurry of new cards - which feels about right?

<p>
That said, there's also suggestion of a special booster pack due for launch in December - which points to a smattering of extra cards arriving slightly sooner to tide fans over. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming additions to Pokémon TCG Pocket spotted in the datamine include a new card rarity, and rare picks being added to the Wonder Pick mechanic.

Pokémon TCG Pocket looks to be off to a great start, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-passes-30m-downloads-in-a-week">$12m earned over the game's first four days</a> and more than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">30m downloads after a week</a>.

Pokémon TCG Pocket is heavily built around the opening of trading card game packs, though you can also play a simplified version of the classic trading card game via the app as well.

Nintendo will hold a special Direct broadcast later today - but, once again, it's not to announce <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, the Super Nintendo World Direct will focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-expansion-for-super-nintendo-world-opens-in-spring-2024">upcoming addition of Donkey Kong Country</a> to Universal Studios Japan. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the broadcast, which is scheduled for 10pm UK time tonight (that's 2pm Pacific or 5pm Eastern), Nintendo said the stream would last for roughly 10 minutes and that no information on upcoming games will be featured.

"Please note, there will be no game announcements or mentions of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation," Nintendo noted.

<p>
Super Nintendo World finally opened its doors at Universal Studios Japan in late 2020. A slightly smaller version, at Universal Studios Hollywood, opened in early 2023. 
</p>
<p>
Two other incarnations of Super Nintendo World are under construction and due to open in 2025. These will be located at Universal Studios Singapore and at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/universal-floridas-super-nintendo-world-park-gets-may-2025-opening-date">Universal Epic Universe in Florida, the latter of which will include Donkey Kong Country from the off</a>.

<p>To mark the achievement, Infold dropped a new gameplay overview trailer subtitled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54yRMWCF3hs">Unfold Your Whim</a>, "offering a glimpse into the journey ahead".</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki tasks players with collecting Whimstars and special outfits that give Nikki unique abilities.</p>
<p>"Each new ability allows Nikki to explore deeper, discover hidden paths, and interact with the vibrant open world around her," Infold teases. "Alongside her, Momo, her loyal companion, offers a camera feature for players to capture memorable moments throughout their adventure."</p>
<p>For some, this milestone may not be surprising. In August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-dress-up-adventure-from-legend-of-zelda-dev-has-over-12-million-pre-registrations">over 12 million of us had already signed up</a> for the "cosy open-world adventure" follow-up to the highly successful mobile series of dress-up games.</p>
<p>We still don't have a release date for Infinity Nikki yet, however when the time does come, it will be available across PlayStation and PC, alongside Android and iOS devices. In the meantime, you can still <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/2">sign up for the Infinity Nikki playtest here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
