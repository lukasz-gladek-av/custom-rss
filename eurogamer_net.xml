        <p>In-person work provides "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity", CEO says.</p>

            <p>
EA has detailed a new in-office working policy that will see all local employees return at least three days a week, and largely phase out remote roles.
</p>
<p>
The changes mean any employee living within a 30-mile radius will be required to commute at least three days a week under a new hyrbid policy. 
</p>
<p>
Employees working outside of that 30-mile radius will continue to work remotely unless their role is designated oherwise - though there's uncertainty over EA saying it will additionally  "sunset the Offsite Local work model" over the next "three to 24 months", depending on location.
</p>
<p>
Staff members this affects told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN</a> they believe this means existing remote workers will have their "exemptions" removed over the next two years, with uncertainty over any remote working after that time. 
</p>
<p>
Certainly, it sounds like fully remote work will be an exception going forward. Any exception to the above policies or future hiring for a remote position will need direct approval from EA CEO Andrew Wilson or company president Laura Miele, the latter said in an email, describing the changes as a shift from "a decentralised approach to a globally consistent, enterprise-wide work model".
</p>
<p>
Explaining the changes, Wilson said in-person work was EA's preference as it provided "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted EA for detail on how this policy will impact the company's UK studios. 
</p>
<p>Numerous employers are attempting to bring staff back to offices following years of remote working - to a mixed response. In March 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developers-blast-rockstars-reckless-decision-to-return-to-office-full-time">developers working on GTA 6 criticised Rockstar for telling employees they must return to the office full-time</a> with just a month's notice, calling the decision "reckless". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Call%20of%20Duty:%20Black%20Ops%206%20developers%20protest%20over%20office%20working%20policy">Protests were held by Call of Duty developers</a> in autumn last year over Activision's return-to-office plans, around the same time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Ubisoft%20staff%20told%20to%20strike%20over%20remote%20working%20changes">Ubisoft workers also went on strike in Paris</a>.

            <p>
Epic Games has withdrawn its initial submission for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to return to the iPhone App Store in the US, after Apple failed to approve the game for launch this week. 
</p>
<p>
The Fortnite maker <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585">announced</a> last Friday, 9th May, that it had submitted Fortnite to Apple for review - a process that usually lasts just a day or two. Apple, however, doesn't appear to be in any hurry to see Fortnite return.
</p>
<p>
Now, due to the game's ever-updating nature, Epic has been forced to withdraw that submission and reapply using Fortnite's next game version - which had been due to go live on all platforms this morning, but has now been <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1922806111284924584">postponed</a> until tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
These developments follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">bombshell ruling of a US judge earlier this month</a> that blasted Apple for continuing to impede developers from offering their own in-app payment methods - the issue which kickstarted Fortnite's long-running feud with Apple and got the game booted from the App Store worldwide. Apple must now allow developers in the US to do this, the judge ruled - though the matter of approving individual apps is still at Apple's own discretion.
</p>
<p>
"No news from Apple yet," Epic Games boss <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922654805735952768">Tim Sweeney wrote on social media last night</a>. They've had it since last Friday. 
</p>
<p>
"We emailed yesterday but haven't heard back," he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922655523175862658">continued</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously," <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922724874264412295">Sweeney noted in another post</a>. "So we have pulled the previous Fortnite version submitted to Apple App Review last Friday, and we have submitted a new version for review."
</p>
<p>
After years of legal wrangling, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">Fortnite is back on iPhone in the European Union</a> - but currently nowhere else. Apple, meanwhile, has already filed to appeal the recent ruling over its US App Store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Leak specifically pertained to "older text messages"</p>

            <p>
Valve has responded to reports of an alleged "massive" Steam data leak, insisting none of its systems have been breached and no account, password, payment, or personal data has been stolen. It has, however, confirmed hackers accessed a number of "older text messages" containing limited information.
</p>
<p>
Unsubstantiated reports of a Steam data breach first surfaced over the weekend, when a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/underdark-ai_cybersecurity-databreach-steam-activity-7327022917370703872-JqN3/">widely shared LinkedIn post</a> claimed a "threat actor" had appeared on a "well-known dark web forum claiming to have breached Steam" and was "offering a dataset of over 89m user records" for $5K USD. A later update claimed the breach was related to "real-time [two-factor authentication] SMS logs", and that analysis of the leaked data suggested the hacker had gained "backend access to a vendor dashboard or API, not Steam directly."
</p>
<p>
Valve has now responded to those claims, saying it has "examined the leak sample and... determined this was <em>not</em> a breach of Steam systems." The leak specifically relates to "older text messages", it added, and Steam users "do not need to change [their] passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event."
</p>
<p>
"You may have seen reports of leaks of older text messages that had previously been sent to Steam customers," the company wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/533224478739530145?l=english">full message shared on Steam</a>. "We have examined the leak sample and have determined this was <em>not</em> a breach of Steam systems. We're still digging into the source of the leak, which is compounded by the fact that any SMS messages are unencrypted in transit, and routed through multiple providers on the way to your phone."
</p>
<p>
"The leak consisted of older text messages that included one-time codes that were only valid for 15-minute time frames and the phone numbers they were sent to," it continued. "The leaked data did not associate the phone numbers with a Steam account, password information, payment information or other personal data. Old text messages cannot be used to breach the security of your Steam account, and whenever a code is used to change your Steam email or password using SMS, you will receive a confirmation via email and/or Steam secure messages"
</p>
<p>
"You do not need to change your passwords or phone numbers as a result of this event," Valve added. "It is a good reminder to treat any account security messages that you have not explicitly requested as suspicious. We also recommend setting up the Steam Mobile Authenticator if you haven't already, as it gives us the best way to send secure messages about your account and your account's safety."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has released fresh screenshots of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, giving us our first look at the game in three years.</p>
<p>The last time the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">shown was back in 2022 for the series' 20th anniversary</a>, revealing Sora's return and the expansive metropolis of Quadratum.</p>

<p>"We're currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts 4 and will continue pouring ourselves into the game's development. We're dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations!" reads an official social media post.</p>
<p>"We've seen how excited you are, and we are truly grateful from the bottom of our hearts. We are equally excited and can't wait to share more about Kingdom Hearts 4 when the time is right. Until then, we appreciate your patience."</p>
<p>The screenshots show Sora mid-battle in Quadratum against a handful of Heartless, as well as close-ups of some character models and moments in the city.</p>
<p>One screenshot suggests Mickey Mouse will be playable in this game. Disney's lead character has always been a part of the series and has previously been playable in a limited capacity, but his inclusion here hints at a bigger playable role this time around.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>To our Kingdom Hearts community,</p><p>Weâre currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the gameâs development.

<p>Perhaps what's most interesting is what isn't shown in these screenshots. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> games fuse together the worlds of Disney and Final Fantasy, but we're yet to see which Disney kingdoms will be featured in the new game, nor which Final Fantasy characters will make an appearance. I can certainly imagine Clive turning up at some point.</p>
<p>Also, where are longtime partners Donald and Goofy?</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts 4 remains without a release date, but it's been in development for quite some time. It's been six years since the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a> on PS4 and Xbox One and fans are eagerly anticipating the next installment.</p>
<p>Last year, series director Tetsuya Nomura said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-will-lead-towards-a-series-conclusion-so-nomura-can-retire">Kingdom Hearts 4 will lead towards a series conclusion</a> as he looks to retire.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
