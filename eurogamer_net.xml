            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> has been banned in the US.</p>
<p>Whilst 170m American TikTokers were anticipating the app's suspension after the US Supreme Court upheld a decision to ban the Chinese app over security concerns, Marvel Snap players in the US have also been impacted given publisher Nuverse is also owned by TikTok owner, ByteDance.</p>
<p>According to developer Second Dinner, the ban was every bit as much a "surprise" to the team as it was to players, too.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Marvel Snap isn't available right now," the app now tells all US players.</p>
<p>"A law banning Marvel Snap has been enacted in the US. Unfortunately, that means you can't use Marvel Snap for now.</p>
<p>"Rest assured, we're working to restore our service in the US," the brief statement concluded. "Please stay tuned!"</p>

<p>Developer Second Dinner also addressed players on social media, insisting the "outage" was "a surprise to us and wasn't planned".</p>
<p>"Marvel Snap isn’t going anywhere," the team insisted. "We’re actively working on getting the game up as soon as possible and will update you once we have more to share."</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it is not clear how long the game will be offline.</p>
<p>At the end of 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-publishers-parent-company-confirms-restructuring-stepping-away-from-video-games">ByteDance restructured its video games business</a> - including Nuverse -  calling the changes a "difficult" decision to make.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
