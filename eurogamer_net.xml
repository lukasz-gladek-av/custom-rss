            <p>Nintendo and Universal Pictures have registered the copyright for a Donkey Kong film, suggesting the forthcoming Mario sequel and Legend of Zelda film could be followed by Nintendo's gorilla.</p>
<p>Few details are currently known, beyond the existence of the <a href="https://publicrecords.copyright.gov/detailed-record/rmm_voyager_V01503556900000">copyright itself</a>, but the news is in line with a response from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">investor call</a>.</p>
<p>Furukawa was asked about the future of the "visual content business" - films, essentially. The president replied the company has been "working on initiatives beyond our dedicated video game platforms for several years" and that it's "deeply involved in production".</p>

<p>He added: "Although we cannot discuss our plans beyond The Legend of Zelda movie at this time, we are working on various other projects."</p>
<p>It seems a Donkey Kong film will be the next project.</p>
<p>A Donkey Kong film would certainly make sense. To begin with, the gorilla is a prominent character in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, voiced by Seth Rogan, and will likely feature in the sequel - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-super-mario-movie-title-quietly-announced-then-quickly-removed-by-nbcuniversal">expected to be called Super Mario World</a>.</p>
<p>Then there are the theme parks, which have expanded from just the Mario universe to include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> releasing as a launch period game this week for Nintendo's new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>All of which is to say Nintendo is putting great emphasis on Donkey Kong at present, meaning it's understandable why a Donkey Kong film would be prioritised as the next project after Mario and Zelda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Mario sequel film is set to release in April 2026</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">Zelda film was recently delayed to March 2027</a>. There's no indication as to when the Donkey Kong film will be released but, perhaps Spring 2028 if they're a year apart?</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed ahead of its release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza is being made by the Mario Odyssey development team</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza recently</a>, stating "it's clear to me that the Nintendo developers in Japan have paid an enormous amount of attention to the entirety of Donkey Kong's history - and the result is a Nintendo Japan game that has a rare energy".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-film-copyright-registered-by-nintendo-as-gorillas-prominence-continues]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ken Levine has revealed his upcoming game, Judas, will be an "old-school" and "traditional" single-player adventure.</p>
<p>It's been 11 years since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, and on the surface, Judas seems to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> game in all but name, with gunplay and elemental powers in an offbeat alternate universe setting. And while that is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levines-new-game-looks-like-bioshock-in-space">essentially what trailers</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">shown us of the game so far</a>, Levine has now confirmed that his upcoming game will indeed feel "old-school" given its focus not on live service or online play, but "telling the story and transporting the player".</p>

<p>"I grew up playing single-player games," Levine said. "And I grew up before [...] certain types of monetisation existed. I'm not here at all to say this is bad, or this is good, right? That's not really my thing. I know the kinds of games I like to make, and so we never made a game... like, Juas is a very old-school game," Levine told Nightdive's Lawrence Sonntag in a recent interview (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/bioshock-creator-says-audiences-reward-single-player-games-that-dont-have-other-methods-of-monetization-like-baldurs-gate-3-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-and-clair-obscur-expedition-33/">GR+</a>).</p>
<p>"You buy the game and you get the whole thing. There's no online component. There's no live service, because everything we do is in service of telling the story and transporting the player somewhere.</p>
<p>"We're very fortunate. This is no diss on any developers who have done that, because look, games are expensive to make, and we're very fortunate to work at a company where they believe in us enough that they say, 'Okay, you've been working on this thing for a long time, it's gonna cost a reasonable amount of money, and we're not gonna push any of that stuff on you.'"</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> developer Unknown Worlds' parent company, Krafton, has issued another statement, this time confirming that an internal milestone document leaked online is authentic.</p>
<p>As Matt explained for us last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> became the unexpected focus of industry drama last week when Krafton <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">announced it was 'replacing' three key members of Unknown Worlds' leadership team</a> - including studio founder and original Subnautica director Charlie Cleveland - with Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. At the time, Krafton insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development", despite their departure.</p>

<p>Fan pushback was swift, and the situation only grew murkier after Bloomberg reported Cleveland, as well as Unknown Worlds' chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire, had all been "pushed out" amid Krafton's sudden decision to shift Subnautica 2's early access launch from its announced "2025" window into 2026.</p>
<p>It was also claimed the move - which Unknown Worlds' ousted leadership reportedly did not support - would mean the studio was unlikely to meet the revenue targets that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">unlock a promised $250m bonus for the development team</a>. Shortly thereafter, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Unknown Worlds' ousted leaders announced legal action against Krafton</a>.</p>
<p>Then, just ahead of the weekend, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">pages from an internal review document</a> also popped up online. According to the leaker, it "clearly shows the state of the development progress and why Krafton and the Subnautica team disagreed on the release schedules".</p>
<p>The document purports to show where the development of Subnautica 2 was deemed to be versus expectation at this point in the development cycle. It criticises the as-is position, saying "while the game includes a variety of content, it currently lacks the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and "falls short of meeting the high expectations of the OWSC and the Asian market". It also clearly states it expects a "content volume increase of over 30 percent compared to v1.0".</p>
<p>At the bottom of the second slide, the author - which remains unknown - states: "compared to the originally planned EA launch specifications, the current target content volume has been reduced or adjusted across various elements such as biomes, creatures, equipment/progression, and features. Due to a gap between the current state and the content volume assumed during the initial launch planning, it is necessary to reassess the release timeline and roadmap".</p>
<p>Rather than refute the leak, however, Krafton has confirmed the document is real, saying it was approving the credibility of the report because that would "minimi[se] speculation and ensur[e] accurate communication with players".</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/comments/1lwyorm/a_leak_from_a_credible_source_regarding_the/">A leak from a credible source regarding the milestone review of Subnautica 2</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Complete_Bread_4924/">u/Complete_Bread_4924</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_2/">Subnautica_2</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>"Krafton is issuing the following statement in response to growing speculation surrounding the development of Subnautica 2," Krafton said in a statement to Eurogamer. "This statement aims to offer clarity and context regarding the current situation.</p>
<p>"The document that has been circulating on social media and reported by various outlets is indeed part of an internal milestone review conducted as part of the Subnautica 2 project. Krafton has confirmed that portions of it have been leaked and are now being widely shared across online platforms and within the fan community. Krafton recognises the confusion this has caused.</p>
<p>"Given these circumstances, Krafton has determined that transparent communication is necessary and has chosen to confirm the authenticity of the document," the publisher added. "Krafton believes that minimising speculation and ensuring accurate communication with players must take precedence.</p>
<p>"Milestone reviews are conducted regularly in collaboration with Krafton's creative studios across all projects. These reviews help assess development progress, define clear objectives, and ensure that each project aligns with Krafton's standards in both creativity and quality. This process is central to Krafton's commitment to delivering polished, high-quality games at the right time.</p>
<p>The statement closed with Krafton's claim that it will "continue working closely with Unknown Worlds to ensure that Subnautica 2 meets the expectations of players who have supported the franchise over the years."</p>
<p>There has, as yet, been no formal response from the former leadership team.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real]]></content:encoded>
