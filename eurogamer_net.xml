            <p>The GameChat function on Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> will include a couple of very welcome accessibility features to make it easier for players to communicate.</p>
<p>Both text-to-speech and live captions will be included, as shown in new videos on social media (thanks, OatmealDome).</p>
<p>The former means players will be able to type messages on a virtual keyboard which are then read by the system. The original Switch does support USB keyboards, but it's unconfirmed if the new console will too.</p>

<p>As for live captions, the console is able to transcribe speech into a chat box at the side of the screen during GameChat.</p>

            <p>Early access for Fantasy Life i on Xbox Series X/S version has been delayed.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1924089583471562809">dropping an unexpected head's up</a> about a possible delay earlier today, developer Level-5 has now confirmed that today's early launch on Xbox Series X/S will not go ahead as planned due to an "ongoing technical issue on Xbox's end".</p>

<p>"Early Access for the Xbox Series X|S version of Fantasy Life i, originally scheduled to begin at 3:00 PM GMT on May 18, has unfortunately been delayed due to an ongoing technical issue on Xbox's side," the developer said on social media. "As of now, the issue remains unresolved and players are still unable to play on Xbox platforms.</p>
<p>"We truly want players to dive into [Fantasy Life i] as soon as possible and it's incredibly frustrating for us that we cannot yet make that happen," the statement added. "We are continuing to work closely with the relevant teams to restore access as soon as possible, but are currently unable to provide a specific time for when Early Access will begin. We will share updates on this account and our official website as soon as we have more information."</p> <div>

<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time will launch for all players across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S (hopefully), Switch, and PC via Steam on 21st May.

            <p>Fall Guy director David Leitch is in talks to direct the movie adaptation of Gears of War.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/gears-of-war-movie-david-leitch-director-1236212544/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Leitch is in negotiations to direct and produce the film with Kelly McCormick and their 87North production company in partnership with game developer, The Coalition. We already knew Jon Spaihts, whose Dune screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, is also on board as script writer.</p>

<p>Netflix did not comment on this latest development but has previously said this will be an adaptation of the Gears of War "video game saga", suggesting it'll be more faithful to the source material than Universal's stalled effort.</p>
<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-live-action-movie-and-animated-series-in-the-works-at-netflix">announced</a> it had acquired the rights to adapt Gear of War into a movie in November 2022, following earlier unsuccessful attempts by New Line Cinema to get a live-action adaptation off the ground. That version, first trumpeted in 2007, had abandoned all pretence of being set in the game's universe by 2019, when the project became permanently stuck in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-movie-is-still-go-gets-screenwriter">development hell</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">People Can Fly is working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game, Gears of War: E-Day</a>.

<p>Yesterday, we revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-movie-could-be-picked-up-for-multiple-millions">bid numbers in the "multiple millions"</a> were reportedly on the table for the adaptation of EA's fan-favourite co-op adventure, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Cloud Imperium Games has responded to players unhappy about the recent introduction of "<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7956894">pay to win</a>" flight blades in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a>, admitting it "missed a step".</p>
<p>While Star Citizen's community doesn't typically shy away from financially supporting the game's 12-year-old early access period, on this occasion, players took umbrage that even though the blades give an undeniable in-game advantage, they had been introduced as a premium item that could not be earned organically through gameplay.</p>
<p>The fallout has been so intense, CIG has now posted a statement, stressing to players that they will be able to obtain flight blades through the in-game currency aUEC "in our next patch this June" and said that "for future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one".</p>

<p>"We're pushing 11 patches this year instead of 4. We're crushing more bugs than ever, building more exciting content, moving faster than ever to make the Persistent Universe a better experience for everyone, and in moving that fast, we missed a step," stressed Tyler "Zyloh-CIG" Witkin (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/after-raising-over-usd800-million-from-its-community-star-citizens-developer-delays-the-release-of-a-new-ship-upgrade-as-players-baulk-at-having-to-pay-for-it/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"To be clear, the new Flight Blades will be obtainable for aUEC in our next patch this June. We followed our usual approach by offering early access on the pledge store to help support development. But after some reflection, we've decided that for smaller components like Flight Blades or bomb racks, they should be available in-game at the same time they appear on the store.</p>
<p>"The choice has and should always be yours," the statement continued. "If you want to support the project early, you can, but it's not required.</p>
<p>"Thanks to everyone who's weighed in, especially those who brought the heat constructively. This game has always been shaped by the community," Witkin concluded." Star Citizen wouldn't exist without your passion and support, or your scrutiny and feedback. We hear you, and we take it all to heart."</p>
<p>Not all players were mollified, however.</p>
<p>"This is meant to be constructive, but you cannot keep the status quo and move up the in game part a little faster and act like you have solved the root of the problem," <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7954429">responded</a> one. "This is a bandaid to calm people down, but the root issue here is that you continue to sell more and more items in the game that have a wider impact on what a player would do day to day.</p>
<p>"Everyone knows the convienence of the pledgestore would outweigh any gameplay in an MMO that is meant to be played and slowly gained progress over years…"</p>
<p>"Flight blades were kept from players in PTU with complete radio silence from CIG only for them to pop up in the store once the patch hit LIVE," <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7955870">added</a> another. "They wanted to cash in on the FOMO during Invictus, and have not changed course. This isn't an act of goodwill, this is a non-apology and business-as-usual for CIG."</p>
<p>Another said players "deserve what we tolerate", <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7959094">stating</a>: "These flight blades feel so gimicky, and having them locked to a single type of ship is just greedy design.</p>
<p>"If we accept this and CIG makes money off these blades, then we deserve more pay-to-win features. "Vote with your wallet, citizens! I've been following the project since 2.6 and I was happy with the development till they changed the ship prices to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> online prices (and economy). That was a hard pill to swallow, but seeing these flight blades come out in this manner, it just paints a clear picture of things to come."</p>

            <p>Semiwork has outlined the next batch of changes coming to its fan-favourite co-op horror game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/repo">REPO</a>.</p>
<p>In a new, and brilliant, video, designer Pontus discussed a revamp of the game's health and re-gen systems, as well as give us a sneaky peek at a devastating new weapon that's slated to arrive, too.</p>

<p>After a cheeky nod to the not-remotely-secret spam-E-as-the-level-loads health glitch - which, sadly, will not be making a return any time soon - Semiwork said it was "listening to feedback", including taking "another look at health balancing in general, as well as crystal balance".</p>
<p>"We are tweaking the health system so that it will be easier to heal your entire team," designer Pontus explained. "We'll be adding a team discount for the health kits, so the more players you are, the cheaper the health kits will get. Also, the truck will be more generous with its health recovery when Semibots return to the truck."</p>
<p>This means that below Level 5, players will get 50 HP when successfully making it back to the truck, and after level 5, you'll regain 35 HP. From Level 10+, it'll be 25 HP.</p>
<p>"We want the health kits and the crystals to be more attractive to buy, so they will have a similar cap on the pricing," Semiwork added.</p>
