            <p>
Secret Mode, the UK indie publisher behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and A Little to the Left, has suffered a "small number" of jobs losses as a result of its sale, Eurogamer can confirm.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, it was announced that Secret Mode had been acquired by Emona Capital, a financial investment firm that also owns Company Heroes studio Relic Entertainment.
</p>
<p>
The move follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">last month's announcement by Sumo Digital, Secret Mode's previous owner, that it would refocus on providing "development services for partners"</a> rather than continuing to create its own IP, in order to balance "creative ambitions and commercial realities". At the time, it said this move would "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people".
</p>
<p>
In a press release this week, Secret Mode said it would now continue under Emona Capital, with its focus remaining on supporting PC and console indie games. The company's current bosses, Ed Blincoe and James Schall, will also remain at the firm. 
</p>
<p>
"Secret Mode is deeply passionate about the creativity and innovation within the indie space, and so we are thrilled to be partnering with Emona Capital and to fully focus on the independent publishing scene," Blincoe said in a statement. 
</p>
<p>
"I also want to express our gratitude to Sumo not only for believing in Secret Mode's original vision and overseeing our startup years, but for granting us this opportunity to become a fully independent entity."
</p>
<p>
This week, several former Secret Mode team members have said they had now been made redundant and were looking for work, including staff in PR and marketing roles. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer, a Secret Mode spokesperson confirmed "a small number of roles" were impacted by the sale, as the publisher adjusted its unannounced line-up of games due for launch across the remainder of this year. 
</p>
<p>
The Chinese Room, which developed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-review">Still Wakes the Deep</a> as well as the acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review">Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</a>, currently remains owned by Sumo Digital.

            <p>Acclaim, the publisher behind hundreds of classic games from the 80s and 90s, is set to be revived.</p>
<p>The company closed back in 2004 as it filed for bankruptcy, but will now return to support indie developers and "reignite classic franchises" from its portfolio of IP.</p>
<p>Acclaim was known in the 90s for game adaptations of familiar franchises, from WWF (now WWE) and The Simpsons, to movie tie-ins like Alien 3, Judge Dredd and Batman Forever, to comic book games like Spider-Man and Wolverine.</p>

<p>It also published the likes of the controversial Mortal Kombat games and Theme Park. Then, in the late 90s, it was prolific for publishing N64 games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a>, Extreme-G, Shadow Man, and the South Park FPS.</p>
<p>As well as resurrecting its old franchises, the company will be offering funding, marketing, and PR support to indie studios.</p>
<p>The newly-revived publisher has an advisory board of industry leaders, including "licensing icons, professional athletes, living music legends and season veterans who have defined the intersection of video games and pop culture". That includes two-time Hall of Fame wrestler Jeff Jarrett.</p>
<p>"For more than three decades, I've had the privilege to have been a part of both the wrestling and gaming universes, and I'm thrilled to now be a partner in the revival of Acclaim, an iconic publisher known for releasing some of the most legendary games of the '80s and '90s," said Jarrett.</p>
<p>"From my early involvement with the publisher's hit 16-bit WWF titles to my experience helping shape the TNA Wrestling series, which spawned the first video game wrestler to become a full-time roster member in the Squared Circle, I've seen firsthand the type of impact great games can have on players and fans. Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved."</p>
<p>Acclaim was originally founded in 1987, publishing a number of NES and Game Boy games. However, sales of its games declined in the early '00s which led to a number of studio closures across the UK. Eventually the company closed in August 2004, closing all of its facilities and terminating all employees at its Austin and New York studios.</p>
<p>Still, a number of game franchises first published by Acclaim have made a return in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-n64-racing-games-join-nintendo-switch-online-today">High-speed racer Extreme-G and puzzle game Iggy's Reckin' Balls</a> were added to Nintendo Switch Online's N64 catalogue last year, which were followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-mature-app-receives-two-additional-n64-games">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil and Shadow Man in the Mature app</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, as previously reported, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-shadowman-game-in-the-works-21-years-after-the-last">new Shadow Man game is in development</a> from Blowfish Studios along with comic publisher Valiant Entertainment, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-turok-game">Saber Interactive is working on a new Turok game</a> it revealed at last year's The Game Awards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
