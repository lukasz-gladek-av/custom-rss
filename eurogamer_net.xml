<p>So, what of the games themselves? We were quite fond of sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>. </p>
<p>"Much like its heroes, God of War: Ragnarök learns to love itself for what it truly is: gargantuan, excessive, and wonderfully absurd," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-glorious-excess-makes-a-triumphant-return">Eurogamer's God of War: Ragnarök review</a>.</p>
<p>Another highlight is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a>. "Occasionally turning subtext into text, Citizen Sleeper's real magic is found in the boundless warmth of its characters - and the humanity of its own design," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-review-a-gentle-cerebral-game-of-belonging-and-survival">Citizen Sleeper review from 2022</a>.</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pressure-of-success-citizen-sleeper-and-the-mission-to-expand-rpgs">our Bertie recently chatted with the game's creator Gareth Damian Martin</a> about the pressure of success and upcoming sequel Citizen Sleeper 2.</p>

<p>Then we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name">Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a> - perhaps something to enjoy ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-getting-new-game-plus-in-free-post-launch-update">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>. We praised Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name's "absolutely fantastic combat system" on its release, however we were left wondering if this was a story that really needed to be told at all.</p><p>"This is another entertaining, idiosyncratic, action-packed romp for the Yakuza series, but it feels as though Like a Dragon Gaiden needs to do more to justify its undermining of Kiryu's perfect sendoff in Yakuza 6," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-review">our three star review</a>.</p>
<p>As for those on Premium, it may not be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, but there is the Staff of Kings to tide you over before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">Bethesda's latest take on the fedora wearing professor makes its way to PlayStation 5 later this year</a>.</p>
<p>"The Staff of Kings certainly has all the ingredients for a cracking action-adventure, but somewhere along the line the team ended up making arguably the most forgettable Indiana Jones game to date," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-staff-of-kings-review">reads our review from 2009</a>.</p>

            <p>
Remote Raid Passes are now usable for the first time within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> to take part in Shadow Raids, the game's developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has announced.
</p>
<p>
It's a notable move by Niantic to allow Remote Raid Passes for an in-game activity that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-the-remote-pass-nerf-pokemon-go-moves-forward-with-shadow-raids">originally designed to revitalise in-person play</a> back in 2023, as the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-teases-blockbuster-slate-of-summer-features-as-it-makes-major-remote-raid-changes">looked to limit remote raiding</a> following the era of Covid lockdowns.
</p>
<p>
Shadow Raids can be battled with Remote Raid Passes for a week, in what feels like something of a test for the idea ahead of a wider rollout. The move coincides with a new Shadow Pokémon in-game event, and a raid day for Shadow Legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh this weekend.
</p>
<p>
Until now, powerful Shadow Pokémon - harder hitting than their regular counterparts - have only been available in raids via in-person meet-ups. 
</p>
<p>
This limitation was deliberate, and the allure of capturing Shadow creatures - in particular, Shadow Legendary Pokémon - was designed as way to get players back outside and raiding together.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps Niantic feels that the feature's limitations have now promoted as much in-person play as they were ever going to? Perhaps the introduction of Gigantamax Pokémon - another feature players must battle in-person in large groups - has taken its place? Or perhaps the ever-popular Remote Raid Passes are simply too lucrative to throttle in the same way going forward? Eurogamer has asked Niantic for comment.
