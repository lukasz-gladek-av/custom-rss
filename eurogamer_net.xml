            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> team has announced the release date for its highly anticipated sequel.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch on Playstation 5 later this year, on 2nd October.</p>

<p>"It's been nearly five years since we shipped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and in that time we’ve been hard at work making Ghost of Yōtei something special," wrote Sucker Punch's Andrew Goldfarb, announcing today's release date news. </p>
<p>"While the stories are unrelated, it's important to us to make this a worthy follow-up to Jin's journey, and we can't wait for you to experience Atsu's quest for vengeance later this year."</p>
<p>The studio also released a new trailer for Ghost of Yōtei, which you can check out below.</p>
<p>This trailer gives us more insight into Atsu's aforementioned quest for vengeance. We already knew she was seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, but now we know just <em>who </em>it is she is hunting down - that would be a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito," Sucker Punch teases.</p>

<p>Today's trailer is but a small taste of what players can expect on Ghost of Yōtei's release, the developer added. Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so this remark is in keeping with the studio's overall plan for the sequel.</p>
<p>Those interested in pre-ordering Ghost of Yōtei will be able to do so from next week, with those pre-orders starting on 2nd May (how is it May next week?!). As is the case with many releases these days, there will be a number of different editions to choose from. </p>
<p>Regardless of which edition you plump for, those who do pre-order will receive a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yōtei Six (see below).
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Anyway, onto those editions, and what they include. The standard edition of Ghost of Yōtei which includes the game (obviously) will retail for £69.99 / €79.99. This edition will be available at certain retailers or via the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition of Ghost of Yōtei will also be available for  £79.99 / €89.99. This chap will have the game itself, as well as some bonuses such as The Snake's armor set, as well as an alternate dye for your starting armour. </p>
<p>
Ghost of Yōtei's  Digital Deluxe Edition will also come with a unique horse color and unique saddle dye, as well as an in-game Charm, gold Sword Kit, and an early unlock of Traveler’s Maps. These will help you find statues throughout the world, which in turn will be useful for upgrading your skills.
</p>

</figure>
<p>Lastly, Sucker Punch is releasing a Ghost of Yōtei Collector's Edition. The developer is yet to announce pricing for this edition, but we do know what it will include.</p>
<p>Those who opt for Ghost of Yōtei Collector's Edition will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the pre-order bonuses</li>
<li>All in-game items from the Digital Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>A digital copy of the game, as well as a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask</li>
<li>A replica of Atsu's sash, complete with the names of all six members of the Yōtei Six</li>
<li>A replica of the Tsuba from Atsu's katana</li>
<li>A pouch of coins</li>
<li>Instructions to play Zeni Hajiki, a game of skill you'll play throughout Ghost of Yōtei.</li>
<li>A foldable papercraft ginkgo tree along with a wolf at its base</li>
<li>A set of four 5 x 7-inch art cards featuring the sash, the wolf, Atsu's Ghost mask, and our key art</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general point, an account for PlayStation Network will be required to redeem things such as digital items available via a voucher code. </p>
<figure>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-update-sparks-speculation-of-new-in-game-economy-and-bounty-system">Sucker Punch said it remained committed to Ghost of Yōtei's 2025 release window</a> on PS5. </p>
<p>There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).

            <p>After plenty of rumours, speculation and leaks, Bethesda finally announced and released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">spruced up version of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion last night</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after this, the studio stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">there was no official mod support for its Oblivion remaster</a>, but that hasn't stopped plenty of players already releasing mods for it anyway.</p>

<p>As highlighted over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1k5pezw/oblivion_remastered_theres_already_over_70_mods/?share_id=JAyEZRfoDcy1hdxfTtsPb&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">reddit</a>, in just 11 hours after the game was released, there were already over 70 mods available for Oblivion Remastered players to choose from.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are currently 96 Oblivion Remastered mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=updatedAt&amp;page=1">available on Nexus Mods</a> (at least as I can see while not being logged in), but I suspect it will soon pass 100.</p>
<p>These mods include things like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/100">Faster (And Slower) Levelling</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97">Slower Item Degradation</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13">improved HUDs</a>. There's also the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15">Adoring Fan desktop shortcut icon replacer</a>, because <em>of course </em>he is going to pop up.</p>
<p>So, yes, people have certainly been busy since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> debuted yesterday. Meanwhile, I am sitting here just chuffed that I have at least managed to get it installed on my Xbox in the time since last night.</p>

<p>Away from my not-very-impressive-Xbox-flex, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos on Steam, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far</a>. Are you one of them?</p>
<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo does not have the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> stock to meet customer demand in Japan, it has admitted, in a stark warning from the company's president.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media this morning, <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">Nintendo boss Shuntaro Furukawa revealed</a> an astonishing 2.2 million people had applied to buy a Switch via the My Nintendo Store as part of a lottery process.
</p>
<p>
Furukawa admitted this was a number that "far exceeds expectations" and "far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered" at launch.

</figure>
<p>In Japan, Nintendo has offered a cheaper, region-locked version of Switch 2 that will only play Japanese games and only be compatible with Japanese Nintendo accounts. The thinking here is that this version can be offered to Nintendo's key home market, which is currently impacted by a weak Yen, while also ensuring it cannot be bought up and resold online to those elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>But creating a Japan-only version of Switch 2 may also present its own problems - such as creating an additional line of stock that has to be manufactured separately, and cannot be topped up by additional units made for elsewhere.</p>
<p>
Nintendo is now telling its Japanese fans that "a significant number of customers" will be unable to get Switch 2 at launch. Anyone who has applied to buy the console so far will be automatically entered into a second lottery - but this too will result in an undisclosed number of applications being unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
"We deeply apologise for not being able to meet your expectations despite our prior preparations," Furukawa wrote.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo says it is "further strengthening" its Switch 2 production as a result, and that pre-orders via other Japanese retailers will open tomorrow, should fans want to try their luck there.
</p>
<p>
"With the cooperation of retailers, we will continue to ship the console and make efforts to get as many Nintendo Switch 2 consoles as possible into your hands," Furukawa added.
</p>
<p>
"We plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future. We apologise for the delay in our ability to meet your expectations, and we appreciate your understanding."
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1914985844189933700">Dr Serkan Toto</a>, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy firm Kantan Games, described the amount of interest in Switch 2 as "ridiculous", but also noted Nintendo had "originally promised enough supply for launch - which of course immediately sounded like a fairy tale for anybody with a basic understanding of the game market".
</p>
<p>
Overseas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Switch 2's launch has already proven bumpy in North America</a> - where Nintendo has had to factor in the current US trade war with China into its launch pricing. In the US, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Switch 2 will still arrive on 5th June alongside the rest of the world, though prices for its accessories have now been raised</a>.

            <p>It may have now released its own remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion, but that doesn't mean Bethesda is planning on shutting down work on the fan-made Skyblivion mod.</p>
<p>Let's be honest, we all knew a spruced up version of Oblivion was on the cards. Along with those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">screenshots on developer Virtuos' website</a>, references to the project were also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-references-now-found-on-bethesdas-website">spotted on Bethesda's own website</a> before Bethesda had made any official announcement. Then last night, it finally got around to telling us what we all knew already: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered is real</a>, and available to play now.</p>

<p>However, while this was an exciting bit of news for many, there is one particular group this announcement was perhaps less than welcome for, at least in terms of timing. That would be TESRenewal, the team working Skyblivion, a volunteer-based project seeking to remake Oblivion in the Skyrim engine.</p>
<p>When word of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster started gaining more traction last week, project lead Rebelzize said Bethesda's then-impending announcement "changes nothing" as far as the Skyblivion team were concerned. Rebelzize, on the outside at least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyblivion-fan-project-lead-reacts-to-oblivion-remake-news-with-all-love-and-no-hate">remained positive about the project and the upcoming remaster being able to both thrive</a>, stating it was a "win-win" for fans of Oblivion.</p>
<p>Now, the TESRenewal team has gone one step further and assured its Skyblivion community Bethesda has "no intention of shutting down our project". It additionally thanked the studio for the Oblivion Remastered game keys Bethesda gifted the entire modding team.</p>
<p>"This means so much to us. Thank you for everything," the <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914754195674333459">TESRenewal team shared on social media</a>.</p>

<p>While this is good news for the Skyblivion team and all those looking forward to the project's release (which is slated for some time this year), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda itself has said it has no plans for Oblivion Remastered official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile since its release last night, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos. Over on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">Oblivion Remastered has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Who would have suspected Bethesda to shadow drop Oblivion yesterday! Well, quite a lot of us, in fact. 
</p>
<p>
But regardless of whether fans had already prepped themselves for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> or not, they turned up in huge numbers.
</p>
<p>
Over on Steam, which <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2623190/charts/">publicly reveals its player data</a>, Oblivion Remastered has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far - placing it ahead of anything else on Steam except stalwarts <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.

Oblivion Remastered is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the best-selling game on Steam right now, and has launched with a Very Positive user review rating from those who have played.
</p>
<p>
Of course, Steam's numbers only count for a fraction of those who have jumped in so far. Oblivion Remastered is also available via the Microsoft Store on PC, and via the PC Game Pass subscription, as well as on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
We'll be keeping an eye out for combined player numbers from Bethesda when they're available.
</p>
<p>
As announced - and launched - yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">the Oblivion Remaster is really more of a ground-up remake</a> using Unreal Engine 5 from talented co-developer Virtuos. 
</p>
<p>
The new version of Bethesda's classic role-player includes the game's previous expansion content and boasts various gameplay tweaks such as a refreshed levelling system inspired by Skyrim, additional dialogue, modern controls including sprinting. It now also runs at 4K 60fps.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda said it had no plans for Oblivion Remastered official mod support</a>, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda">plenty of unofficial mods have popped up now anyway</a>. Bethesda also made the welcome gesture of gifting access to the Oblivion Remaster to the team of fans currently remaking Oblivion in the Skyrim engine, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-has-no-intention-to-shut-down-fan-made-skyblivion-mod">which it has indicated it approves of</a>.
