<p>"We have been faced with a crossroads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job openings that were looking to be filled on other projects," Rigden said in a statement posted to social media.</p>
<p>The VR team has now been redeployed to "other projects/roles".</p> <div>

            <p>
Nintendo is expected to finally unveil <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> in just a matter of days. 
</p>
<p>
Industry whispers Eurogamer has heard over the past week have coalesced around a reveal this Thursday, 16th January, with a focus on the much-leaked console itself, rather than a deep dive into its software line-up.
</p>
<p>
Today, these whispers were first mentioned publicly by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4&amp;ab_channel=NatetheHate">Nate the Hate</a> podcast, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">previously leaked Microsoft's multiplatform publishing plans</a>. Writing on social media, The Verge's <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217">Tom Warren</a> confirmed he also understood Nintendo planned to reveal Switch 2 this week.

</div><figcaption>Everything we learned this week about Switch 2<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1BtAZoo1S0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
While Nintendo is yet to announce anything, and announcement plans are always subject to change, the growing sense that this week is - finally - the week we officially see Switch 2 for the first time fits with what Eurogamer has previously heard of Nintendo's announcement timing. 
</p><p>
Eurogamer has tracked Switch 2's road to release over the past few years and exclusively reported that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">system's capabilities had been demoed to developers around Gamescom</a> in the summer of 2023. We believed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">an early 2025 reveal was imminent</a>, as Nintendo sought to wring one last Christmas from Switch 1 but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">faced a ticking clock for when it would then reveal the console's successor</a> before its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">self-imposed 31st March deadline</a> - and amidst a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-visited-genki-to-discuss-those-switch-2-leaks-reporter-claims">growing ocean of leaks</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's reveal of the Switch 2 hardware, when it comes, will finally put paid to speculation around the console's form factor, before an expected full reveal of the its launch line-up at a later date, it's believed. 
</p>
<p>As for the console's actual launch, Eurogamer previously reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Switch 2 will not arrive before April</a>, following earlier plans that saw its arrival <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">pushed to 2025 to ensure it arrived with the strongest launch line-up possible</a>.
</p>
<p>
An announcement this week also fits neatly after last week's industry focus on the CES trade show, and a week clear of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Microsoft's own Xbox Developer Direct</a>, on Thursday 23rd January.

            <p>Bungie's all-new IP, codenamed Gummy Bears, is a team-based competitive MOBA that has now been handed over to a brand-new PlayStation studio.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/">The Game Post</a>, which said that about 40 Bungie developers are working with the new studio to expand the "vibrant and colourful" Super Smash Bros-esque game to "attract a younger audience" and diversify both its portfolio and audience. According to sources, it's been in development for around three years and is getting "overwhelmingly positive feedback".</p>

<p>There's more, too. The report hints that "multiple" anonymous sources claim Gummy Bears' players "won't have traditional health bars" but instead use a "percentage-based damage system where characters are knocked back further based on how much damage" they take or inflict.</p>
<p>We're told it'll be a "lo-fi and cosy" competitive PvP team-based game with the fundamentals of a MOBA and splashes of Smash Bros.</p>
<p>There'll be several modes and three class types, including Support, Attack, and Defense. Interestingly, players will also be able to "hang out with friends in-between matches and express <em>their</em> identities in the game".</p>
<p>We've reached out to PlayStation for comment about both the game itself and the mysterious new studio developing it - we'll let you know as/when it comes back to us.</p>
<p>Presumably it won't be adapted from the '80s Disney cartoon of the same name pictured above... but we'll see, I guess?!</p>
<p>As for Bungie itself? Almost exactly a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">it was reported</a> Bungie had delayed its sci-fi extraction shooter Marathon into 2025, the studio released a gameplay-free developer update saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">the game is "on track", albeit a "little early to show"</a> - and that it'll "reveal a lot more" later this year.</p>
<p>The update marked the first promotional push from Bungie after it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laid off 220 staff</a> - roughly 17 percent of its workforce - in July 2024.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Skyscraper-sized reptile king Godzilla will soon be unleashed on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s battle royale map, as a quick snippet of gameplay footage released today shows. 
</p>
<p>
We've known since December that Godzilla was set to take a starring role this season - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-leaks-point-to-godzilla-crossover">smaller-sized version is also coming as a skin, as part of the current battle pass</a>. But this is the first time we've seen him actually stomping around the map in actual gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
It looks as if ol' Godzilla will be a giant roaming boss - similar to last year's climactic Doctor Doom fight, where all players banded together to take down the Marvel villain. Quite how it'll work here remains to be seen.

<p>
And in other Fortnite news, developer Epic Games has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">now made its crossover with Hatsune Miku official</a>. The virtual popstar icon will front the next season of the game's musical Fortnite Festival mode.
</p>
<p>
The next Music Pass will include a Fortnite crossover version of Hatsune Miku, including a variant style themed to look like the game's Brite Bomber fan favourite skin, plus various themed virtual instruments and other accessories. A classic Hatsune Miku skin will also be available to buy separately.

As announced last week, the new Fortnite Festival season will additionally add local co-op play on PlayStation and Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-festival-is-getting-local-co-op-support-rekindling-memories-of-rock-band">recreating the feel of those classic Rock Band and Guitar Hero sessions</a> (albeit with fewer plastic add-ons).
