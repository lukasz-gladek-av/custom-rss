            <p>
Grand Taking Ages, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> "parody" that uses AI artwork and voice acting, has done enough to convince Valve it should launch on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
That's despite Sony recently stepping in to remove a PS5 version of the project set to launch on the PlayStation Store.
</p>
<p>
Originally titled Grand Taking Ages 6, the now re-named game has a July 2025 release date on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3464800/Grand_Taking_Ages/">Steam</a>, and there's fresh detail on what the game actually is. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulled-gta-6-parody-game-grand-taking-ages-from-the-playstation-store-but-its-now-cleared-for-release-on-steam">IGN</a>, developer Violarte said Grand Taking Ages would be a management simulator, where players attempt to run a game developer. (Presumably you are not rewarded for getting booted off the store of a major console manufacturer.)
</p>
<p>
Adjustments have been made in order to convince Steam owner Valve that Grand Taking Ages is actually a legitimate project, with changes to the game's logo and presentation "to clearly differentiate the game" from Rockstar's own GTA 6.

According to Violarte, its project was taken down by Sony despite the defence that it was clearly a parody. Indeed, the developer suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">the recent Grand Theft Hamlet project</a> - a film in which a production of Shakespeare's classic play is performed within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> - proved just this.
</p><p>
"We genuinely believe that, with the recent updates, Grand Taking Ages is now ready to be relisted on the PlayStation Store," Violarte concluded, saying it had requested Sony now reinstate the game's store page. "We strongly believe that there will be no issues with Sony this time, given the adjustments we've implemented."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Sony for comment.

            <p>
Ted Price, the founder and CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> and Marvel's Spider-Man developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, has announced his retirement from the games industry, saying he "felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team."
</p>
<p>
Price founded Insomniac (then known as Xtreme Software) in 1994, and the studio released its debut title - first-person shooter Disruptor - two years later. Soon after, the studio embarked on a run of releases that would cement its position in the video game hall of fame, establishing beloved franchises including Spyro the Dragon, Ratchet &amp; Clank, and Resistance.
</p>
<p>
Insomniac's close relationship with PlayStation eventually led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-has-bought-spider-man-developer-insomniac-games">Sony's acquisition of the studio in 2019</a>, after which it saw continued success across three Marvel's Spider-Man games.

<p>
Now though, after 30 years steering Insomniac, founder and CEO Ted Price is stepping down. "After having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games," he <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/">wrote on the Sony Interactive website</a>, "I'll be retiring from the industry at the end of March."
</p>
<p>
"I actually made this decision last year," Price continued. "For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team."
</p>
<p>
Price added a "succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades" has been in the works for some time. As a result, Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/">been announced as Insomniac Games' new co-studio heads</a>.
</p><p>
"I want to thank every Insomniac for having a positive and lasting impact on my life," Price concluded. "Working side by side...for so many years has been a gift that I'll cherish for the rest of my days. I also want to thank our fans who, for three decades, have shared their enthusiasm, their encouragement and their support - inspiring us to take every game farther than the last. We do what we do for you. And I can assure you that we won't be slowing down."
</p>
<p>
Insomniac is currently developing Marvel's Wolverine, which still doesn't have a release date despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-reportedly-due-2025-darker-than-spider-man">previous reports it was targeting 2025</a>. Footage of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">unannounced live-service Spider-Man game</a> also surfaced last year following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-leak-lays-bare-spider-man-developer-insomniacs-plans-for-the-next-decade">major security breach</a> - but it's believed that project, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">host of other first-party PlayStation live-service titles</a>, is now cancelled.
