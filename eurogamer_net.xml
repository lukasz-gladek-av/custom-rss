            <p>Remember when we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix was hiking prices again, but most of Europe had escaped</a>? Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/07/netflix-increase-uk-subscription-prices-despite-record-audience">The Guardian</a>, the streaming giant has now confirmed above-inflation price rises for UK subscribers, with its most popular non-ad-supported subscription increasing by £2 to £13 - that's an 18 percent hike - and its most expensive tier rising £1 to £19 a month.</p>

<p>Even the cheapest tier, which includes advertisements, has also increased by a pound to £6 per month. It now also costs an additional £1 to add an extra member to a package.</p>
<p>"We will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improve Netflix," the company said, saying the increased fees help the firm "continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members".</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us at the time, the news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter. And it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025, too.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-crys-animated-netflix-series-gets-april-release-date-and-a-limp-bizkit-opener">Netflix's animated adaptation of Devil May Cry is almost upon us</a>. The streaming service has announced the series premieres on 3rd April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PlayStation Network is still offline after unexpectedly going down around midnight last night, UK time (1am CET / 7pm ET / 4pm PT).</p>
<p><a href="https://status.playstation.com/en-gb/">According to Sony</a>, the outage is impacting all services and features, including account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and PlayStation Direct.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psn-down-for-hours-as-sony-services-experiencing-issues">Unlike last time</a>, this seems to be impacting all PlayStation systems, not just PS4 and PS5 players, but also PS Vita, PS3, and website visitors, too.</p>

<p>Beyond a single-line statement posted to PlayStation social media accounts around 10 hours ago that said Sony is "aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN", there have been no further updates on what's caused the outage, nor when its services will resume.</p>
