            <p>Two of my words are colliding, people! Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is currently updating Hitman with a new elusive target - it's only ruddy La Chiffre from Casino Royale!</p>
<p>The news was revealed this evening, with actor Mads Mikkelsen joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> and IO boss Hakan Abrak to announce the Hitman x Bond collaboration. Le Chiffre will be available to hunt for free via PC and consoles soon. As in, very soon - the devs are getting it all prepped as we speak, so in a few moments or so we are go!</p>

<p>Above is a little trailer for the whole thing, which takes place in Paris, and yes I am reacting perfectly normally about it all and not getting overexcited at all.</p>
<p>And, below's an infographic for Agent 47's next elusive target. As you can see, playing and killing La Chiffre will unlock awards for 007: First Light. </p>
<p>"Le Chiffre is a character I have always enjoyed - he's calculating, cold, and ruthless," said Mads Mikkelsen. "Bringing him into the world of Hitman makes for a thrilling collaboration. Players can expect mind games, high stakes, and twists that only this character could orchestrate. To succeed, they'll need to play their hand wisely."</p>
<p>"We are beyond thrilled to welcome Mads Mikkelsen to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>," added IO's Hakan Abrak. "Players are really going to enjoy this new mission, which marks the return of Le Chiffre after nearly 20 years. I'm excited to see our players jump into this small taste of bigger things to come in the Bond franchise from IO Interactive."</p>

<p>IO, of course, also recently lifted the lid on its upcoming Bond game. Earlier this week, we got a reveal trailer which introduced us to the young Bond at the start of his life as an agent.</p>
<p>But, while it may be an origin story, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-may-be-an-original-story-but-you-might-have-missed-plenty-of-homages-to-the-bonds-that-came-before">007: First Light already has plenty of nods to the Bond books and films that came before</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
