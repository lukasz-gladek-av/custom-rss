            <p>Uncork'd Entertainment has acquired distribution rights to 'George A. Romero's Resident Evil' - an investigative documentary which looks into the filmmaker's unrealised film adaptation of the video game series - in the US and Canada.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3840097/george-a-romeros-resident-evil-documentary-releasing-in-january-2025-exclusive/">Bloody Disgusting</a>, the documentary has been directed and co-written by Brandon Salisbury. It takes us back to 1998, when Constantin Film set out to bring Resident Evil to the big screen with the help of Romero. On its release, the documentary will include archival footage, as well as interviews with those who were involved in the unreleased film, going into the reasons why it was never made.</p>
<p>"George Romero gave birth to modern horror, the modern zombie, and ultimately Resident Evil," said Salisbury. "I am honoured to bring fans the untold story of his most important unmade project, to celebrate the legacy of the man that inspired me to pursue filmmaking as a career. I hope fans enjoy this ultimate experience in survival horror."</p>

            <p>There's been a question mark over this one for years, but it seems BioWare did once plan to let you import your Hero of Ferelden, your Grey Warden protagonist from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>. It was only at the last minute that the studio cut the feature and swapped a Grey Warden character called Stroud in their place.</p>
<p>In Inquisition, there's a pivotal mission near the end - Here Lies the Abyss - where you get a chance to meet protagonists from previous games. You meet your Hawke from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>, and then you get the chance to meet one of three Grey Warden characters from Dragon Age: Origins - and it's here the game was supposed to let you meet your Hero of Ferelden. But it didn't - this is where Stroud was swapped in instead.</p>
<p>"Here's the thing about honouring previous game choices from a design perspective: it's a sucker's game," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwpwi6ns22">wrote Gaider on Bluesky</a>. "What many fans picture, when you mention it, is divergent *plot* - the story changes path based on those major choices. How exciting!</p>
<p>"But you will never be able to deliver divergent plot."</p>

<p>"It's a question of resources, and there's never enough to go around.</p>
<p>"Here Lies the Abyss in DAI was about as good as it gets," he added, "and even that was a far cry from how I originally pictured it (hello last-minute insert of Stroud when a DAO Warden import got cut)."</p><p>Gaider's Bluesky thread came about as an addendum, of sorts, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-developer-cast-farscape-star-as-morrigan-after-hearing-her-beat-poet-rendition-of-noughties-rap-banger">yesterday's story about the origins of Morrigan's character</a> and the voice actor cast to play her. The primary focus of the addendum concerns Morrigan's child in the game, Kieran, AKA the Old God Baby. He does appear in Inquisition but this was another choice from Dragon Age: Origins that gave Gaider a headache.</p>

<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">BioWare didn't know there would be a Dragon Age 2 when it was making Dragon Age: Origins</a>, let alone a Dragon Age 3 (Inquisition), so it didn't plan these things in advance. It did a bunch of things in Origins it turns out were incredibly hard to fulfil later on.</p>
<p>The Old God Baby is a big deal... <em>if</em> it happened in your game. The soul of the Archdemon you defeat - a corrupted Old God - is transferred into the baby that you and Morrigan, or Morrigan and another character, conceive on the eve of the final battle. Already, then, there are permutations in who the father could be, so who should canon-Kieran look like?</p><p>"It was a decision from *two games ago* that only a small minority (hello telemetry) would even choose," said Gaider. "To the rest, they probably neither knew about it nor cared... so how many resources could you invest? To do what? Set up an even bigger divergence for the NEXT game?"</p>
<p>The solution came when Gaider made the scene more about Morrigan and less about Kieran, a character the players didn't know. "Thus began a feverish three days where I wrote probably the most complicated scene of my career: Morrigan's reckoning with Flemeth in DAI and the fallout after," he said. "Three different versions (OGB Kieran, non-OGB Kieran, and no Kieran), each with branching for other choices (like the Well of Sorrows)."</p>
<p>It was a scene that resonated with Morrigan actor Claudia Black, who'd had a child of her own not long after Dragon Age: Origins had come out. In fact, she would later have her own child play the role of Kieran in the scene. "Claudia was in the booth, gently coaching him through his lines," Gaider said, "and I think that was the first moment I felt I'd done the right thing."</p>
<p>Gaider, incidentally, did not work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> at all - a game that sidesteps a lot of the issues Inquisition faced by letting you customise an Inquisitor during character creation, and then outlining only three of the biggest choices they made. It does not - as previous Dragon Ages did - use the web-based Dragon Age Keep database, which tracked a multitude of decisions from the older games.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-7</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-%C2%A37.1041639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-now-selling-digital-shoes-for-your-character-skin-with-nike-air-jordans-costing-around-7<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has a new type of cosmetic option for its characters - Kicks - which are, in a nutshell, shoes. 
</p>
<p>
The first pair of Kicks has been viewable within Fortnite since the start of its current Chapter 2 Remix season - a pair of Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Black Toe Reimagined' trainers, which you can unlock as part of the current battle pass. 
</p>
<p>
As of today, however, Kicks are now equippable by (many, though not all) Fortnite character skins. A range of other shoes - sorry, Kicks - are also available to buy. 
</p>
<p>
Starting today, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nike Cortez Leather OG - 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Air Foamposite One 'Galaxy' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Shox R4 'Comet Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Chomp Stompers - 600 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

<p>
And from tomorrow, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Jordan 3 Retro 'Palomino'- 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 3 'Black Cement-Gray' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 11 'Black/Gym Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 4 Retro 'Manila' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

<p>I really like the Chomp Stompers - those shark slippers which only cost 600 V-Bucks (around £3-ish?) As a Fortnite-original design, these are cheaper than the other options. There's no way I'm paying 1000 V-Bucks - the price of a battle pass - for anything else.</p>
<p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games says Kicks are currently compatible with over 500 Fortnite skins, with 95 percent of the game's skin library set to be compatible by the spring of next year. 
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">Fortnite revealed a shake-up to its battle pass system</a> and the introduction of another separate battle pass for its upcoming, permanent edition of the game's original map: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">Fortnite OG</a>.

            <p>The award-winning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is seemingly the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed that the game's average daily peak concurrents are up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent this year over last year, when Baldur's Gate 3 launched.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its average daily active users are up by a more substantial 20 percent over last year. "If you zoom out on our sales chart it looks like the heartbeat of a happy little guy," Douse wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>These increases, Douse has implied, are thanks to mods (they are "very good", in his words).</p>
<p>Back in October, Larian celebrated 50m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). At this same time, the developer said 10k of those mod downloads were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-modders-really-want-to-change-withers-name-to-bone-daddy">players changing Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity Withers' name to Bone Daddy</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>In June, Larian head Swen Vincke stated Baldur's Gate 3's official mod support would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">handover moment to players</a>, though the studio will continue to provide updates afterwards.</p>
<p>As for what's next, Larian previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before the studio decided to try something new instead. The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
