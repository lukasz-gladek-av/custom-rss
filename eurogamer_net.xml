            <p>
Images that look to have been taken inside Rockstar's San Diego office have been posted online, showing a computer screen with what appears to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> running. 
</p>
<p>
As a video game leak, the purported image of GTA 6 itself is essentially meaningless - it simply shows main character Lucia standing next to a wall and some crates. What's more, the image appears to date from the summer of 2021, three and a half years ago.
</p>
<p>
What's unusual here is that the image has been taken within the bowels of Rockstar's own offices, and posted online by someone who seems happy enough to live with the consequences. 
</p>
<p>
The photo and two accompanying video clips, which show a brief glimpse at more of the office surroundings, were first posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F98ox9ku1jfae1.jpeg">reddit</a> by user JustLovett0 around 17 hours ago. "Someone I am close to took it when they worked at the Rockstar office for a few months," they wrote of the image, on a post titled "a photo from mid-2021. I think it's been long enough I can post this."
</p>
<p>
What's shown of the office itself looks relatively generic, though it's clearly the Rockstar San Diego building based on the shape of the windows and frontage that can be seen outside. 
</p>
<p>
Desks nearby house PlayStation and Xbox developer kits, one of which is labelled with a code beginning "SAND", presumably a reference to San Diego.
</p>
<p>
When asked whether their friend was worried about being traced, JustLovett0 wrote: "He is super far from Rockstar now, doesn't work there or in any related field. I'm not worried but I'll probably delete the post soon enough.
</p>
<p>
"Hopefully there's no camera footage from 3.5ish years ago."
</p>
<p>
The post has since been removed, though has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hratml/reupload_of_the_guys_gta_6_leaked_photo_vids_from/">reuploaded</a> elsewhere on reddit. Eurogamer has contacted Rockstar for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Back in September 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">a teenage hacker from the UK stole an enormous swathe of in-development GTA 6 footage and files</a>. The now-notorious leak remains one of the most prominent in video game history. Its culprit was later arrested, though was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/teenage-gta-6-hacker-given-indefinite-hospital-order">ultimately deemed unfit to stand trial</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>'s director has appeared to contradict Microsoft, stating the game's Xbox delay is due to the Series S's memory limitations. This is something that the Xbox maker has previously denied.</p>
<p>Writing on Chinese social media platform <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223">Weibo</a>, Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji said the Xbox Series S's memory is the reason behind the game's delay on Microsoft's consoles. Lamenting Black Myth: Wukong's absence on Xbox in an otherwise good year for the studio (it recently scooped up a number of awards at the Steam Awards), the director wrote:</p>
<p>"But that 10G shared memory, I can't really get it without a few years of optimisation experience" (translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukongs-game-director-blames-the-xbox-series-s-10gb-of-memory-for-the-xbox-version-being-delayed.1072326/">ResetEra</a>).</p>

<p>In September of last year however, Microsoft said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">delay to the game's Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong was <em>not </em>due to "platform limitations"</a>. At this time, there was also chatter that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">Black Myth: Wukong team had entered into an undisclosed exclusivity deal with PlayStation</a>.</p><p>"As we have said before, we're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms," Microsoft said at the time. "We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to both Xbox and Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science for clarification on the game's Xbox delay.</p>

            <p>
New year, new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks. While Nintendo's plans for its Switch successor remain officially under wraps, a <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/12182966?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiIwNGIxYTliMS1lNTFjLTQ3OTktOWU0OS05OTE4ODk1MzQ3ZWQiLCJ2ZXIiOiI2MDkzNTYxMy1jNDg1LTRiMTUtYWZmMi02NzZhMDliNmZiZWMiLCJleHAiOjB9">patent</a> from the company has surfaced detailing plans to use upscaling technology to cram games with up to 4K textures onto physical game cartridges. 
</p>
<p>
The patent describes technology similar to Nvidia's DLSS, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>'s baked in PSSR, to upscale images using AI. A key advantage listed here is to decrease the size of games that would otherwise include hefty 4K-native assets. This helps keep download sizes small, and also allows for these games to fit onto moderately-sized physical media.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's patent dates from July 2023, but was only published publicly this week. As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3leooutc5sk26">highlighted</a> by industry consultant Laura Kate Dale, the patent suggests "a game with native 4K textures might need a 60GB download, but a 1080-native version might only need 20GB (which would allow it to fit on a 32GB Switch cart, the current max size)".
</p>
<p>
The news comes as a fresh leak shows our best look yet at what appears to be the Switch 2's internal components. The images tally with what we know about the size and internal makeup of the device already from past leaks - including an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">earlier glimpse at the Switch 2's motherboard</a>, and the suggestion the console will have a second USB port at the top of the device.

Nintendo has previously said it will announce Switch 2 before the end of its current financial year, on 31st March. But much of the console's design can now be assumed - all signs point to it being a slightly larger version of the current Switch, with magnetic Joy-Con and a mysterious new "C" button on the right Joy-Con.
</p><p>
"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense,"  industry analyst Serkan Toto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">told Eurogamer last month</a>. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them, even if some of them will turn out to be made up. It is actually getting so bad with those leaks that they might cause Nintendo to release information earlier than planned."
