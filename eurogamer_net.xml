            <p>A new report now suggests that some BioWare staff "loaned" to other EA studios will not be returning.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, amid reports of potential layoffs at BioWare, studio general manager <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-many-staff-moved-elsewhere-in-ea-as-core-team-focuses-on-mass-effect-5-in-downsized-studio">Gary McKay has confirmed "many" employees have now been moved elsewhere in EA</a> following the completion of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - and that a remaining core team is fully focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p>
<p>Now, however, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss">Bloomberg</a> is reporting that the "loans" made by BioWare to support EA teams elsewhere have now "morphed into permanent relocations".</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg sources and "people familiar with what happened", staff are no longer BioWare employees "temporarily on assignment elsewhere" but, in fact, now work for whichever EA subsidiary had borrowed them.</p>
<p>"If they want to work at BioWare again in the future, they would have to look for job openings and re-apply," Bloomberg stated.</p>
<p>"This was an unwelcome development for some of the employees, who now find themselves on brand-new teams at studios theyâ€™d never planned to join. Some had come to BioWare to work on storied role-playing game franchises and found the idea of working on action or sports games less appealing."</p>
<p>This means BioWare has seemingly halved its 200 headcount to around 100 in just two years.</p>
<p>Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veteran Trick Weekes is among a group of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-veteran-writer-among-those-looking-for-work-after-post-dragon-age-the-veilguard-downsizing">BioWare veterans who recently announced they are now looking for work</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-confirms-many-staff-moved-elsewhere-in-ea-as-core-team-focuses-on-mass-effect-5-in-downsized-studio">following the news that BioWare is downsizing</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> players who bought the premium Founder's Pack have hit out at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> for cancelling its free-to-play live-service fighting game before they had a chance to redeem all of their rewards.</p>
<p>After learning yesterday that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">MultiVersus' fifth season will be its last</a>, some players who stumped up $100 for MultiVersus' Founder's Pack have taken to social media saying they've been "scammed" given they'd paid for 30 character tokens and 2500 Gleamium that they've yet to use.</p>

<p>Whilst some point out that, with the arrival of Aquaman and Lola, there will be 35 characters in the roster, some founder players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1iegmz7/comment/ma7ih74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> that "Gold was a lot more generous back [during the beta]" so they'd been able to redeem characters via the in-game currency, which is why they have character tokens left over.</p><p>Others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1iegmz7/comment/ma8atkc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">say</a> they were keeping their tokens for "future updates"  and that as six of those 35 fighters were given away freely - Banana Guard, Jason, Shaggy, Wonder Woman, Lola, and Aquaman - many Founder Pack owners may have unused credits (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/multiversus-players-unhappy-season-5-shutdown-100-dollar-founders-pack-feel-scammed/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"23 characters were already unlocked before purchasing Premium Founders," the OP <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1iegmz7/comment/ma7l9d0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">explained</a>. "They still charged despite that. Means they promised the purchaser that they would be able to use all 30 of those tokens knowing that they bought it even after unlocking everything that was released at that moment."</p>

<p>"The concept of the item has to then be useable, if a product is unusable or is described improperly at time of purchase, the consumer is due a refund."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there has been no formal word from Warner Bros. Games or developer Player First Games if they will refund some or all of the cost of Founder's Packs.</p>
<p>In a post to players yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">MultiVersus team confirmed Season 5 will end on 30th May</a>, although the game will still be available offline "for the foreseeable future".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whilst we already knew that Absurd Ventures, the media company established by Houser following his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">departure from the Grand Theft Auto developer in 2020</a>, was working on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-company-is-creating-an-open-world-action-adventure">"open world action-adventure"</a>, this is the first time we get a look at "just a few characters" coming to a "story-driven action-comedy adventure game set in the Absurdaverse".</p>

<p>"A very first look at just a few characters from the Absurdaverse. Prepare to meet some new kinds of heroes (and watch them suffer)," the team teased.</p>
<p>"More information to come this year about the first animation projects and about our original story-driven action-comedy adventure game set in the Absurdaverse, now in development at Absurd Ventures."</p>
<p>That's not all, either. We'll also learn more about two other "storytelling universes" - Better Paradise and American Caper - later this year. The latter is described as a "new crime fiction universe".</p>
<p>We recently learned that following a difficult year for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/immortals-of-aveum">Immortals of Aveum</a> developer Ascendant Studios, a "core team" of around <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/core-team-of-immortals-of-aveum-developers-joins-rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-absurd-ventures">20 employees has now decamped to Absurd Ventures</a>, establishing a new studio that'll be known as Absurd Marin.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
