            <p>More games have been added to the Video Game Hall of Fame, including Rare's brilliant first-person shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>The Strong Museum's <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/exhibits/world-video-game-hall-of-fame/">Video Game Hall of Fame</a> was established back in 2015, with a goal to recognise individual electronic games from arcade to console and everything in between which have "enjoyed popularity over a sustained period and have exerted influence on the video game industry or on popular culture and society in general".</p>
<p>And now, having missed out on being inducted to this Hall of Fame back in 2023, N64 classic GoldenEye 007 has finally made the cut.</p>

<p>"GoldenEye surpassed its contemporaries to become the third best-selling game on the Nintendo 64, beaten only by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-64">Mario Kart 64</a>," the <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/games/goldeneye-007/">Video Game Hall of Fame team wrote of GoldenEye 007</a>.</p>
<p>"Critics lauded it as the premier example of a first-person shooter to succeed on a console rather than a PC, and it is still considered one of the best multiplayer experiences ever produced on a Nintendo system."</p>
<p>This is honestly one of my favourite games of all time. When it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-comes-to-nintendo-switch-online-xbox-game-pass-this-friday">released on Xbox in 2023</a>, I spent quite a bit of time besting my family in the multiplayer. And, thanks to the introduction of Achievements with this Xbox release, I can still look back at my unforgiving gaming dominance with pride... (see below)</p>

<p>Other games inducted into the Strong Museum's World Video Game Hall of Fame this year are Defender, Quake and Tamagotchi. Since its conception in 2015, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-video-game-hall-of-fame-selects-its-inaugural-class">49 games have been added to the Strong Museum's World Video Game Hall of Fame</a>. These include classics such as the original Tomb Raider, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-ocarina-of-time-is-finally-in-the-video-game-hall-of-fame">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, Tetris and Pac-Man.</p>
<p>As for the future of James Bond games, Hitman developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has one in the pipeline, known for now as Project 007. This release will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">kick off a new trilogy of games</a>, IOI hopes. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has updated its Nintendo Account Agreement with a severe warning against "unauthorised use", in a bid to prevent emulation and piracy.</p>
<p>All those with a Nintendo account will have received an email (including Eurogamer) linking to the updated policy. And, as <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-emulation-hacking-brick-warning-terms-of-service">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> spotted, the wording for the Licence for Digital Products section has been altered.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/eula/GB?lang=en-GB">agreement for UK accounts</a> now states digital products are "licensed only for personal and non-commercial use", and that any "unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable".</p>

<p>This differs slightly from the US, which states: "You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>For comparison, here's the original wording (effective since April 2021): "You are not allowed to lease, rent, sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble all or any portion of the Nintendo Account Services without Nintendo's written consent, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law."</p>
<p>And here's the UK update in full: "Any Digital Products registered to your Nintendo Account and any updates of such Digital Products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use on a User Device. Digital Products must not be used for any other purpose. In particular, without NOE's written consent, you must neither lease nor rent Digital Products nor sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of Digital Products other than as expressly permitted by applicable law. Such unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable."</p>
<p>The US update is as follows: "Without limitation, you agree that you may not (a) publish, copy, modify, reverse engineer, lease, rent, decompile, disassemble, distribute, offer for sale, or create derivative works of any portion of the Nintendo Account Services; (b) bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo Account Services, including through the use of any hardware or software that would cause the Nintendo Account Services to operate other than in accordance with its documentation and intended use; (c) obtain, install or use any unauthorised copies of Nintendo Account Services; or (d) exploit the Nintendo Account Services in any manner other than to use them in accordance with the applicable documentation and intended use, in each case, without Nintendo's written consent or express authorisation, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/privacy_policy/GB?lang=en-GB">Nintendo Account Privacy Policy</a> has also been updated ahead of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. Now, Nintendo will be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited period of time - if you give consent.</p>
<p>This is intended for anyone who encounters "language or behaviour that may violate applicable laws", with the company able to review the last three minutes of recorded footage. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment".</p>
<p>The update comes ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-finally-explains-what-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-does">Game Chat feature on Switch 2</a>, where players can essentially video call each other during gameplay.</p>
<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">Nintendo shared a legal victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which it stated was "significant...for the entire games industry".</p>
<p>It followed a string of moves against piracy, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">shutdown of Switch emulator Yuzu</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">lawsuit against a streamer who regularly played pirated copies of Nintendo games ahead of release</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For those Steamier players among us, I have some whip-cracking good news for you. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is now Steam Deck Verified.</p>
<p>The studio has released a hotfix, which will include those optimised Steam Deck settings (a quick note from MachineGames: "When running the game on Steam Deck, the 'Texture Pool Size' is now set to a value called 'Steam Deck' to avoid exceeding RAM limits that will crash the game. Other graphics options can still be adjusted to preference).</p>
<p>This hotfix features a nice mix of bug fixes. For example, Indy will no longer drop items such as his lighter after fast fingered players rapidly switch equipped items with the d-pad at the same time as picking other objects. The developer said those who have dropped any important progression items should find them restored once they've installed the hotfix and launched the game.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those using a DualSense to play Indiana Jones and the Great Circle should notice some improvements to the Adaptive Triggers. They should no longer quietly "click" when Indy is looking at a friendly NPC. There is also a Menu option added, which will allow modification of DualSense wireless controller Adaptive Trigger strength. This includes an option to turn it off.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has sorted out an issue that found the cave door in Iraq closed when players revisited that level.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/7l0DOi4PftsFbyblYdhilO/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tm-update-4-hotfix-2">full notes of the most recent Indiana Jones and the Great Circle hotfix here</a>.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle initially released on Xbox and PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-features-detailed">before arriving on PlayStation last month</a>.</p>
<p>"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle makes a successful leap on to PS5 platforms and despite its delayed release, everything we loved about the Xbox experience is intact. In comparison, the Series X is a preference over the base PS5 - given the often higher average resolution on Xbox - but the margin isn't wide enough to be a deal-breaker," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5-excellent-game-solid-port">Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote following the Great Circle's PS5 debut</a>.</p>
<p>"PS5 owners still get a superb take on MachineGames' latest work. In every other respect the two are matched, right down to the consistency of their 60fps readings in gameplay and the use of RTGI."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
