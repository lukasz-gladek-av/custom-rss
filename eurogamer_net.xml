            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick has revealed why the publisher is keeping Rockstar's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>'s release date such a closely guarded secret.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk">Bloomberg</a>, Zelnick acknowledged the fervor for GTA 6 is "the greatest anticipation [he's] ever seen for an entertainment property", but said that whilst some publishers reveal their publishing plans "years in advance", Zelnick would prefer to "maintain the anticipation and excitement".</p>

<p>"The anticipation for that title may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times," Zelnick explained right at the end of the interview.</p>
<p>"I've been in every entertainment business there is, and we want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement.</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials <em>relatively</em> close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," he added.</p>
<p>"I don't always get it exactly right, but that's what we're trying to do."</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, Take-Two has been doggedly sticking to the same non-specific <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">"fall" launch window for Grand Theft Auto 6</a> since announcing it last May - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">despite persistent reports of a potential delay</a>. But there seems to be one relatively safe spot on the 2025 calendar right now: it's unlikely GTA 6 will release on or during the weeks surrounding 23rd September, given that's the launch date <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">Take-Two reserved for Borderlands 4</a> earlier this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Riven developer Cyan Worlds has cut its staff count by half.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to social media, the Washington studio - perhaps best known for the Myst series - said "despite its best efforts", "industry conditions" had forced it into a "tricky spot [where] the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025" left it with no choice but to lay off half its team.</p>

<p>"Today we would like to share with you some very unfortunate news," the statement began. "Despite our best efforts to avoid it, Cyan has made the difficult decision to reduce our overall staff size - resulting in the layoff of 12 talented staff members, roughly half the team - effective at the end of March.</p> <div>

<p>"Industry conditions have forced us into a tricky spot where we are having to weigh the future health of our studio against the month-to-month realities of game development in 2025. Throughout the past year, we have been ultra-transparent with the entire Cyan team about the choppy waters we find ourselves in, as well as the dangers ahead. While the news of a layoff was not a surprise to the team, it was (and is) still deeply saddening for all of us."</p>
<p>The studio said it has "done [its] best to pad the landing for those affected" with severance packages and is now committed to securing funding for its next project to "restabilise" the studio.</p>
<p>"We've been around for a very long time, and have been through tough times before," the statement concluded. "Our sincere hope is to continue to be around, and to provide the types of experiences that only Cyan can deliver."</p>
<p>At the end of last week, Tomb Raider developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics similarly made the "difficult decision" to layoff 17 "talented" staff</a>. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/">1200 game developers have lost their jobs</a>, on top of around 14,600 in 2024, and 10,500 in 2023.</p></div>

<p>According to an image shared on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">newly released Nintendo Today app</a> yesterday, the live-action film will make its debut on 26th March, 2027.</p>
<p>"A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise[,] The Legend of Zelda follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness," writes the blurb on <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">Production List</a>, which posits filming will begin this November in New Zealand and wrap in April 2026.</p>
<p>"The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce - an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest."</p>
<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie back in November 2023</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the movie</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution). Wes Ball is lined up to direct.</p>
<p>Film producer Avi Arad - whose previous game-to-film projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">last year's Borderlands adaptation</a> and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uncharted-film-sequel-in-development-sony-pictures-confirms">Tom Holland-fronted Uncharted</a> - is also on board.</p>
<p>Along with its Zelda adaptation, Nintendo also has a sequel to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">hugely successful Super Mario Bros. film</a> in the works. The full release date for the animated film sequel will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">3rd April 2026</a> in the US, 24th April 2026 in Japan, and a less specific "April 2026" window for "other countries and regions".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>SAG-AFTRA - the union that represents 160,000 American media professionals, including voiceover artists - has launched two new agreements: the Student Interactive Waiver Agreement and the Game Jam Waiver Agreement.</p>
<p>The union said the new agreements "provide video game developers at every stage of their careers the opportunity to work with union performers, even as the video game strike continues".</p>

<p>The Student Interactive Waiver Agreement has been designed for students currently taking video game courses at accredited educational institutions and "provides an opportunity for students to work with SAG-AFTRA performers to satisfy course requirements during game development" providing the project is recorded entirely in the US and is owned by the student.</p>
<p>The Game Jam Waiver Agreement, on the other hand, is designed for developers contributing to game jams. Under this agreement, participants can work with SAG-AFTRA performers and session fees and secondary payments are deferred "provided that the project does not generate revenue" and material is not recorded prior to the commencement of the event.</p>
<p>In the event that a project does generate revenue, SAG-AFTRA will work with participants to "sign the project to the appropriate agreement".</p>
<p>"With these new agreements, SAG-AFTRA can help support game developers at all levels who want to work with union talent and who want to learn more about producing video games under a union contract. Plus, our members are passionate about this industry and they want to be able to participate in these types of projects where the future of video games is being shaped," said SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">actors' union stated the strike would continue due to "alarming loopholes" allowing for "AI abuse"</a>. Negotiators on behalf of the bargaining video game companies, meanwhile, stated "meaningful progress" had been made, but voice actors on games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/genshin-impact-actor-recast-due-to-ongoing-sag-aftra-strike-over-ai-others-come-out-in-support">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">Zenless Zone Zero</a> have been replaced due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA actors' union strike.</p>
