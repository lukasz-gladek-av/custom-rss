            <p>We should all know by now that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Joy-Cons feature a mouse sensor, but we've also just learned that Nintendo's new system will also support USB mice, too.</p>
<p>As shared in a video by Koei Tecmo, and transcribed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/switch-2-supports-usb-mouse-controls-developer-reveals/">VGC</a>, Nobunagaâ€™s Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition producer Michi Ryu showed off how a mouse can be used on the new system, demonstrating the feature by using both the built-in mouse and a USB one plugged into the console.</p>
<p>You can watch it for yourself in the video below:</p>

<p>"The functionality is the same as the already released Steam version, allowing for left click, right click and wheel operations," Ryu said as he moved the Joy-Con's analogue stick up and down, as though wheeling a mouse scroll button. He also illustrated how the left Joy-Con 2 can also be used at the same time to access shortcuts.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ryu then showed the same functionality using the same left Joy-Con 2 shortcuts, but by using a USB mouse instead. Each time he changed input devices, there was a message on the screen confirming the change.</p>
<p>On its debut, the Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-function-includes-welcome-accessibility-features">GameChat will include text-to-speech and live captions</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">Nintendo will also be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited time</a>, if you give consent. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment", Nintendo said, with footage only reviewed as part of its user-report system. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-feature-requires-a-mobile-phone-number">Those wanting to utilise the Switch 2's GameChat feature</a> will need to register a phone number.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be available worldwide in just under two weeks time, on 5th June. For more, you can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-specs">check out our guide to the Switch 2's specs here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Level 5's role-playing sim Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time has hit 500,000 sales in just three days.</p>
<p>Addressing the thousands of players who had bought the game on PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen systems, the developer thanked players by releasing an all-new illustration marking the milestone.</p>

<p>The team also <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1925940951949656112">announced</a> Update the World!, a free DLC pack that adds news recipes, as well as "content designed to help your high-rarity weapons truly shine, as you aim even higher in your adventure". Expect more details, including the release window, "soon".</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, The Girl Who Steals Time is a sequel to Level 5's Fantasy Life - a sort of job-focussed mash-mash of life sim and RPG - which enjoyed modest critical and commercial success when it launched for Nintendo DS back in 2012. Eurogamer's celebrated its "abundance of features" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-review">our 6/10 review</a> at the time, but noted the result was often "less than the sum of its parts".</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is available now on Steam, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and Switch, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version coming later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
