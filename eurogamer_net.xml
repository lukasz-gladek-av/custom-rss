Previously unseen concept art purportedly showing character designs from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games-montreal">Warner Bros. Games Montreal</a>'s cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> follow-up Project Sabbath has surfaced online, showing further glimpses of a beardy Bruce Wayne, Damian Wayne, and more.
</p>
<p>
Whispers of Project Sabbath's existence first emerged back in 2016, with Batman: Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Games Montreal said to be at the helm. Along the way, however, Project Sabbath was ditched in favour of what would ultimately become the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-review-batman-minus-batman-is-scrappy-but-riddled-with-charm">rather middling Gotham Knights</a>, and much of what we know about the cancelled game has been gleaned through various bits of concept art that've emerged over the years.
</p>
<p>
In 2019, for instance, concept art from Project Sabbath - which would supposedly see Bruce Wayne's son Damian donning the famous cowl and cape - popped up on 4chan, showing off various elements including an older Bruce Wayne, a rundown Gotham City, Gorilla Grodd, and more. All that was accompanied by claims the game would have used <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>'s acclaimed Nemesis System. Additional concept art then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-knight-canned-sequel-apparently-shown-via-concept-art">emerged two years later</a>, offering closer looks at both Bruce and Damien.
</p>
<p>
And now, yet more Project Sabbath concept art has emerged, this time from character artist Rodrigue Pralier, who worked at Warner Bros. Games Montreal circa 2014/2015. Although the Artstation page originally featuring the concepts has now been removed, the images have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/arkhamvideos.bsky.social/post/3ls75vje3d22d">saved for posterity on social media</a>, revealing a further look at Damian Wayne and his beardy pa Bruce, alongside Killer Croc, The Huntress, and more.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> - the title WB Games Montreal switched its attention to after ditching Project Sabbath - did, of course, fail to generate much enthusiasm among critics and fans, and it was followed in 2024 by Arkham Knight studio Rocksteady's Suicide: Kill the Justice League. That proved to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">another Batman-adjacent flop</a> in a year that also saw Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions underperform and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">limp return of Warner's now-cancelled MultiVersus</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the start of this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">several rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">layoffs</a> across its studios - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> boss David Haddad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">departed the company</a>. Just a month later Warner Bros. announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelling Monolith Productions' long-in-the-works Wonder Woman game</a>, closing the studio, and shutting down Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego too. Since then, it's announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">drastic shift in leadership</a> that'll see it refocusing on several core brands, including Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.

            <p>
Promising Minecraft-like sandbox adventure Hytale has been cancelled after a decade of development, and creator Hypixel Studios is "winding down" its operations.
</p>
<p>
Hytale began development in 2015, and was Hypixel's attempt at combining the mini-games found on its hugely popular eponymous Minecraft server - which has been visited by more than 18m visitors since its inception in 2013 - with its own RPG-like, Minecraft-style sandbox experience, built from the ground up. And there's been a lot of buzz around the project for a long time, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games investing millions in Hytale prior to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>. But now the plug has been pulled.
</p>
<p>
Hypixel announced the "incredibly tough news" in a <a href="https://www.hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale">lengthy statement on its website</a>. "This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted," it wrote. "But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn't bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."
</p>
<p>
"Game development is brutally hard - especially when you're trying to build something original that speaks to a creative, passionate community," it continued. "Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn't as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we'd need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game.
</p>
<p>
"We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn't have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve. This is a painful decision. We still believe in Hytale. We believe in the team, and are forever grateful to every member, past or present, who poured their love into the game. We're also incredibly proud of the work we did: the world we imagined, the risks we took, and the heart we poured into this project. None of that can be taken away. And just to clarify - this doesn't affect the Hypixel server on Minecraft. It's run separately from Hypixel Studios and will continue to operate as usual."
</p>
<p>
Hypixel's statement suggests it had attempted to "see if there were investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward", but with no more funding coming from Riot and the project now dead, employees - said to number "100+" on Hypixel's website - are being "supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what's next". Hypixel itself is "beginning the process of winding down... over the next few months".
</p>
<p>
"To our community: thank you," the statement concludes. "Your belief in Hytale kept us going through thick and thin... Even though we're closing this chapter, the spirit of Hytale and everything we hoped it could be will stay with us. We're proud of what we built, and we’ll carry those lessons forward into whatever comes next."
