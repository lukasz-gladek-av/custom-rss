            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has now surpassed $120m in total earnings since its release three weeks ago.</p>
<p>The mobile game reached $100m on 15th November, 17 days after release. This was also its highest-earning day yet, earning $8.2m from player spending according to data from AppMagic (shared by <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-surges-past-100-million-in-17-days/">PocketGamer.biz</a>).</p>
<p>As of 17th November, the game has generated $120.8m. On average, it's made almost $6.4m each day since release.</p>

<p>In its first week, Pokémon TCG Pocket made $35.8m. Then it made a further $48.5m in its second week. For its third week, the game has so far generated $37.2m.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, 42 percent of global spending has been in Japan, with the US in second place generating 28 percent of revenue.</p>
<p>As we previously reported, the game reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">earned $12.1m in its first four days</a>.</p>
<p>However, Pokémon GO had a bigger launch, with $58m earned in its first week. It remains the most popular Pokémon mobile game.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-new-booster-packs-available-before-end-of-year">more will be coming to TCG Pocket soon</a>, with new booster packs due "by the end of the year" and card trading arriving early next year.</p>
<p>It also looks like its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-events-revealed-in-datamine">next events will be Bulbasaur themed</a>, according to a datamine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Developer Blackbird Interactive has detailed its forthcoming final update for Homeworld 3.</p>
<p>This chunky update, which the team describe as being "mothership-sized" with a "gargantuan number" of improvements and such, is set to go live on 21st November.</p>
<p>It will include a combat overhaul, while Blackbird has also completely redone how damage and armour works within the game. In addition, on the multiplayer side of things, the team has significantly increased the difficulty of Standard and Hard AI opponents in Skirmish. This was made following community feedback.</p>

            <p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard's co-directors have discussed BioWare's push to return to its roots in character-focused single-player role-playing games, after its recent struggles with both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a> and Anthem.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/corinne-busche-john-epler-game-directors-dragon-age/id1665581266?i=1000677429520">My Perfect Console</a> podcast, The Veilguard directors Corinne Busche and John Epler said BioWare had been supported by publisher EA in returning to what the studio had always done best, after seeing its focus diluted by chasing industry trends. 
</p>
<p>
"I felt very supported through this by BioWare and EA," Busche said, on Dragon Age: The Veilguard's development. "And I'll tell you, it's intimidating to buck the trends in an era where it feels like almost every game must be an open world. 
</p>
<p>
"It's [being able to say], you know what - that works for those titles. For us, the way in which we tell the best stories and stay true to our roots - a more handcrafted, intimate solution is appropriate. And just to have that support from within, around getting back to those elements we do best, was fantastic."
</p><p>
Epler, a BioWare veteran of 17 years, said that the studio's focus with The Veilguard had been a deliberate push to return to its "very real strength" in character-building and storytelling, after "projects that maybe didn't centre that strength as well as they could have". 
</p>
<p>
"You know, I personally love Mass Effect Andromeda but there was also - we had open-world that was a big thing in the industry at the time and that starts to dilute your focus," Epler said. "We had Anthem - live-service dilutes your focus. 
</p>
<p>
"So for us it was really understanding what it is that people come to the studio to do - they work here for a reason, they want to make big stories that... allow you to be a big hero of your own creation, but also a focus on characters, a focus on that experience of living in a different world. 
</p>
<p>
"For The Veilguard we just wanted to get back to those things that made the studio what it was, that contributed to what I would call the Golden Age of BioWare, when there was hit after hit being turned out. The Veilguard was a very conscious return to that with a focus on characters, storytelling and being just this really bombastic single-player RPG."
</p>
<p>
Dragon Age: The Veilguard had a decade-long on-off development and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-says-next-dragon-age-will-now-be-single-player-only-due-to-anthems-fortunes-reversing-eas-original-plans">at one point was set to include multiplayer elements until EA and BioWare changed tack</a>, resulting in the brilliant single-player RPG that ultimately released last month. 
</p>
<p>Story ideas for the game lasted throughout that time, however, as can be seen in some of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-had-dragon-age-the-veilguards-look-nailed-10-years-ago">Dragon Age: The Veilguard's earliest concept art</a>, which has now been shared online. But perhaps this shouldn't be too surprising? After all, as we found out from Dragon Age creator David Gaider, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">BioWare knew the deepest secrets of Dragon Age lore 20 years ago, and locked it away in an uber-plot document</a>.</p>
<p>
"A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle. This is the best Dragon Age, and perhaps BioWare, has ever been," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.

            <p>Nintendo has added the brilliant soundtrack to N64 classic F-Zero X to its music app.</p>
<p>The high-speed futuristic racer has a pounding electro-rock soundtrack, with courses like Mute City and Big Blue featuring particularly iconic music.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of Dream Chaser, which accompanies the Silence course, those wailing electric guitars matching its intensity of speed.</p>
<p>Still, we need the F-Zero GX on the app next please Nintendo!</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-adds-30-banging-wii-sports-tunes">soundtrack to Wii Sports was added to the app</a>. It's unclear at what cadence Nintendo will be making additions, but if it's weekly then who knows what's next. Can we get Wave Race: Blue Storm too?</p>
<p>Whatever is added, you'll find a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-track-list-every-game-song-system">full list of available game soundtracks in our Nintendo Music app guide</a>.</p>
<p>F-Zero is certainly having a bit of a renaissance at the moment. First there was battle royale F-Zero 99 for Switch Online that's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-99-secret-tracks-private-lobbies-added">regularly updated with new tracks</a> and Satellaview exclusives. Then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-f-zero-game-speeds-on-to-switch-this-week-at-maximum-velocity">Nintendo added Game Boy Advance launch game F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</a> to its Switch Online collection.</p>
<p>Most recently, Nintendo followed that up with two more Game Boy Advance F-Zero games, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-f-zero-games-headed-to-switch-online-including-previously-japan-only-release">Japan-only F-Zero Climax</a>.</p>
<p>Can we dare to dream a new original game could be on the way? Until then, I'd recommend giving <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aero-gpx-is-the-f-zero-gx-sequel-nintendo-wont-make">indie game Aero GPX</a> a go on Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mojang Studios has entered a partnership with theme park operator Merlin Entertainments to introduce real-life Minecraft experiences across the globe, beginning in the UK and US.</p>
<p>Merlin Entertainments - which is also behind tourist hot spots such as Alton Towers and Legoland, to name but two - is investing in excess of £85m in the first two planned Minecraft attractions, marking the company's first global partnership with a gaming brand.</p>

<p>While Merlin and Mojang have not shared specific dates or locations, these "experiences" are expected to launch in the UK and US between 2026 and 2027, and include Minecraft-themed accommodation, along with food, beverages, a themed ride and other "exciting" elements. Following this, Merlin and Mojang will expand this partnership - known as "Adventures Made Real" - further afield.</p>
<p>"This is a significant milestone for Merlin, which reinforces our commitment to reaching new audiences through bold and captivating concepts, and directly supports our ambitions for growth," Scott O'Neil, CEO of Merlin Entertainments, said today.</p>
<p>"Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time, and this world-first will see fans experience its thrill and creativity in real life, at theme parks and city-centre attractions in leading tourist destinations."</p>

<p>"Partnering with Merlin Entertainments is an incredibly exciting step for us at Mojang Studios. Merlin's expertise in creating world-class attractions makes them the perfect partner to help us bring Minecraft to life in new and immersive ways in permanent locations around the globe," Kayleen Walters, vice-president franchise development for gaming at Microsoft, added. Microsoft acquired Mojang and Minecraft back in 2014, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buys-mojang-and-minecraft">deal worth $2.5bn</a>.</p>
<p>"Our vast and diverse community is always looking for new opportunities to explore and engage with Minecraft, and we are thrilled to build touchpoints around the globe that will surprise and delight them," Walters continued. </p>
<p>
"These new real-life Minecraft experiences will not only grow our community but also offer fans many more opportunities to immerse themselves in the world of Minecraft in ways they've never imagined."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Merlin Entertainments</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Along with these upcoming attractions, Minecraft also has a number of other projects in the pipeline, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-gives-first-look-at-block-stars-jason-momoa-and-jack-black-in-action">live-action film starring Jack Black as Steve</a> (see trailer above) and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series.</p>
<p>Netflix will produce this project alongside Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development. While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of Minecraft in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Blimey guvnor! Ubisoft has only gone and slapped a shiny ol' update on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>, that game set in Victorian London.
</p>
<p>
Ahem. First released in 2015, it's something of a surprise to see Syndicate get an update now. But as Assassin's Creed fans are now waiting until February for the upcoming Japan-set Shadows, it's perhaps a good time to give this enjoyable romp a revisit.
</p>
<p>

Nearly a decade on, Syndicate feels a little overlooked in the Assassin's Creed canon, which is a shame. Its release came at a difficult time for the Assassin's Creed franchise overall - a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">the disaster that was Unity</a>, and while work to softly reboot the series with Origins had already begun.
</p>
<p>
But Syndicate has some great moments, the Frye Twins' co-protagonist mechanic works well, and it hosts a beautiful rendition of London (Big Ben! Leaping between boats on the Thames! A moving steam train hideout!). </p>
<p>
  If you're yet to give it a go, it's a refreshing change from the hardboiled history of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> or the melodrama of Unity. It's also the first time Ubisoft Quebec (the studio behind the upcoming Shadows, as well as the Ancient Greek-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>) got to spearhead a full game for itself.
</p>
<p>
"Syndicate moves Assassin's Creed forward with a solid new adventure, a beautiful London playground and a renewed sense of fun," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-syndicate-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Syndicate review</a>. Cor!

            <p>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka would love to see a similar remake for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vi">Final Fantasy 6</a>, though there are no "concrete plans".</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dragon-quest-3-remake-interview-hd-2d-final-fantasy-vi">Inverse</a>, Hayasaka discussed the popularity of the HD-2D visual style and whether he'd like to see any other games be remade in this way.</p>
<p>"It’s not that we have concrete plans for this, but personally I would have to say Final Fantasy 6," he said. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> - the first HD-2D title - was developed while referencing FF 6, as it had the highest quality pixel art. I would love to see how the game we referenced would look with the HD-2D art style."</p>

<p>He continued: "Because this art style itself was created while referencing such titles, it’s highly compatible with games originally made using pixel art. This compatibility is probably why people feel this style is a match made in heaven with these types of remakes."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 6 would certainly be a popular choice for a remake in this style, alongside the iconic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>. In fact, last year an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/3d-artist-recreates-chrono-trigger-in-hd-2d-style">artist created a HD-2D concept of Chrono Trigger</a> that proved popular on social media.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 6 is already available on modern platforms as part of the Pixel Remaster collection.</p>
<p>Hayasaka also discussed some of the difficulties of remaking classics in HD-2D, comparing the first teaser for Dragon Quest 3 released three years ago to the final product released last week.</p>
<p>"I’m sure you will find everything to be different, from the map size to the characters’ body proportions," he said. "We get asked why things took so long since the first announcement, but the fact that we needed this much time speaks to how intensely involved the process of applying HD-2D graphics to Dragon Quest 3 truly was.</p><p>"Some say that because HD-2D is pixel-based and this game is a remake, it should be easier to produce, but that is far from the truth! In my opinion, this style requires a higher level of artistic sensibility, and a remake faces more project-level limitations compared to a brand-new title, making the difficulty extremely high. After all, the expectations from the fans of the original game are a monumental hurdle we must work hard to meet."</p>
<p>"The HD-2D overhaul is stunning," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review">Eurogamer Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake review</a>.</p>
<p>"Blocky sprites are replaced by ones with much higher detail, and they're placed on 3D backgrounds with a camera tilt that still retains the proportions of the old sprite style. It looks exactly how you remember old games felt to play - the goggles of nostalgia made real - only everything's a little smoother now thanks to its new autosave, a greater number of places to save more generally, objective markers to help direct you, and an easier way to teleport between visited locations."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Kadokawa buyout would also include Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership studio.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
PlayStation maker Sony is currently in talks that would likely see it acquire a controlling stake in FromSoftware, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, Dark Souls and Bloodbourne, as part of a buyout of its owner, the Japanese publishing giant Kadokawa.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/">Reuters</a> report which claims a deal could be signed in weeks, via sources with knowledge of discussions between the two companies. Both Sony and Kadokawa declined to comment on that report.
</p>
<p>
Launched in 2022, Elden Ring has now sold more than 25m copies worldwide.
</p>
<p>
Sony already owns a 14 percent stake in FromSoftware, and already has ownership of both the Bloodborne and Demon Souls franchises. FromSoftware, meanwhile, owns the rights to Elden Ring and Sekiro.</p>
<p>This deal would likely result in PlayStation gaining the 69.6 percent stake in FromSoftware that Kadokawa holds, meaning it would hold a commanding 84 percent of the company. (Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> currently owns the remaining 16 percent.)
</p>
<p>
Kadokawa owns various other studios, too. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and Tenchu developer Acquire, which recently developed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> for Nintendo Switch, Shiren the Wanderer studio Spike Chunsoft and RPG Maker developer Gotcha Gotcha Games.
</p>
<p>
Outside of video games, Kadokawa is also a huge name in anime and manga, and would be a significant addition to Sony's existing portfolio that includes Crunchyroll and Funimation. 
</p>
<p>
PlayStation's other recent purchases include UK studio Firesprite, plus Housemarque and Nixxes, all in 2021. Most recently, Sony bought the Jade Raymond-founded startup Haven Studios in 2022, currently working on Fairgame$.
