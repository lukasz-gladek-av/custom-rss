            <p>
BioWare suffered from friction between its Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> teams, a former developer has claimed. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Dragon Age creator and former lead writer David Gaider has discussed his experiences at the studio prior to his departure in 2016, and said that staff working on the studio's two biggest franchises "didn't get along".
</p>
<p>
This was something Gaider said he experienced personally when he moved across to join the main Mass Effect team as they worked on the ill-fated Anthem, after completing work on the original Mass Effect trilogy.
</p>
<p>
"For a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the Dragon Age team and the Mass Effect team," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lmqqa5tm4s2p">Gaider wrote</a>. "Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn't get along.
</p>
<p>
"The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often. Yet this didn't really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the [Anthem] team. The team didn't want me there. At all."
</p>
<p>
Gaider says he had been specifically asked by BioWare management to write a science fantasy story for Anthem, after the project had initially been concepted as a "hard sci-fi setting" akin to Aliens. And while Gaider says he was just following orders, his new colleagues were seemingly unaware of why he was writing something they thought was "too Dragon Age".
</p>
<p>
"I kept getting feedback about how it was 'too Dragon Age' and how everything I wrote or planned was 'too Dragon Age'... the implication being that *anything* like Dragon Age was bad," Gaider continued. "And yet this was a team where I was required to accept and act on all feedback, so I ended up iterating CONSTANTLY."
</p>
<p>
"I won't go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn't want to make an RPG. Were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare quality story without giving me any of the tools I'd need to actually do that."
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Gaider departed BioWare after 17 years following a failed attempt to bargain for a creative director position on another project after Anthem, and some "blunter words" on 
the likelihood of him having success outside the company if he did quit.
</p>
<p>
"I had no idea where I was going to go or what I was going to do, but I wanted OUT," Gaider concluded.
</p>
<p>
Since departing BioWare, Gaider has gone on to developer Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical at new outfit Summerfall Studios, which launched to a generally positive response in 2023. The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creators-stray-gods-studio-unveils-demonic-deckbuilder-malys">next project will be a demonic deckbuilder called Malys</a>.
</p>
<p>
BioWare continued work on Anthem for several years, though the project ultimately launched as a critical and commercial failure. The studio subsequently released the well-received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> in 2021, followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which garnered positive reviews but lacklustre sales. 
</p>
<p>
A newly-slimmed down BioWare is now working solely on the next Mass Effect, first announced back in December 2020.

            <p>Cinemas have begun playing a short video ahead of A Minecraft Movie screenings, asking viewers to refrain from hurling their popcorn everywhere, and to be kind and respectful to others.</p>
<p>If you are wondering why this is necessary, it is because a viral trend has seen some younger viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">screaming out loud mid-film while launching their popcorn into the air when Jack Black's character Steve shouts "chicken jockey"</a>, as Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison gets ready to fight a baby zombie riding on the back of a chicken.</p>
<p>While this trend perhaps started off as a bit of fun, it has quickly become increasingly disruptive, with one absolute idiot even bringing a live chicken into the cinema.</p>

<p>While cinemas and Black seem to be keen to put an end to the disruptive behaviour, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-director-defends-popcorn-throwing-chicken-jockey-chaos-says-viewers-just-having-a-true-party">A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess doesn't sound too fussed</a>.

<p>"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."</p>

            <p>
US president Donald Trump has effectively backtracked on the tariff exemptions announced last Friday which indicated that some electronics, like PCs, would escape the country's 145 percent levy on Chinese goods.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media last night, Trump said that "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'" and that "there was no Tariff 'exception' announced on Friday" (thanks, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62z54gwd22o">BBC News</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Chinese electrical goods would simply now be placed in "a different tariff bucket", Trump continued, concluding that National Security Tarriff Investigations would be reviewing "the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN".
</p>
<p>
US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told ABC News that a separate "semiconductor tariff" was now planned - exact details of which are yet to be determined. 
</p>
<p>"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels, we need to have these things made in America," Lutnick <a href="https://twitter.com/howardlutnick/status/1911439638062842356">said</a>. "We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us."</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamieson-greer-trade-representative-trump-face-the-nation-transcript-04-13-2025/">CBS News</a>, US trade representative Jamieson Greer confirmed this semiconductor tariff meant Chinese electrical goods had therefore been given something that was "not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it."
</p>
<p>
"It's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring," Greer continued. "They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs."
</p>
<p>There's no detail yet on when this semiconductor tariff may be introduced, or by how much it will impact prices.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pcs-will-be-exempt-from-trumps-tariffs-but-consoles-will-not">the expectation was that PCs would escape Trump's tariffs, even if consoles such as Nintendo's incoming Switch 2 would not</a>. 
</p>
<p>Ahead of the US' so-called 'Liberation Day', <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">Nintendo had already begun stockpiling Switch 2 consoles in the US, and directed the vast majority of its non-Chinese manufacturing output to the country</a>. Many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> consoles set to be sold in the US will now have been made in Vietnam - a country which also initially had tariffs introduced, only for them to be paused.</p>
<p>This morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony announced it had raised the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition price</a> in the UK and mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>That's according to game director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>, speaking during a recent <a href="https://x.com/koji10_tbs">Koji Pro radio broadcast</a>, who said the upcoming sequel will have a feature that allows players to skip boss battles if they prove to be too difficult.</p>

<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a>, who translated, explained on social media.</p>
<p>According to Genki_JPN, if players choose to clear any of Death Stranding 2's bosses this way, they will still receive information about the foe, which will be presented "like a novel" via an image and text descriptions.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is set for release on 26th June, and includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">a new character that looks remarkably like Metal Gear Solid's Snake</a>. This was revealed during the game's SXSW 2025 showcase earlier in March.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, Kojima Productions shared several new snippets of footage for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">including a look at the upcoming game's very realistic photo mode and Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion, Dollman</a>. As you would expect from a Kojima game, it all looks suitably bizarre.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, earlier this month it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">Death Stranding's live-action movie adaptation had found its writer and director</a> in the form of A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
