            <p>Joining the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">upcoming rush of summer's various showcases and reveals</a> is PlayStation, which has announced its next State of Play.</p>
<p>Those interested in finding out more about what Sony has been cooking up behind the scenes will be able to tune in tomorrow, 4th June, at 10pm UK time. That's 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST.</p>
<p>While the team is remaining coy about what will be shown - this isn't a game specific State of Play a la <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">April's Borderlands 4 showcase</a> - there should be plenty to whet appetites for the coming months.</p>

<p>"Watch live for news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5. The show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe," reads an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">accompanying PlayStation blog post</a>. The show will last for "40+" minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a chance we will hear more about the PS5's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, which is set for release on 2nd October. Developer Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so maybe we will get a taste of that later this week.</p>
<p>The PS5 exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> will also likely be part of the upcoming State of Play even if it is more of a brief teaser rather than anything too chonky, given that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Kojima Productions is hosting its own dedicated On the Beach showcase this coming Sunday</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">a Wolverine release date, perhaps</a>?</p>

            <p>Activision has claimed advertisements for microtransactions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> players were seeing on their loadouts were added by mistake, following intense community fallout.</p>
<p>This announcement came from <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291">the official Call of Duty Twitter account</a>, which posted, "A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game."</p>
<p>Reactions to this post aren't exactly glowing in positivity. Twitter users expressed their disbelief in the statement, unconvinced that a feature like loadout ads were accidentally implemented, rather they were pulled down following negative feedback. <a href="https://x.com/ProRebornYT/status/1929756558348767663">One user wrote</a>, "this some soviet era level gaslighting".</p>

<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-shows-you-microtransaction-ads-when-you-swap-weapons">controversial addition at the weekend came alongside the game's fourth season</a>, and essentially meant that every time you swapped weapons you'd see a billboard-style poster shilling a premium skin. This, as you can imagine, went down like a lead balloon among the Call of Duty community, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kylh9d/comment/muy8exa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">with one player on Reddit writing</a>, "actively witnessing call of duty become the krusty krab".</p>
<p>The Season 4 update also brought with it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-season-delayed-verdansk-return-now-expected-next-month">the returning Verdansk map to Warzone</a>, widely believed to be the best map the game has ever had, with a variety of new additions to mix things up for older players.</p>
<p>At the same time, Activision continues its years-long struggle against cheaters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">recently allowing players to turn off crossplay in order to help avoid cheaters</a>, a nasty group of ne'er-do-wells Activision admits are most prominently found on PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
