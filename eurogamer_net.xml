            <p>I have some <em>Fantastic</em> news <em>Four </em>you (it's Monday, let me have this one). At the end of the week, the Fantastic Four will be making their debut in the free-to-play hero PvP shooter, Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>The heroic team - which comprises Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch and the Thing - will be arriving in the game as part of the first season, known as Eternal Night Falls, which has a vampiric flavour to it.</p>

<p>"Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages. Dracula and Doctor Doom disrupt the moon's orbit, plunging the city into eternal night and unleashing an army of vampiric creatures," reads the official blurb.</p><p>"With the world on the brink, the Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals!"</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals' first season kicks off at 1am PST on Friday, 10th January. That's 9am for those of us in the UK.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-opening-weekend-sees-10m-players-join-in">Marvel Rivals has proven incredibly popular</a> since its launch. Its opening weekend saw 10 million players join online to take part in the fray.</p>
<p>"NetEase's spin on the hero battler is complex and moreish, but rarely much actual fun," our Chris wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-review">Eurogamer's Marvel Rivals review</a>. "Its biggest impact is a renewed appreciation for the rivals that do it better." He awarded it two out of five stars. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-claims-2025-as-the-year-of-eevee<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
2025 will be the Year of Eevee, according to the Pokémon Company. 
</p>
<p>
Branding showing <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/year-of-eevee">Pokémon's Year of Eevee</a> is now live on the franchise's Pokémon Center site, alongside an array of merchandise featuring the cute creature and its many evolutions including plushies and action figures. 
</p>
<p>
The gimmick follows Nintendo previously declaring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-nintendos-year-of-luigi-continues-until-18th-march">2014 to be the Year of Luigi</a>, and Sega last year dubbing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">2024 to be the Year of Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.
</p>
<p>
On the surface, the Year of Eevee seems to be just a merchandise range, but the Pokémon Center often taps into themes for the coming year with merchandise that ties into the wider franchise.

<p>
So, what's in store for Pokémon fans this Year of Eevee? So far, all we know of 2025 is that it will see the launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the next mainline Pokémon game that will return to Kalos, the region based on Paris first seen in Pokémon X and Y. (And hey, that's where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fest-2025-to-be-held-in-paris">being held this year</a>! How's that for brand synergy?)
</p><p>
Could the Year of Eevee finally see a new Eevee evolution announced, perhaps set to debut in Pokémon Legends: Z-A? It's now been 12 years since Eevee's eighth evolution option - the Fairy-type Sylveon - was announced, and fans have long hoped for more. A Dragon-type Eeveelution, perhaps? Or how about a Ghost-type?
</p>
<p>And what else could be on the way? C'mon, Pokémon - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">Sega gave Shadow a movie</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
