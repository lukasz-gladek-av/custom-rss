            <p>As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs.</p>
<p>Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about "why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat" and discussed "whether or not games treat [violence] as the default".</p>

<p>Acknowledging he's had "pushback on similar answers in the past", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: "The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it".</p>
<p>"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games.</p>
<p>"This is <em>obvious</em>. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take <em>just</em> as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars," he added.</p>
<p>And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a "drop in the bucket", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, "those drops become a storm and companies will listen".</p>
<p>"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent," he added. "It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.</p><p>"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?" Cain said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-co-creator-tim-cain-says-violence-will-be-the-default-in-aaa-rpgs-as-long-as-we-keep-buying-it-companies-dont-make-them-because-they-feel-like-it-they-make-them-because-they-sell/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!"</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> fans think they've spotted a clue that the series' signature morality system may be making a comeback in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst developer BioWare has confirmed nothing either way - which means we can only take this with a healthy bucket of salt for now - fans like X user Kalaelizabeth believe they've spotted a sneaky nod to Mass Effect's Paragon/Renegade system hiding in plain sight.</p>

<p>Take the post embedded below, which includes an <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1722012172166025591">official promotional image</a> of the next Mass Effect game that, at first glance, may not be telling us very much at all.</p>
<p>Look a little closer, though, and you can see why fans are drawing the conclusions they are. Regardless of whether or not you believe the image is sneakily acknowledging the morality system is making a return, it's a curious image for BioWare to have shared, especially when super-imposed by the iconic Paragon symbol:</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The flames of speculation have been further fanned by the post Kalaelizabeth was quoting.  BioWare project director and executive producer Michael Gamble recently commented on the series' long-held morality mechanic, acknowledging that although more players opted to be a Paragon - that is, a "good" Shepard - in the original trilogy, how you play is "meaningless" unless the ability to be "bad" also exists.</p>
<p>"Regarding Renegade and Paragon - yes, it‚Äôs true that more people played Paragon. But, it would have been meaningless if Renegade had not existed. The ability to choose is stronger than the number of people playing any option, IMO," Gamble tweeted (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-5-paragon-renegade-options-return-not-confirmed/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Does all of this mean Paragon/Renegade is "absolutely returning" for Mass Effect 5? Absolutely not. But it's arguably one of the best interpretations we've had yet as to why BioWare teased such an interesting image...</p>
<p>As for the eagerly-anticipated Mass Effect TV show? An adaptation was first touted back in 2021, when former BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained various factors had contributed to the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-explains-why-the-mass-effect-movie-fell-by-the-wayside">shifting its initial vision of a movie adaptation toward something for the smaller screen</a>. Later that same year, reports surfaced claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">Amazon was "nearing a deal" for a Mass Effect TV series</a>, as part of its ongoing push into sci-fi and fantasy storytelling.</p><p>And now those reports have been confirmed. Variety revealed on the most recent N7 day - 7th November 2024 - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">a Mass Effect TV series is now officially in development at Amazon</a>, with 10 Cloverfield Lane and Fast &amp; Furious 9 (AKA F9: The Fast Saga) scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Markus "Notch" Persson has "basically announced" Minecraft 2.</p>
<p>In an X exchange over the New Year, Persson invited his millions of followers to indicate which project they'd like him to focus on in 2025 - a traditional roguelike mixed with a "tile-based first-person dungeon crawler" or a "spiritual successor" to Minecraft.</p>

<p>In the post asking for "honest and legitimate [...] feedback for once", Persson explained briefly what his dungeon crawler would entail, but then admitted, "but then I gots to thinking that maybe there are people who like my work but might not share my taste in retro nostalgia and would prefer for me to make a spiritual successor thing to Minecraft, and I mean sure, I'd take that cash".</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Honest and legitimate request for feedback for once:</p><p>The new game I'm passionately working on is currently set to be a traditional roguelike (i.e. ADOM, nethack, etc) mixed with a tile based first person dungeon crawler (ie Legend of Grimrock (esp 2), Eye of the Beholder)</p><p>But‚Ä¶</p></div>‚Äî notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>At the time of writing, almost a quarter of a million of his followers have left a vote, 78 percent of which have, perhaps unsurprisingly, been in favour of a new Minecraft game, even though he'd asked people to "[please] vote potion. You can do this Zoomers, it's actually super cosy.</p>

</p></div>
<p>A few days later, responding to commenters who missed his original posting, Persson summarised what had happened, saying: "I basically announced Minecraft 2. I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</p>
<p>"I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</p><p>"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic," he added. "The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for.</p>
<p>"I intend for the money to the [sic] spent for good, but my God, have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed."</p>
<p>Persson <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532193227473093">added</a> that he had no non-compete clause in the sale of Minecraft to Microsoft - "there was a one-year period where I couldn't make a game with modifiable terrain or something like that, but I was off in the Maldives during all that, didn't affect any creative decisions" - but did acknowledge that using the Minecraft name "would be super illegal".</p>
<p>"Instead, I'd make a new original game of the same type as Minecraft and call it something else," he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874523772734390380">said</a>. "These are traditionally sometimes referred to as 'spiritual successors', but usually kinda mostly feel a bit flat.</p>
<p>"But, like, if that's actually what people want, I would LOVE to make that game. It'd be my Gremlins 2."</p>
<p>Persson also said that as "a man of [his] word", he intended "to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about".</p>
<p>"And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me," he added.</p>
<p>It's been a busy time for Minecraft. At the end of last year, the game finally received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-after-ps5s-launch-minecraft-finally-gets-a-native-version">PlayStation 5 native version</a>, announced it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ditching-psvr-support-minecraft-is-officially-abandoning-vr-on-pc-from-next-year">ditch PC VR support</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-attractions-set-to-open-in-uk-and-us-as-85m-deal-with-alton-towers-owner-signed">plans to launch Minecraft theme park areas in the US and UK</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> co-founder Andrew Gavin has opened up about why the studio was acquired by Sony back in 2001.</p>
<p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/">LinkedIn</a>, Gavin cited the spiralling costs of game development as one of the reasons the studio was sold, saying "a systemic issue in the AAA space" wherein developers "almost never have the resources to fund their own games [...] gives publishers enormous leverage".</p>

<p>"Why did we sell Naughty Dog? It's a question I've been asked countless times. The answer is simple: budgets were skyrocketing," Gavin - who worked at Naughty Dog for almost 20 years before leaving in 2004 - said (via <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/522635/article/naughty-dog-co-founder-reveals-why-they-were-acquired-by-sony/">Gameranx</a>).</p><p>"When we started Naughty Dog in the 1980s, game development expenses were manageable. We bootstrapped everything, pouring profits from one game into the next. Our early 80s games cost less than $50,000 each to make. Rings of Power ('88-91), saw budgets rise to about $100,000, but yielded slightly more than that in after tax profits in 1992.</p>
<p>"In 1993, we rolled that $100k from Rings into a self-funded Way of the Warrior. But Crash Bandicoot ('94-96) cost $1.6 million to make. By the time we got to Jak and Daxter ('99-01), the budget busted the $15 million mark.</p>
<p>"By 2004, the cost of AAA games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jak-3">Jak 3</a> had soared to $45-50 million - and they have been rising ever since," Gavin added. "But back in 2000, we were still self-funding every project, and the stress of financing these ballooning budgets independently was enormous.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just us. This was (and still is) a systemic issue in the AAA space. Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage. Selling to Sony wasn't just about securing a financial future for Naughty Dog. It was about giving the studio the resources to keep making the best games possible, without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralysing fear that one slip would ruin it all.</p>
<p>"Looking back, it was the right call."</p>
<p>Gavin ended by admitting that "AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then", citing costs for today's big-budget games "easily" top "$300, $400, or even $500 million".</p>
<p>"Would we have been able to keep up? Maybe. But selling - to the right party - gave Naughty Dog the stability it needed to thrive and to continue making the kinds of games we'd always dreamed of!"</p>
<p>Several months after studio lead Neil Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, the team has lifted the lid on its next, all-new title: Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for PS5.</p>
<p>"Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria ‚Äì a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," teases the blurb.</p>
<p>"Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit," reads the game's official blurb."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> Nightreign will not include the game's signature in-game messaging system because there will be "no time" to read or write messages.</p>
<p>Whilst Nightreign's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">announcement trailer</a> featured plenty of familiar elements like sites of grace and Evergaols - as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">enemies from Dark Souls</a> like The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> - Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed the studio is pulling its in-game communication because with sessions around 40-minutes long, there simply isn't any time to waste.</p>

<p>"You can still see the ghosts of other players, but the ability to leave messages has been removed," Ishizaki told <a href="https://jp.ign.com/elden-ring-nightreign/77870/interview/elden-ring-nightreign-403rpg">IGN Japan</a> via machine translation.</p>
<p>"The reason we removed the message feature is that in this game, where each session is about 40 minutes long, there is no time to write your own message, and no time to read messages written by others."</p>
<p>"The concept was to make a 'condensed RPG'. RPGs have their ups and downs, and players sometimes gain and sometimes lose," Ishizaki added. "I think the best part of RPGs is that all of these experiences ultimately come to fruition. In order to create a harmonious experience that allows players to experience the true essence of RPGs, each game took place over three days."</p><p>Interestingly, this means defeated foes will not revive during the match - not even when you rest at a site of grace - and although ashes will make an appearance in Nightreign, how they're "handled" will differ from the original Elden Ring game.</p>
<p>The interview also revealed that Miyazaki was involved "up until the creation of the initial concept" for Nightreign, but he has since stepped aside for the new director, who has been at FromSoft since 2011.</p>
<p>"Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign is a very exciting game that will excite players," Ishizaki concluded. "It will provide a sense of accomplishment and joy that is different from previous titles, so please look forward to it."</p>
<p>ICYMI, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
