            <p>A collection of Japanese publishers including Bandai Namco, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and others have come together as part of CODA (Content Overseas Distribution Association) to request Open AI cease training AI video generation tool Sora 2 on their collective creative works.</p>
<p>The statement to Open AI, <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">made public via a statement published on the CODA website</a>, state that CODA, requests that CODA members works are not used for machine learning without prior permission, and that Open AI responds sincerely to claims and inquires from CODA members regarding copyright infringement related to Sora 2's output.</p>
<p>The statement also mentions Sora 2's opt out policy, that being that copyrighted works will be used by Sora 2 unless copyright owners specifically opt out themselves. Coda emphasises that this goes against Japanese copyright infringement laws in which permission is required beforehand. Coda also noted that: "there is no system allowing one to avoid liability for infringement through subsequent objections."</p>

<p>Coda is a substantial organisation in Japan that is responsible for copyright protection through combating piracy, as well as the legal worldwide distribution of Japanese video games, movies, music, T.V, and animation. It has a wide variety of members, including companies like Bandai Namco, Cygames, Toei, Square Enix, and more.</p><p>Coda is among many with serious copyright concerns in regard to AI models such as Sora 2. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y4jpg922qo">AI company Anthropic agreed to pay $1.5bn to authors to settle a copyright lawsuit earlier this year</a>, while a wide variety of ongoing lawsuits are currently in the works (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-copyright-case-tracker/">all of which can be tracked on this handy Wired article</a>)</p>

            <p>It's been a long-running mystery why Rockstar's PlayStation-exclusive spy game Agent never materialised. It was announced with much fanfare in 2007, then proceeded to never show up again. But Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has finally provided an adequate answer. Simply put, he and Rockstar couldn't find a way to make an open-world spy game work.</p>
<p>"We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game and it never came together," <a href="https://youtu.be/o3gbXDjNWyI?si=Sd4dXzJqaE1DVzWD">Houser told Lex Fridman in a rare and revealing podcast</a> interview. Houser said there were roughly five different iterations of Agent, including one set in the 1970s Cold War era and another set in the modern day.</p>
<p>But wherever and whenever Rockstar tried setting Agent, it couldn't make the idea of an open-world spy game work. "I don't think it works," Houser said. "I concluded - and I keep thinking about it; sometimes I lie in bed thinking about it - that what makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games.</p>

"You've got to go here to save the world, you've got to go there and stop that person being killed <em>and then </em>save the world... And an open-world game does have moments like that when the story comes together, but for large portions it's a lot looser and you're just hanging out and doing what you want."</p><p>What makes the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption games work so well as open worlds is their in-between time - the time you have to cruise around, either on a horseback or in a car, listening to the radio or watching the world go by. In those games, you do your own thing. "That's why it works well being a criminal: because you fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to do," Houser said.</p>
<p>The minute you put that into a spy game, however, you slacken the line of tension you need running through the spy framework to give missions jeopardy. "As a spy that doesn't really work because you have to be against the clock," Houser said. It's a fundamental issue - one Rockstar couldn't overcome. "For me, I question whether you can make a good open-world spy game," he said.</p>
<p>It's a question I'm sure Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has had to reckon with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">while plotting blockbuster James Bond game 007: First Light</a>, though IOI's expertise is not in open worlds but sandbox mission approaches. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-rockstar-north-dev-talks-agent-abandoned-zombie-game-in-fascinating-new-blog">Agent apparently began life as a demo for the Grand Theft Auto 4 engine</a>, a Rockstar developer revealed a couple of years ago, and it showcased a hang glider and a car that turned into a submarine. A fuller, more linear game was then apparently green-lit, which would take us to classic spy movie locations such as the French Riviera, a Swiss ski resort, and Cairo. And the story would culminate with a big shootout with lasers in space. That idea was apparently in development for a year and a downhill skiing section was developed, but the game didn't get much further. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-has-abandoned-its-agent-trademark">Rockstar eventually abandoned its trademark for Agent in 2018</a>.</p>

            <p>The Simpsons has a long running couch gag bit, which plays out during the show's title sequence. Sometimes this sees America's yellow cartoon family taking part in a group dance or being abducted by aliens.  There are also times when the fivesome are surprised by some unexpected visitors already plopped down in front of the TV, leaving Homer and co with nowhere to park their own rears. </p>
<p>And, that is exactly what has happened in the latest episode of The Simpsons, this time with familiar faces from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> taking a seat at 742 Evergreen Terrace.</p>

<p>During the opening sequence of The Simpsons' season 37 episode 5 - known as Bad Boys... For Life? - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie all arrive at home to find the likes of Fishstick there. Not a family to take this intrusion lightly, the Simpsons proceed to draw some weapons on the Fortnite lot and, errrr… let Peely know who is boss.</p>
<p>You can check out this Fortnite-flavoured The Simpsons couch gag below.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time The Simpsons has given a nod to video games. Last year, during season 35 (I still can't quite believe how long this show has been going for), we got a Mario Kart parody, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-simpsons-mario-kart-parody-is-the-closest-weve-got-to-a-hit-run-sequel">complete with a moustachiod Lisa and a Bowser-esque Nelson</a>.</p>
<p>As for the here and now, this opening is a timely addition to the show's lineup, with Fortnite itself hosting a The Simpsons season.</p>
