            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating its guidelines will be subjected to varying limited-time bans, with even indefinitely suspendees able to reapply for their accounts to be reinstatement after six months.</p>
<p>This means even streamers with multiple infringements merely have to wait for the violations to "drop off [their] account". Providing you don't reoffend in a set period, your account will be reset to "good standing", as though the original violation never happened.</p>

<p>Higher-severity violations - such as ones for hateful conduct - could remain on an account longer, such as a couple of years. But players caught cheating in games whilst streaming via Twitch are now deem "low severity" will only face a 24-hour suspension from the service.</p>
<p>"Starting today, most violations will expire and drop off of your account after a set amount of time," Twitch <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US">explained</a>. "You will be able to track when they expire in the Appeals Portal, and this information will also be in the enforcement emails that you receive.</p>
<p>"Most violations committed tend to be low severity (such as cheating in online games) and will expire in 90 days. However, higher-severity violations (such as hateful conduct) will remain on an account longer, and will expire in 1 or 2 years.</p>
<p>"The most severe harms will still result in immediate indefinite suspensions. If you are indefinitely suspended due to accumulating multiple violations within a short time period, you are able to apply for reinstatement after 6 months."</p>
<p>Twitch believes "escalating consequences" will "hold users accountable for repeated harmful behaviour", defining harm as "including actions that lead to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a community member, to Twitch, or to society".</p>
<p>If your account was previously indefinitely suspended it will remain so despite these changes, Twitch stressed, although in those instances, users can apply for reinstatement (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">Insider Gaming</a>).</p>
<p>In November, just ahead of the US elections, Twitch tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues". However, after a vocal backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streams-about-political-and-sensitive-issues-including-reproductive-and-lgbtq-rights-now-require-a-label">Twitch clarified that labels would not apply if a streamer is discussing their "lived experience"</a>, or if discussion of these topics isn't the "focus" of the stream.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The pace of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> US sales has "fallen behind" that of the PS4 Pro.</p>
<p>That's according to games industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who used Circana data to conclude that whilst the PS5 Pro enjoyed a solid start, January 2025's hardware spend in the US was 45 percent lower when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>

<p>In fact, Piscatella posits that there was "double-digit percentage declines" across all major console platforms compared to a year ago, with PS5 hardware spend dipping by 38 percent year-on-year, Xbox Series declining by 50 percent, and Switch 53 percent.</p>
<p>The latter, however, may be as a result of players holding off for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as part of its financial report to investors, Sony confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">sales of its PS5 console have reached 75m units</a>, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>

<p>Digital SKUs accounted for 49% of PS5 HW units in Jan and 88% of XBS units.</p>â€” Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">@matpiscatella.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3liozdg5zng2w?ref_src=embed">February 21, 2025 at 2:29 PM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p>
<p>However, Sony deviated from the norm and chose not to separate console sales in this report, so we're no longer able to disaggregate PS5 Pro sales from the base console. This makes it difficult to ascertain if the PS5 Pro's eye-watering cost of admission has put off players who would typically update their hardware mid-generation.</p>
<p>That said, PlayStation 5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month in terms of both units sold and dollars generated. Xbox Series was second in hardware spending, although the Nintendo Switch edged out Xbox Series in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no comparative sales data for PS5 in the UK or Europe.</p>
<p>Back in November, Sony said that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-price-has-not-had-a-negative-impact-on-sales-says-sony-boss">the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on PS5 Pro sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Good news, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s genre-defining voice recognition feature is coming to consoles.</p>
<p>Although PC players have long been able to experience the horror game with the added stress of voice recognition, the October console release shipped initially without the feature.</p>

<p>Now, however, Kinetic said the feature is ready to go on both PS5 and Xbox consoles, enabling console players to try out the voice prompts for equipment like the Spirit Box and Ouija Board, as well as Monkey Paw.</p>
<p>The delay of some of Phasmo's fan-favourite equipment and tools hasn't put console players off, however - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-marks-22m-total-sales-with-its-2025-roadmap-and-changes-to-maps-kit-and-our-humble-journal">the ghost-hunting sim has sold two million copies on console</a> since it came out of early access last October, bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million.</p>

            <p>NetEase is reportedly pulling back on its international game investments.</p>
<p>The Chinese megacorp's backtrack commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>, but now <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">Game File</a> reports the company is "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios" in the hope of divestiture.</p>

<p>Sources talking to Game File under the promise of anonymity claim NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams. If they can't secure a buyer, studios like Quantic Dream and Grasshopper Manufacture could face closure.</p>
<p>Other studios at risk include Anchor Point, GPTRACK50, Jackalyptic Games, Nagoshi, Pincool, Rebel Wolves, Skybox Labs, Studio Flare, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, and more.</p>
<p>NetEase declined to comment formally but told Game File: "All studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation, and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Matt reported that Marvel Rivals - which has been a huge success for publisher NetEase since its launch last year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-was-reportedly-almost-cancelled-at-one-point-because-netease-objected-to-paying-disney">reportedly almost didn't make it to release</a> as its CEO objected to paying Disney for the use of its characters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
