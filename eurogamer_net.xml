<p>"The Game Awards aims to recognise the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content‚Äôs release," the website now says. "Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination.</p>
<p>"Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration."</p>
<p>This now means that remakes like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> could be in contention, as well as DLC like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. Elden Ring won the TGA Game of the Year award in 2022.</p>
<p>It also means games with seasonal content like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, Destiny, and other live-service games are also eligible, even if the base game itself released several years ago.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">Baldur's Gate 3 secured the top award</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> snapping up several awards, too. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2023-has-broken-its-own-viewership-record-with-118m-livestreams">The Game Awards 2023 broke its own viewership record</a>, clocking up around 118 million livestreams.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> players are calling on Konami to address the technical issues still plaguing the game on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> ten days on from the console's release.</p>
<p>Despite plenty of comments on Silent Hill 2 Remake's social media posts, as yet there's been no formal word from either developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> or publisher Konami on whether or not a fix is even on the way, let alone when it will be released.</p>

<p>In a reddit post entitled "Konami is completely silent", a player shared a screenshot showing a number of Silent Hill fans asking for an update.</p>
<p>"Finished downloading, fired it up, bathroom cinematic plays through, walk out the bathroom and I immediately knew something was off without even seeing gameplay previously or even playing the game before this. That's how bad this is," lamented the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gt33js/comment/lxj60bn/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">poster</a>.</p>

</span></p><p>"I can't even bring myself to play it in this state because it's so distracting. I feel like even if I did play the game in this state it would just get worse throughout the game and I would be even more pissed off. So 70 bucks down the drain because it still hasn't been fixed yet. I feel like I am gonna get to play this game after the holidays at the rate Konami and Bloober are going at this point‚Ä¶"</p> <div>

<p>Another player, responding to a tweet asking for players to share their favourite Silent Hill 2 Remake screenshots said: "I'd share some screenshots but it's very poor on PS5 pro‚Ä¶ drop the patch FFS".</p>
<p>Another simply said that if the studio wasn't "going to provide a PSSR update, just fix the flickering issue".</p> <div>

<p>"It's really scummy to advertise a game as Pro Enhanced when it actually plays worse than the base unit," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gt33js/comment/lxjave0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> another.</p>
<p>"Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer's Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>, awarding the game an impressive five out of five stars in the process.</p><p>Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 remake has already sold a total of 1m copies</a> across both physical and digital media since its global launch on 8th October. That likely makes Silent Hill 2 Remake the best-selling Silent Hill game ever.</p>
<p>One clever reddit user recently figured out a hidden message tucked within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team">Silent Hill 2 Remake by using the mysterious photos found in the game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
