            <p>
The slow swell of Nintendo Switch Online's N64 library continues with a brand-new addition for Expansion Pack subscribers: developer Rare's much-loved 1996 fighter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killer-instinct-gold">Killer Instinct Gold</a> is available now in the west, with Japan getting something else entirely.
</p>
<p>
Rare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killer-instinct">Killer Instinct</a> series - something of a response to the hugely popular (and considerably more violent) Mortal Kombat games - debuted in arcades back in 1994, with the series making its home console debut on Super Nintendo  later that year. A sequel, Killer Instinct 2, hit arcades in 1996, and it's this version that later made its way to the N64 under the name Killer Instinct Gold.
</p>
<p>
Killer Instinct Gold offered a bit of a glow-up compared to its console predecessor, replacing the previously 2D backdrops with new-fangled 3D. The pre-rendered characters, though, remained staunchly two dimensional across its 11-strong roster of new and returning fighters, which included the likes of Sabrewulf, Riptor, Galcius, and Spinal. Gold was warmly received at the time, but would mark the start of over a decade-and-a-half of dormancy for the series, which didn't return until 2013's Killer Instinct reboot on Xbox.

<p>
Anyone looking to relive the halcyon days of 1996 now have the option to do so on Switch, as long as they've got themselves a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. Things are a little different for members in Japan, however, where the service's latest N64 addition is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ridge-racer-64">Ridge Racer 64</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ridge-racer-64-is-finally-playable-again-after-its-n64-debut-25-years-ago">arrived in the west back in January this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Killer Instinct Gold and the rest of Nintendo's Switch Online classic games catalogue will also be available to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> owners with an Expansion Pack subscription <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">when the console arrives on 5th June</a>. In addition to the already available NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, N64, and Sega Mega Drive titles, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">Switch 2 also brings access to a range of GameCube classics</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, Soul Calibur 2, and F-Zero GX are all currently confirmed for launch day.

            <p>
Bungie has admitted that an external artist's work has been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent. 
</p>
<p>
The issue came to light yesterday following recent playable alpha tests of Marathon, from which an artist recognised their designs had been used.
</p>
<p>
"The Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017," artist <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Fern Hook wrote on social media</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language i have refined for the last decade, but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution."
</p> <div>

<p>
Responding via its less-visible <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">Marathon Dev Team social media account</a>, Bungie wrote that it had "immediately investigated" Hook's claim and found that, yes, a former artist at the company had swiped the designs.
</p>
<p>
"This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred," Bungie wrote. "We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to 
[Hook]  to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.
</p>
<p>
"As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission," Bungie continued, stating - if it needed to be said - that the developer does not endorse plagiarism. 
</p>
<p>
"To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions," the publisher concluded.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Bungie has faced claims of using artists' work without permission - with multiple instances coming to light regarding designs for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.

"I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email," Hook concluded.
</p>
<p>
"In 10 years I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitising my designs while I struggle to make a living."
</p>
<p>
Bungie's Marathon reboot is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 23rd September.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> will release on PC on 11th June, but its availability on Steam has been blocked in over 120 countries, surprising even the game's developer.</p>
<p>Shift Up shared news of the release <a href="https://x.com/StellarBlade/status/1923048769245020481">on social media</a>, but a number of fans responded with Steam screenshots showing the game is unavailable in their region. Shift Up responded to confirm the PC version does not require a PSN account and appeared surprised in the replies at the games unavailability.</p>
<p>Checking <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/1294088/info/">SteamDB</a>, it appears Stellar Blade has been restricted in over 120 countries. Most of these are where Sony's PSN is unavailable.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was review-bombed last year following a PSN requirement, which led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">game being pulled from sale in 177 countries</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">company quickly u-turned its decision</a> following the backlash.</p>
<p>It would appear Stellar Blade is experiencing a similar issue, although Shift Up has stated a PSN account is not required. However, a free bonus costume will be offered when a PSN account is linked to Steam.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sony for clarification.</p>
<p>The Steam listing does state that Denuvo has been incorporated, much to the annoyance of some fans.</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-out-on-pc-next-month-according-to-leaked-trailer">Stellar Blade's PC release date leaked earlier in the week</a>, but has now been confirmed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/stellar-blade-launches-june-11-on-pc-specs-and-features-revealed/">PlayStation Blog</a>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s already a bit of a winner, but Obsidian Entertainment has pledged to make its acclaimed RPG even better over the remainder of 2025. As per the studio's latest development roadmap, a new game plus, photo mode, and more are all on the horizon, and that's alongside the additions now available in its newly-released 1.4 update.
</p>
<p>
Avowed's 1.4 patch is available now for PC and Xbox Series X/S, introducing a range of tweaks and improvements. Top of the list is a new Arachnophobia safe mode, for players wanting to experience the game without the creeping threat of spindly legs and eight piercing eyes. This option can be switched on via the accessibility menu and replaces spider enemies with round, floating - and delightfully rainbow-hued - orbs.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
That's alongside a range of quality of life improvements including mouse and keyboard support for Xbox, additional gold and crafting materials, and unique gear improvements. Obsidian has also highlighted a number of changes introduced based on community feedback: critters can now be defeated, with a chance they'll drop loot; time can be advanced by waiting at the Party Camp; new optional settings enable players to view chests on the minimap or cancel Bow and Arquebus power attacks; Soul Pads now dispel illusions, and there are fog of war improvements too. Full <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134717-patch-14-notes/">patch notes are available on Obsidian's forum</a>. 
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
So that's that for update 1.4, but Obisidian has also now confirmed <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/1-4-update">more's on the way as 2025 continues</a>. The studio has so far outlined two additional updates for the year, one coming this summer and another this "fall". Avowed's summer update will, for instance, include cooking and crafting improvements, new NPC abilities and behaviours, new active and passive abilities, new unique weapons and armour, plus custom map markers.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the nights start drawing in and the scent of autumn fills the air, Avowed players can look forward to some pretty significant new additions. A new game plus mode is top of the list, followed by a photo mode, and a new weapon type. Obsidian is also teasing new character presets, more Godlike feature presets, and the ability to change appearance in-world.
</p>
<p>
"We also want to acknowledge our players in Korea, Japan, and French-speaking regions," the studio adds in its latest blog post. "We know how important it is to experience a game in your preferred language, and we are actively working on localised versions for Korean and Japanese, along with ongoing improvements for French. We're committed to delivering these updates as soon as they are ready, and we deeply appreciate your patience and support as we make sure they meet the quality you deserve."
</p>

<p>
It's a good time for Avowed fans, then, as Obsidian continues to finesse its already excellent fantasy RPG. "Avowed has been more generous than I thought it would be - in length, in heart, in depth," Robert Purchase wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a> earlier this year, "and it never loses sight of being a game, of being an adventure, of taking you places you would never normally go, or of simply providing a few dozen hours of unabashed escapism. I think it's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."
