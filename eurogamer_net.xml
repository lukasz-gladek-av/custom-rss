            <p>As we suspected, but couldn't say 100 percent for sure until now, Bomberman has been confirmed for the Xbox version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Konami released an Xbox-specific trailer for its upcoming remake of the 2004 game. And, while those on PS5 and Steam versions of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be able to partake in a spot of 'Snake vs Monkey', where they have to capture the Pipo Monkeys, we now know Xbox users will instead square off with Bomberman.</p>
<p>"Snake vs Bomberman for Xbox Series X/S," reads the trailer's blurb. "Take control of Snake and face off with Bomberman in this special side mode. Blast 'em away in each stage!" You can have a watch below.</p>

<p>As well as this Bomberman confirmation, earlier today Konami also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-taking-hide-and-go-seek-to-the-next-level-with-original-multiplayer-mode">"completely original" online multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, known as Fox Hunt.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">initially revealed back in 2023</a>. It retains the 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">remake has been done with future generations in mind</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura said in an interview last year. "It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura said. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">scheduled for release on 28th August</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Silent Hill remake has just been announced during Konami's Press Start showcase.</p>
<p>The game will be created by Bloober team in collaboration with Konami. As of writing, the only confirmed is that the game is "in development".</p>
<p>The brief reveal trailer was paired alongside the Silent Hill 1 intro theme, further confirming that this is the original game in the legendary horror series being remade.</p> <div>

<p>This remake of the original 1999 game by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>, the developer responsible for the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. That game received ample critical and commercial success, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">in Eurogamer's own review of the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Vikki Blake noted: "Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves."
</p>
<p>This will be the first time Silent Hill 1 has gotten the remake treatment, although it was reimagined back in 2009 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-shattered-memories-review">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a>. That game, released on the Wii and later ported to the PS2, was an interesting spin on the game that started it all. 
</p><p>
Bloober Team is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-release-window">which got a release date announcement at Summer Game Fest only a few days ago</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a>, which was initially released four years ago (four years ago!), has a prototype mini game hidden away so well within it, that apparently nobody found it.</p>
<p>Senior designer Grant Parker showed the mini game off during a live stream on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, though developer Insomniac has since shared the clip on its social media. </p>
<p>
During this Rift Apart stream, Parker explained how to find the Easter egg for a prototype mini game, which would have allowed players to ride the mechanical bull inside Zurkie's (a bar-like establishment).</p>

<p>Like I said, the developer is pretty sure no one has discovered this Easter egg for themselves yet, and having listened to him explain it I can't say that I am surprised. To check it out, players need to head towards the entrance of Zurkie's, where they will see two signs beside the doorway informing patrons not to bring weapons inside. These are the key to unlocking the bull riding Easter egg.</p>
<p>What you have to do is shoot the left sign five times, then the right one four times, before shooting the left one 13 more times. Nothing will happen, or so it would seem as there isn't any mystical bell or anything like that that suddenly chimes to let you know you have uncovered something secret. There is literally "no confirmation, or anything," Parker explained in the video. However, if you mosey on into Zurkie's and head to the bull, you will get a prompt: Hold L2 to Ride Mechanical Bull.</p>
<p>You can check out the "super duper early" prototype mini game via the embed below. "It's just something fun that I thought I'd leave in the game," Parker said.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer was full of praise for Rift Apart on its PlayStation 5 release in 2021, with our Chris calling it "another lesson in laid-back, unpretentious fun".</p>
<p>"It's just pure craft, pure fun, pure video games - all the brilliant, bizarre ideas this studio has just thrown at the wall and all of them sticking. The only thing it lacks - apart from maybe a tiny bit of restraint - is pretence," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-review">Eurogamer's Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart review</a>. "There's no self-seriousness, no po-faced melodrama, no insecurity about the form. A game that's happy to be a game, in a familiar, cuddly shape.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
