            <p>
Minecraft's live-action movie adaptation is almost upon us, and with its 4th April release date looming, Warner Bros. has shared a "final" trailer - giving us a quick glimpse of Jack Black's Nether region, as well as Jennifer Coolidge in a still-mysterious role.
</p>
<p>
For this fourth and final trailer, the bombastic action of earlier showings is cranked even higher, as huge armies of classic Minecraft mobs - including Piglin Brutes and Iron Golems - amass for some sort climactic set-piece battle. That's balanced out by some sillier moments, but none of this is likely to win over anyone who's previously been put off by the <em>ugliness</em> of it all.
</p>
<p>
We get even more of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-trailer-reveals-first-look-at-its-villagers-and-they-are-sight-for-sore-eyes">those nightmare villagers</a>, as well as Ghasts that looked like they've just slipped in from some eldritch dimension. I'm still not convinced by the Creepers either, given what I'd always assumed were a sort of sentient cactus have been reimagined as angry shoeboxes covered in astroturf. Thank goodness for Jennifer Coolidge, then, who immediately improves the situation at the end of the trailer, simply by being Jennifer Coolidge.

<p>
The Minecraft movie, if you haven't been keeping up, follows four "misfits" - played by Sebastian Hansen, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Jason Momoa - who're suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a "bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination". To get back home, they'll need to embark on a magical quest with help from Jack Black's Steve.
</p>
<p>
I can't honestly say the Minecraft movie is something I'll personally be rushing out to watch based on everything Warner Bros. has shown so far, but it does at least look like the kind of harmlessly amusing fluff that - between its silly gags and mild peril - should shut the kids up for an hour or two. And if that suits, it's coming to cinemas on 4th April.

            <p>
IGN Live will return this June for a second year, with plans for an even bigger physical event in Los Angeles during the summer's annual game announcement season.
</p>
<p>
Held once again at LA's Magic Box downtown event space, IGN Live (organised by Eurogamer's parent company, IGN Entertainment) will feature various hands-on oppurtunities, plus a stage with fresh reveals and trailers, interviews and celebrity panels.
</p>
<p>
Last year, IGN Live welcomed Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> to the stage, and featured over 100 gaming stations. The plans for this year's edition are even bigger, organisers have said.
</p>
<p>
For those across the pond, more details on dates and tickets, when announced, will be available at <a href="http://ign.com/live">IGN.com/live</a>. Alternatively, you'll be able to follow the biggest announcements live online.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">E3 might be dead and buried</a>, but the beginning of June remains a time we're all glued to the internet to find out what's next from the games industry.
</p>
<p>
Expect the usual glut of publisher shows around the same time, including the regular conferences from Microsoft, Sony, Ubisoft and more - and hopefully more from Nintendo as it gets ready to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>.

            <p>
More than 110 former Metro series developers have come together as a new studio, known as Reburn, and its first project - La Quimera - is sci-fi shooter set in Latin America that's being co-written by Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn.
</p>
<p>
The specifics of the announcement have lead to some confusion as talk of rebranding has gone around, but Reburn essentially appears to Metro developer sub-studio 4A Games Ukraine breaking away from 4A Games' Malta-based headquarters to do its own thing. As for the 4A Games that remains, it continues to work on a new IP and the next Metro project.
</p>
<p>
Reburn, though, consists of over 110 former Metro developers, including gameplay designers, artists, sound engineers, and programmers - all led by former 4A Games Ukraine CEO Dmytro Lymar. And its debut project is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">sci-fi FPS La Quimera</a>, promising "familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" in a futuristic Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle setting.

<p>
La Quimera sees players - either going it solo or co-operatively with up to two friends - stepping into the customisable exosuit of a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier battling against rival factions. There's talk of "unique and highly detailed environments, characters and weapons", as players experience a world and narrative written and created by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, Only God Forgives, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren.
</p>
<p>
You can get a taste of that in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u_qFKhoB8c&amp;t=57s">La Quimera's announcement trailer</a> above. But Reburn - which also has a presence in Cyprus alongside its Ukraine and remote teams - says it'll share more on the PC game, alongside additional "supporting visuals", in the coming months.
