            <p>
We're less than a week away from Indiana Jones' next big adventure - in which the boulder-bothering, grail-quaffing archaeologist goes in search a big old circle - and ahead of its release, developer MachineGames has revealed PC requirements and, as a bonus, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq97d1RkdRM">new trailer</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Great Circle in question (it's in the title, so probably relatively important as the story proceeds), is, as game director Jerk Gustafsson <a href="https://www.lucasfilm.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview/">previously explained</a>, "very real and mysterious". It just so happens to connect many historical sites such as Giza, Easter Island, Sukhothai, and Nazca as it runs around the Earth's circumference, and nobody has ever figured out why. Except, probably, Indiana Jones in about a week's time.
</p>
<p>
And if you're a PC player considering joining Indy on his globe-trotting, first-person adventure, MachineGames has now detailed exactly what hardware you'll need to have stuffed inside your computer to ensure it runs at a satisfactory level. In all cases, you'll be wanting to free up 120GB of storage, with full specs detailed at the bottom of this page.

<p>
As noted over on <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/3Od8RFBcAOGNxNDlD801Rp/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-pc-specs">Bethesda's blog</a>, Indy potentially comes in a little smaller on Xbox, with its basic installation size weighing in at roughly 87GB. However, there's an optional 45GB Higher Resolution Textures pack that's installed by default on Xbox Series X.
</p><p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> launches for Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on Monday, 9th December, but it'll be playable from 6th December for anyone that pre-orders the Premium Edition, Premium Edition Upgrade, or Collectorâ€™s Edition - you'll find <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-the-great-circle-release-times">specific release times over here</a>. As for PlayStation 5 owners, it'll be available on Sony's console in spring 2025.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ian Higton positively vibrated with excitement when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">went hands-on with the Great Circle</a> back in October. "I think it's going to be something truly special," he wrote, "and I can't wait to play more of it." And on that note, those PC system requirements in full:

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> was in a bit of a state when it launched earlier this month, as developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> was all too aware. It took less than a day for the studio to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">acknowledge</a> the post-apocalyptic  shooter's "rough edges", and it's been flinging out fixes since then. And today brings a third patch, this one weighing in at around 20GB on PC.
</p>
<p>
Patch 1.0.3 (which totals a rather more svelt 7.91 GB on Xbox Series X/S) isn't, perhaps, as sexy as GSC's first, which came with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-first-patch-is-here-featuring-over-650-fixes">eye-catching promise of over 650 fixes</a>. Improvements are still improvements, though, and this time the studio has set its sights on crashes, memory leaks, control adjustments, mission and side missions, plus balance and AI.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, update 1.0.3 addresses a potentially heart-stopping issue that was causing player saves to vanish after a hard reboot of their PC or Xbox. "Thanks again for your support," the studio concludes in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474965">release notes on Steam</a>. "We will continue working on future updates, reading your comments and feedback, and fixing 'anomalies' if they occur."

<p>
Stalker 2's significant technical issues were highlighted repeatedly at launch, despite an otherwise solid critical reception. "It all hurts the game's natural playability quite badly, even if it is often funny", we said in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">three star review</a> - so hopefully GSC can get its shooter to a place the underlying experience is more readily able to shine.
</p><p>
Not that bugs have stemmed player enthusiasm for the developer's long-awaited sequel; GSC announced Stalker 2 had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">sold over 1m copies</a> just days after release. Its massive popularity does, however, appear to have made the Ukrainian-developed game the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-reportedly-target-of-russian-disinformation-campaign-claiming-its-used-to-draft-players-into-ukraine-war">target of a new Russian disinformation campaign</a>, falsely claiming it scans players' computers in order to help the Ukranian government "locate citizens suitable for mobilisation".
