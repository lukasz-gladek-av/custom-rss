            <p>FromSoftware is reportedly in advanced development on a project it's yet to announce, which could be out as early as next year.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">mp1st</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-reportedly-has-another-unannounced-game-that-could-release-next-year/">VGC</a>), which has information suggesting the Japanese studio has a multiplatform game with the codename FMC in development.</p>
<p>Due to "the nature of the source these details come from", mp1st believes this project is in an advanced stage and should be out next year. The fact it's a multiplatform game confirms FMC is not the codename for the already announced The Duskbloods, which will be exclusive to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this game be? That's where things get speculative.</p>
<p>Mp1st has noted that previous Dark Souls games - and 2023's Armored Core 6 - had codenames with abbreviations beginning with F.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> was FDP, Dark Souls Remastered was FHD, and Armored Core 6 was FNR. By contrast, Sekiro was NTCG/NTC, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was GR (short for Great Rune).</p>
<p>The suggestion, then, is that FMC could be related to either the Dark Souls or Armored Core series.</p>
<p>Nick "Shpeshal Nick" Baker, co-host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Mmo392kpNoA">XboxEra Podcast</a>, reported last year Dark Souls 3 Remastered was in development. Series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> previously told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-3-interview-it-wouldnt-be-right-to-cont/1100-6432425/">Gamespot</a> he considered Dark Souls 3 to be "the big closure on the series". But would this rule out a remaster?</p>
<p>Armored Core 6, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">a successful revival of the series for FromSoftware</a>, selling 3m units in under a year. It seems likely the studio would want to build on that success.</p>
<p>All we officially know for sure is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods will be heading to Switch 2</a> and will combine vampires with jetpacks and dinosaurs. Miyazaki has also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">FromSoftware's focus hasn't shifted to multiplayer</a>, despite this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
British video game composer and sound designer Peter Connelly, known for his work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>, has been jailed for 16 months after being found guilty of fraudulently claiming a second Covid loan.
</p>
<p>
The news was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud">announced on the UK government's website</a> by its Insolvency Service agency, which appears to have embarked on a flashy series of press releases in recent months featuring dramatic ink-stamp graphics with words like "JAILED", "LOAN FRAUD", and "BANNED".
</p>
<p>
According to the agency's announcement, Connelly overstated his company's turnover to obtain a second Bounce Back Loan of £37,500 in 2020. Bounce Back Loans were provided to businesses who might otherwise have struggled to access finance during the Covid pandemic, but companies were only entitled to one. Connelly is said to have secured his first loan, for £22,000, at a different bank just a month earlier.
</p>
<p>
"Peter Connelly blatantly disregarded the rules of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, designed to support small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic," the Insolvency Service's chief investigator David Snasdell said in a statement accompanying the news.
</p>
<p>
In interviews with the Insolvency Service, Connelly told investigators he had been given the potentially lucrative opportunity to re-imagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack, and had taken out personal loans and sold his car to complete the project. Things then "stalled" at the start of the pandemic, and Connelly's company, Peter Connelly Limited, went into liquidation in August 2021 without repaying either loan.
</p>
<p>
Connelly, who previously signed an Individual Voluntary Arrangement agreeing to repay his debts, was found guilty of fraud and was jailed for 16 months by Durham Crown Court on Thursday, 17th July. The 52-year-old is also banned from being a company director for six years.
</p>
<p>
Connelly composed soundtracks for a number of Tomb Raider games while the series was under <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/core-design">Core Design</a>'s stewardship in the 1990s and early 2000s, including The Last Revelation, Chronicles, and The Angel of Darkness. He's also provided sound design work for the likes of Watch Dogs, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a>, and 2023's Dead Island 2.

            <p>
Julian LeFay - who oversaw multiple Elder Scrolls games as chief engineer at Bethesda, and is often referred to as the 'father' of the series - is stepping back from game development to spend his "remaining time with his family and loved ones" following his cancer diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after its founding in 1987, and worked on the likes of The Elder Scrolls: Arena in 1994 and its 1996 sequel Daggerfall, before departing the company in 1998. LeFay briefly returned for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, and pursued various other ventures before setting up independent studio OnceLost Games with fellow Elder Scrolls alumni Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman in 2019. Since then, the studio has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wayward-realms-is-a-grand-rpg-by-former-elder-scrolls-devs">working on The Wayward Realms</a>, an open-world RPG announced in 2021.
</p>
<p>
News of LeFay's departure from the project, and from game development as a whole, was announced in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwMyPR8Li6k">emotional video addressed to The Wayward Realms community</a> on YouTube. "Our technical producer Julian LeFay, who I'm sure needs no introduction, has been fighting a battle with cancer for the last several years," creative producer Victor Villarreal explained. "He's fought bravely and strongly but it seems he doesn't have very much time left. He has stepped away from the project to spend that remaining time with his family and loved ones."

<p>
Villarreal also invited fans to "share any words, thoughts, or memories you might have of Julian, as well as any well-wishes you might have for his family." He noted the studio would discuss how the news impacts The Wayward Realms at a later date, adding: "It is something we've been preparing for. Julian has made his vision of the game very clear to the team and we will work tirelessly to bring that vision to life."
</p>
<p>
A separate, lengthier statement from LeFay's long-time friend and colleague Ted Peterson was shared alongside the video. "I could talk stories about our friendship and how we've worked together recently with our team on Wayward Realms as creative and technical directors," Peterson wrote, "but I need to come to the point of this. Julian has been courageously battling cancer. His doctors have informed us that his time with us is limited, and we are preparing to say goodbye to a true legend of the industry."
</p>
<p>
"Obviously, the team has already had a chance to say goodbye and give their individual messages, and I sat by his hospital bed, reading them to him," Peterson continued. "In that case, I was reading them out loud and Julian was giving me dictation to reply back, which is rather hard to do through my tears... To me, this is deeply personal, and I regret every second I didn't spend with one of the most charming, smart, funny, and interesting people I've ever met. It's also a spur to action for me: I will not let down his legacy."
</p>
<p>
"That said," Peterson concluded, "a final quote from the eminently quotable Julian LeFay. He said this at our last team meeting, and I believe it represents him and his beliefs well. 'It is personal. And if it's not personal, then you're just doing work for hire and you'll never have the motivation to accomplish a significant goal.'"
</p>
<p>
OnceLost also <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1945983192617652588">shared a follow-up message</a> from LeFay's daughter Shae on its social media page. "The best any of us can hope for is to leave this life and know that we have made a positive impact," she wrote. "That is my dad's greatest motivation to this very day. We are truly grateful for the outpouring of love and support since the announcement was made."
</p>
<p>
"It has reinvigorated both myself and my father and given us a sense of peace in stressful times, knowing of the impact he has made on all of you. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, everyone. We will continue to read the comments to keep our sprits up in the days ahead."

            <p>A little while ago, Nintendo said smartphone racer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a> would stop receiving new content updates. But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-tour-updates-end-next-month">even though that was the official line back in 2023</a>, Tour racers do in fact have some new content to look forward to after all.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Mario Kart Tour team shared a new trailer for the mobile game's upcoming Sunshine Tour, which will feature a collaboration event with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. This "special campaign" celebrating Mario Kart World's release last month will take place in Tour, with moustachioed brothers Mario and Luigi in mechanic outfits. Additionally, four new Karts will make their Mario Kart Tour debut.</p>
<p>The Mario Kart World Special Campaign - to give it its full name - will run from Wednesday, 23rd July until Wednesday, 6th August. You can check out a trailer for it all below.</p>

<p>Mario Kart Tour originally launched for iPhone and Android devices back in September 2019. It went on to become one of Nintendo's most lucrative mobile launches. In September 2022, so three years after its launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-tour-is-nintendos-second-highest-grossing-mobile-game">Mario Kart Tour had made Nintendo an estimated $293m globally</a>.</p>
<p>While it proved popular, there were some muddy waters on the game's initial release, as Mario Kart Tour included a gacha-style system where players pulled on Mushroom Kingdom warp pipes for a chance at unlocking new characters and kart pieces. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-to-gut-mario-kart-tour-of-grubby-gacha-elements">Nintendo ultimately removed this feature from the game in 2022</a>, and replaced it with an in-game item shop.</p>
<p>As for Mario Kart World on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, well we rather enjoyed the latest series release on its debut, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">our Tom calling it "entertaining, snackable, fun" in Eurogamer's review</a>. He awarded Mario Kart World four out of five Eurogamer stars.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/smartphone-racer-mario-kart-tour-gets-first-new-content-in-years-to-celebrate-switch-2s-mario-kart-world]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fox was interviewed by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story">Game Informer</a> about Sucker Punch's forthcoming Japanese epic, when he was asked whether the studio would be open to revisiting its Infamous series of superhero games.</p>
<p>"I would love to work on more Infamous," said Fox. "I would love to see a trilogy rerelease, but Sucker Punch is a one game at a time shop, and right now we are very focused on finishing Ghost of Yōtei."</p>

<p>Fox has long worked at Sucker Punch, beginning as a designer on the first Sly Cooper game in 2002. He also worked as the game director for all of the Infamous games and expansions - Infamous, Infamous 2, Infamous: Festival of Blood, Infamous Second Son, and Infamous First Light.</p>
<p>After working as game director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, he's now co-director on Ghost of Yōtei along with Jason Connell.</p>
<p>The first Infamous game released on PS3 and was notable for its Karma system that allowed protagonist Cole to become either good or evil, with suitably evolving powers. Later, on PS4, Infamous Second Son featured Troy Baker as protagonist Delsin Rowe, who could absorb a great variety of supernatural powers.</p>
<p>It's been 11 years since Second Son and its expansion First Light, but it seems Sucker Punch won't be returning to the series anytime soon, especially considering the success of Ghost of Tsushima</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will be released on 2nd October exclusively on PS5. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yoteis-gorgeous-gameplay-deep-dive-reveals-refined-combat-lo-fi-beats-mode-and-more">recent State of Play gave us a longer look at its open world gameplay</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/infamous-director-would-love-to-see-a-trilogy-rerelease-but-sucker-punch-is-a-one-game-at-a-time-shop]]></content:encoded>
