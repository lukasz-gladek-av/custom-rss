            <p>Former Striking Distance and Sledgehammer founder Glen Schofield has shared his concerns about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">the sale of his former employer, EA</a>, saying it's a "bittersweet moment" that reminds him of the sale of Activision to Microsoft.</p>
<p>"in the span of just a few years, the two publishing giants who shaped the last 20+ years of our industry have both entered new eras," he said.</p>
<p>"I spent roughly a decade at each company, right in their primes," he wrote to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_ea-and-activision-thank-you-when-the-news-activity-7405032019358851072-hPut/">LinkedIn</a>. "Watching them fade from their roles as dominant publishers and powerhouse training grounds hits harder than I expected."</p>

<p>"EA was buttoned-up, disciplined, and structured in a way that forced you to rise to the level of the room. Franchise reviews were intense – no shortcuts, no guessing. You had to know every inch of your game. And they’d challenge you, push you, test you. But when you walked out of that meeting, you knew exactly where you stood."</p><p>Reflecting on his first meeting as an executive producer, Schofield revealed that "being [at EA] felt like a creative all-star lineup", with "so many legends in one place". Activision, by contrast, "was a storm of A-type personalities, but in the best possible way".</p>
<p>"Review meetings were loud, passionate, borderline chaotic, with people calling out questions over one another," he said. "But the questions were sharp, focused, and always aimed at making the game better. A one-hour meeting becoming two and a half was normal and somehow, the time always felt well spent.</p>
<p>"So yes, it’s tough to watch these companies step back from what they once were: major publishers, major developers, and incredible places to grow, learn, and sharpen your craft. They trained generations of us. They made careers. Mine included."</p>
<p>But despite the "bittersweet" nature of his message, Schofield did acknowledged that the "bright side" of the acquisition means others will now be able to step up.</p>
<p>"New leaders. New studios. New publishers. Someone will take that mantle, we always do as an industry. And when they do, I hope they lead, teach, and invest in talent the way EA and Activision did. They set a bar that pushed all of us to be better. They’re both still around, and I sincerely wish them success in whatever comes next.</p>
<p>"From the bottom of my heart, thank you EA and Activision for an amazing run and for everything you helped me become."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Eurogamer reported that Dead Space creator Glen Schofield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-hopeful-eas-new-owners-will-let-him-make-dead-space-4-promising-to-save-them-millions-of-dollars">was "already making calls" to EA's new owners in the hope he can make Dead Space 4</a>. Schofield was executive producer on the first Dead Space game in 2008, and while he wasn't involved in its two follow-ups, he later developed the spiritual successor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> at Striking Distance Studios in 2022. He  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">left Striking Distance in 2023 after the game flopped</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Schofield posted on LinkedIn the games industry is "tough" after failing to obtain financial backing for his latest project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-hints-at-retiring-from-game-development-after-struggling-to-fund-latest-project">hinting he may have directed his last game</a>.</p>

            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has once again publicly congratulated Sandfall Interactive for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, this time for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">securing a record-breaking nine wins at The Game Awards earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has just been named Game of the Year in Los Angeles. A historic first for a French title!" Macron announced on Instagram.</p>

<p>"Great pride for Montpellier and for France. Congratulations to the Sandfall Interactive team. For future generations and those that follow!"</p>
<p>Some commenters, however, have taken the opportunity to remind the President that he once suggested video games had "poisoned" the minds of young people during the 2023 riots, although shortly thereafter, Macron did clarify his position, insisting he only said that because " video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks", adding: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-clarifies-view-on-video-games-after-blaming-them-for-riots">it is this violence that I condemn, not video games</a>.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"Video games are a culture, an entertainment, a spectacle! They are a ground for artistic experimentation, a fascinating learning space, mixing all the arts," he said at the time. "Playing means listening to music, immersing yourself in stories, feeling emotions, travelling through time. It is exploring visual universes that write a new chapter in the history of art."</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also congratulated Sandfall Interactive back in May, calling its RPG a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">"shining example of French audacity and creativity"</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had a pretty fantastic night, taking home not only the coveted Game of the Year gong, but eight other awards too. It won best narrative, best score and music, best art direction, and best game direction, and was named best RPG, best independent game, and best debut indie game too. Additionally, Jennifer English's turn as Maelle was named best performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wasn't the only winner on the night</a>, of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> won best action game, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> walked away with the best action-adventure prize.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-alien-game-back-in-development/">Insider Gaming</a>, the new game – described as "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> with xenomorphs" — has been in development since 2020 "under a variety of names", including Marathon, and "switched developers multiple times".</p>

<p>With enemy "Al designed to adapt and react to whatever tactics you use", it's thought the gameplay will balance combat with platforming and puzzles, with an emphasis on stealth and resource management in a single-player arcade survival horror game.</p>
<p>The anonymous source also revealed character names and abilities – such as a grappling hook and magnetic boots – and teased the team "hopes" Sigourney Weaver will reprise her fan-favourite role as Ripley, but this is in no way confirmed as yet.</p><p>Interestingly, the source also intimated that the budget for the game is around £56 million ($75 million) and is hoping to release "for all major platforms" in 2028, which means there's plenty of time for details and mechanics to change between now and then.</p>
<p>Eidos Montreal declined to comment.</p>
<p>Alien actress <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-eyes-alien-actress-sigourney-weaver-for-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver will star in the live-action Tomb Raider adaptation from Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> as Wallace.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-trailer-for-netflixs-tomb-raider-the-legend-of-lara-croft-season-two">The second and final season of Netflix's Tomb Raider anime debuted on 11th December. </a></p>

            <p>One of the most headline-grabbing things about science-fiction role-playing game Exodus, beyond it looking a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, is that it stars Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role. He plays the role of C.C. Orlev in the game, a character still shrouded in some mystery, and you can hear his voice narrating the new trailer for the games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/11/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice">But McConaughey recently made headlines by signing a deal that will allow his voice to be AI-generated</a> in certain situations by the company Elevenlabs, which he also invested in. Which begs the question: is it really McConaughey in Exodus or has his voice been AI-generated?</p>

<p>"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," Chad Robertson, co-founder of Exodus developer Archetype, told me in an interview. "He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used.</p><p>"The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific. But my point in this is there's a lot more stuff that's going to evolve that way. So if we ask what our long-term studio stance [on AI] is, we want to be smart technologists, and we want to make great games. And if for cost reasons or quality reasons, that becomes something that becomes more acceptable and becomes more commonplace, I think we're gonna have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves. But currently we don't have plans."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that"</em></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, I asked Robertson specifically whether generative AI was used in Exodus' development at all and it's not. "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it," he said, "but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan.</p>
<p>"We, as creators, have a ton of respect for art in general. And don't you know it's a hot topic with our team when it's come up - it consumes some of our team meetings every Friday. So our team is super passionate about it. But there's an evolution happening in the industry where I think it's going to become more prevalent and become something that everybody's facing."</p><p>Archetype unveiled a new trailer for Exodus during The Game Awards, giving us another montaged look at the sci-fi adventure in which we'll try to escape a tech-related plague by assembling a ship and crew of our own. In the game, we'll play as hero Jun Aslan, a seemingly regular person who happens to be compatible with ancient and powerful tech they'll find through the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exodus-release-date-moved-thirsty-compaions-mass-effect-comparisons">Exodus is a game that looks and sounds like Mass Effect, including in how it has some "thirsty" companion romances</a>, and it's made by many former BioWare developers, including the lead writer of Mass Effect 1 and 2, Drew Karpyshyn. Chad Robertson also hails from BioWare.</p>
<p>Despite the similarities, however, there are some key differences, including most notably time dilation. The nearer to the speed of light you travel at, the more time will pass, allowing you to see first-hand the long-term consequences of your actions. I'll write more about this next week.</p>

            <p>Dispatch developer AdHoc has told Eurogamer there's one super-rare game-state that no player has unlocked or achieved yet - something it knows because it has back-end statistics that track these things.</p>
<p>It's to do with a statistic that reflects how you played as Robert, the main character, which is given at the conclusion of the game.</p>
<p>"At the end of the game, we did a little personality test thing, where it's like, 'your Robert was an everyman', based on how you played the game. Or 'your Robert was an anti-hero'," studio co-founder Nick Herman told me.</p>
<p>"There's actually... I've only seen three show up, and there's four. We know the fourth one is actually really hard to get, intentionally. That's just a piece of content I have never seen, and we have stats on the back-end that show that maybe no one's ever gotten it.</p><p>"It's based on gameplay performance," Herman added. "Have you perfected the game, essentially, is what that is. I don't know that anyone's done that." And it's based on perfecting non-randomly generated outcomes in the game, by the way. "We focused it on the non-RNG elements," said Herman.</p>

<p>However, there's a catch. There is a chance that someone <em>has</em> played Dispatch in such a way that they should earn this elusive game-state, or response, but it simply isn't registering their efforts correctly. "It might just be a bug," Herman said, casually. "It's so hard to do regardless that we were like, 'Well of course no one's gotten it,' but it's probably a bug."</p>
<p>"We have a permutation that you have not seen because you're not allowed to see it because we broke it," added fellow co-founder Pierre Shorette, the writer of the game, laughing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone">Dispatch, a superhero workplace comedy, raced to 2m sales earlier this year</a>, proving that an appetite for Telltale-like episodic series was still very much there. Attention now turns to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">a possible Dispatch sequel, or second series</a>; to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">potential reinstated sex scenes</a>; and to The Game Awards this week, in which Dispatch is nominated for Best Debut Indie Game. These are all things I spoke to Herman and Shorette about at much greater length. Look out for a fuller interview soon.</p>
