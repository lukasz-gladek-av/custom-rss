            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-star-wars-fortnite-fans-expect-another-themed-mini-season-this-year-potentially-involving-the-simpsons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is currently in the midst of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-getting-the-force-with-chapter-6-season-3-star-wars-themed-season-galactic-battle">dedicated Star Wars mini-season, Galactic Battle</a>, but fans are already looking to the future. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' battle royale/metaverse has hosted themed seasons before, but only around Marvel. Now, the shorter length and naming of Fortnite's big Star Wars crossover has fans expecting other similar mini-seasons in future.
</p>
<p>
Officially, Galactic Battle is referred to in-game as Chapter 6: MS1, or Mini-Season 1, something which rather suggests there will be a Mini-Season 2 as well. And indeed, growing whispers suggest another Disney-owned property is being lined up for a crossover later this year: The Simpsons.

Fortnite has long had a close partnership with Disney, and the two companies have only grown closer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">since the latter's $1.5bn investment</a> to help fund <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-x-fortnite-collab-moves-into-stable-branch-exactly-a-year-after-disney-invested-15bn-in-epic-games">an upcoming Disney mode</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Following the launch of other Disney-owned characters in Fortnite, including those from Disney's own animated films, Pixar movies and Family Guy, The Simpsons' arrival in Fortnite has only seemed like a matter of time. 
</p>
<p>
Now, a <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1920270562812670238">cluster</a> of <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920271960937791525">smaller</a> Fortnite <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1920276038921204113">leakers</a> have cautiously pointed to a potential Simpsons mini-season later this year, based on access to leaked game information that correctly detailed Fortnite's Star Wars season before it was revealed.</p>
<p>While this is far from a confirmation, it isn't the first time word of a Simpsons crossover has been touted - having originally been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteLeaks/comments/1epsjko/fortnite_x_the_simpsons_is_in_development_via/">noted</a> by another Fortnite leaker as in development late last year.
</p>
<p>Last night's leak also reveals other potential details of Fortnite's future content roadmap, and comes almost exactly a year on from the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">2024 content schedule being leaked in its entirety</a> ahead of time. Eurogamer has contacted Epic Games for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
