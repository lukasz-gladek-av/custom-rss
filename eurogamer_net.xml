EA Sports has offered some scant clarification as to whether or not its EA Sports FC and Madden NFL games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">announced today as coming to the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, will be fully-fledged annual entries such as FC 26, or more limited 'Legacy'-style versions. The Switch 2 versions, EA says, will aim for parity "as much as the hardware allows."
</p>
<p>
"We're excited to bring two of our most beloved franchises - EA SPORTS FC and Madden NFL - to Nintendo's Switch 2, giving fans even more ways to play the sports they love, anytime and anywhere," opened EA's statement, provided to Eurogamer. "Both experiences are being built specifically for the new handheld platform, grounded in what fans enjoy from our franchises across platforms. We look forward to sharing more soon."
</p>
<p>
The developer-publisher also added a few other points of slight clarification, in response to hypothetical questions. For the question of whether or not there would be feature and/or visual parity with current-generation consoles such as the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the response was:

<p>
"We'll share more details on the Madden NFL and FC experiences for Switch 2 at a later date, but our goal is always to deliver a consistent player experience across platforms as much as the hardware allows." 
</p>
<p>
It was also non-committal on questions about crossplay - more to share "at a later date" - as well as whether entries named FC 26 and Madden NFL 26 will feature on the consoles at all, whether other EA Sports games will come to the platforms, and really any other details, too. To the hypothetical question of whether these Switch 2 versions are different SKUs to current and upcoming EA Sports games, the response was that the Madden NFL and FC "experiences" are "designed for the Switch 2."
</p>
<p>
"We're excited to bring two of our most beloved franchises, EA SPORTS FC and Madden NFL, to Nintendo's new handheld platform, Switch 2. It's a great opportunity to reach even more fans - especially younger players - with the sports they love," EA also added.
</p>
<p>
In previous years, EA Sports has released "Legacy Edition" games for handheld consoles like the original Switch, with heavily stripped-back features and simply updated team rosters and stats for each new, full-priced entry. Last year, for FC 25 on the Switch, there was a more significant version however, which has led to hopes EA Sports will continue to provide versions closer to those on the other current-gen consoles.
</p>
<p>
As for how to interpret those responses, well, in brief: it looks like we probably won't get full feature parity, and the games may even launch under different names to the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions, but at least a more substantial entry than the Legacy years gone by isn't off the table (yet).

Switch 2 was almost called the Super Nintendo Switch, but Nintendo felt it "didn't feel right" to use the same naming convention as the SNES due to Switch 2's backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
In a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/">Ask The Developer discussion</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto discussed how the team landed on the right name for the new console.
</p>
<p>
"There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one," he said. "We even considered ideas like 'Super Nintendo Switch'. However, Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn't play NES games. Since Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo."

<p>
He added: "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."
</p>
<p>Does that mean we can expect a Nintendo Switch 3 in the future?</p>
<p>
Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta continued: "From the beginning of development, we wanted Switch 2 to be a system that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. This hasn't changed from Switch to Switch 2. I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware. So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system."
</p>
<p>
Surmised Tetsuya Sasaki, from the Technology Development Division: "I thought the name was simple and easy to understand, since development began with the idea that Switch 2 would be a proper successor to Switch."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the interview, Dohta also confirmed the Switch 2's eShop will be improved.
</p>
<p>
"Thanks to the system's performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games," said Dohta. "We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience."

            <p>While the Switch 2 is backwards compatible with original Switch games - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">some are even receiving an upgrade</a> - there are still a number of games with compatibility issues on the new console, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has released details on compatible games, with 122 Nintendo games and over 15,000 third-party games playable on the new console. This is shown in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/">Steam Deck-esque system on the Nintendo website</a>.</p>
<p>Only one game is completely incompatible with Switch 2 and that's the Labo VR Kit, as the Switch 2 console cannot be inserted into the Toy-Con VR Googles. Sorry cardboard fans.</p>

<p>However, there remain a number of third-party games that either have start up issues on Switch 2, or are playable but have in-game compatibility issues. While those specific issues are unknown, they are all being investigated.</p>
<p>The biggest game with start up issues is Fortnite, though a specific Switch 2 version of the game is planned - it's unknown when this will be released, but at least one of the biggest games in the world will eventually be playable on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>In total, there are <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN.pdf?_gl=1*xvm77x*_gcl_au*MTY1ODE0OTE3NC4xNzQxNjA5OTkx*_ga*MTQ5ODE5NDYyNS4xNzQzNjAzNDkx*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzYwNzMyNi4xNy4xLjE3NDM2MDgyNjIuMC4wLjA.">141 games with start up issues</a>, including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, Doom: Eternal, Final Fantasy, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a>.</p>
<p>As for games with <a href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf?_gl=1*xvm77x*_gcl_au*MTY1ODE0OTE3NC4xNzQxNjA5OTkx*_ga*MTQ5ODE5NDYyNS4xNzQzNjAzNDkx*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MzYwNzMyNi4xNy4xLjE3NDM2MDgyNjIuMC4wLjA.">in-game compatibility issues</a>, there are 47. That includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a>, Fall Guys, Harvestella, and Overcooked! All You Can Eat.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of games that are playable on Switch 2 but require an original Switch Joy-Con to play - these are mostly motion-controlled games.</p>
<p>For instance, the Joy-Con 2 won't fit in the Ring Fit Adventure Ring-Con; they don't include an IR Motion Camera for 1-2-Switch, WarioWare: Move It! or Game Builder Garage; Everybody 1-2-Switch will be more difficult as the force feedback of vibrations has been reduced in Joy-Con 2; Joy-Con 2 don't fit in the leg strap for the soccer mode of Nintendo Switch Sports.</p>
<p>There are also compatibility issues with the Labo Variety Kit, Robot Kit, and Vehicle Kit.</p>
