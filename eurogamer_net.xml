            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-frightfully-british-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-and-sequel-plans-are-already-in-discussion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Atomfall - the seudo-apocalyptic survival game set in 1950s rural England - was "immediately profitable" for developer Rebellion, and now talks of a sequel are already afoot.</p>
<p>Atomfall released back in March across PC, PlayStation and Xbox. It was also available on both Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, likely bolstering its popularity. Speaking to Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass">GamesIndustry.biz</a> last month, Rebellion head Jason Kingsley noted that much of Atomfall's success could be attributed to its release on Game Pass, stating it "does mitigate risk" and guarantees "a certain level of income" for a studio.</p>
<p>But, even though it was indeed available to play via Xbox's subscription service, of course meaning players did not have to buy the game outright if they already had Game Pass, Atomfall still made back its development costs more or less straight off the (cricket) bat.</p>

<p>This nugget comes from Rebellion head Jason Kingsley, who sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59eD2qMEcR8">The Game Business</a> to reflect on the launch of Atomfall and the industry in general.</p>
<p>During this chat, the studio affirmed the studio has DLC for Atomfall planned, but also that the idea of a sequel or a spin-off has already been floated, saying Rebellion of course wants to "keep on making games" in the future.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Rebellion wants to "continue to make more good games," Kingsley said. "We've now got the challenge of a massive new success in Atomfall. What do we do in the future with Atomfall? Well… we've got DLC coming up," he continued before adding: "We're talking about what do we do about sequels? Do we do spin-offs?"</p>
<p>So, is a sequel something you would like to see for Atomfall?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-release-breaks-records-for-sniper-elite-studio-though-i-thought-wed-have-drunk-more-tea">Atomfall was Rebellion's "most successful launch" ever</a>, and soon after it was released the studio celebrated 1.5 million players joining in the oh so rather British fun. At this time, the studio revealed we had managed to devour 4m pasties, and savour 300,000 cups of tea in the game, though those numbers are likely even higher now.</p>
<p>If you haven't played Atomfall for yourself yet, but are curious about it all, you can check out our review. "If you can get over a difficult start and fancy a lean take on the survival genre, Atomfall delivers an intriguing tale worth discovering," our Tom wrote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-review">awarding the game three Eurogamer stars</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Doug Cockle, the voice of Geralt in The Witcher games, has called out so-called fans as "stupid" for describing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> as "woke" for having Ciri as the protagonist.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">revealed the next game and its protagonist last year</a>, though some have already criticised the studio as "woke" for having a female protagonist.</p>
<p>"That's just stupid," said Cockle in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufg-mhMsR7o">video published by Fall Damage</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke">IGN</a>). "There's nothing woke about it."</p>

<p>He continued: "[Ciri's] a cool character from The Witcher, and they're going to focus on that character. I think that's awesome. We can't just have Geralt for every single game for The Witcher ad nauseum, through eternity. Besides, we've seen the end of Geralt's journey - Blood and Wine was supposed to wrap up Geralt's journey.</p>
<p>"I celebrate Ciri. I celebrate her being the protagonist. So all you people who think it's woke… [blows raspberry]."</p>
<p>He added fans of the game should also read the books.</p>
<p>"If you read the books then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue," said Cockle. "There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it. If you think it's woke, read the damn books!"</p>
<p>Following the reveal of The Witcher 4, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">CD Projekt spoke to Eurogamer about the fan reaction to Ciri</a> as the protagonist.</p>
<p>"So I can really understand if some people, you know, might have wished to play another game with Geralt - like I can say myself, I could make games about Geralt until the day I die, and I would probably die happy," said narrative director Philipp Weber.</p>
<p>"But I think for me, and I think for all of us [at CDPR], it's also just really exciting to see all the opportunities that Ciri brings us, both with her character, and also by just virtue of who she is, what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well. So I think the best answer for us, for those people that really are worried right now, is basically to show them, when we are ready, that we really do this well and with care. And I think - I hope - we can then convince them with the game itself. Because I think actions speak louder than words."</p>
<p>Earlier this year the studio stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">doesn't plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026</a>, meaning it could end up being a next generation game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is finally back on iOS devices in the US and Europe, after a five-year legal battle between Epic and Apple.</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">"peace proposal" being offered by Epic</a> at the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-blocks-fortnites-return-to-iphone-in-us">Apple later blocked the return of Fortnite</a> in the US. When Epic returned to the judge of the legal case to review its Fortnite submission, the judge responded Apple is "fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing" and warned the official who is "personally responsible for ensuring compliance" would have to return for a hearing (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">TheVerge</a>).</p>
<p>The two companies have since filed a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25949416-joint-notice/">joint notice</a> stating they have "resolved all issues".</p>

<p>As such, Fortnite has now returned to iOS devices, with Epic boss Tim Sweeney writing on social media "we back fam".</p>

<p>Though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">Fortnite had already returned to iOS devices in the European Union</a>, Apple's block of the game in the US delayed a regular update to the game, forcing all versions to be taken down.</p>
<p>Of course, the UK is no longer in the EU, meaning Fortnite is not yet available here on iOS. It's <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1794096002762244392">expected in the second half of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">Epic added a direct in-game payment option in Fortnite</a> to circumvent Apple and Google's official in-app purchase options, from which those companies take a 30 percent cut.</p>
<p>In retaliation, Apple pulled Fortnite from its App Store, sparking the five-year feud.</p>
<p>A verdict was finally reached earlier this month, when the US District Court of Northern California found Apple in "wilful violation" of the court's previous injunction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing".</p>
<p>That injunction meant Apple had to allow purchases for apps from outside websites, to which it agreed but levied a 27 percent fee. The court stated this move "strains credulity" and that Apple's goal "was to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream". The court verdict added: "In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction."</p>
<p>Sweeney wrote on social media "Game over for the Apple Tax" and stated Fortnite would return to the iOS App store. Now, it finally has.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1924970858558128424">social media last night</a>, Sweeney said: "Thanks to everyone who supported the effort to open up mobile competition and #FreeFortnite from the very beginning. And thanks to all of the folks who initially sided with Apple then later came around to the winning side, supporting app developer rights and consumer rights."</p>
<p>Fortnite has immediately risen to the top free game on iOS in the US.</p>
<p>Epic has this week been in hot water due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-now-lets-you-chat-with-darth-vader-using-generative-ai-speech">addition of AI Darth Vader to Fortnite</a>, which was quickly used to spout bad language. A hot fix has since been issued, but actors' union <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-files-unfair-labour-practice-charge-against-fortnite-maker-epic-following-ai-generated-darth-vader-voice-lines">SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labour practice charge</a> in retaliation for the use of AI.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda has announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> has become the "biggest launch" in id Software's history.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244">shared the news on social media</a>, adding three million players had made their way into the fiery pits of hell since the game's release this month.</p>
<p>To put that into more context, Bethesda says Doom: The Dark Ages reached this number seven times faster than Doom Eternal.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1924819963623174653">According to SteamDB</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages topped sales charts for the PC storefront during the week of 13 May - 20 May 2025. It was followed by the Steam Deck in second place, while the remainder of the Steam top five for that week was rounded out by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>While this launch is no doubt an impressive achievement for all those involved in Doom: The Dark Ages' release, it is worth noting that the game was also made available to play via Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1924954084269777113">The Game Business co-founder Chris Dring</a> states that of those three million players, over two million came from Xbox according to figures from Ampere.</p>

<p>We were rather taken with Doom: The Dark Ages, with Chris Donlan calling it a "more grounded" series entry, but "one that's as brisk and playful" as ever.</p>
<p>"As a parent, the game I'm most concerned about these days is probably something like Roblox. By contrast, Doom feels like an entirely known and understood entity. Let's savour it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Eurogamer's Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>. "Here's a slice of pure gaming charisma that has come to us, unfrazzled, from a more innocent time.</p>
