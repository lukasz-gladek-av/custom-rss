            <p>
We're coming up to a year since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-long-awaited-private-servers-arrive-next-week">launched its long-requested private servers</a>, and with that first anniversary looming, Rare has announced it's making some welcome changes, finally allowing players to earn full rewards while sailing in Safer Seas mode.
</p>
<p>
Safer Seas, if you're unfamiliar, provides a means for a single crew of up to four pirates to sail Sea of Thieves' entire open-world map without the ever-looming PvP threat of High Seas mode. While the absence of other crews means a good chunk of PvP focussed content is unavailable in Safer Seas, players <em>can</em> still tackle emergent PvE events, complete Trading Company voyages, and embark on narrative-driven Tall Tales.
</p>
<p>
Crucially too, it's possible to earn gold to spend on cosmetics and to increase Trading Company standing by earning reputation in Safer Seas - but both of these have been capped at 30 percent of the amount you'd ordinarily earn in High Seas until now, making things a bit of a drag for pirates who just want to, say, have a chill time raising funds for a shiny new figurehead away from the hubbub of Sea of Thieves' main mode.

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pzdHh1ALXc">new developer update</a>, however, Rare has acknowledged Safer Seas' "punishingly restrictive rewards", admitting they're working against its intention of providing an "onboarding ramp for new players". As such, it'll be increasing the current gold and reputation payout rate all the way up to 100 percent, matching the rewards earned in High Seas. There's a trade-off, though; the studio is dropping Safer Seas' level cap down from 40 to 25.
</p><p>
Essentially, that means players wanting to work their way up to Pirate Legend status and gain access to the various Trading Company cosmetics unlocked along the way will now need to hop over to High Seas much sooner. On the flip side, players looking for a safe environment to learn the ropes, or for a more relaxed space to amass gold or Seasonal Renown (which continues to be awarded at a 100 percent rate in Safer Seas) can now do so completely unhindered. It is, admittedly, a shame the Hunter's Call faction has been slapped with a lower level cap given how perfect Safer Seas mode is for a evening of quietly contemplative fishing (and given the Trading Company's already glacial reward payouts), but perhaps that'll be something - alongside the use of Captaincy ships, pretty please Rare - revisted as a Christmas treat <em>next</em> year.
</p>
<p>
In other Sea of Thieves news, players will soon get their hands on a number of features originally promised for the start of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-stealthy-season-14-grapple-guns-toward-an-october-release-date">current stealth-focused Season 14</a>, but which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-temporarily-yanks-nearly-all-its-big-new-stealth-features-following-significant-issues">pulled en masse</a> as part of "drastic steps" following a disastrous launch in October. Once Rare releases its next patch this Thursday, 14th November, players can finally lay traps, hang from ledges while sneaking, and wear disguises. Rare is also promising a number of "high impact" fixes, putting a stop to players using crouch to gain a firing speed advantage, and preventing pirates grabbing supplies from barrels after moving out of range. Additionally, measures have been introduced to stop players swiping treasure from the Fort of the Damned's vault by swimming underneath.
</p>
<p>
The studio notes this week's update has gained "additional [testing] time internally and with insiders", and that the team has also been trialling a new process enabling it to address critical experience issues as it locks down each build. "There's been a concerted effort across the team to improve on quality control", says Rare, and plans are also now in motion for "broader improvements for quality at the studio", with more details to come.
</p>
<p>
And finally, players sailing the Sea of Thieves within the first week of tomorrow's update will earn bonus gold and doubloons, alongside a Lucrative Voyage of Luck or Legendary Voyage of Luck for Pirate Legends. These bonuses will now be offered with every monthly update.

            <p>
Warcraft, you might have noticed, is 30 this year (this <em>week</em> in fact, if you want to be more specific), and Blizzard is celebrating the occasion with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efhAa3zYZLw">bit of a news splurge</a> covering its various games set in the Warcraft universe. And that, of course, includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, with today bringing word the long-running MMO will soon see customisable cars, the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft-classic">World of Warcraft Classic</a> <em>Classic</em>, plus player houses sometime next year.
</p>
<p>
On the World of Warcraft Classic front, Blizzard has announced it'll be launching <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria">Mists of Pandaria</a> Classic in 2025, with a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24148499/catch-up-on-the-future-of-warcraft-with-the-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct">roadmap accompanying the news</a> pointing to a pre-patch drop early next summer, before the full release a little later on. Additionally, it's confirmed the impending arrival of World of Warcraft Classic Classic (not <em>strictly</em> an official title), which introduces new fresh realms as part of a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24156594/relive-your-adventure-with-the-wow-classic-20th-anniversary-edition">WoW Classic 20th Anniversary Edition</a> launching on 21st November this year. These will be available in PvP, PvE, and Hardcore flavours, all progressing through to Burning Crusade Classic (Classic?) next year.
</p>
<p>
Over in World of Warcraft regular, meanwhile, patch 11.0.7 is on the horizon, introducing the Siren Isle as this year's The War Within expansion continues to unfold. That's alongside a revamped Winter Veil event for the festive season, and the previously announced return of WoW's battle royale-style Plunderstorm mode, which is making a comeback next year.

<p>
And as for what's next, that'll be WoW's 11.1 update, officially known as Undermined, releasing this winter. Undermined takes players to the capital city of the goblin's trade empire - called, yes, Undermine - where they'll learn more about goblin culture as The War Within's story continues, aligning themselves with one of the four warring goblins cartels: Steamwheedle, Blackwater, Bilgewater, and the Venture Company.
</p><p>
There's a lot going on in update 11.1, including a new dungeon, Operation: Floodgate, which'll see players racing to stop a group of goblins from blowing up a dam that would bring ruin to the Ringing Deeps. This'll be immediately available as part of Season 2's dungeon pool, alongside four other launch dungeons and three returning legacy dungeons - including Motherlode from Battle for Azeroth. There's also a new arena PvP map set in the heart of the city, plus an eight-boss raid zone - The Liberation of Undermine - taking players through the city's streets and into the colourful but deadly Gallagio, where its owner, Gallywix, awaits.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
Undermined's most notable addition, however, is the introduction of cars, which players will earn early on in their quest, enabling them to barrel through Undermine's streets "much, much faster" than a regular ground mount would allow. Better yet, car characteristics - grip, drift, acceleration, top speed, and so on - can all be customised to suit players' tastes.
</p>
<p>
Blizzard has plenty more planned for World of Warcraft in 2025, of course, with its roadmap outlining various new content drops as the year continues. That includes the MMO's next expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight, which continues the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcrafts-the-war-within-expansion-kickstarts-worldsoul-saga-next-year">Worldsoul Saga</a> started in The War Within. And while Blizzard is mostly keeping tightlipped about Midnight for now, it <em>has</em> teased - via its favoured medium of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4">cinematic reveal trailer</a> - the introduction of player houses. It'll likely be some time, however, before it's ready to share more.
</p><p>
In other Warcraft news, Blizzard has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-warcraft-1-2-remasters-are-official-and-out-now-on-pc">announced remasters of Warcraft 1 and 2</a>, which real-time strategy fans can purchase via - either on their own or as part of a new $39.99 USD Battle Chest bundle containing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warcraft-iii-reforged">Warcraft 3: Reforged</a> - starting today.
