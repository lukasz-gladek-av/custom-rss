Following yesterday's long-awaited Switch 2 reveal, Nintendo has started opening up registrations for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">previously announced public hands-on play sessions</a>, confirming that attendees will have up to four hours play tie with the new console.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Switch 2 World Tour, as the company's calling the months-long event, runs from 4th April until sometime in June. It's set to visit 15 cities spanning four continents - Europe, North America, Oceania, and Asia - in that time, starting with Paris and New York.
</p>
<p>
And for those eager to attend and check out Nintendo's new console, <a href="https://experience.nintendo.com/#/events">registrations are starting to go live</a>. Currently, registration is open for most European venues - Paris, London, Milan, Berlin - with other Madrid, Amsterdam, and venues in other territories to follow.

<p>
What's perhaps most notable is the length of time attendees can spend with Switch 2. Anyone looking to go hands-on must select a 60-minute arrival window when they register, but actual play sessions officially last four hours. In Europe, at least - details currently available for North American venues point to significantly shorter play sessions, lasting two and a half hours.
</p><p>
It's worth reiterating registration doesn't guarantee entry to Nintendo's hands-on events, as tickets will be assigned based on a randomly selected draw. You can, however, register as a group - provided everyone attending has a Nintendo Account linked to the same family group.
</p>
<p>
As to what'll be available to play during each session, Nintendo hasn't yet said - but it seems likely a new Mario Kart will be there given its prominence in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">this week's Switch 2 reveal</a>. We can expect more details on the console's launch line-up during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's Switch 2 Direct on 2nd April</a>, but in the meantime, here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">everything we know so far</a>.
