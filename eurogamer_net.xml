Former Activision Blizzard boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> has branded the 2016 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> film "terrible" and "one of the worst movies I've ever seen".
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick shared his frustrations with Blizzard's attempt to turn the Warcraft MMO into a movie success, and said the project had been a "huge distraction" for the company that ended up causing delays to World of Warcraft game updates.
</p>
<p>
So why did Kotick let it all happen? Apparently, the deal to make the film happen had already been signed before Activision snapped up Blizzard in 2008.
</p>
<p>
"World of Warcraft, the movie... I thought was a terrible idea," Kotick said. "They had signed the deal before we owned the company. It took loads of resources and distracted them.
</p>
<p>
"Think about all the people who make video games for a living, and now have a chance to make a movie. They were, like, helping with the casting, and they're on the set... it's just a huge distraction. Our expansions were late, patches weren't getting done on time."
</p>
<p>
Legendary Blizzard developer Chris Metzen was burned out by the project, Kotick continued, and only returned to Blizzard years later after Kotick "begged" him to come back.
</p>
<p>
"And the movie was terrible," Kotick concluded. "It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-movie-director-outlines-what-would-have-happened-in-the-trilogy">Plans had been in place to make a full World of Warcraft film trilogy</a>, but they were scrapped after the movie flopped at the US box office.
</p>
<p>
"You have what amounts to the most expensive lore wiki ever made," former editor Oli Welsh wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-warcraft-movie-is-too-faithful-by-half">Eurogamer's World of Warcraft movie review</a>. "A film whose ending will have no impact for anyone who doesn't know who or what Thrall is; and a story whose greatest moments all lie in sequels that will, in all likelihood, never get made."

Former Activision Blizzard boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> has said he desperately wanted the rights to make a Jurassic Park video game - and created a bizarre personal pitch to movie director Steven Spielberg before the first film came out.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick said the proposal to Spielberg was "nuts" and the only time he ever pitched Spielberg after hearing that the legendary director had been interested in video games.
</p>
<p>
Alas, the pitch was unsuccessful. But the story of what Kotick did is still a good tale.
</p>
<p>
"I had a board member who was Spielberg's lawyer, and he called me and said - 'Spielberg wants to make video games, he loves video games... we'll come to you first'," Kotick recalled.
</p>
<p>
"The only time I ever pitched anything to Steven was I really wanted the rights to Jurassic Park. I was friends with Michael Crichton and I had read the manuscript and I thought 'this is going to make a great game'. So I called Michael and said 'what do I need to do to get the game rights to this?' He said 'you gotta get them from Spielberg, he owns the rights'. 
</p>
<p>
"I built... I had to make a manuscript - our proposal was a manuscript - of what we were gonna make, and I put it in, like, a dinosaur egg, in a crate," Kotick said. "I went nuts. It was all I wanted.
</p>
<p>
"I knew him [Spielberg], but I had all my friends who were good friends with him call him and say 'you know Bobby really wants to do this'. And I called him up and I said 'what do you think?' And he's like 'great pitch, great vision for what you want to do with the game'.
</p>
<p>
"He said 'I really want you to do it, I really would like you to do it, so pay the most money'. 
</p>
<p>
"And Konami ended up giving him some crazy guarantee and we didn't get the rights. And I was bummed too because I thought it would have made an incredible game.'"
</p>
<p>
It's now been a year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-kotick-departs-in-just-a-few-days">since Kotick departed Activision Blizzard</a> after a long and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-boss-bobby-kotick-under-fire-after-damning-report-into-what-he-knew-of-workplace-abuse">frequently controversial tenure</a> at the top of the company. Last autumn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/behind-the-scenes-at-blizzard-jason-schreier-talks-misconduct-swingers-parties-and-what-press-got-wrong">Eurogamer sat down with Bloomberg writer Jason Schreier for more detail on life behind the scenes at Activision Blizzard</a> - featuring plenty of chat about Kotick's time and influence at the firm.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crysis">Crysis</a> developer Crytek is the next studio hit by layoffs, as it announces it's set to lose an estimated 15 percent of its 400 employees.</p>
<p>That's around 60 people, with both development teams and shared services affected.</p>
<p>The studio put development of its next Crysis game on hold last year to focus on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> 1896, but has described the layoffs as "inevitable to move forward".</p>

<p>Crytek shared a statement on social media as follows:</p>
<p>"Like so many of our peers, we aren't immune to the complex, unfavourable market dynamics that have hit our industry these past several years," it reads.</p>
<p>"It pains us greatly to share today that we must lay off an estimated 15 percent of our around 400 employees. The layoffs affect development teams and shared services. This has not been an easy decision to make, as we deeply appreciate the hard work of our talented teams. After putting the development of the next Crysis game on hold in Q3 2024, we have been trying to shift developers over to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>
<p>"While Hunt: Showdown 1896 is still growing, Crytek cannot continue as before and remain financially sustainable. Even after ongoing efforts to reduce costs and cut operating expenses, we have determined that layoffs are inevitable to move forward. Crytek will offer affected employees severance packages and career assistance services."</p>
<p>The statement ends with the studio affirming its commitment to Hunt: Showdown 1896.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ninja-gaiden-2">Ninja Gaiden 2</a> Black has received a major update, adding a New Game+ mode and a photo mode.</p>
<p>New Game+ allows players to begin a new game on any difficulty level previously cleared with all weapons and Ninpo spells unlocked (though they revert to level one).</p>
<p>Photo mode, meanwhile, is accessed in the options menu and allows players to pause the action and move the camera around to take screenshots. It's pretty basic, but a nice addition.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the update, on top of a handful of bug fixes, players can now hide their projectile weapon for a cleaner look, and Team Ninja has made a few balance adjustments.</p>
<p>Specifically, these mainly impact missions where players take control of Ryu's various female companions: the enemies in chapters 8 and 11 have had their HP lowered, while the number of enemies in chapters 13 and 14 (the latter played as Ryu) has been raised. Ayane has also seen a buff to her attacks.</p>
<p>The full patch notes can be found on the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng2black/us/update/">Team Ninja website</a>.</p>
<p>The update is available now across all versions: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Microsoft Store, Steam).</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was shadow dropped at the recent Xbox Developer Direct - it's a revised version of the Xbox 360 game Ninja Gaiden 2, with elements from its Sigma release on PS3.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-ninja-gaiden-2-black-isnt-perfect-but-its-the-best-version-yet">Digital Foundry described the release</a> as "the best version yet", though it's not perfect.</p>
<p>The release comes ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, with Team Ninja collaborating with action game experts PlatinumGames and adding in a new playable protagonist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Another wave of redundancies has hit Unity, the company behind the ubiquitous video games engine.
</p>
<p>
The latest job losses - which appear to include all members of some teams - are the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-likely-to-announce-layoffs-to-cut-costs">sixth in the past three years</a>, during which time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-makes-further-job-cuts-as-it-ends-agreement-with-weta-fx">roughly 3500 staff</a> have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unity-starts-2024-by-laying-off-1800-employees-as-part-of-ongoing-reset">been let go</a>.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, Unity team members impacted by the latest cull reportedly woke to find out their fate via an email sent from a noreply@unity address at 5am Pacific time, stating their role had been "eliminated" by organisational changes (thanks, <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-unity-suddenly-lays-off-numerous-developers-with-a-5-am-email/">80.lv</a>).
</p>
<p>
Unity CEO Matthrew Bromberg later confirmed the job cuts in an internal memo, obtained by <a href="https://80.lv/articles/exclusive-unity-ceo-s-internal-announcement-to-staff-amidst-the-layoffs/">80.lv</a>, in which he mentioned the repeated nature of job losses at the company.
</p>
<p>
"I know that there is some exhaustion associated with prior changes at Unity that haven't delivered the promised results, but 2025 is going to be the year where we bring to market products and services that will transform our position in the marketplace and provide a springboard to long-term growth," Bromberg claimed.
</p>
<p>
Impacted staff say the latest cuts amount to "mass layoffs", including senior staff who had been at the company for years.
</p>
<p>
Included in the cuts are the entire Unity Behavior development team, which worked on a visual tool for programming NPCs and objects.
</p>
<p>
One affected team member, Shanee Nishry, reported that everyone working on the project had been let go in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1imk2qv/unity_just_laid_off_the_entire_staff_for_their/">post on reddit</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, we were told today that our team is included in the latest round of layoffs and we will not be able to support you any longer," Nishry wrote. "I've reached out to leadership to ask if they can open-source the project, but there is no guarantee."
</p>
<p>
Unity has yet to tell staff the total number of jobs lost. Eurogamer has contacted the company for comment.

<p>Last year also saw Remedy release two DLCs for the game: Night Springs in June, and The Lake House in October.</p>
<p>The company credits these expansions, along with the physical edition release, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch, and other ongoing quality of life updates for Alan Wake 2's long-term sales.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the report, Remedy reaffirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">FBC: Firebreak will release this year</a> - it's a three-player co-op first-person shooter set in the world of Control.</p>
<p>Remakes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 and 2 are in "full production" together with publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>, though remain without a release date.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> will enter full production at the end of this month.</p>
<p>We're yet to see anything official on Control 2, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Alan Wake 2's Lake House DLC perhaps hints at what to expect</a> as the two games will be linked.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
