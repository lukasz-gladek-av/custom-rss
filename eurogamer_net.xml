            <p>
As part of tonight's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, developer Remedy Entertainment has shown off a little more of its upcoming three-player co-op Control spin-off, FBC: Firebreak, with a more substantial reveal now confirmed to be airing next Thursday, 24th April.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak, for the uninitiated, casts players as members of the Federal Bureau of Control's Firebreak division, a team of volunteer first responders charged with roaming the ever-changing Oldest House and keeping its unconfined paranatural anomalies in check.
</p>
<p>
When last we saw FBC: Firebreak, Remedy was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">showing off a mission involving a rampant spread of sentient Post-It notes</a>, but its latest trailer - which maintains the same quippy tone - goes all in on rampaging furnaces and an outbreak of pink exploding goo (AKA Exogenic Mass) as players attempt to regain control of the Oldest House's Maintenance Sector.

<p>
These are just two more of the otherworldly hazards players may face as their team embarks on new Jobs at the behest of FBC uppermanagement, each chaotic mission taking them to different areas of the Oldest House - some familiar and some new - and featuring different mechanics, enemies, objectives, and even status-effect-style conditions.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak already looks to offer a promising extradimensional twist on the co-operative shooter - and one mercifully free of time-sucking live-service trappings, at that - and it's set to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this "summer". However, those eager to learn more about Remedy's latest can tune into a <a href="http://twitch.tv/remedygames">special Twitch livestream</a> at 6pm BST/10am PDT next Thursday, 24th April, when the studio is promising "brand new content and exciting news".
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak isn't the only game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">currently in the works at Remedy</a>, of course. It's also collaborating with Rockstar to remake <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2, and there'll be more opportunity to revisit the Oldest House away from FBC: Firebreak thanks to fully fledged sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.
