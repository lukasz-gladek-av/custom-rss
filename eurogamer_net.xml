            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is clamping down on what it calls "disruptive behaviour" - specifically, players going AFK to boost account levels without playing, or playing on alternative servers via VPNs.
</p>
<p>
The franchise's Ricochet Anti-Cheat technology has been tuned to better detect AFK players who load into matches simply to gather XP without any intention of playing, disrupting team balance and infuriating team mates. 
</p>
<p>
Anyone looking to unlock Ranked Play will now need to win 50 match-made multiplayer matches before doing so, in order to ensure Ranked players are at the correct skill level (presumably, to give less experienced players a chance to improve but also stop sweaty veterans making fresh accounts that get matched with newbies). 
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, this change is also designed to give Ricochet a cache of match history data to "examine", with top players further looked into via a Replay Investigation Tool to ensure everyone's playing by the rules. 
</p>
<p>
These updates will also apply to Ranked Play when it arrives in Call of Duty Warzone, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes">patch notes</a> state.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday we took a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-battle-pass-includes-a-parasite-skin-for-some-reason">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Season 1 battle pass</a>, which includes a parasite skin and what looks like a rip-off of Rocket Raccoon.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warzone-black-ops-6-season-1-release-date-time">Call of Duty Warzone and Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> launches today at 5pm UK time. </p>
<p>"For a series built on high-octane thrills and explosive gratification, its withdrawal to the well-trodden formula echoes the wider industry's continued allergy to risk," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will add the ability to trade cards with other players at the start of 2025, the smash hit smartphone game's development team has confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
Before then, the game will also be refreshed with the launch of new booster packs due "by the end of the year".
</p>
<p>
In a development update posted to X, the Pokémon TCG Pocket team said it was "aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be traded starting in January 2025". It's unclear, however, which cards these might be limited to, and what other costs or limitations might be involved.

<p>
Pokémon TCG Pocket's plan to add fresh booster packs before the end of 2024 lines up with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-expansion-due-late-january-leak-suggests">recent datamine which suggested at least one additional pack would arrive in December</a>, before a fully-fledged new expansion due on 29th January next year. 
</p>
<p>
That datamine also highlighted in-progress work on a new card rarity and rare card picks being added to the Wonder Pick mechanic. As ever, however, datamined details are subject to change.
</p>
<p>
"We have other new features in development outside of the trade feature," the Pokémon TCG Pocket team wrote. "We plan to announce more details about the update as the dates for the addition of these features are finalised, so please look forward to it.
</p>
<p>
"We hope you continue to enjoy Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket. Don't forget to open your packs each day!"

            <p>
We're coming up to a year since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-long-awaited-private-servers-arrive-next-week">launched its long-requested private servers</a>, and with that first anniversary looming, Rare has announced it's making some welcome changes, finally allowing players to earn full rewards while sailing in Safer Seas mode.
</p>
<p>
Safer Seas, if you're unfamiliar, provides a means for a single crew of up to four pirates to sail Sea of Thieves' entire open-world map without the ever-looming PvP threat of High Seas mode. While the absence of other crews means a good chunk of PvP focussed content is unavailable in Safer Seas, players can still tackle emergent PvE events, complete Trading Company voyages, and embark on narrative-driven Tall Tales.
</p>
<p>
Crucially too, it's possible to earn gold to spend on cosmetics and to increase Trading Company standing by earning reputation in Safer Seas - but both of these have been capped at 30 percent of the amount you'd ordinarily earn in High Seas until now. That's made things a bit of a drag for pirates who just want to, say, have a chill time raising funds for a shiny new figurehead away from the hubbub of Sea of Thieves' main mode.

<p>
In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pzdHh1ALXc">new developer update</a>, however, Rare has acknowledged Safer Seas' "punishingly restrictive rewards", admitting they're working against its intention of providing an "onboarding ramp for new players". As such, it'll be increasing the current gold and reputation payout rate all the way up to 100 percent, matching the rewards earned in High Seas. There's a trade-off, though; the studio is dropping Safer Seas' level cap down from 40 to 25.
</p><p>
Essentially, that means players wanting to work their way up to Pirate Legend status and gain access to the various Trading Company cosmetics unlocked along the way will now need to hop over to High Seas much sooner. On the flip side, players looking for a safe environment to learn the ropes, or for a more relaxed space to amass gold or Seasonal Renown (still awarded at a 100 percent rate in Safer Seas) can now do so completely unhindered. It is, admittedly, a shame the Hunter's Call faction has been slapped with a lower level cap given how perfect Safer Seas mode is for a evening of quietly contemplative fishing (and given the Trading Company's already glacial reward payouts), but perhaps that'll be something - alongside the use of Captaincy ships, pretty please Rare - revisted as a Christmas treat <em>next</em> year.
</p>
<p>
In other Sea of Thieves news, players will soon get their hands on a number of features originally promised for the start of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-stealthy-season-14-grapple-guns-toward-an-october-release-date">current stealth-focused Season 14</a>, but which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-temporarily-yanks-nearly-all-its-big-new-stealth-features-following-significant-issues">pulled en masse</a> as part of "drastic steps" following a disastrous launch in October. Once Rare releases its next patch this Thursday, 14th November, players can finally lay traps, hang from ledges while sneaking, and wear disguises. Rare is also promising a number of "high impact" fixes, putting a stop to players using crouch to gain a firing speed advantage, and preventing pirates grabbing supplies from barrels after moving out of range. Additionally, measures have been introduced to stop players swiping treasure from the Fort of the Damned's vault by swimming underneath.
</p>
<p>
The studio notes this week's update has gained "additional [testing] time internally and with Insiders", and that the team has also been trialling a new process enabling it to address critical experience issues as it locks down each build. "There's been a concerted effort across the team to improve on quality control", says Rare, and plans are also now in motion for "broader improvements for quality at the studio", with more details to come.
</p>
<p>
And finally, players sailing the Sea of Thieves within the first week of tomorrow's update will earn bonus gold and doubloons, alongside a Lucrative Voyage of Luck or Legendary Voyage of Luck for Pirate Legends. These bonuses will now be offered with every monthly update.
