            <p>
In an announcement set to send shockwaves through wallets everywhere, Lego has announced it will launch a Pokémon-themed range in 2026.
</p>
<p>
Lego's reveal today offers little other than two logos sat next to each other on a website, but already the company's accountants will rubbing their paws. Oh, and there's a Pikachu tail made of Lego too. That's nice.
</p>
<p>"Electrify your imagination in 2026 and get ready to build something we've never built with Lego bricks before!" the company has teased.</p>
<p>
Pokémon has - for a long time - partnered with Mega Bloks to release various buildable sets. No longer, it appears! While Pokémon is not owned by Nintendo per se, the two companies are closely linked, and this announcement follows several <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">successful Lego ranges based around Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing</a>.
</p>
<p>
At a guess, I'd say we're likely to see buildable models of Pokémon that you can pop on your desk or in your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/ikea">Ikea</a> kallax, rather than Lego playsets featuring Pallet Town. But I'd love an Ash Ketchum minifigure, Lego, so please do consider it.
</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a press release accompanying the announcement from The Lego Group states that it and Pokémon "both have a long history of pushing the boundaries of social play, which is at the core of this partnership". 
</p>
<p>"For the first time, the Lego Group will be bringing the most loved Pokémon to life in a brand-new way, with play experiences that will delight new and existing fans alike," the press release states. Is this hinting at some new kind of NFC toy integration, perhaps to see Pokémon battle other players' sets?</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to be working with a brand that has such a deep and passionate fanbase as Pokémon, partnering to give our joint audiences what they have been asking us for," Lego chief product and marketing officer Julia Goldin  said in a statement today. "We strongly believe that through the endless possibilities of Lego play and the exciting adventures the world of Pokémon brings, this partnership will create a range of new possibilities for Trainers and builders alike."</p><p>

"The Lego Group and Pokémon have strong shared values of imagination, creativity and fun, making this the perfect partnership to deliver unique, meaningful and engaging ways for Trainers to experience the Pokémon brand," added The Pokémon Company chief product and experience officer Gaku Susai. "Working with the best-in-class team at the Lego Group and seeing their dedication and passion for the project has culminated in an innovative and groundbreaking collaboration that will surprise and delight fans. We cannot wait to see both Lego fans and the Pokémon community's reactions in 2026."

<p>Elsewhere in Lego-related news, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/18-lego-mario-kart-set-leaks-online">Nintendo announced The Lego Super Mario: Mario Kart - Mario &amp; Standard Kart set</a>. This particular set features a buildable Mario complete with a posable head and arms. The Nintendo mascot is sitting behind the wheel of Mario Kart's Standard Kart, described as "the most iconic Mario Kart vehicle of all".</p>
<p>Back in the world of video games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">Pokémon Legends: Z-A will launch for Nintendo Switch</a> (and presumably there will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version) late this year. It's a bit of a longer wait than we were expecting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
