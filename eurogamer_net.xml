EA's free-to-play Skate reboot is officially gearing up to launch into early access this "summer", narrowing down its previous "2025" release window. But first, it'll receive its "biggest playtest update" yet, which will be made available to all registered Insiders starting on 2nd July.
</p>
<p>
This latest iteration of Skate was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">formally unveiled in 2022</a> as an "authentic evolution" of the beloved skateboarding series, and is being developed by Full Circle, a studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-full-circle-the-new-studio-working-on-the-next-skate">specifically set up to work on the project</a>. Its team - which includes original Skate creators Deran Chung and Cuz Parry - has been intermitently sharing progress reports since then, and select players have even been able to participate in early closed playtests.
</p>
<p>
Playtests were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-is-finally-ready-for-playtesting-heres-how-to-get-involved">expanded to consoles at the start of this year</a> (and were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-doesnt-yet-have-a-full-release-date-but-already-has-microtransactions">rapidly followed by microtransactions</a>), and EA now says it'll be opening playtests up to everyone, provided they've registered their interest before 27th June. This comes ahead of Skate's "biggest playtest update yet", which will pave the way for its early access release this "summer".

<p>
Skate's impending update is officially titled Update 0.27.0, and promises "upgrades, changes, fixes, and performance improvements". EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-three">goes into a little more detail in its blog post</a>, but playtest participants can expect a visual overhaul, bringing the likes of increased environmental detail, improved lighting and shadows, better textures and effects, UI enhancements, and an increase in players per server to 150.
</p>
<p>
That's alongside more missions and challenges - EA says players will now find over 140 challenges around the city of San Vansterdam - plus expanded character customisation options (including more hairstyles, gestures, and emotes), and overhauled progression and rewards.
</p>
<p>
EA's blog post also contains answer to some frequently asked questions (no to keyboard and mouse support, yes to cross-progression, for instance), but the important bit is that anyone wanting to experience Skate's impending playtest update on 2nd July will need to have <a href="https://skate.game/insider">registered as an Insider</a> by 27th June, with access invitations set to go out in waves. Registration will no longer be available after this point, as Full Circle makes final preparations for Skate's "summer" early access launch. It sounds like summer might be nearing its end by the time Skate arrives, however, given EA also says the game is now "just months away".

            <p>
Following last year's slam-dunk <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, the beloved survival horror sequel is being reinterpreted yet again, this time in the form of new movie adaptation Return to Silent Hill. And now, three years after its announcement, it's been given a release date of 23rd January 2026.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">originally unveiled in 2022</a>, alongside a variety of gaming projects including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-fails-to-impress-with-greedy-monetisation-and-cluttered-ui">unloved Silent Hill: Ascension</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">masterful Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and No Code's still-mysterious Silent Hill Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Amid that flurry of gaming news, Return to Silent Hill was perhaps a little lost in the throng, but the key bit of information was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">see Christophe Gans take on directing duties once more</a>. Gans, of course, previously helmed 2006's Sean-Bean-starring original Silent Hill movie, which certainly captured the game series' atmosphere - even if it did all start to fall apart in the last stretch, when it suddenly decided it needed to explain itself in a ham-fisted exposition dump that even some high-velocity barbed wire couldn't save.

<p>
Since Return to Silent Hill's initial unveiling, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine will star as Silent Hill 2 protagonist James</a>, with Hannah Emily Anderson in the role of his "one true love" Mary (an early leak suggested the two won't be married in this version). More recently, Gans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">insisted his adaptation would be a "faithful" one</a>, although a careful reading of the movie's synopsis does imply some potentially notable changes:
</p>
<p>
"James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads the official synopsis. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."
</p>
<p>
We'll know if Return to Silent Hill does its source material justice when it <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/">hits the big screen</a> on 23rd January next year. However it ends up, Bloober's remake - which has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">sold over 2m copies</a> - is a fine way to experience a bonafide gaming classic. And the studio is about to do it all over again, as it embarks on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">recently announced remake of Silent Hill 1</a>.
