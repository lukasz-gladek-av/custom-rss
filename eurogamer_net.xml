            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has a daily XP cap and yes, that applies during double XP weekends, too.</p>
<p>Players believe they've uncovered proof that once you've hit 1.5 million XP in a single day, you "literally earn nothing" until the day resets.</p>

<p>That may not sound like a big deal for most players - there's no danger of it happening to me - but the cap also apparently applies when there's a double XP weekend, with one player reporting you can "hit that cap in just 4-5 hours of playing".</p><p>"In a $70 'AAA' game not a mobile free2play title you're being told how much fun you're allowed to have per day," wrote one player. "This isn't a free live service grindfest. This is a full price shooter with a F2P gacha like system glued on top."</p>

</span></p><p>"EA somehow managed to make progression time gated in a premium game, and almost nobody's talking about it. You buy the game, pay for cosmetics, battle pass, AND now you're limited on how much XP you can earn daily? Unreal.It's disgusting and antiplayer to the core.</p>
<p>"Players deserve to know this before buying. Stop pretending this is fine just because it's Battlefield."</p>
<p>"I got 200k XP for a single win in RedSec yesterday, the game was 21 minutes long," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmn21y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another player. "1.5m doesn't really seem that insane to be fair."</p>
<p>"Not that crazy. I got 140,000 XP for a gauntlet game yesterday," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmnl8c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">opined</a> another.</p>
<p>Not everyone's outraged, however.</p>
<p>"If you hit 1.5m xp in one day you gotta go outside," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmj3cs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">replied</a> another player, while someone else <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmky9n/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a>: "While I see their point, I think if you're hitting enough daily playtime for this to be an issue that it might be time to reconsider some things about your life."</p>
<p>Even those who wouldn't hit the cap do agree with the spirit of the complaint, though.</p>
<p>"I won’t hit an exp cap either because I can only put myself thru 2hrs max. But I agree with OP, a game that I pay $70 for I should be allowed to grind until my mouse/controller falls apart if I want to," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oqzchg/comment/nnmnd5d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">opined</a> someone else.</p><p>Yesterday, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bots-are-returning-to-battlefield-6s-conquest-breakthrough-and-rush-modes">Battlefield 6 was "reintroducing bots to verified experiences"</a>. Bots were originally removed as part of efforts to "support healthier matchmaking", but they've now been returned to Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush, with up to 12 popping up in each game mode. Challenges will "remain completable" with bots.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">EA and Battlefield Studios made sweeping changes to challenges</a>, reducing the required milestones for class assignments, weapon assignments, gameplay and mastery assignments, and more. And last weekend, Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-makes-temporary-adjustments-to-xp-earned-in-strikepoint-mode-to-maintain-fair-and-consistent-progression">"made some temporary adjustments" to XP</a> earned in Strikepoint as it works on "a longer-term solution". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-drops-a-new-relaxed-way-to-earn-xp-without-the-intensity-of-a-full-pvp-lobby">introduced a new "relaxed way" to play "while still earning progression and completing challenges"</a>.</p>

            <p>FromSoftware hasn't finished with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> or spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> just yet.</p>
<p>That's according to parent company Kadokawa, which revealed in its latest financials that with Elden Ring Nightreign "performing well beyond initial expectations", we can expect new DLC by the end of this financial year, which is the end of March 2026.</p>

<p>"We are aiming for further sales growth for Elden Ring Nightreign, original Elden Ring, and its DLC," the company <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/information/">added</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p>
<p>"We have multiple game titles in the development pipeline. FromSoftware is currently developing Elden Ring Nightreign DLC (planned for release in FY2025) Elden Ring Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)."</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-delayed-to-2026-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">FromSoftware pushed back the release of the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 port of Elden Ring</a> to "allow time for performance adjustments". In a brief statement, the developer apologised for the delay, but said it was "wholeheartedly [working] toward release", which is now expected sometime in 2026. Sadly, a firmer release window was not been provided.</p>
