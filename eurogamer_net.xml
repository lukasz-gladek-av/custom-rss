            <p>
Evercade seller Funstock has become the first notable hardware retailer to freeze orders for US customers due to the country's ongoing trade war with China.
</p>
<p>
At the start of April, sweeping international tariffs enacted by US president Trump have caused stock markets to falter and left companies struggling to react as the situation fluctuates daily.
</p>
<p>
Now, retro console and handheld seller Funstock, which handles sales of the Evercade in the UK and internationally, has said it will be taking "a cautious approach to the situation" by "temporarily stopping any new orders and pre-orders for US customers".
</p>
<p>
"Until we know more, we do not want to put our customers at risk of unexpected charges," Funstock said in a statement emailed to existing customers this afternoon, as seen by Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"As soon as the situation is clearer, we'll release a statement on our shipping policies going forward. This pause in service will be effective from Monday, 28th April and means that customers in the US will not be able to make new orders on our website."
</p>
<p>
Existing US customers still awaiting pre-orders will need to sit tight for now, Funstock continued. 
</p>
<p>
"We are exploring all available options to ascertain what our customers can expect with their pre-orders and will update you on any changes by 17th June," the company concluded. "We will advise all customers with existing pre-orders what to expect by that date."
</p>
<p>
Orders to customers in Canada are unaffected, Funstock noted.
</p>
<p>
Funstock is far from the only video games company which has reacted to the US tariffs. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Nintendo delayed US Switch 2 pre-orders until today</a> while it reassessed the situation and ultimately <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raised the prices of Switch 2 accessories in response</a>. PlayStation, meanwhile, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">raised the price of PS5 in various countries, including the UK</a>, citing "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".

            <p>Wombo Games - that is to say, the new studio from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> co-founder and ex-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> chief creative officer Janos Flösser - has unveiled its first title.</p>
<p>It's a "pulse pounding" top-down roguelite called Raiders of Blackveil, with a focus on "mastering champions, combining synergistic perks and acquiring powerful loot".</p>
<p>It's all set in a dystopian industrial fantasy world full of oppressed animals. Who is oppressing these poor beasts? Well, humans, of course. They have formed a mega corporation known as, you guessed it, Blackveil.</p>
<p>"You will join the animal rebellion as they aim to thwart Blackveil’s attempt at enslaving nature and enforcing a mindless consumer society," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">reads the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Raiders of Blackveil includes a range of MOBA-inspired champions, "each with unique abilities, playstyles, and personalities". Roles, meanwhile, include Tank, Damage Dealer, or Support.</p>
<p>Those working on Raiders of Blackveil include veteran developers whose previous works includes the likes of Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a>, Just Cause and, of course, Hitman.</p>
<p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world," said Flösser of the game's reveal.</p>
<p>"Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year."</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">add Raiders of Blackveil to your Steam wishlist now</a>.</p>

<p>As for Flösser's former studio, it is currently working on a new James Bond title. IO first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>. Very little has been shared on it since, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">our Bertie managed to tease a few extra 00-details out of the team back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, IO said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
