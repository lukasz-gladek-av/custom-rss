            <p>The Last of Us has an ending that leaves many questions regarding Joel's actions. Was he right to do what he did? Well, The Last of Us' creator Neil Druckmann believes he was.</p>
<p>Please be aware of <strong>major spoilers for The Last of Us (the game and the first season of the show) below</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>At the end of The Last of Us, Joel executes multiple members of the Fireflies when he discovers that for them to work on a cure for the cordyceps virus, Ellie would need to have an operation that would kill her.</p>
<p>By this point in The Last of Us' narrative, Joel has come to consider Ellie to be like his own child, and having already lost one daughter, he can not bring himself to lose another one. But, whether or not Joel was right to do this has been an ongoing debate since the first game released back in 2013.</p>
<p>Now, ahead of The Last of Us season two, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-hbo-creators-answer-whether-or-not-joel-was-right-to-save-ellie">IGN</a> asked the show's cast and creators the same question, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s own Neil Druckmann is firmly on the side of Joel simply doing what he had to do.</p>
<p>"I believe Joel was right," Druckmann said. "If I were in Joel's position, I hope I would be able to do what he did to save my daughter."</p>
<p>Fellow showrunner Craig Mazin added he would probably do the same thing if he was put into Joel's position. "But I'd like to think that I wouldn't," Mazin said, adding: "That's the interesting push and pull of the morality of it. And that's why the ending of the first game is so provocative and so wonderful. It just doesn't let you off the hook as a player.”</p>
<p>Mazin continued: "People get to the end of The Last of Us [the game] and there is that question, what would you do? What should you do if faced with the opportunity to save the world, if you sacrifice your child. That goes back to Abraham and Isaac. It's so profound. The notion of sacrifice to save the world."</p>
<p>"It's a difference between, OK, if I had to kill a random person to save who knows how many lives, in the abstract, you would say, well, yeah, that makes sense, of course,” Druckmann furthered. "But now, remove it from being a random person and it's your kid. Now the answer is very different."</p>
<p>Other cast members such as Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in the show, said that Joel did save the world, it is just that the world he saved was his own. Jesse actor Young Mazino mused: "It's like death begets death begets death and I think that's just a perfect example. And yeah, it's his world. Who cares about the world if your world isn't there?"</p>
<p>These comments echo what Troy Baker - who plays Joel in the games (and James in the show's first season) has previously stated. Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-the-last-of-us-episode-nine">Baker said he believes Joel's actions at the end of The Last of Us to be "the most selfish act ever"</a>. However, he doesn't feel the ending could have played out any other way, as, in Joel's eyes, Ellie was "his world" and as such saving her was more important than saving humanity.</p>

            <p>If you are simply breezing your way through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and thinking to yourself 'oh I would love this so much more if it was a bit more challenging', well then I have some good news for you.</p>
<p>According to creative director Jonathon Dumont, the team at Ubisoft is "actively looking at… making even a tougher setting for difficulty for some of our players".</p>

<p>Based on my own experience with Shadows so far, this will not be a setting for me. Reader, I have died plenty on my adventures through Feudal Japan so far. But, for those who are not me, Dumont joked to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-devs-actively-looking-at-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode-for-the-rpg-how-challenging-do-you-want-it/">GamesRadar</a>: "How challenging do you want it?"</p>
<p>The developer added Ubisoft is "always listening and monitoring what players are doing" so it can address <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">things like bug fixes and any other changes its community wants</a> via the "constructive feedback" it receives.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we can't do everything, but there are things that we're going to be actioning on, and just for the next updates, there are quite a bit of bug fixes and little feature enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont explained. "I can't just make a list. There's quite a bit of it. So the team is always working to improve the game, and hopefully, people will be able to see the difference when they're playing Shadows in the upcoming months."</p>

            <p>According to Sony's outgoing SVP of Global Partner Development and Relations, PlayStation is like a well choreographed dance.</p>
<p>The company's Phil Rosenberg will be heading off to pastures new at the end of this year. But, while he may be leaving, he has plenty of optimism for PlayStation's future.</p>
<p>"I think we have the smartest, brightest and most passionate people in the world working at [Sony Interactive Entertainment]. They are specialists in areas that need specific expertise. I think that as technology continues to evolve, it becomes more stable, will run faster and that gaming will be an even bigger part of our entertainment world," he said in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/leadership-spotlight-a-conversation-with-phil-rosenberg/">a recent interview</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The exec went on to describe the company's workings being "like a ballet", saying while it may all appear "like it's kind of effortless", in reality there is "a lot of work" and "heavy lifting" behind the scenes.</p>
<p>"And we're really good at it,"  Rosenberg said.</p>
<p>The exec stated he was "very hopeful and very encouraged by the wind we have in our sails right now", adding he believes the company will "end this year on a great note". Meanwhile, while he didn't go into any great detail, he said all signs point to Sony having "another fabulous year" in 2026.</p>
<p>Based on nothing other than my own extrapolations, this comment made me think of Insomniac's Wolverine, which still doesn't have a release date yet. I am still hopeful for a release this year, although it was recently said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-window-narrowed-down-by-black-panther-himself">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was aiming for a Christmas launch window</a> - would Sony want to release a first party Marvel game around the same time? I am not sure.</p>
<p>But, back to the matter in hand! Continuing his train of thought, Rosenberg said he is sure Sony has a "bright, bright future" in store. "This is not a '30 years and out' story," Rosenberg closed. "This is a '60 years and who the heck knows from there' story."</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Sony news, earlier this month a leak revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">the company was working on AI-driven characters</a>, including Aloy from the Horizon series.</p>
<p>This prompted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-forbidden-west-actress-ashly-burch-responds-to-sonys-controversial-ai-aloy">Aloy's Ashly Burch to respond to the leaked footage</a>, with the actress stating she doesn't feel worried that the technology exists, or even because game companies want to use it, but it does still scare her.</p>
<p>"I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone's performance attached to it. That does have someone's voice, or face, or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse," Burch said. "They wouldn't have any protections. Any way to fight back.</p>
<p>"And that possibility... It makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, there is a good reason for this, with none other than Tony Hawk himself taking responsibility.</p>
<p>"It was my choice to pick some different songs by the same artists featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">THPS3</a>+4 OST," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHtXr4Xppt8/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Hawk wrote on Instagram</a>.

<p>As for that second wave of music, it includes tracks such as Hollywood Baby by 100 gecs and 2 Minutes to Midnight by Iron Maiden.</p>
