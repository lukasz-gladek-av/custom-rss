Kojima Productions really is determined to make sure we don't forget <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is almost upon us. Alongside a <a href="https://www.deathstrandingconcert.com/">musical world tour</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/limited-edition-death-stranding-2-ps5-controller-will-launch-alongside-kojimas-sequel">themed PlayStation 5 controller</a>, plus all that chatter about a Death Stranding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">movie</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-casually-reveals-a-death-stranding-anime-is-in-the-works">anime</a>, the studio has now confirmed it'll be streaming a Death Stranding 2 panel event next month.
</p>
<p>
Officially known as the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Game Premiere event, it's the first date in Kojima Productions' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-getting-world-tour-to-celebrate-its-release">previously announced months-long "world tour"</a> that careens through the likes of Sydney, Paris, London, and Hong Kong before ending in Lucca this November.
</p>
<p>
Things get underway, however, at 7pm PDT on Sunday, 8th June in Los Angeles, California - and keen-eyed observers will immediately appreciate that ties is neatly with the start of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest season</a>. And thus enter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, who'll be hosting the Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Game Premiere event at Los Angeles' Orpheum Theatre, with best pal and Death Standing creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> in attendance too.

<p>
The focus of the event is a panel discussion featuring Kojima and unspecified "special guests", but there's also talk of a live demonstration of Death Stranding 2, should you wish to get another peek ahead of its 26th June release on PlayStation 5. And if you <em>do</em>, you can either show up in person - tickets are <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/f7243f5b-d8db-4292-9b92-eacc5a299c61/summary">available online</a> - or, probably more conveniently for most, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/gOV2Rx-ncxM">watch the whole thing on YouTube</a>. Just be aware that it doesn't start till 3am on 9th June in the UK, so you might prefer to catch up later once you've had your beauty sleep.

<p>
So there's a lot happening in the world of Death Stranding, then, but will the wait be worth it? Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale nipped across the ocean to have a look a few months back and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">came away with many thoughts</a>. Perhaps the most telling words, however, are these: "So far, [Death Stranding 2] feels like the most Kojima-game yet".
