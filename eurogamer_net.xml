            <p>Future updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will seemingly include "Hagga-Basin-like maps".</p>
<p>Revealed by community manager Iggy in the Dune Awakening Discord server, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1006265467754790943/1379064253537063103/1384818624283545693">he wrote</a>: "I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content".</p>
<p>Iggy refers to pre-launch developer vlogs in which Dune: Awakening spoke about the roadmap for future updates. Creative director Joel Bylos stated updates for the game would be free, with only optional cosmetics, battle passes, and especially large expansions being sold.</p>

If it ever comes as part of a paid package, I imagine it would be because it's something big." Iggy continues "But for now I think we have said we plan to release content for free, and then optional stuff via optional DLCs so we can actually afford rent, lights, and pineapple on pizza."</p>
<p>Dune Awakening has proven exceptionally popular since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend">its launch on Steam, breaking 150,000 concurrent players</a> and popping off among the higher reaches of the Top Sellers list alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a>. A recent patch for the game provided several quality of life fixes, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">ended the practice of crushing players with orniphopters in PvP</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Eurogamer's recent review of Dune Awakening</a>, which scored it four stars, offered praise to the progression through Hagga Basin. It features the following: "[...] the process of gathering material around the starter area of Hagga Basin, refining your haul at your handcrafted base, and manufacturing new gear is made endlessly compelling with an unwavering faithfulness to the source material."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gears of War Reloaded developer The Coalition has extended the second weekend of the game's beta, which along with more time will also include more modes and more maps for participants to check out.</p>
<p>The upcoming weekend's beta will now run between 20th June 8pm UK time until 23rd June 5am UK time, and feature five maps for both Social Team Deathmatch and Competitive King of the Hill and Execution. Initially, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-coming-this-weekend">things were planned to be wrapped up within 48 hours and with less variety</a>.</p>

<p>As to why the team has decided to do this? Well, "we heard you," is what it wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1935414750034411784">post on social media</a>.</p>
<p>You see, the first Gears of War Reloaded beta weekend didn't <em>exactly </em>go all that smoothly for the developer, and there were multiple reports from players of <a href="https://x.com/SASxSH4DOWZ/status/1934359201523929512">server instability</a> as well as technical issues. Many were quite <a href="https://x.com/Lilkillsville/status/1934044001050730864">vocal about their experiences</a>.</p>
<p>"Most of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> stream thumbnails are of people sitting trying to find a match. When you eventually can get into a match, everybody is laggy and when you start shooting somebody they just disappear and then randomly you die or they stutter back and forth taking multiple full clips and not dying," read <a href="https://x.com/Freas23Gaming/status/1933863257304875257">one such post on social media</a> following the first beta. "I knew the beta was probably gonna be bad but this is just terrible and unacceptable."</p>
<p>Hopefully things will go a bit better this weekend.</p>
