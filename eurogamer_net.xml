            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> said personal abuse sent to Wuk Lamat's voice actor "breaks my heart".</p>
<p>Wuk Lamat was a fresh character introduced in the latest expansion, Dawntrail, but proved unpopular with some players. This turned sour when voice actor Sena Bryer received transphobic abuse for her portrayal of the character.</p>
<p>Yoshida has commented on the character, as well as the abuse Bryer received, in a new interview with <a href="https://checkpointgaming.net/features/2024/10/chatting-with-the-iconic-naoki-yoshida-on-the-design-and-reception-of-dawntrail/">Checkpoint Gaming</a>, acknowledging player feedback and tweaks coming in forthcoming patches.</p>

<p>"[Wuk Lamat's] a very complex character, and she even has a bit of a complex about herself," said Yoshida. "Unfortunately, we didn't delve very far into the background of why she had those feelings, so it appeared as if she left a negative impression.</p><p>"We accept that feedback. I feel a little sorry that we weren't able to properly depict her. We may have been able to make her more straightforward, so we're pushing her in the forefront as this character. But again, we're going to be reflecting that learning into [content patch 7.1] and onward, we're hoping that we can show more of what makes Wuk Lamat so great, and I'm hoping that we can regain from there."</p>
<p>Yoshida then specifically mentioned the personal attacks against Bryer.</p>
<p>"One additional thing, there were comments about how we are too accepting of diversity - some people seem to be disapproving of that," he said. "I'm afraid one of our staff members received very negative comments and it almost felt like a personal attack, which breaks my heart, because she worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all. It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Yoshida has been outspoken against this abuse, telling German outlet <a href="https://jpgames.de/2024/09/final-fantasy-xiv-das-sagt-naoki-yoshida-zur-kritik-an-wuk-lamat/">JPGames</a> in September it was "really difficult" to discern valid criticism from people "just criticising the character in relation to values".</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14">Yoshida discussed criticism of Dawntrail</a>, particularly how some fans were disappointed the Scions took more of a backseat in the drama compared to previous expansions.</p>
<p>"With regards to the Scions playing a more active role only later on in the story, truth be told this is something I intentionally wanted to try out," said Yoshida. "I do understand there are people who always want the Scions to be at the centre of the story, but at the same time there are people who are also requesting something new instead. So it was a conscious effort on my part to experiment and see how the balance would play out."</p>
<p>Patch 7.1 of Final Fantasy 14, named Crossroads, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-71-crossroads-is-coming-in-november">set for release in mid-November</a>, bringing new story missions and - most notably - the start of the Final Fantasy 11 themed raid series, Echoes of Vana'diel.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has an arachnophobia mode as part of its accessibility offering that turns spider-like creatures into amusing blobs.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game in the series has an open beta coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-getting-open-beta-in-november-with-early-access-for-playstation-plus-subscribers">PS Plus subscribers getting early access</a> that's now available.</p>
<p>Right at the start, players can tweak the settings and turn on Arachnophobia Assistance, which "adjusts the appearance of some small monsters and endemic life to accommodate players with arachnophobia".</p>

<p>The result is creatures becoming golden globules that wobble around environments. As an arachnophobe myself, it certainly put a smile on my face.</p>
<p>Note, however, this only applies to small monsters rather than the main monsters you'll be tasked with properly hunting.</p>

<p>That's fine for the menagerie of dragon, lizard, bear, and toad-like monsters, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp4gR1QEvVA">spider-esque Lala Barina</a> seemingly won't be affected. Still, it does have four legs rather than eight - and the legs are the worst.</p>
<p>The beta also provides a look at other accessibility options, with three presets for visual, auditory, and motion sickness options. These can also be toggled individually in the options menu.</p>

<p>The arachnophobia mode is fast becoming standard in games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-later-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-an-arachnophobia-mode">World of Warcraft finally received one</a> earlier this year after 20 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-arachnophobia-mode-is-arguably-more-terrifying-than-actual-giant-spiders">Call of Duty Black Ops 6 turns spiders into something even worse</a>. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-it-doesnt-have-a-single-spider">Dragon Age: The Veilguard doesn't bother</a>, because thankfully there aren't any spiders to begin with.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the beta (from the start at least) is the same demo I was able to play at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> this year. It begins with a chase across sand dunes, before hunting a monster with an exceptionally large tongue.</p>
<p>I came away impressed with that demo, calling it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">most approachable Monster Hunter in the series yet</a>. And while that's a descriptor often used for each new game, it's a welcome evolution that streamlines the experience with tidier menus and NPC teammates.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta launches across all platforms on 31st October and lasts until 4th November. We've got all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-release-date-time-early-access">beta times in our guide</a>.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year"> full game will be released in February next year</a>.</p>

With a positive critical response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> now safely tucked under its belt, BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a> project director Michael Gamble has reflected on some of the differences between the studio's two upcoming projects.
</p>
<p>
Unlike Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which hits shops later this week, Mass Effect 5 will not seek to tweak the sci-fi franchise's established visual style, he said.
</p>
<p>
"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it," Gamble wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850999886763983193">post</a> on X. 
</p>
<p>
"Both are from the studio, but Mass Effect is Mass Effect. How you bring a sci-fi RPG to life is different than other genres or IPs," he continued, "and has to have different kinds of love."
</p>

<p>
Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese praised The Veilguard's divisive new graphical style in our review of the game, noting how BioWare seemed to be "aiming for something closer to an animated film in appearance". 
</p>
<p>
"It really works," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>, noting how in particular it enhances facial gestures and helps draw out "the inherent fantasy and emotion in scenes and environments".
</p>
<p>
As for Mass Effect 5's tone, Gamble wrote it would "maintain the mature tone of the original Trilogy. This is all I'm going to say for now."
</p>
<p>
The obvious point of comparison here is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-andromeda">Mass Effect Andromeda</a>, the franchise's fourth main entry that was primarily developed by BioWare's now-shuttered Montreal team. This entry took a chattier, more youthful and adventurous tone than the sci-fi series' first three games - perhaps to be expected, considering the increasingly dire stakes and wartorn backdrop there. Still, the change was not well received.
</p><p>
But word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">Mass Effect 5, or whatever it ends up being called</a>, will feel closer to the original trilogy of games is not a surprise. We know from years of teases that BioWare's return to the franchise will pick up the story of the original trilogy's Milky Way galaxy many centuries later, and see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">the return of at least one familiar face</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for when Mass Effect 5 might arrive, BioWare has not yet said. Perhaps we might hear more on 7th November, the series' annual N7 Day fan celebration, when BioWare typically drops new information.

            <p>Two N64  games have now been added to the Mature app of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-2-seeds-of-evil">Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</a> and Shadow Man are both available right now for subscribers with the Expansion Pack.</p>
<p>Both games were known for their blood and gore - unusual on Nintendo's system - hence their inclusion in the Mature app, alongside shooters Perfect Dark and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok-dinosaur-hunter">Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</a>.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the Mature app is a separate download away from the main N64 app.</p>
<p>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil was, of course, the follow-up to the first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a> game, in which players shoot dinosaurs with a variety of outlandishly gruesome weapons.</p>
<p>Shadow Man, meanwhile, was based on the comic book series of the same name, following a voodoo warrior with the ability to visit the land of the dead.</p>
