            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Xbox has collaborated with Meta to launch the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, a limited edition VR headset.</p>
<p>The device continues an ongoing partnership between the two companies, following the addition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Xbox cloud gaming to Meta headsets in 2022</a>. This was followed by the release of Xbox Game Pass to Meta Quest 3 back in 2023, as Xbox expanded its cloud gaming offering.</p>
<p>The headset features an Xbox design of black and green, along with matching Touch Plus controllers and a limited-edition Xbox Wireless Controller. The package also includes three months of Meta Horizon+ and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It's out now, and costs £379.99. It is available directly from Meta or exclusively at Argos and EE in the UK.</p>

<p>US purchasers will find the headset at Best Buy for $399.99. Further details can be found on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>Through the cloud, users will have access to Xbox Game Pass through the headset - though this won't be fully VR versions of games. Instead, there are four display options, including one cinema-sized screen. Cross-play and cross-progression mean players can continue playing across the VR headset or their Xbox console or PC.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, CEO of Microsoft Gaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-vr-not-a-focus-for-project-scarlett-because-xbox-fans-arent-asking-for-it">Phil Spencer stated VR wasn't a focus</a> for the company's then forthcoming Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>
<p>"I have some issues with VR," he said. "It's isolating and I think of games as a communal, kind of together experience. We're responding to what our customers are asking for and... nobody's asking for VR."</p>
<p>He added "nobody's selling millions and millions" of VR units, before stating: "I think we might get there [eventually]. But yeah, that's not where our focus is."</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft is dipping its toes into VR with this collaboration, without developing its own VR system.</p>
<p>It mirrors the company's recently announced handheld console, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">Xbox branded ROG Ally from ASUS</a>. As announced at the recent Xbox Games Showcase, the handheld will be released later this year.</p>
<p>It's also in contrast to Sony's PSVR2, which has not been well-supported since its release in 2023. Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">Beat Studios ended support for Beat Saber on both PS4 and PS5</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember last week when an advert for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> popped up on the London Underground, stating the game is "out now"? This was, alas, a mistake, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-advert-reportedly-spotted-in-london-sparking-hopes-of-imminent-release">Nintendo confirming to Eurogamer the advert was incorrect</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the error has been remedied, and a fresh look Metroid Prime 4: Beyond poster now sits in place, with a 2025 release window plopped next to the image of Samus. This was likely hidden underneath the original 'Out Now' proclamation.</p>

<p>The advert itself is for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> Edition of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, so touts features such as support for mouse controls, up to 4K resolution in docked TV mode, frame rates up to 120fps, and HDR support. On its release - whenever that may indeed be - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is also set for Nintendo's original Switch console.</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">first gameplay trailer for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond back in June last year</a>. A deeper look at the game was shown during the March Nintendo Direct, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">Samus' psychic powers were revealed</a>.</p>
<p>Our Ed called Metroid Prime 4 "the best example of Switch 2's varied control capabilities" when he took the upcoming release for a spin earlier this year, though for now he isn't totally convinced by the mouse (as a reminder, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2 Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release</a>).</p>

            <p>The<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/street-fighter"> Street Fighter movie</a> may have found its Chun-Li, who will reportedly be a "lead female role" in the 2026 adaptation.</p>
<p>Callina Liang, known for her roles in recent thriller Presence and high school drama Bad Genius, has been picked for the role of one of gaming's biggest female fighters <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/street-fighter-movie-casts-callina-liang-chun-li-1236439931/">according to Deadline</a>.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter movie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date#:~:text=Live%2Daction%20Street%20Fighter%20movie,2026%20release%20date%20%7C%20Eurogamer.net">is scheduled for release on 20th March 2026</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-gets-new-director-still-set-for-2026">will be directed by Kitao Sakurai</a>. Sakurai was previously responsible for directing Netflix's Bad Trip, as well as the Eric André Show.</p>

<p>Additional details on the Street Fighter movie are scarce. We know Capcom is "deeply involved" with the adaptation thanks to a report by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, but the premise or other featured characters remains a mystery.</p>
<p>What we do know is Chun-Li has found herself in a second surge of popularity - not thanks to the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, but due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> where a crossover skin introduced her to a new generation of fans. This skin has also recently made a return to the battle royale, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lj01px/chunli_is_1st_best_seller_for_3_days_straight_so/">quickly becoming the top selling cosmetic in-game</a>.</p>
<p>It's also clear we're in the midst of a golden era for video game adaptations. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/movies/minecraft">The Minecraft movie</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-movie-jockeys-past-550m-at-the-box-office">broke records around the world</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">has a sequel on the way</a>. Meanwhile the Sonic film franchise spun past $1bn in global box office sales this January.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-movie-chun-li-actor]]></content:encoded>
