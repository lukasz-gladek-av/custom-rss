            <p>A revitalised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>) is bringing players back, propelling the game to most-watched status on streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and to being one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most played games on Steam</a> - comfortably above copycat hero-shooter Marvel Rivals. There was even a queue to log in to Overwatch when I played yesterday evening, which is something I've never seen before.</p>
<p>Currently there are <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/overwatch-2">nearly 100,000 people watching Overwatch streams on Twitch</a>, making it the most viewed game by some way, with nearly 30,000 more viewers than second-place game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>. Meanwhile on Steam, Overwatch peaked at 165,000 players, putting it briefly in the top 10. It's currently 13th, nearly 10 places ahead of genre rival Marvel Rivals, which has trumped Overwatch on Steam for a long time.</p>
<p>Note, however, that Overwatch is not only available on Steam. The predominant platform for play is Battle.net, which is presumably where the bulk of the audience lies. Should the jump in activity on Steam reflect the jump in activity on Battle.net, then, the actual number of Overwatch players is presumably much higher.</p>
<p>The renewed Overwatch activity is due to an expansion-like release, The Reign of Talon, which arrived yesterday. It's the game's first expansion and heralds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">the beginning of a new yearly expansion-era for Overwatch</a>, which Blizzard will release in addition to more regular Season updates.</p><p>Season 1 - the kick-off season for Reign of Talon - brings five new heroes to the game at once, which is an unprecedented amount for Overwatch, and Blizzard plans to add five more new heroes over the course of the year. These aren't the only changes to the game, though, with major user interface reworks and story-related changes present as well.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1segu/so_death_chandelier/">So… Death Chandelier???</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Synodii/">u/Synodii</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/">Overwatch</a> </blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>But it's the new heroes that everyone is talking about - notably the new flying hero Jetpack Cat, who has the meta-shaking new ability to tow other characters through the air. All of the combo possibilities of this are currently being felt out. Among them, lifting a spinning, Ultimate-ing Reaper above a team to prevent them hiding behind cover; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1omoi/behold_the_jetpack_cat_reinhardt_duel/">airlifting the hammer-swinging Reinhardt through the air to duel other airlifted Reinhardts</a>; and discovering bizarre quirks such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rsht/eliminated_someone_before_the_match_even_started/">being able to kill people before a match has officially begun</a>. People are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rog9/first_game_with_emre_first_potg/">getting to grips with the other new heroes, such as Emre</a>, and discovering how potent they can be. The question is how long Overwatch can keep this renewed momentum up for.</p>
<p>Not all of the new heroes have gone down well, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-responds-to-overwatch-anran-design-controversy">Controversy arose over the weekend around the visual appearance of new fire-wielding hero Anran</a>, whose final, cute in-game look seemed to contradict a more ferocious design used in previously-released animated shorts and comics for the game. Anran's face also appears very similar to a lot of other female characters in the game - an issue the community refers to as "same-face syndrome". Blizzard has said it's discussing her design with the intention of making changes to it.</p>

            <p>Konami has announced its next Silent Hill Transmission broadcast.</p>
<p>As shared by the company, we can all expect to hear more about what's in store for the Silent Hill series tomorrow, 12 February, at 4pm PT. That's actually the early hours of the 13th for those of us here in the UK, with everything kicking off at midnight.</p>

<p>As for what we can expect, the studio has said it will share the "latest news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>".</p>
<p>Silent Hill: Townfall (my computer keeps trying to autocorrect that to Downfall, which is very annoying) is coming from No Code, the Glasgow-based developer of Stories Untold and Observation. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">first announced back in 2022</a>, though at this time not too much was revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie.</p><p>Soon after this reveal, some started to decode the trailer, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">discovered an SOS signal was tucked between the 'THY FLESH IS WEAK' images</a>. There was also mention of Alessa, who is the little girl seen throughout Silent Hill during the first game and the name should be pretty familiar to anyone who's played the first or third installments, or watched the original Silent Hill movie.</p>
<p>So, will you be watching?</p> <div>

<p>Last year saw the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, which plopped players into the shoes of teenager Hinako. We awarded Silent Hill f four stars on its debut. "Silent Hill f's frustrating first-half is outweighed by a brilliant, delirious second that's well worth the initial slog," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f review</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/">Eidos-Montréal</a> is one of those veteran game studios that constantly appear in the news cycle, but always seem to be tied to some form of drama despite their pedigree. Luckily, Embracer Group has kept it running and working away on a handful of mystery projects, most of which have been scrapped.</p>
<p>Though the current buzz points to the developer now working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumour-has-it-a-new-alien-game-is-on-the-way-and-its-being-described-as-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-with-xenomorphs">an ambitious Alien video game</a> with heavy action-adventure elements, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-cancelled-lotr-game-by-eidos-montreal-with-a-telltale-like-story-first-look">this report from MP1st</a> deals with a cancelled Lord of the Rings project which never got too far. Late last year, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8?t=2132s">Insider Gaming talked about this</a> already, so it's not the first time we'd heard about it, but that noise didn't take off.</p>
<p>MP1st now claims to have gotten their hands on concept art and early tests done for the game, which apparently didn't advance much before being binned. The project joins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/">the reported Legacy of Kain reboot</a> as games that haven't moved forward at Eidos-Montréal recently.</p>
<p>The images show painterly and colourful art depicting what's believed to be the Umbar region of Middle-earth, as pointed by recurring file names and some of the 3D screens introducing a better sense of how the game would've been structured, at least in that region. Apparently, the iconic Prancing Pony inn from the books and movies was part of the game as well, as it wouldn't have been restricted to the area south of Gondor and known for its pirates.</p><p>But perhaps the most interesting part of the report is the game would've featured card-based mechanics on top of an isometric view similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest for the Wicked</a>'s and a Telltale-like narrative approach. We lack more details, but I think it's safe to say Eidos-Montréal aimed to make a LOTR game that would've felt quite different from what we've gotten before.</p>
<p>The end of the report underlines the studio is now "deep in development" of a major project nicknamed "P11" that's third-person and open-world. Could that be the rumoured Alien title? Place your bets now.</p>

            <p>Sorry Marvel fans, you may need to retract those claws, as it seems that Insomniac's Wolverine won't be appearing during this week's PlayStation State of Play.</p>
<p>When Sony first announced a State of Play for tomorrow, 12th February, it said the show would last for over 60 minutes, and include "news, gameplay updates, and announcements". Many soon assumed (and hoped) this lengthy broadcast would include a look at Insomniac's Wolverine, which was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game"> first teased back in 2021</a> during a PlayStation Showcase.</p>

<p>However, it now appears that this won't be the case after all. Replying to one fan on social media, who asked when we would all hear and see more from Logan and co, <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?s=20">Insomniac replied</a> with a very to the point:</p>
<p>"Spring 2026."</p>
<p>Now, alas, February doesn't exactly fall under the 'spring' window (she writes while looking out at the sunless, grey sky, wondering when the ground will ever be dry again). Spring starts towards the end of March, so unless Insomniac is pulling the wool over our eyes it seems doubtful Wolverine will show up tomorrow night.</p><p>Something that may (<em>may</em>) show up though could be the next game from Sony Santa Monica. When asked about a possible appearance from the team during tomorrow's State of Play, industry insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot48-has-ot48-been-hijacked-by-ot47-ot46-and-ot45-to-the-detriment-of-48-ots-of-history.1329010/page-378#post-151107211">Shinobi602 responded</a>: “Wouldn’t be super surprising given the target release window." They did stress, though, "this isn’t a confirmation it'll be there lol".</p>
<p>Thankfully, we don't have too much longer to find out what Sony has up its sleeve, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">tomorrow's State of Play kicking off at 10pm UK time</a>. What do you hope to see there?</p>

<p>In the meantime, while we may not be getting Wolverine news this month, we do have another Marvel-flavoured leak for February. Recent rumours suggest that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-extra-february-games-leak-ahead-of-tomorrows-state-of-play">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be headlining PlayStation's PS Plus Extra games for February</a>.</p>

            <p>It seems that PlayStation's upcoming PS Plus Extra games for February have leaked.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029">dealabs</a>, PS Plus members can expect to get their hands on the following three titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown (PS5)</li>
<li>Neva (PS5/PS4)</li>
</ul>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The big headliner here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which reunites players with Spider-Man (of course) as well as Miles Morales and MJ. "At once a little simple and a little over-stuffed, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is still above all a game of immense charm and fluid, free-form style," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">four star review from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>I would also fully recommend Neva, which is the most recent game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gris">Gris</a> developer Nomada Studio. It follows the story of a young woman named Alba and a magnificent wolf, with whom she forms a lifelong bond.</p>
<p>We also awarded Neva four stars on its release. "Nomada Studio follows up on the striking Gris with an effort that's poignant and precise, if maybe just a tad melodramatic," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neva-review">Eurogamer's Neva review from 2024</a>.</p>

<p>It is expected that Sony will officially announce February's PS Plus Extra games in the very near future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">perhaps during this week's State of Play</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>
