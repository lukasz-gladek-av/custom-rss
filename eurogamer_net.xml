            <p>As is tradition, the Call of Duty series is returning once again for its annual dollop of guns and ammunition, and today Activision has announced Black Ops 7.</p>
<p>The next series entry is being helmed by Treyarch and Raven Software, with the developers promising the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet. It will all be set more than 40 years after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, with things all kicking off in the year 2035. And, I am sorry to say, it doesn't sound like things are looking too good for humanity.</p>
<p>"The world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare," reads the official blurb. "Wielding cutting-edge technology, David Mason and his team must fight back against a manipulative enemy who weaponises fear above all else." You can check out the first teaser for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 below.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 will be able to be played solo or with friends "in a thrilling and innovative" co-op campaign, while also having the series' "signature" multiplayer experience. This will include new maps and more from Zombies.</p>
<p>All in all, this next game will be "the full Call of Duty package", says series general manager Matt Cox, promising more details to come later this summer.</p>
<p>Tyler Bahl, head of Activision Publishing Marketing, added: "This is the first time we're staying within the Black Ops series with back-to-back releases, so we're excited to give players a bit more time to enjoy all the live seasons and provide players more of what they want across Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone before we turn the page to Black Ops 7."</p>
<p>For now, we don't have a release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but when it does arrive it will be available across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC (no word on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-agreement-for-call-of-duty">despite that Call of Duty deal Microsoft made with Nintendo a little while ago</a>). It will also debut on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Just as I was starting to being able to walk by hedges again without getting terrible spider-based flashbacks, Obsidian has announced a sequel to its wonderful 2020 garden survival game, Grounded, and it's launching surprisingly soon.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian's original Grounded - in familiar Honey, I Shrunk the Kids fashion - saw its pre-teen protagonists meet the wrong end of a shrinking ray while out in their backyard. And it turns out gardens are scary places when you're only an inch or so high.
</p>
<p>
As for the upcoming Grounded 2, it's somehow contrived to do it all over again, meaning more outdoor survival, crafting, and base building as our protagonists battle creepy crawlies and more in a bid to grow big again.

<p>
The first major change up appears to be a shift in locations from the original's suburban backyard to a public park in the middle of town. And while the fundamentals of survival look familiar, we get whole bunch of terrifying new critters to deal with - including big, hairy caterpillars - along with new tools, such as the ability to mount insects and scurry around.
</p>
<p>
Best of all, Grounded 2 is almost upon us. It's launching for Xbox Series X/S and PC as an early access release on 29th July.

            <p>At today's Xbox Showcase, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> revealed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> is finally available right now on Xbox. Further, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> will also make its way to the platform this winter.</p>
<p>The Xbox release of Final Fantasy 16 comes two years after its release on PS5 as a console exclusive, before also arriving on PC last year. Final Fantasy 7 Remake, meanwhile, arrives five years after its original PS4 release, which was followed by its PS5 re-release, PC release, and the release of sequel Rebirth. </p>
<p>It's all part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a> it began "aggressively pursuing" last year, in a move to "diversify earnings opportunities". But are these games arriving on Xbox too late?</p>

<p>Anecdotally, there have certainly been plenty of calls from Xbox players to have these games available on Microsoft's platform. And a wider release means wider access to games and more sales, so it certainly makes business sense. Their arrival at last has felt like an inevitability for some time - Final Fantasy 16 producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-wants-xbox-launch-but-cant-say-when-itll-happen">Naoki Yoshida even stated he was keen on an Xbox release</a>.</p>
<p>Yet Square Enix - and more specifically, the Final Fantasy series - has a storied history with both Sony and Nintendo, which is why these companies have been favoured in the past. Traditionally, Xbox hasn't sold well in Japan (arguably because it's an American product) and that in turn meant a lack of Japanese-made games - and crucially Japanese RPGs - on those consoles.</p>
<p>Yet Microsoft seems keen to change that perspective. Beyond the likes of Xbox 360-exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-odyssey">Lost Odyssey</a> from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, the company has been flirting more and more with the Japanese market. Just last year, it had a livestream at the Tokyo Game Show where it announced Square Enix's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters would at long last be arriving on Xbox consoles</a>. "Our partnership with Square Enix is stronger than ever," boasted Sarah Bond, president of Xbox, at the time.</p>
<p>And that followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-heading-to-xbox">addition of MMORPG Final Fantasy 14 to Xbox consoles</a>. This was announced in Las Vegas at the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Fan Fest, where Xbox boss Phil Spencer joined Yoshida on stage to reveal the news. Spencer described the partnership as a "seminal" moment.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Dawntrail was the first FF14 expansion released simultaneously on Xbox | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer after the release of FF14 expansion Dawntrail, Yoshida said players had been "waiting a long time for the Xbox release" and that it had "a really strong response" with the community growing.</p>
<p>He continued: "With Final Fantasy 14 as an opportunity, we can take this opportunity to strengthen the community on Xbox towards the Final Fantasy franchise. I think this is where we would take more communication and work on establishing the community moving forward. And this is important, not for Final Fantasy 14, but, I would say, for Square Enix. With Final Fantasy 14's release on Xbox, Phil Spencer spent a lot of his time and a lot of effort and put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality. So we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward."</p>
<p>Yoshida even acknowledged "the Final Fantasy fanbase on Xbox has reduced" following the release of Final Fantasy 15 back in 2016, considering later games haven't appeared on Xbox. That game remains the fastest-selling game in series history, and is its fifth highest-selling overall. Why? It's the only mainline game in the series to be released simultaneously on Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Indeed, it always comes down to money. While neither company has released direct numbers of Xbox players in Final Fantasy 14 or the Pixel Remasters, both games are regularly cited as having strong sales in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">Square Enix's financial reports</a>. Their respective Xbox releases must at least have given some sort of boost. What's more, the response to Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC proves there is at least an audience for these games outside of PlayStation and Nintendo.</p>
<p>As such, there's no doubt releasing Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake on Xbox will extend the sales tail of these games. There's certainly an audience for them and both Xbox and Square Enix seem keen to strengthen their working relationship in a bid to increase both profits and reputation.</p>
<p>But this news isn't quite a silver bullet to turn around Square Enix's fortunes of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">games not meeting expectations</a>. Instead, it's still playing catch up on possible sales. Really it should be taking inspiration from its biggest previous launches and go all-in on multiplatform support from the start. Bring on Final Fantasy 17.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"The Outer Worlds 2 is the eagerly-awaited sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment (just look at the exciting number of dashes in this sentence!)," reads the trailer's official blurb. "Time to clear your calendar – get ready for an action-packed adventure with a new crew, new weapons, and new enemies in a new colony! So much newness!</p>
<p>"As a daring and most likely good-looking Earth Directorate agent, you must uncover the source of devastating rifts threatening to destroy all of humanity. Your investigation leads to Arcadia, home of skip drive technology, where the fate of the colony, and ultimately the entire galaxy, rests on your decisions—your strengths, your flaws, your crew, and the factions you choose to trust."</p>
<p>We will likely hear even more at the dedicated Outer Worlds 2 showcase coming up in about half an hour or so, so stay tuned.</p>
