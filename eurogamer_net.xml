<p>The characters within this collection of Eclipse images are each shown with various different outfits and equipment.</p>
<p>A selection of other humanoid characters that are smugglers are shown. The only two which appear to have specific names are Jotraaaz Kammzzzek and Travis, suggesting that they may play a bigger role in Eclipse's overall story, whenever it finally releases.</p>

<p>Star Wars Eclipse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first announced at the 2021 Game Awards</a>, where it was revealed it would have a High Republic setting. The affluent High Republic era is set around 200 years before the Skywalker Saga. (It's not to be confused the Old Republic, set thousands of years prior.) Happily, this means Jar Jar himself won't be featuring.</p>
<p>However, since that time, very little else has been heard of the game. In October 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">the studio described Star Wars Eclipse as "simmering"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumi√®re said the studio's teams had not been impacted by cuts made by its owner NetEase. At this time, the company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">the studio was "continuing to develop our projects at full pace"</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, former lead writer for Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a> and Star Wars Eclipse Adam Williams revealed he had left the studio after 10 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">He subsequently announced his new studio, Republic Games</a>, which is working on a handcrafted "dark, mature fantasy RPG".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bethesda has opened up suggestions for improvements to its hugely-popular The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remaster, and fans have begun weighing in via reddit and Discord with their requests. 
</p>
<p>
Among the top ideas, we've seen a few come up repeatedly - and those who've played the remaster already may well be able to guess what they are.
</p>
<p>
First off, is difficulty. "There must be a difficulty level between Adept and Expert!" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1k96i47/bethesda_is_taking_suggestions_for_oblivion/?sort=confidence">wrote WheelsOnFire</a>, to the agreement of many others who believe Adept is too straightforward, but Expert is too much of a grind.
</p>
<p>
"I'm still having moments of actually having to try at level 19 if I'm ganged up on, but for the most part my health barely goes down on Adept," another fan noted. "Even going out of my way not to over-level constitution. While expert makes even single mobs a slog at times."

<p>
"It's truly ridiculous," wrote another fan. "After a while Adept is just too easy so I've been playing on Expert and I die eight times every dungeon and go through like 30 potions it's insane."
</p>
<p>
Speaking of dungeons, there are several popular requests regarding those, too. 
</p>
<p>
"[A] cleared tag on cleared dungeons on the world map like in Skyrim!" suggested Kalameet7, to much agreement. 
</p>
<p>
"Yes, also the world map automatically zooming in to your location when you're in a dungeon instead of having to manually do it from the over land view every single time," wrote the appropriately-named ITrageGuy. We've seen many similar requests from others about this too - and hopefully it's an easy thing to fix.
</p>
<p>
Other popular quality of life changes include the ability to see weight when looting, modify your character build later in the game, bundling the game's many keys onto a keyring, and better animations for the remaster's newly-added ability to sprint. 
</p>
<p>
Fans have also asked for a couple of other more modern features - a photo mode, and the ability to call your horse. Imagine seeing that gleaming horse armour trotting towards you!
</p>
<p>
We've seen a number of fans ask Bethesda to add proper mod support, especially on consoles, similar to that found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has already said it will not be officially supporting Oblivion Remastered mods</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda">that hasn't stopped fans from quickly getting to work on PC anyway</a>.
</p>
<p>
But with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">huge popularity of Oblivion now, with over four million players</a> - could Bethesda change its mind?
</p>
<p>
And finally, here's one that would be fun: "Change it so when you wake up after your first sleep, you wake up in the back of the wagon at the start of Skyrim," wrote JustSomeGuyThing. You were trying to cross the border, right?

            <p>Until Dawn is the latest video game to get itself a film adaptation, having made its cinematic debut on 25th April. At the film's close, its credits acknowledge the game it is inspired by, but no individual developer credits are highlighted.</p>
<p>Now, a former PlayStation narrative director has <a href="https://www.change.org/p/credit-the-until-dawn-game-creators">started a petition</a> "for the integrity of the Until Dawn creators", which they hope will see the film's credits updated so members of the original team "may be finally honoured".</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the petition has 167 signatures.</p>

<p>"As a former Sony Interactive Entertainment and PlayStation narrative director who was firmly told that the IP I personally created would NEVER be credited to me as I was salaried (no royalties, no control, no ownership , no acknowledgement) I am struggling with the difference between [The Last of Us creator] Neil Druckmann's favour and that of others in your company," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7321943561434796033?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7321943561434796033%2C7321958047344463872%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287321958047344463872%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7321943561434796033%29">Kim MacAskill wrote on LinkedIn</a> (please note, she is <em>not</em> talking about personally being a part of Until Dawn's creation, here).</p>
<p>"I've just left Until Dawn where the film director, writers etc were all credited but instead of you mentioning the leading game dev(s) who created this ICONIC game you're clearly proud of, you just wrapped it as 'based on the Sony game'."</p>
<p>MacAskill said members of the Until Dawn team had spent "years breaking their brains to make something incredible", and therefore "the world DESERVES to know their names" in the film's credits.</p>
<p>"Why should IP creators keep working for you? Film and TV, which is grotesque at the best of times, still own the need to note the importance of credit," MacAskill closed.</p>
<p>However, while there should absolutely be credit where credit is due, MacAskill fails to acknowledge that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-curious-about-how-people-will-react-to-season-2-as-elephant-in-the-room-is-dodged">Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann also works on The Last of Us TV show as a writer and director</a>. In Until Dawn's case, meanwhile, the game's writers were not approached to consult on the film, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-movie-teaser-reveals-how-its-replaced-the-games-branching-narrative">differs from the source material significantly</a>.</p>
<p>As for The Last of Us, the wider studio is credited under the banner that the show is based on the video game series.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/movies/news/why-until-dawn-video-game-writers-arent-credited-on-the-movie/ar-AA1DD96a">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick - the pair who wrote 2015's Until Dawn video game release for PlayStation - have said they weren't surprised to see their names absent from the film's credits, and weren't seeking to be included now - although a nod would have been appreciated.</p>
<p>"I didn't assume anything, but I thought somebody would have bothered to throw in our names, even during the end credits," Fessenden said. "But there's no courtesy in show biz."</p>
<p>On this lack of credit, screenwriter and Writers Guild of America (WGA) member C. Robert Cargill - whose credits include 2016's Doctor Strange - pointed out this is common practice.</p>
<p>"This is one of those situations where credit is clear, but because the Guild doesn't know who to ascribe credit [for video games] in general, they don't have a hard and fast rule about how to do that," Cargill said.</p>
<p>"Technically, the studio's abiding by Guild rules."</p>

<p>The Until Dawn adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">features both a new cast of characters and a new story</a>.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, last year's PS5 remake introduced a new ending for Until Dawn, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-leak-points-to-potential-sequel">which hints towards a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
