            <p>
It looks like Sonic and Shadow are heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, though perhaps not in the way you'd expect.
</p>
<p>
Known Fortnite leaker Wenso has shared datamined evidence on social media of Kicks themed around the two Sega hedgehogs based on in-game data, suggesting in-game trainers will be added to the game. 
</p>
<p>
The designs resemble <a href="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-puma-collection-release-date/">Puma's forthcoming Sonic the Hedgehog collection</a>, which will be available to purchase from 30th October - perhaps that's when they'll be added to Fortnite too, though Wenso noted there are no shop assets yet.

<p>
The Fortnite shop already includes <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?game=br&amp;type=kicks">Kicks</a> for brands like Nike, Adidas, Vans, and Puma.
</p>
<p>
Puma's collection also includes sneakers themed on sidekick Tails, though these are yet to be discovered in the game.

<p>
Does this mean we'll also get full skins to play as? That does seem unlikely, in part due to character proportions but also that Sonic canonically has not wielded a gun - although Shadow, of course, has.
</p>
<p>
Still, I think Sega is likely to go the way of Nintendo and not want its characters shooting each other. Perhaps we could see more clothing items in addition to those Kicks?
</p>
<p>The Fortnite crossover could also coincide with the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, due out later this month. Indeed, the racing game's premise is crossovers with other series, so perhaps it works both ways.</p>

            <p>Sony has released a new PlayStation Family App on iOS and Android, giving you more - and more immediate - control over a number of aspects of your child's gaming.</p>
<p>What catches my eye is the ability to manage how much time a child is spending on their PlayStation machine, and to do it dynamically. This means your child has a time balance per day to play, which you can up or down whenever you wish, and you can see how much they have used in real-time. They can even pitch you for more playtime via the app, so you don't even need to talk to them! You need only approve or decline.</p>

<p>Also useful: real-time notifications that show what they're playing, spending controls, customisable content filtering, and managing access to social features. And graphs, which are always useful, I think.</p>
<p>"We're excited to bring an easy way for parents to manage their children's gaming directly from their mobile devices," said Sony on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/10/announcing-playstation-family-app-for-parental-controls-and-family-management/">the PlayStation Blog.</a> "This is just the beginning with our new mobile app – we'll plan to continue adding enhancements to the PlayStation Family app to evolve the experience over time."</p>

            <p>Sega and Sports Interactive, developer of the Football Manager series, have announced that the next and highly anticipated version of the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a>, will release on 4th November.</p>
<p>The initial roll-out of the game will be on PC/Mac (full-fat version), alongside Football Manager 26 Console for PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. On 4th December Football Manager 26 Touch will release digitally for Nintendo Switch. All these versions of the game are built on the Unity Engine for the first time and offer save game compatibility with Football Manager 2024 and Football Manager 2023.</p>
<p>A mobile version of FM26 will be released exclusively for Netflix subscribers on the same date. This version will have compatibility with saves from FM24 Mobile careers only, and hasn't made the switch to the Unity Engine.</p>
<p>"Setting Sports Interactive up for the next 20 years and beyond was an enormous undertaking but I couldn't be prouder of the efforts of the whole team over the past two years" said Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson.</p>
<p>Football Manager 26 and Football Manager Console (Xbox) will also launch day one in Game Pass.</p>
