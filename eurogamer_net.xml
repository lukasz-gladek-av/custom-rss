            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> has undergone a drastic shift among its leadership, as part of the company's refocus on major IPs like Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/">According to Variety</a>, three studio heads were promoted to senior vice president positions. These include NetherRealm's Shaun Himmerick, Warner Bros. Games New York's Steven Flenory, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games-montreal">Warner Bros. Games Montreal</a>'s Yves Lachance.</p>
<p>Himmerick is now in charge of both Mortal Kombat and DC games, Lachance is handling Harry Potter and Game of Thrones, while Flenory is left with game and publishing technology, customer service, quality assurance and user research.</p>

<p>The trio will now report to Warner Bros. Discovery's CEO of games and global streaming, while all teams under the Warner Bros. umbrella will now be reporting directly to these new vice presidents.</p>
<p>Variety confirmed no layoffs are attached with this shift. This is in stark contrast to Rocksteady, developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and part of the Warner Bros. Discovery collection of studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">which suffered significant layoffs in January 2025</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Warner also recently closed Monolith, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego</a> as part of what the company called a "strategic change in direction". Back in March it was reported by Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">a major expansion to Hogwarts Legacy was cancelled</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> officially got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">its final update earlier this year</a>. Even Mortal Kombat wasn't sheltered from this hardship, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netherrealm-ends-mortal-kombat-1-support-as-focus-shifts-to-the-next-project">suddenly announcing an end to major updates in May</a> despite prior statements from Ed Boon that the game would have a longer life ahead of it.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for future games from Warner Bros. Games? Well we know <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/">a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy is coming</a>, a game that proved exceptionally popular for Warner Bros. and a jewel in its crown ever since.</p>
<p>We also saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-of-thrones-war-for-westeros-is-an-rts-launching-next-year">Game of Thrones: War for Westeros announced at Summer Game Fest</a>, an RTS set to launch next year. These will prove to be the first examples of games created under the umbrella of Warner Bros. Games' new direction, and a tone setter for what's to come. DC Boss James Gunn stated in February he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games">discussing the development of games using the IP with Rocksteady and NetherRealm</a>. Injustice 3, anyone?
</p>
<p>It's clear Warner Bros. Games is in a bad state. Its lack of game releases <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">resulted in a 48 percent drop in game revenue last quarter</a>, and it has unceremoniously kicked hundreds of developers out the door. The company is in desperate need of a win. Whether or not this shift can lead to an end to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-hellish-decade-offers-a-valuable-lesson-to-gamings-power-brokers-sometimes-youve-nobody-to-blame-but-yourselves">what has been a hellish decade</a> for the media giant's gaming aspirations remains to be seen.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>New casting rumours have begun doing the rounds for Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda live-action film adaptation, suggesting the possible ages of its lead protagonists.</p>
<p>Nintendo's own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> first confirmed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">live-action The Legend of Zelda movie back in November 2023</a>, with a rather casual post on social media. Following this news, many hoped that Euphoria's Hunter Schafer may land the role of Princess Zelda. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/miyamoto-admits-nintendo-faces-an-extremely-high-hurdle-with-zelda-film">Schafer said it would be "pretty cool" to get the part</a>.</p>

<p>However, the adaptation's latest casting rumours suggest Nintendo is looking for actors between the ages of 16 and 23, at least for both Link and Zelda, which would potentially age Schafer out of consideration (Schafer was born in December 1998, making her 26).</p>
<p>Word of this casting process comes from internet tipster DanielRPK (via <a href="https://zeldauniverse.net/2025/06/17/casting-for-zelda-movie-is-possibly-in-the-works/">ZeldaUniverse</a>), who is perhaps best known for scoops on Marvel TV shows and movies. According to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/131325843">DanielRPK's Patreon account</a>, casting for the roles of Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, Impa, and/or the King of Hyrule could be taking place as we speak. </p>
<p>It's claimed the casting period could be wrapped by the end of August. Meanwhile, the current rumour is that filming for the Zelda adaptation will start sometime this November, with production aiming to then be complete by the following spring.</p>
<p>While we don't yet know which game the film will be adapting, given the ages of the actors they are looking for it is safe to rule out the likes of the very first game, when <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-The-Legend-of-Zelda-Ocarina-of-Time-3D/Vol-5-Mr-Shigeru-Miyamoto/2-Many-Characters-Many-Roles/2-Many-Characters-Many-Roles-224609.html">Link was around 12 years old</a>. Likewise, according to the <a href="https://amiibo.fandom.com/wiki/Toon_Link_(Super_Smash_Bros.)">amiibo description for Toon Link</a> (as he is often referred to), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">Wind Waker</a>'s Link would have received his green tunic on his 12th birthday.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the film's Link and Zelda are being cast to look more like very young adults, we could perhaps be looking at an adaptation more along the lines of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, in which flashbacks take place around and on <a href="https://zeldawiki.wiki/wiki/Spring_of_Wisdom_(Voice_Memory)">Zelda's seventeenth birthday</a>. An adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a>, however, may prove more complicated to adapt, given its time-travelling mechanic.</p>

<p>As for what we do know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-is-being-made-in-close-collaboration-with-the-true-genius-of-miyamoto">Miyamoto will produce the Zelda film</a>, which is being co-financed by Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment (Sony will also handle worldwide theatrical distribution).</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda film adaptation is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">currently slated for release on 7th May, 2027</a>. It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-could-be-the-first-of-a-trilogy">allegedly be the start of a trilogy</a>, planned for release over six years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
