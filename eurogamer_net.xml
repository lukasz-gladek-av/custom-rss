            <p>How time flies. It only seems like yesterday we had the last State of Play, and yet here we are with Sony delivering a State of Play broadcast this evening from 10pm UK time. We'll be covering all of the announcements, as they happen, right here in this article, as we always do, in exactly the same way. The games will be different, though, I hope.</p>
<p>As always can chat along with us and let us know what you think of the games. Some people like to be mean, others are quite positive about everything - it really depends on if every other game is a soulslike or not.</p>
<p>What's in tonight's show is a bit of a guess at this point. It looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-but-dont-expect-to-see-wolverine-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play">Wolverine isn't going to be here</a>, but we expect to see Saros, and perhaps an update on Fairgames if it's still in development. Shall we say it? Worth a go, I guess... maybe there'll be a Bloodborne remaster too? Unlikely, but one day, maybe, if we all hope hard enough.</p>
<p><em>Anyway.</em></p>
<p>PlayStation at 10pm, then. Join us for what is bound to be an hour or so of at least mild entertainment.</p>
