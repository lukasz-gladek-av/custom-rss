Popular mobile card game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has warned players it will take action against anyone with a rude, inoffensive or inapproproate username.
</p>
<p>
After all, Pikachu and friends appeal to players of all ages, and the app is definitely not a place for username gags on Pokéballs.

"In accordance with the Terms of Use, we will change player names of the accounts in question and will warn them, suspend their accounts, or take other action," the statement reads.

<p>
"We will continue to strive to provide an environment where everyone can safely and comfortably enjoy their experience. We hope you continue to enjoy Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket."
</p>
<p>
In other words, keep your swears, insults and lewd references to Diglett to yourself.

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has found a big audience, and raked in well over $120m since its launch last month. Today brings a selection of fresh cards via a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-cards-joining-pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-ahead-of-december-events">new Venusaur PVE event that's live from now until 13th December</a>. </p>

            <p>The next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studios will be a sci-fi survival horror, in a marked change from the souslike genre.</p>
<p>As reported by Korean news site <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423">EBN</a>, the game will utilise Unreal Engine 5 and is targeting a release on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The same report also confirms DLC for Lies of P is slated for the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>A statement from publisher Neowiz said it's too early to disclose progress of the project and that it is one of multiple PC and console games in development - presumably alongside the confirmed sequel to Lies of P.</p>
<p>Still, a swing to survival horror for its next standalone project is quite a change and proves the wide-reaching ambitions of the developer to become a leader in the South Korean games industry.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">sequel to Lies of P was confirmed last year</a> by director Ji Won Choi. "Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on our sequel," he said at the time.</p>
<p>While it's unknown where the story will lead in a sequel, hints at the end of Lies of P have certainly had fans speculating on what fairytale could be next for the soulslike treatment, following the game's Pinocchio inspiration.</p>
<p>As for the Lies of P DLC, its existence was revealed shortly after the game's release, though so far only concept art of a ship has been shown. "I can promise you one thing," said Choi with the reveal. "What I just showed you scratches merely the tip of an iceberg."</p>
<p>Following its launch last October, Lies of P sold a million copies in less than a month and, by March of this year had surpassed seven million players (including through subscription services).</p>
<p>It's proven a big success for the developer and is now frequently considered one of the best soulslike games not created by From Software.</p>

            <p>
With the end of the year looming, Hello Games' exploratory space sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is - in an occurrence that's rapidly becoming a bit of a tradition - revisiting all its limited-time Expedition events from 2024 over the next ten weeks. That means you've got another chance to whizz through and earn their various rewards if you missed them the first time around.
</p>
<p>
And I do mean whizz. While Expeditions ordinarily last around six weeks, No Man's Sky's latest Redux event is racing through this year's offerings at a pace of one a fortnight. Furthermore, things are already underway with Omega - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-is-free-to-play-this-weekend-as-new-omega-update-lands">kicked off 2024's Expeditions</a> back in February - now live and running until 11th December.
</p>
<p>
Omega (as is the case for all future Expeditions) can be accessed via the terminal in No Man's Sky's communal Space Anomaly, and - among its many rewards - gives players the opportunity to earn the rather flashy Starborn starship. Before we cover the highlights of each Expedition, though, here's the upcoming Redux schedule in full:

<figcaption>No Man's Sky's spooky The Cursed expedition arrived in October.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyPJUtsQiEY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>Omega: 27th November - 11th December</li>
<li>Adrift: 11th December - 25th December</li>
<li>Liquidators: 25th December - 8th January</li>
<li>Aquarius: 8th January - 22nd January</li>
<li>The Cursed: 22nd January - 5th February</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rewards for Adrift, which sees players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-latest-update-lets-players-explore-a-lonely-abandoned-universe-devoid-of-life">stranded alone in an empty universe</a>, include a haunted frigate known as the Ship of the Damned. Liquidators, meanwhile, features organic chitlin armour to earn as players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-borrows-some-of-light-no-fires-fancy-tech-for-a-planetary-overhaul-in-latest-update">embark on a Starship Troopers-style bug hunt</a> across the stars. 
</p><p>
As for Aquarius, it's a fairly leisurely Expedition primarily concerned with introducing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-reel-in-new-aquarius-fishing-update">No Man's Sky's new fishing system</a>, and rewards here include the Lost Angler's fishing equipment and a octopus-inspired bobblhead for your starship's dashboard. As finally, there's The Cursed - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-the-cursed-is-a-spooky-expedition-for-halloween-set-in-a-collapsing-reality">horror-themed Expedition</a> set in a collapsing reality populated by spectral entities. Rewards here are pretty nifty, including the Cthulhu-esque Horror Exosuit customisation, bioluminescent pets, and the UFO-like Boundary Herald starship.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games' Expedition Redux event is now underway on all platforms, and it follows yesterday's news that No Man's Sky has finally - eight years after its rocky launch - managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eight-years-after-its-rocky-launch-no-mans-sky-finally-hits-very-positive-reviews-on-steam">hit the "Very Positive" reviews threshold</a> on Steam. Reaching the coveted "Overwhelmingly Positive" ranking will be a bit of a challenge given the way Steam ratings are calculated, but who knows - Hello Games has <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/11/holiday-2024-expeditions/">confirmed</a> it still has "much more in store" for No Man's Sky.
