            <p>A little while ago, Nintendo said smartphone racer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a> would stop receiving new content updates. But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-tour-updates-end-next-month">even though that was the official line back in 2023</a>, Tour racers do in fact have some new content to look forward to after all.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Mario Kart Tour team shared a new trailer for the mobile game's upcoming Sunshine Tour, which will feature a collaboration event with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. This "special campaign" celebrating Mario Kart World's release last month will take place in Tour, with moustachioed brothers Mario and Luigi in mechanic outfits. Additionally, four new Karts will make their Mario Kart Tour debut.</p>
<p>The Mario Kart World Special Campaign - to give it its full name - will run from Wednesday, 23rd July until Wednesday, 6th August. You can check out a trailer for it all below.</p>

<p>Mario Kart Tour originally launched for iPhone and Android devices back in September 2019. It went on to become one of Nintendo's most lucrative mobile launches. In September 2022, so three years after its launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-tour-is-nintendos-second-highest-grossing-mobile-game">Mario Kart Tour had made Nintendo an estimated $293m globally</a>.</p>
<p>While it proved popular, there were some muddy waters on the game's initial release, as Mario Kart Tour included a gacha-style system where players pulled on Mushroom Kingdom warp pipes for a chance at unlocking new characters and kart pieces. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-to-gut-mario-kart-tour-of-grubby-gacha-elements">Nintendo ultimately removed this feature from the game in 2022</a>, and replaced it with an in-game item shop.</p>
<p>As for Mario Kart World on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, well we rather enjoyed the latest series release on its debut, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">our Tom calling it "entertaining, snackable, fun" in Eurogamer's review</a>. He awarded Mario Kart World four out of five Eurogamer stars.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/smartphone-racer-mario-kart-tour-gets-first-new-content-in-years-to-celebrate-switch-2s-mario-kart-world]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sucker Punch's Nate Fox would "love to see a trilogy rerelease" of the Infamous games, but the studio only works on one game at a time - and right now that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>.</p>
<p>Fox was interviewed by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story">Game Informer</a> about Sucker Punch's forthcoming Japanese epic, when he was asked whether the studio would be open to revisiting its Infamous series of superhero games.</p>
<p>"I would love to work on more Infamous," said Fox. "I would love to see a trilogy rerelease, but Sucker Punch is a one game at a time shop, and right now we are very focused on finishing Ghost of Yōtei."</p>

<p>Fox has long worked at Sucker Punch, beginning as a designer on the first Sly Cooper game in 2002. He also worked as the game director for all of the Infamous games and expansions - Infamous, Infamous 2, Infamous: Festival of Blood, Infamous Second Son, and Infamous First Light.</p>
<p>After working as game director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, he's now co-director on Ghost of Yōtei along with Jason Connell.</p>
<p>The first Infamous game released on PS3 and was notable for its Karma system that allowed protagonist Cole to become either good or evil, with suitably evolving powers. Later, on PS4, Infamous Second Son featured Troy Baker as protagonist Delsin Rowe, who could absorb a great variety of supernatural powers.</p>
<p>It's been 11 years since Second Son and its expansion First Light, but it seems Sucker Punch won't be returning to the series anytime soon, especially considering the success of Ghost of Tsushima</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will be released on 2nd October exclusively on PS5. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yoteis-gorgeous-gameplay-deep-dive-reveals-refined-combat-lo-fi-beats-mode-and-more">recent State of Play gave us a longer look at its open world gameplay</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/infamous-director-would-love-to-see-a-trilogy-rerelease-but-sucker-punch-is-a-one-game-at-a-time-shop]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> will end support for the Windows 10 operating system on 14th October, 2025.</p>
<p>This is due to Microsoft itself no longer providing security updates or support for PCs running Windows after this date. As such, <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/e260c504b32d4dfd8be14d582f54b14664e9d8d0">Square Enix stated</a> continuing support for this OS is "a difficult proposition".</p>
<p>The company added it's likely players will still be able to play Final Fantasy 14 on Windows 10 systems after this time, but it will no longer be able to provide support for any OS issues.</p>

<p>Some technical support may be provided, it said, but this will be informal, on a case-by-case basis, and not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Along with this change, the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/system_requirements/#windows">OS/CPU requirements</a> for the Windows version of Final Fantasy 14 will also be updated on 14th October.</p>
<p>Windows 10 was first released in July 2015, so this end of support from Microsoft comes after a decade of use. Windows 11 is the latest version of the Windows OS, which was released in 2021.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14, of course, released back in 2010, so has been available across multiple operating systems. This is somewhat par for the course for such a long-running game.</p>
<p>The game's most recent expansion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail</a>, introduced a graphical update in an effort to modernise the visuals.</p>
<p>The next patch, 7.3, will be released early next month. It's called <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/patch_7_3/">The Promise of Tomorrow</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-ending-support-for-windows-10-os-alongside-microsoft]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo is gearing up for another one of its Switch Online playtest programs.</p>
<p>This particular test will kick off later this month, on Monday 28th. It will run until Sunday, 10th August.</p>
<p>As with last year's playtest, Nintendo is keeping this rather mysterious for would-be participants, stating it is all "related to a service" for Switch Online. That said, if you did participate in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">previous event which took place in October</a>, you will have an idea of what this is all about, as "this is a test of the same service".</p>

<p>If you are interested in applying, you will need to have a Nintendo Account registered in Japan, United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Canada, Brazil, or Mexico, and an "active" Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. Unlike October's test (for obvious reasons), the upcoming test also caters for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> users.</p>
<p>Nintendo said it expects to have 40,000 participants worldwide for the upcoming playtest. If you are interested, registrations open this week via <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's official website</a>. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last">with the previous test</a>, Nintendo requests participants do not discuss or disclose content from either the Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others (although, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-people-are-streaming-nintendos-mysterious-switch-online-playtest">we all know how that went last time…</a>).</p> <div>
