            <p>Marvel Rivals has amassed over 40 million players since its launch, but Chinese publisher NetEase has denied abandoning western studios after it laid off a number of developers from the game's US development team.</p>
<p>In its latest financial report, the company also boasted the free-to-play hero shooter topped Steam's global sellers chart after launch and had over 10 million registered users within 72 hours.</p>
<p>However, earlier this week NetEase laid off an unspecified number of employees from Marvel Rivals' US development team, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">game director Thaddeus Sasser breaking the news first</a>. "This is such a weird industry," he wrote. "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games... and were just laid off!"</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-publisher-netease-responds-to-shocking-layoffs-claims-they-were-to-optimise-development-efficiency">Netease stated afterwards</a> the layoffs were a "difficult decision" made to "optimise development efficiency". However, a new report from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/netease-is-unloading-its-overseas-game-properties-hurting-u-s-gaming/">VentureBeat</a> suggests there's more to come.</p>
<p>Sources interviewed by VentureBeat said the company is losing its will to make games outside of China, in part due to the high cost of US developers. The success of games like Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> also prove the AAA capabilities of China's own development studios.</p>
<p>The report also highlights that recent layoffs have coincidentally occurred alongside the trade war between the US and China, which could have further repercussions in the global games industry.</p>
<p>NetEase has denied such allegations.</p>
<p>"As far as overseas business efforts are concerned, NetEase has not wavered in its global expansion plans," reads a statement from the company to VentureBeat.</p>
<p>"Our 'two-pronged' approach, proposed in 2022 (combining self-research and investments to explore overseas markets), is still actively progressing and yielding positive results. For titles developed by the self-owned studios, we successfully launched games like Once Human and Marvel Rivals in 2024. These projects demonstrate NetEase's ability, along with our talented development teams, to produce high-quality games loved by players worldwide. For 2025, we have an extensive pipeline of titles in development, featuring a variety of genres, including FragPunk, Ananta and more."</p>
<p>NetEase did, however, acknowledge a "scaling down" of studios - something that has led to shutdowns and layoffs at an array of studios including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Mass Effect veteran Mac Walters' Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Halo Infinite head of design Jerry Hook's Jar of Sparks</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Just Cause creator Christofer Sundberg's Liquid Swords</a>.</p>
<p>"As part of our investment strategy, we started scaling down two of our studios at the end of 2024," it said. "This decision was based purely on business evaluations and was not influenced by other factors. And this represents only a small portion of our overseas studio portfolio. Our studios in North America, UK, Spain, and Japan all continue to refine and develop their ongoing game projects."</p>
<p>It continued: "We are very open and aim to leverage our company's strengths and accumulated expertise to support all developers. In order to achieve this vision, we have implemented an evaluation process, which applies equally to all NetEase studios globally – both domestic and overseas."</p>
<p>As far as the trade war is concerned, NetEase responded: "Regarding the tariff trade war, yes of course we are mindful of any developments in international trade. However, our decisions have been based solely on business evaluations and not influenced by other factors. We highly respect our gaming community in the US and their love and enthusiasm for our games is valued and appreciated."</p>
<p>Could other Chinese games companies pull out of the US? All eyes are on Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, the biggest games company in the world, which the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">US labelled as a military company</a> last month. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent threatened "legal proceedings"</a> in retaliation.</p>
<p>"While geopolitical concerns and cost pressures after two challenging years for the global video game industry are driving Chinese game companies to re-evaluate their US operations, this does not signal a withdrawal from operating and investing in studios overseas," gaming analyst firm <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/">Niko Partners wrote</a> yesterday. "It instead reflects a more selective and strategic approach to overseas investments, prioritizing projects with clear market potential - a business and fiscally driven strategy."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in its financial report, NetEase stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">wuxia action game Where Winds Meet</a> surpassed 3m downloads within four days of its PC launch in China - combined with the later mobile release, the game had 15 million players within two weeks. A release outside of China is expected this year.</p>
<p>"We boldly pushed the boundaries of innovation once again in 2024, delivering groundbreaking gaming experiences that captivated players worldwide," said CEO William Ding. "Our new hit titles not only redefined gameplay but also set new industry benchmarks, while our legacy franchises gained fresh momentum through striking enhancements in design, storytelling and immersive content. As our diverse game portfolio expands across more genres and engages an ever-growing global audience, we remain dedicated to fostering creativity and collaborating with top talent and strategic partners to shape the next wave of gaming trends."</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals season 1.5 launches tomorrow, adding The Thing and Human Torch among other additions detailed in the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250218/41548_1212474.html">patch notes</a>.

            <p>The live-action Street Fighter film now has a new director: Kitao Sakurai.</p>
<p>Capcom is "deeply involved with the adaptation" reports <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-finds-its-director-1236140934/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, and it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">still set to release on 20th March 2026</a>.</p>
<p>The Japanese-American filmmaker most recently directed Netflix film Bad Trip starring comedian Eric André. Sakurai also wrote, directed and exec produced The Eric André Show.</p>

<p>Sakurai also isn't a stranger to video game adaptations, having directed several episodes of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a> TV show. He was also exec producer on the second season of Netflix show Beef, and directed several episodes of forthcoming Amazon series Butterfly.</p>
<p>Legendary will co-develop and co-produce the film alongside Capcom.</p>
<p>A previous incarnation of the film was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-new-street-fighter-movie-gets-the-directors-behind-horror-film-talk-to-me">set to be helmed by Australian twin filmmakers and YouTubers Danny and Michael Philippou</a>, known for the horror film Talk to Me. Last June the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-loses-talk-to-me-filmmakers-1235924842/">pair left the project</a> with scheduling partly to blame.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the film, though Capcom's involvement will hopefully ensure its authenticity. I'm sure we can expect the likes of Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li to feature.</p>
<p>Of course, it's by no means the first Street Fighter film adaptation, following the infamous 1994 film starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter film will be up against its traditional rival, Mortal Kombat.</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company's annual Pokémon Presents broadcast has now been confirmed to air next week, on Thursday 27th February at 2pm UK time. That's 6am Pacific Time, or 9am Eastern.
</p>
<p>
Every year, Pokémon holds a presentation on this date to mark the anniversary of the original Pokémon Red and Green titles launching in Japan for Game Boy. This year is no different. 
</p>
<p>
So, what do we expect to see?

<p>
This year's biggest Pokémon launch will undoubtedly be Pokémon Legends Z-A, which was announced last year in a brief teaser that curiously did not show any gameplay. The title is a Switch 1 game, but will we see a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version confirmed - or the game running on Nintendo's newly-announced hardware?
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Legends Z-A is set to take players back to the Kalos region</a>, the setting of Pokémon X and Y, and looks like it will once again feature the popular Mega Evolution mechanic.
</p>
<p>
As another Legends game, it will likely have more of an action-RPG focus, similar to the previous Pokémon Legends Arceus. But where that game was set in the distant past, Z-A appears to be set in the modern day or near future.
</p>
<p>
Alongside a big focus on Z-A, Presents will likely feature a look at the franchise's other various ongoing games - such as Pokémon Unite, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.
</p>
<p>
This week, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">Pokémon Go is in talks to be sold to the Saudi-backed Savvy Games Group</a>, in a deal worth  $3.5bn. But don't expect to hear an update on that next week.
</p>
<p>
As ever, Eurogamer will be covering all the announcements from Pokémon Presents - join us then for more.

            <p>The second major update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is now available, adding a new Olympian: the god of war.</p>
<p>Appropriately named the Warsong Update, Ares has now been added (but redesigned) along with all of his boons, which look to be similar to those in the first game.</p>
<p>Also added is The Final Confrontation, with a new discovery to make atop Mount Olympus. Say no more.</p>

<p>The update also includes a new animal familiar to aid in battle, new arcana arts, new enemies, new music, and new ways to relax in the Crossroads, all as per the trailer above.</p>
<p>And of course, the story expands with new events too.</p>
<p>Over on Steam, developer Supergiant Games has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404">detailed all the additions</a> - along with quality of life tweaks and bug fixes, there are reworked boons and blessings, new upgrades and keepsakes, changes to level designs and more.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-new-region-weapon-familiars-and-more-in-first-major-early-access-update">first major update for Hades 2</a> (the Olympic Update) was back in October last year, which the Warsong Update follows along with other smaller patches.</p>
<p>The game remains in early access for now and, as noted in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350?emclan=103582791472836561&amp;emgid=503942841152569349">separate Steam blog</a>, a third major update is planned. There's still no release date for version 1.0.</p>
<p>"We're excited to have launched this Major Update, since it includes numerous ideas we've been eager to implement since we started working on Hades 2 years ago!" the post reads.</p>
<p>"But we're not finished yet, and have already made plans for our third Major Update, which we intend to deliver some months from now. Note it's still too early to share our plans beyond that, including when our v1.0 launch will be."</p>
<p>Last year creative director Greg Kasavin said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-in-early-access-at-least-through-the-end-of-this-year-says-creative-director">game would be in early access "at least through the end of this year"</a>. It seems that's set to extend for a while yet.</p>
<p>"Supergiant's first ever sequel may feel very comfortable and familiar, but Hades' best weapon remains the power of surprise," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 early access review</a>.

            <p>
Sony has responded to former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and Marathon reboot director Christopher Barrett's $200m USD wrongful dismissal lawsuit, detailing Barrett's alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates - including "sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare'".
</p>
<p>
Barrett's departure from Bungie was first reported last March, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">word of a leadership shakeup</a> at the studio. However, it was later claimed Barrett was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-former-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-reportedly-ousted-following-inappropriate-behaviour">fired from his role following an internal investigation</a> into accusation of inappropriate behaviour filed by "at least eight" female employees. Things took further turn in December, when Barrett <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-marathon-reboot-director-sues-sony-and-bungie-for-200m-claiming-wrongful-dismissal">filed a lawsuit against Bungie and Sony</a>, claiming the companies had "deliberately destroyed [his] reputation by falsely, and publicly, insinuating...he had engaged in sexual misconduct."
</p>
<p>
Barrett's list of accusations was long, but core to his argument was the claim his firing was a "premeditated scheme" concocted so Bungie and Sony could avoid paying him "nearly $50m... owed under his employment agreement". He additionally claimed he "did not do anything remotely resembling gross misconduct or 'Cause' as defined in the Retention Agreements... and there could not have been any credible allegation he did because [he] had a spotless twenty-five year track record at Bungie."

And now (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>), Sony has <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">filed its first substantive response</a>, denying Barret's claims and detailing the events allegedly leading to his dismissal. "Multiple female, subordinate employees individually reported to Human Resources that Barrett engaged in inappropriate behaviour and disturbing written and verbal communications," it wrote, "which made them uncomfortable and fearful of retaliation if they failed to engage or reported Barrett."
</p>
<p>
"The investigation revealed that Barrett's misconduct with each employee was consistent: he targeted a lower-level, female employee he wasn't working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the employee by making subtle references to her physical appearance or expressing his interest romantically.
</p>
<p>
"Barrett attempted to create an unprofessional level of intimacy with his victims," Sony continued in its court submission. "He requested to follow personal Instagram accounts and would express anger to the women if they failed to respond to his messages. He would bring up inappropriate topics like their body, their relationships, his marriage, or his desire to date them. He would demand that they participate in sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare' and 'Ask Me Anything'. He texted them at all hours of the day and night. He offered to buy them gifts. He often referenced his wealth and his ability to advance their careers."
</p>
<p>
Sony's filing also includes several examples of Barrett's alleged misconduct, including an incident where it's claimed he FaceTimed one female employee late at night while drunk despite requests to "recognise 'boundaries'", eventually moving to his bedroom and telling her, "I can't believe I am lying in bed while talking to [VICTIM 1]".
</p>
<p>
Barrett also allegedly contacted a second employee via Instagram direct message, telling her, "You are the holy grail. I hope you find a person worthy of your attention." After the employee responded saying she had a boyfriend who treated her very well, Barrett is said to have told her, "He better[.] Cuz I would hit on you if he wasn't." It's claimed he later made further contact, writing, "You want to be worshipped, I think? Why are you against that actually happening?".
</p>
<p>
Other incidents detailed in Sony's filing includes a "virtual game of 'Truth or Dare' initiated by Barrett", and a Microsoft Teams exchange in which he allegedly asked a female member of staff, "Are you still in PJs? [Is] it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweat pants? Lulu lemons?".
</p>
<p>
Sony adds, "Barrett’s predatory behaviour caused victims to seek guidance from other Bungie employees on how to manage Barrett’s constant boundary-pushing given that he was a long-standing, senior member of the company. Multiple victims reported to Human Resources during the investigation that they were afraid for their jobs during these encounters."
</p>
<p>
In response, Barrett's lawyers told Game File, "Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations and make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause.
</p>
<p>
"Christopher is confident that when all the evidence is presented, it will be clear that Sony engaged in a scheme to strip him of his role and the equity awards he earned for his 25 years of loyal service to the company."
</p>
<p>
As well as denying inappropriate behaviour during his time at Bungie, Barrett's original filing argued his former employers' actions had "irreparably harmed [him] financially, physically, and emotionally". As such, he is seeking $200m in damages - including $46K (plus interest) owed under his employment terms - and is requesting to be reinstated as game director on Marathon.
