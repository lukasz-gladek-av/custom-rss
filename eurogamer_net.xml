            <p>The Persona-inspired horror game Demonschool has a new release window, following a delay last year.</p>
<p>As revealed at the PC Gaming Show, the RPG will be released this summer. It was originally intended to launch last September, but in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-and-italian-horror-inspired-tactical-rpg-demonschool-gets-last-minute-delay">August was delayed to allow the studio to "manifest our bigger dreams into reality"</a>.</p>
<p>The new trailer, below, provides a gameplay summary of Demonschool and its parallel social activities and tactical battles, all with a cartoon horror aesthetic.</p>

<p>Demonschool will be released across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC (Steam, Epic), with Steam Deck support too.</p>
<p>Set in a haunted university, Demonschool includes both Persona-esque social activities and romance, with tactical battles inspired by Into the Breach. There will be 15 playable characters, each with special combat skills.</p>
<p>"Our team took great pride in fleshing out the world of Demonschool as much as possible," said Brandon Sheffield, creative director of developer Necrosoft Games. "With plenty of class and demon assignments to complete, characters to hang out with, and minigames to play, students won't run out of things to do on Jabberwock Island."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-is-persona-meets-buffy-and-i-love-its-90s-vibes">demo of the game was released last year</a>, which I described as "Persona meets Buffy" with its 90s vibes. "Added to the bold artwork, a dark yet funky soundtrack, and an over-the-top cartoonish aesthetic (I love the bouncy run animation), and Demonschool is yet another brilliant example of silly adults bested by a plucky gang of pesky kids."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Rogue Prince of Persia is finally leaving early access with a full 1.0 release set for August.</p>
<p>A fresh trailer for the game was shown at the PC Gaming Show over the weekend, showing plenty of its 2D roguelike gameplay, parkour abilities, and stylish combat.</p>
<p>Published by Ubisoft, The Rogue Prince of Persia is being developed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a> studio Evil Empire. It released into early access last May.</p>

<p>The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-the-second-act-update-effectively-relaunches-the-game-makes-prince-no-longer-purple">received a huge update back in November</a>, revamping the art style and doubling the game's size.</p>
<p>The full version will finish the story, add extra biomes with a proper final boss, and include more enemies and weapons. The developer has also promised news of an exact release date as well as console releases on the way.</p>
<p>It's heavily inspired by Dead Cells too, as you'd expect from the same studio.</p>
<p>"What it definitely gets from Dead Cells is an enviable forward momentum," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-lot-of-dead-cells-in-the-rogue-prince-of-persia">Christian Donlan for Eurogamer last year</a>. "The Prince is all leanness and athleticism, decked out like a modern Olympian but with a bright red sash that flows out behind him and highlights his swiftness, his elegance."</p>
<p>Evil Empire is a subsidiary of original Dead Cells developer Motion Twin, which was spun off to work on updates and DLC. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developer-ends-support-focusing-on-new-projects">ended support for Dead Cells last year</a> to work on a "secret project", which turned out to be The Rogue Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>Motion Twin, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/motion-twins-windblown-releases-in-early-access-even-sooner-than-you-think">its own game in early access: Windblown</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Casey has been writing the Mass Effect TV show for "almost a year", the publication noted. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon officially announced a Mass Effect TV show</a> was in development in November last year, when Casey's involvement was initially confirmed.</p>
<p>While we don't know any casting details at the present time, fem Shep actress <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says">Jennifer Hale previously told Eurogamer she would love to be part of the Mass Effect series</a>, and believes the original cast should be involved as well. Meanwhile, once upon a time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-would-love-to-discuss-being-in-the-mass-effect-tv-series">Henry Cavill said he would "love" to be a part of a Mass Effect TV adaptation</a>, however <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/liam-hemsworth-was-almost-cast-as-the-witchers-geralt-in-2018">following his time in The Witcher</a> the actor has now been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">snapped up for Amazon's Warhammer shenanigans</a>.</p>

<p>As for the world of video games themselves, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mass-effect-teaser-shows-series-will-return-to-milky-way">Mass Effect 5 has been announced</a>, but lacks a release date and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">appears to still be several years away</a>.</p>
<p>In October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">project director Michael Gamble said Mass Effect 5 will not seek to tweak the sci-fi franchise's established visual style</a>.
