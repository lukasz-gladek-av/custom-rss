            <p>In an alternate timeline, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> could have been a much gorier game than the one we actually got.</p>
<p>According to former Bethesda character artist Dennis Mejillones, there were once plans for Starfield to have a much more graphic depiction of violence. That included the evergreen gore-filled death - decapitation.</p>
<p>However, heads would not literally roll in Starfield for a number of reasons. The first was due to technical implications with things such as the different space suits. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM">Kiwi Talkz podcast</a>, Mejillones explained that if Bethesda ultimately went down the decapitation route, it would have required the developer to factor in all the suits and how they would react to being severed.</p>

</figure>
<p>"From a technical perspective there's a lot that has to go with it, you know... If you have to cut the helmet in a certain way, and it's got to come off, and you've got to have meat caps for the bottom where the flesh is," Mejillones said when asked about the game's lack of gore.</p><p>Bethesda did have "systems for all of that", he continued, but getting it implemented began to turn into a "big rat's nest of these things" the team had to take into account. He highlighted the helmets' "crazy hoses" as one such consideration.</p>
<p>Mejillones added the character creator in Starfield had evolved from the studio's previous games and now characters' bodies could be more different shapes and sizes, so that was also a factor.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Bethesda</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Away from technical implications, Mejillones also reasoned Starfield has a very different overall tone compared to other Bethesda games, such as the ever chaotic Fallout. "Fallout is very stylised in this regard. It's meant to be... that's part of the tongue in cheek humour," he said, commenting on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>'s Bloody Mess perk.</p><p>If you weren't aware, this perk increases the chances of enemies exploding into, well, a bloody mess (see video below). This over-the-top gore and theatrics is part of the fun of Fallout, and something which translated really rather well into Amazon's TV adaptation.</p>

<p>"It's like those old-school animes like Fist of the North Star - they punch each other, and gushes of blood would forever come out. It's just, nobody can hold that much blood but you're like 'oh man, that's cool'. It adds to that style," Mejillones continued, before concluding:</p>
<p>"I think for Starfield it was definitely meant to be more low-fi and realistic. We were inspired a lot by things like The Expanse and Star Trek, stuff like that. So I think [over the top gore] just didn't fit thematically... And on top of that you have the cost, the technical overhead cost to get that to work, so we were kind of like 'it's probably better not to include it in this game'."</p>
<p>So, would you have preferred Starfield to have featured more gore, or do you agree it needed to keep with its more grounded tone?</p>

<p>Away from the base game, last year Bethesda released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">Shattered Space expansion for Starfield</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-warps-bethesdas-final-frontier-into-full-on-horror">introduced a bit of horror to spice things up</a>.</p>
<p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Todd Howard previously confirmed at least one more DLC for the space epic</a> following Shattered Space. As for what that could be, fans believe a trademark for "Starborn" registered by Bethesda parent company Zenimax back in July <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-trademark-points-to-future-starfield-expansion-fans-believe">could offer a clue to Starfield's second expansion</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> players have spotted references to the Game Boy games in the background of many cards.</p>
<p>The digital card game launched with unique immersive cards to take players inside the artwork, but it's the more basic cards that have caught the attention of fans.</p>
<p>Over on reddit, user asch_win has used card artwork to spot the exact location of the characters. For instance, the Spearow card has buildings and trees in the background that are likely part of Pokémon Fire Red / Leaf Green's Celadon City, outside of which Spearow can be caught.</p>

<p>Another reddit user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1i06uln/found_a_few_more_card_locations_from_the_games/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">jteede</a>, has also identified specific game locations in card artwork. Shiny Diglett's card is outside a cave near Vermillion City; Haunter is between the notoriously haunted Lavender Town Pokémon Center and Pokémon Tower; and Doduo is along the Route 17 eastern bike path, to name three.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> has today had its soundtrack added to the Nintendo Music app.
</p>
<p>
An impressive 133 tracks are included, lasting 3 hours and 40 minutes from start to finish. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's GameCube classic - later remastered for Wii U - remains one of the most beloved entries in the Zelda series, with some truly iconic themes, such as Dragon Roost Island, The Great Sea and that toe-tapping tune that plays when you're inside the pirate ship (titled "Inside the Pirate Ship").

<p>
If you're out of the loop, the Nintendo Music app is a relatively new extra for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, available on iPhone or Android devices via the App Store and Google Play.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Music offers a decent alternative to listening to soundtracks on YouTube or cover versions on Spotify, and allows you to lengthen some tracks to loop for up to an hour. (And yes, you can do this for Beedle's Shop Ship theme.)
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can dip into music from specific moments within the game, such as the cue that plays at daybreak each morning while sailing. (The climactic Setting Sail is also a bit of a tearjerker).
</p>
<p>
Amidst a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">busy week of Nintendo news as we prepare for the reveal of Switch 2</a>, here are the tunes now available on Nintendo Music for The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker:

            <p>Two new Sony patents have been spotted that would allow players to aim their DualSense like a gun, and use AI to predict player inputs.</p>
<p>The first of these, spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/sony-dualsense-gun-accessory/">GameRant</a>, was filed in June last year and made public earlier this month. The patent is for a trigger attachment for the DualSense controller to add realism to gunplay.</p>
<p>Players would theoretically hold the controller sideways with one controller arm, using the space between the R1 and R2 shoulder buttons as an aiming sight.</p>

<p>The patent also suggests this could be paired with other hardware or accessories, including a VR headset. Though with PS VR2's Sense controllers I don't know why this would be necessary.</p>
<p>What's more, the controller arms don't seem long enough to me to house player hands and a trigger system, while the weight of the controller would be uneven to hold up for long periods.</p>
<figure>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>The second patent is, perhaps, more interesting as it could be used to reduce lag in online games by using AI to predict player inputs ahead of time (thanks <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-latency-predicting-inputs/">tech4gamers</a>).</p>
<p>The patent involves using a camera to view the player and controller, record actions, and let AI predict what inputs will be pressed next. Another option would be to use incomplete controller actions instead, allowing AI to guess players' intentions.</p>
<p>Essentially this would help to reduce latency - the delay between player input and in-game action - which can be a major issue during online games.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Other recent patents spotted by tech4gamers include using AI accounts to impersonate players and catch cheaters, and providing real-time in-game location information to assist frustrated players - as well as detecting erratic button mashing and verbal outbursts.</p>
<p>Of course, these patents don't mean these ideas will necessarily come to fruition, but it's always interesting to see what companies may be working on.</p>
<p>Previous Sony patents include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-latest-patent-suggests-its-developing-a-dualsense-controller-that-can-provide-gameplay-hints">predictive AI assistance features</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-patents-ability-for-games-to-adjust-difficulty-levels-on-the-fly">adaptive difficulty</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-patents-game-replay-from-trigger-points-over-streaming">allowing players to replay a game from specific trigger points</a>. Many patents appear to be addressing accessibility issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
