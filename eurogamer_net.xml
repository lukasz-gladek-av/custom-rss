            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> creator Gareth Damian Martin has said their warm-hearted series of sci-fi video games will end with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>, which releases 31st January. However, Citizen Sleeper as a series of games won't necessarily end there.</p>
<p>The intention, as Martin laid it out to me in a recent interview, is to create a full tabletop role-playing version of the game, and thereby handover future adventures in the series to the TTRPG space that has so inspired it.</p>

<p>Responding to whether that would be it for Citizen Sleeper games after the sequel, Martin replied: "I think it is for video games. I'll leave myself a backdoor somewhere that I can climb through and dig it out the grave again... But no. I think especially the ending - and I hope people feel this when they reach the ending - I really felt like, okay, this is me saying the final word on it. I really like where I'm leaving it. I'm really happy with that.</p><p>"But Citizen Sleeper has meant a lot to a lot of people and so I'm not about to leave that behind," they added. "The next big project for me will be to work on a Citizen Sleeper tabletop game in full, but I need to find the right collaborator and I need to work that out, and I need to do that alongside other stuff. So that's something that will be a more long-term project."</p>
<p>Martin has collaborated on tabletop projects before. Their game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lonearchivist/iow-tidebreak">In Other Waters was adapted for tabletop via a collaboration by Lone Archivist</a>, and <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/cyclesoftheeye">Citizen Sleeper was adapted into a solo, tarot-based tabletop game</a> with Alfred Valley's help, so there's a strong precedent there.</p>
<p>The video game Martin will make next is actually the game they were pitching to their publisher Fellow Traveller before development on Citizen Sleeper 2 began. It was only the runaway success of Citizen Sleeper 1 - now at one million players and counting - that derailed those plans, turning Martin's head towards add-on content and, eventually, a sequel.</p>
<p>"I was actually already pitching my next game, which was not Citizen Sleeper 2, to my publisher," they said. "That's actually going to be the next game."</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 arrives to much anticipation on 31st January. Demos have already given us a glimpse of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-goes-even-harder-on-its-rpg-roots-with-its-bold-new-twists-on-its-tabletop-dice-rolls">a game that's quite different from Citizen Sleeper 1</a>, with a much stronger sense of tension in it and more developed, and distinct, role-playing systems. The changes work brilliantly; this could be special.</p><p>The development cycle, however, hasn't been easy. Personal challenges, as well as the pressure of living up to expectations, have made life difficult, I discovered speaking with Martin. Success, as much as we court it, can be hard to deal with.</p>
<p>Look out for my full Citizen Sleeper interview soon.</p>

<p>As is the case with every month, the arrival of these new games means that others will be leaving Game Pass. The following games will leave the service on 15th January:</p>

<li>Escape Academy (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Exoprimal (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>

<li>Those Who Remain (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
<p>For everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, you can check out our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Xbox Game Pass guide</a> detailing the many titles available.</p></div>

            <p>
Sony has unveiled its latest accessories to get the Midnight Black treatment: the DualSense Edge wireless controller, Pulse Elite wireless headset and the Pulse Explore wireless earbuds, as well as the PlayStation Portal.
</p>
<p>
The new range joins the existing Midnight Black colour options for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5s-dualsense-controller-gets-black-and-red-versions">regular DualSense</a> (released back in May 2021) and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-unveils-new-midnight-black-colour-option-for-its-pulse-3d-wireless-headset">Pulse 3D wireless headset</a> (released in September 2021), as well as the PS5's black console covers.
</p>
<p>Today's announcement also comes alongside a slight reduction in price for the DualSense Edge controller in the UK and mainland Europe, with the model now officially £10/€20 cheaper, at £200/€220 instead of £210/€240.</p>
<p>
Sony adding more to its Midnight Black collection had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-dualsense-edge-and-pulse-headphones-reportedly-getting-black-colour-version">previously</a> been reported. As you'd expect, the range is coloured, well, black. Here's a video showing how it all looks:

<p>
"Each Midnight Black accessory features a unique, rich shade of black, with sleek detailing on various buttons and accents such as the PlayStation logo," Sony says, attempting to spin the fact these are coloured black into a full paragraph, which I myself am also now guilty of.
</p><p>
The charging case for the Pulse Explore earbuds is black, the charging hanger for the Pulse Elite headset is black, and the carrying case for the DualSense Edge controller is also black. However, the carrying case for the Pulse Elite wireless headset and Pulse Explore wireless earbuds will be... felt grey.
</p>
<p>The range will go on sale via direct.playstation.com and participating from 20th February, with pre-orders open on 16th January if you're feeling super keen. Pricing is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation Portal remote player – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99 </li>
<li>Pulse Explore wireless earbuds – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99</li>
<li>Pulse Elite wireless headset – Midnight Black: $149.99 | €149.99 | £129.99 GBP</li>
<li>DualSense Edge wireless controller – Midnight Black: $199.99 | €219.99 | £199.99</li>
</ul>
