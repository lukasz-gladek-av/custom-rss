            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> finally so close you can almost smell it (sweat, damp cat, and a lingering whiff of dung bomb, would be my guess), Capcom has teased more of what's coming in its first post-launch content update, now confirmed to be launching in "early April".
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Capcom has discussed Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1, of course; earlier this month, it revealed everyone's favourite bubble dragon Mizutsune would be the first post-launch monster joining Wilds. But now, on the eve of the game's release, it's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236">additionally teased a "new level of challenge"</a>, that'll manifest as a monster of "formidable strength" somewhere above the tougher Tempered variants currently found in-game.
</p>
<p>
Its announcement also alluded to "another challenging monster", but it's unclear if this is a reference to Mizutsune or a third new monster. Either way - as I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">noted in my review this week</a> - Wilds' difficulty feels like it skews a little low at the moment, even where Tempered monsters are involved, so it'll be nice get something a little tougher to tackle so early into its lifespan.

<p>
And there's more. Capcom has <em>also</em> teased a "new place to gather" for hunters who've completed the main story, providing somewhere for friends to "meet, communicate, have meals together, and more". And by more, I assume it means arm wrestle. Currently, Wilds doesn't have a centralised gathering hub in the same way previous Monster Hunters games did, so the addition should create a welcome social focal point for players. And hopefully we'll get some seasonal decor to admire once the post-launch quests start rolling in.
</p>
<p>
But before Title Update 1's "early April" release, Monster Hunter Wilds is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-monster-hunter-wilds-physical-release-requires-a-day-one-update-but-digital-buyers-can-get-a-head-start">set to receive a 15GB day one update</a> - although Capcom hasn't yet detailed what it'll include. Hopefully, it'll address the technical rough spots evident in the pre-launch version - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-feels-undercooked-on-ps5-series-x-and-especially-series-s">Digital Foundry called "undercooked" on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-plays-better-on-ps5-pro">the PS5 Pro version fares better</a>.
