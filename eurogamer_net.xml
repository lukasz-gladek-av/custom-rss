            <p>Netflix has joined the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> film project, adapting Sloclap's kung-fu roguelike for the big screen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-getting-live-action-movie-adaptation-from-john-wick-writer-1">project was first revealed in 2022</a>, with <a href="https://www.story-kitchen.com/projects">Story Kitchen</a> producing - that's the company behind other video game adaptations like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog films</a>, the forthcoming Tomb Raider and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streets-of-rage-movie-in-development">Streets of Rage</a> adaptations, and more.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/netflix-sifu-t-s-nowlin-chad-stahelskis-producing-1236295230/">Deadline</a> has reported, Netflix is now on board and has tapped TS Nowlin to write the script, while inside sources have said Chad Stahelski and his 87Eleven Entertainment company have joined as producers. Sloclap is also officially involved.</p>

<p>Nowlin is best known for adapting The Maze Runner book series into film, and also wrote the 2022 Netflix film The Adam Project, which starred Ryan Reynolds and Zoe Saldana.</p>
<p>87Eleven, meanwhile, is developing various projects including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shogun-star-in-talks-for-ghost-of-tsushima-film-role">Sony's Ghost of Tsushima film</a>, a Rainbow Six film starring Michael B Jordan, a new Highlander film with Henry Cavill, and more.</p>
<p>Story Kitchen partner Derek Kolstad was previously linked with the project, following his work on the John Wick films. The Sifu adaptation was described as "John Wick meets M. Night Shyamalan's Old".</p>
<p>Sloclap's game follows a young martial artist seeking vengeance against the death of his master. Thanks to a magical talisman, he's resurrected after each death but ages every time until old age eventually makes his death permanent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">game reviewed well</a> and proved popular, following Sloclap's previous action game Absolver.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sifu has been adapted either, after it featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-latest-secret-level-trailer-includes-sifu-megaman-spelunky-and-a-nightmarish-pac-man">Amazon's Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>Next for Sloclap is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">football action game Rematch</a>, which promises a fresh perspective on the beautiful game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company has won "substantial" damages after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-sues-chinese-clone-seeks-62m-and-public-apology">long-running battle against a Chinese mobile rip-off</a>, following years of legal wrangling.
</p>
<p>
While the final amount has not been made public, The Pokémon Company previously said it was owed $72m (£57m) by the makers of an unlicensed Pocket Monsters smartphone app that clearly used Pokémon characters and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon Company looked to have initially won its case last September, though two of the companies involved (Guangzhou Maichi Network Technology and Khorgos Fangchi Network Technology) appealed the decision, prompting a further delay (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-pokemon-company-reaches-costly-settlement-in-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-over-chinese-mobile-game/">Automaton</a>).

<p>
Now, a Chinese court has decided upon the matter for good, and the companies have been forced to admit defeat and issue a public apology.
</p>
<p>
"We have deeply realised that our acts had violated relevant laws during the second-instance trial and settlement process," the companies said in a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_news__2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9.pdf">joint public statement, published on The Pokémon Company's corporate website</a>. "[Our] game has extensively used design elements of the well-known Pokémon video game series, infringing the copyrights related to the Pokémon video games, and has unfairly taken advantage of the fame and reputation of the Pokémon video games, thereby constituting acts of unfair competition. 
</p>
<p>
"Our copyright infringement and acts of unfair competition have caused significant economic losses to the rights holders and severely damaged the image of the original Pokémon video games. We hereby sincerely apologise to TPC and other rights holders, as well as the vast number of players, consumers, and the general public."
</p>
<p>
The game, known variously as Pocket Monster: Remake or Pocket Monster: Issue/Reissue, has now been permanently removed from sale. The companies behind the game also say they have paid "a substantial economic price and incurred significant reputational damage".
</p>
<p>
"We have deeply reflected on it and learned our lessons."
</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Fortnite maker Epic Games forced a competitive cheater to publicly apologise</a> after unfairly winning thousands of dollars in prize money. The money was taken back, the cheat was banned from playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> competitively for life, and they had to publish a humiliating public message as a stark warning to others.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has admitted porting PlayStation-exclusive games to PC is "almost like printing money", and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/ex-sony-exec-says-pc-ports-of-old-ps5-games-are-almost-like-printing-money">Push Square</a>), Yoshida revealed he wanted to bring first-party games to PC sooner, but this wasn't Sony's business model at the time.</p>
<p>"Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles – especially in regions where consoles are not as popular," he said. "The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation."</p>

<p>Beyond those benefits, it also allows Sony to reinvest money into other projects.</p>
<p>"It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title," he said. "So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased."</p>
<p>What's more, releasing games on PC allows PlayStation to spread to new regions where that platform is more popular - China, in particular.</p>
<p>"China is a huge PC game market," said Yoshida. "And China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience."</p>
<p>Beginning with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> in 2020, Sony has gradually been porting its PlayStation exclusive games to PC.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> released on PC, while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is set to follow in April.</p>
<p>And while these releases have seen diminishing returns in terms of player numbers on Steam at least, the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was a huge success for Sony - it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest selling game</a> owing to huge success on PC. That success was hampered, though, by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">Sony's insistence on requiring PSN to play</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">Yoshida also discussed Sony's live service plans</a>, revealing he played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s ill-fated The Last of Us Online, which he described as "great".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Cosy Hobbit life sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game has been delayed once again, this time until 29th July.
</p>
<p>
It's the second hold-up for the game after an earlier delay announced last year. Back in September 2024, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed">Wētā Workshop said it expected the game to arrive in early 2025</a>. Now, there's another five months to wait.
</p>
<p>
A statement <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165">published today on the game's social media account</a> does not go into detail on why the game has been postponed once again, other than to say that Wētā Workshop wanted to ensure "every Hobbit, on every platform, can enjoy the same cosy experience".

<p>
It seems possible that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s recent sale of Private Division, Tales of the Shire's original publisher, may have had some impact on the game's progress. But some Lord of the Rings fans have also raised questions about the game's quality level, based on previous trailers.
</p>
<p>
"We want this game to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth," today's statement notes, "and we are making sure that no matter where you play, you'll feel right at home in The Shire. From foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes, every detail will be just right."
</p>
<p>
It's been reported that Tales of the Shire, alongside other Private Division games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">will now be aided by staff members</a> who previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">quit indie publisher Annapurna Interactive in a mass exodus</a> last year.

            <p>Split Fiction will include crossplay for the first time across all platforms - PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (Windows, Steam, Epic) - via the Friend's Pass function.</p>
<p>This means Hazelight's forthcoming co-op adventure will be playable by two players online across any platform with only one copy of the game required.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> similarly included the Friend's Pass function, but players had to be on the same platform. Now, that's changed for Split Fiction.</p>

<p>As long as you own a copy of the game, you can invite any friend on any platform to join you online for free. The catch is that you both need EA accounts linked to your platform account in order to be friends.</p>
<p>Friend's Pass can also be used with "as many different friends as you want, one friend at a time", reads the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-playstation">FAQ</a>, essentially meaning it's not a one time use code so as long as you own a copy of the game, you can share the experience with an infinite number of friends. The host player will also determine the starting point, meaning they can invite a different friend to continue playing (or restart the game).</p>
<p>A demo version of the game will also be playable for free across platforms using Friend's Pass, or in local couch co-op. It includes the first few levels of the game.</p>
<p>And, of course, the game will be fully playable offline in local co-op without using Friend's Pass.</p>
<p>Further, all progress made while playing using Friend's Pass will be carried over into the full game, whether you're the player joining someone else's game via the function, or you're playing the demo version.</p>
<p>However, Trophies and Achievements will only be unlocked by players that have purchased the full game - that would be the host only, and not the player joining for free.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set for release on 6th March - it's a co-op only game about two authors whose sci-fi and fantasy worlds collide. It follows It Takes Two, which won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 among other accolades.</p>
