            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> started development after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was finished, Nintendo has said, and work first began on the original Switch console.</p>
<p>The forthcoming game is the first 3D game featuring Nintendo's gorilla since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, but in an interview with <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20250710/10876902/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2-entrevista.html">La Vanguardia</a>, Bonanza's producer Kenta Motokura stated the team felt "this was the right time to develop this game".</p>
<p>When asked when development began, Motokura replied: "Although I can't give you very precise details, I can tell you that we started developing it after finishing Super Mario Odyssey (2017)" (via machine translation).</p>

<p>Later in the interview, director Kazuya Takahashi discussed how Donkey Kong Bananza's focus on destruction was only made possible on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"As we mentioned before, we wanted to generate continuity through chain destruction, and to do this we needed to place a large number of destructible objects," said Takahashi. "This was only possible on Switch 2, which allowed so many elements to be placed on the screen, as well as different materials and large-scale destruction. In addition, to increase the feeling of satisfaction when destroying, we have put a lot of care into the effects and sounds, and also in the appearance of the objects that are destroyed."</p>
<p>Nintendo confirmed earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team">Donkey Kong Bananza has been developed by the team responsible for Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-film-copyright-registered-by-nintendo-as-gorillas-prominence-continues">Nintendo has registered copyright for a Donkey Kong film</a>, which will likely follow the forthcoming Mario film sequel and Legend of Zelda film.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-started-development-after-super-mario-odyssey-and-wouldnt-have-been-possible-on-the-original-switch]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Haru Urara has been sent an absurd amount of tasty ryegrass, thanks to her appearance in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby and an influx of new fans.</p>

            <p><strong>Uma Musume: Pretty Derby</strong> fanatics have come out en masse to send packages of delicious ryegrass to their favourite horse from the game: Haru Urara. 
</p>
<p>Uma Musume, if you're not in the know, is an extremely popular gacha game that is getting more players by the day: over the weekend, it enjoyed over 50,000 concurrents on Steam alone (notable, since the vast majorioty of the playerbase is on mobile). In-game, you must further the careers of a variety of horses - obviously represented as horses, here - in order to progress. And it just so happnes that Haru Urara is the current fan favourite.  </p>
<p>This flood of new fans have been so passionate in their support the <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/article/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9">Japanese ryegrass gifting website Live Grass Bank</a> has been sporadically crashing for days due to the intense traffic. However, <a href="https://x.com/namabokusobank/status/1944550718050042228">a public statement from the site</a> has confirmed the orders have been received and these gifts will be sent out over time.
</p>
<p>Haru Urara, depicted as a lighthearted pink-haired horse girl in Uma Musame: Pretty Derby, isn't a particularly great horse. During her professional career, the actual racehorse didn't win a single race, which is reflected in-game with career goals focused on gaining fans rather than taking home trophies.
</p>

<p>However, her delightful character has proven more than enough to garner a fresh fanbase with the worldwide release of free-to-play hit Uma Musame: Pretty Derby. An exceptionally popular gacha game available on both mobile and PC, many players who have yet to nab one of the rarer horses have nonetheless been having a blast with Haru and the other basic characters.
</p>
<p>Messages of support for Haru Urara are numerous on the ryegrass gifting website. Alongside each gift, you can leave a lovely message of support, such as "enjoy the grass from a loving sailor", or the short but sweet "never give up". We know Haru's getting the grass too, <a href="https://x.com/animal_love_kaz/status/1942472338420666628">courtesy of videos posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.
</p>
<p>Then, of course, you have social media, where artists have galloped along to immortalise this feeding frenzy <a href="https://x.com/HARUURARA_mochi/status/1943903597994901727">with custom illustrations</a>. It's safe to say that while Haru Urara may not have won any races in their career, winning the hearts of gacha fans will keep them full for a while.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/so-why-exactly-are-uma-musume-pretty-derby-players-are-sending-massive-amounts-of-grass-to-a-retired-japanese-race-horse]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> creator Kinetic Games will be creatively involved in the recently announced film, and, the studio has told Eurogamer, it will begin seeding lore across the game in order to develop a story for it.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we are involved in the creative side of it as well," the game's creator, Daniel Knight, told me as part of a longer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">Phasmophobia interview</a>. "We do want to make sure it is a Phasmophobia film and it's what everybody will expect going in. We're not just making a ghost-hunting film. It will be a Phasmophobia-themed film, and it's our job to make sure it's what everybody wants."</p>
<p>But as people pointed out in reaction to the film's announcement, the game doesn't really have a story. It follows a series of procedurally generated ghost hunts that take place across apparently unconnected properties. How does that translate into a film?</p>

<p>"There's some very minor story parts in the game right now," Knight responded. "We do have a lore update planned as well. We were planning on doing that before the whole film stuff came about.</p>
<p>"We'll do our own lore and story for the game and design it in a way where it's a puzzle for people to figure out," he added. "There's not going to be any story mode or campaign or anything like that. You're just going to be poking around in different locations. And that will be used for the film stuff as well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-has-earned-itself-a-movie-adaptation-from-m3gan-and-five-nights-at-freddys-production-company-blumhouse">The Phasmophobia film was announced in June</a> as a collaboration between Kinetic and Blumhouse (M3gan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a>), and production company Atomic Monster (Annabelle, The Nun, The Conjuring). But apparently Blumhouse wasn't the first film studio to express interest.</p>

<p>"We had a few different studios reach out," Knight told me. "We had quite a lot of interest. Even shortly after release, we had quite a big studio reach out," he said. I asked him who this was but he couldn't remember; I pursued this and genuinely seemed unable to recall the name. "We had quite a few over the years," he added, "and then Blumhouse reached out and we're all fans of all their horror films, and they were the perfect fit.</p>
<p>"A lot of them all play the game as well," he said. "I think it'll be like they will take the game stuff into the film, rather than the other way around."</p>
<p>It's been an extraordinary five years for Knight and Kinetic Games since Phasmophobia was released. Still only in Early Access, the game has sold more than 25 million copies - a new grand total Knight gave me when we spoke. The recent console releases and major Chronicle update have rejuvenated player activity in the game, and now all eyes turn to 2026 and the major 1.0 release, which is so significant, Knight said you should feel like you're playing a new game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-of-phasmophobia-how-the-witcher-3-inadvertently-saved-the-ghost-hunting-game-that-sold-25-million-copies">The full story of Phasmophobia</a>, from near-miss to extraordinary success, is live elsewhere on Eurogamer now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-will-begin-seeding-lore-to-build-story-for-the-film]]></content:encoded>
