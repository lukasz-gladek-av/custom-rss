            <p>An upcoming Pokémon game may have a darker story than you'd expect given its cheerful look and typical Nintendo vibrancy. With links to the original Pokémon game trilogy and hints at older lore, what appears to be a quirky spin on the franchise might actually have a sadder side if fan theories are spot on.</p>
<p>That game, for those not tuned into all things Pokémon, is Pokopia. This is an Animal Crossing style game in which you play a Ditto, morphed into human form, and find Pokémon spread around the island in order to restore some life to the place. Cool right?</p>
<p>Well, the extended trailer The Pokémon Company released earlier this month does offer some hints at a more dire tale hidden beneath the surface. First of all, while a Pokémon Centre is present, there are no other buildings. Ruins, sure, but no sign of human life. This is stated explicitly by your in-game guide Professor Tangrowth, who hasn't seen a human in a long time.</p>

<p>So what's happened? Well, there are some clues hidden fans believe which point to an important link to early Pokémon games. For one, the Pokédex seen at the start of the extended trailer is a generation one Pokédex, which offers a good starting point for where Pokopia takes place. Secondly, the game is set on an island, a key detail to the puzzle.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/">Pokémon fans believe the game may be set on Cinnabar island from the Kanto region</a>. This location was a key spot where the fire gym was located in the first generation Pokémon games: Blue, Red, and Yellow. However, by the time Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal takes place, the volcano on the island erupts, leaving only the Pokémon centre standing - just like the starting town we see in the Pokopia trailer.</p>
<p>Following this eruption the entire island is evacuated, explaining the lack of people present on the island despite clear evidence of buildings, roads, etc. In case you think this isn't enough evidence, there's actually more proof Pokémon Pokopia takes place on a post-eruption Cinnabar. Ditto, who you take control of in Pokopia, can only be found in one spot in the generation one Pokémon games: Pokémon Mansion. If this games <em>does</em> take place between the generation one and two Pokémon games, where else could a Ditto come from?</p>
<p>If we accept Pokémon Pokopia is set in Cinnabar Island it explains a lot of the new Pokémon we see in the trailer too. Pokémon Mansion is where a lot of experiments on Pokémon took place - it's where Mewtwo was created - so it's not out of the question to say other tinkering may have happened.</p>
<p>Failing that, the new Pokémon like Mosslax could simply be a Snorlax left in the same spot mid-sleep, uninterrupted for a super long time. Without people around, it's not out of the question. Maybe Smearguru is what happens when Smeargle is left alone to paint without interruption. Cinnabar may also explain the ghostly Pikachu we see: Peakychu. If there was a volcanic eruption then, well, maybe they got wiped out? A sad possibility.</p><p>There are alternate theories out there that are equally tantalising. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1p3sg81/pokopias_world_is_created_by_mewtwo/">Some believe this</a> could be some alternate spin on early Pokémon games where Mewtwo removed humans from the Kanto region. Not entirely off the cards, <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_multiverse">given alternate realities is something the Pokemon franchise has arguably embraced over the years</a>. In the Mystery Dungeon series there are no humans whatsoever, so anything is possible.</p>
<p>It's something fans of the franchise will surely be digging into come March 2026 when Pokémon Pokopia comes out on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Until then, theories and speculation run amok. Or perhaps, a-Muk.</p>

            <p>Charlie Cox won himself a Game Awards nomination for his work voicing Gustave in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. However, while the actor is understandably delighted to see his contribution recognised, he says as much of the credit needs to go to Gustave's motion performance actor, Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Cox recently reacted to his Best Performance nomination while speaking at a panel (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@posta.entretenimiento/video/7575433617237642517">recorded by POSTA Entretenimiento</a>). "Yes, I'm thrilled for this nomination," Cox said, before immediately praising Cazorla's part in bringing the Clair Obscur character to life.</p>

<p>"I've said this before, and I think it is important to say that there's an amazing French actor by the name of Maxence Cazorla who did almost all of the motion capture for that role," Cox shared with the audience.</p>
<p>"And so, any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Cox admitted that while Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud". Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent</a>.</p><p>Cox is not the only Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 cast member to be up for the Best Performance award at this year's Game Awards. Both Ben Starr and Jennifer English have also been nominated for their part in Sandfall's turn-based RPG. Meanwhile, the title is also up for Game of the Year, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>
<p>With 12 nominations to its name, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has made Game Awards history by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">becoming the most nominated game since the show's conception</a>.</p>

<p>For more on Clair Obscur, back in October the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-still-has-secrets-fans-havent-found-says-director">game's director Guillaume Broche revealed there are still secrets fans are yet to discover</a>, but he wouldn't give any hints. An <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">update for Clair Obscur is also on the cards</a>.</p>
