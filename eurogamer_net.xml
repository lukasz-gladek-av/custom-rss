            <p>
Capcom's clearly in a sharing mood. It's announced it's airing not one but two showcases next week - one being <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> themed and the other focusing on a number of other upcoming games, including Onimusha Way of the Sword.
</p>
<p>
And if that sounds like your kind of night, things get underway at 10pm GMT/2pm PT next Tuesday, 4th February. First up is Capcom's Spotlight showcase. This lasts around 20 minutes and covers three titles on the publisher's slate: Onimusha Way of the Sword, Capcom Fighting Collection 2, and Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection Arcade Classics.
</p>
<p>
Onimusha Way of the Sword was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">announced in December</a> and isn't expect to arrive until next year (some 20 years after the series' previous entry, Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, released), so it's perhaps a little surprising it has more to say so soon. As for Capcom Fighting Collection 2, it hasn't yet been given a release date beyond 2025, so we can probably expect one - and we'll likely also get a release date for Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics on Xbox, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-now-coming-to-xbox-following-technical-discussions-with-microsoft">bit of a faff around</a> last year.

<p>
And once Capcom's Spotlight is done, it'll immediately be time for a 20-minute update on Monster Hunter Wilds, which'll be just weeks away from its 28th February launch by then. We can probably expect a couple of monster reveals, a new biome, and me squealing giddily if they announce they're bringing back sea-squirting Cthulhu cuttlefish elder dragon Namielle.
</p><p>
So that's that; next Tuesday, 4th February at 10pm GMT/2pm PT for all your latest Capcom news. The publisher hasn't actually said <em>where</em> you'll be able to watch its showcase yet, but YouTube seems like a fair bet. And we'll have all the news from the event right here too, if you'd rather catch up at a less indecent time over a nice cup of beans.

            <p>
With Indiana Jones &amp; the Great Circle and Doom: The Dark Ages both waiting in the wings, Microsoft confirmed another of its first-party titles making the jump to PS5. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to Sony's console this "spring", and new content for all platforms is also on the way.
</p>
<p>
Forza Horizon 5 originally released back in 2021, taking the acclaimed open-world racing series to Mexico - or at least a fictional island amalgam, drawing extensive inspiration from the country's landmarks and features. Eurogamer called it "another gorgeous and enveloping pocket holiday" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-review-the-ultimate-big-tent-driving-game-cruises-to-mexico">our Recommended review</a>, highlighting its racing's "enviable tightrope-walk between structure and player freedom".
</p>
<p>
Which is to say it's another great former Xbox console exclusive for PlayStation owners to get acquainted with. Forza Horizon 5's PlayStation release will support cross-play with other platforms, and includes the same content as the PC and Xbox versions - with additional Car Packs and its two expansions, Hot Wheels and Rally Adventure, also available for purchase.

<p>
Additionally, Microsoft has <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-5-comes-to-ps5">announced a free new content update</a> for all platforms, albeit one without a current ETA. Horizon Realms, as it's known, promises to give players the "chance to explore a curated collection of some of the community's favourite previously released Evolving Worlds", alongside some other "surprises".
</p><p>
Forza Horizon 5's leap to PS5 comes after Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">confirmed its new multi-console release strategy</a> last year. 2024 laid the foundations with the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment on PlayStation, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 so far confirmed for 2025.
</p>
<p>
The start of this year also brought reports pointing to other Xbox games bound for PlayStation, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter">PS5 versions of Halo: The Masterchief Collection and Flight Simulator</a> claimed to be on the way. Previously, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">no "red lines"</a> when it came to the games Microsoft was willing to port to Sony's console.
