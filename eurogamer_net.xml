            <p>
Fornite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-season-looks-to-bring-back-sharks-and-midas">is doing it</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-season-23-takes-you-back-to-the-beginning-with-launch-royale">is doing it</a>, and now <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> is looking to tweak nostalgia nubbins by having a nostalgic throwback season of its own - specifically to celebrate the series' eighth anniversary this year - and it'll include the return of 6v6 games.
</p>
<p>
Blizzard has discussed resurrecting 6v6 matches for Overwatch 2 since July, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-exploring-reintroduction-of-6v6-in-a-series-of-upcoming-tests">admitted</a> the switch to 5v5 had come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom". Later, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-is-testing-the-return-of-6v6-next-season-and-blizzard-will-be-watching-the-results-closely">laid out more definite plans for 6v6's return</a>, confirming it would be holding "two different 6v6 tests" as part of Overwatch 2's Season 14 in December. Obviously, though, it's not yet December, and Blizzard has confirmed 6v6's imminent return as part of its <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/">newly announced limited-time Overwatch: Classic mode</a> is "separate from our broader 6v6 plans".
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>: Classic runs from tomorrow, 12th November, to 2nd December, and consists of a series of events featuring Overwatch's original heroes, abilities, and maps. While Blizzard is teasing the "fast paced and frantic gameplay of the 2017 Moth Meta [and] the triple-tank, triple-support style of 'Goats'" further down the line, things kick off with a mode inspired by Overwatch's version 1.0 release back in May 2016.

<p>
This is set to feature Overwatch's original line-up of 21 heroes, its first 12 maps, plus "many abilities that haven't been seen for years and all the chaotic gameplay from that era". Heroes will be grouped by their original classes but can be deployed as players see fit, and, for the funsies, there'll be a No Hero Limits rule for the "first few days" - although single hero limits will be implemented for the remainder of this first Overwatch: Classic event.
</p><p>
Additionally, expect all four original game modes to be playable once things get underway, split across their correlating maps: Assault (Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, Volskaya Industries), Escort (Dorado, Route 66, Watchpoint: Gibraltar), Hybrid (Hollywood, Kingâ€™s Row, Numbani), and Control (Ilios, Lijang Tower, Nepal). However, despite Blizzard's nod toward nostaligic versimilitude (all but default skins will be disabled, it notes maps in the event will appear as they do in other Overwatch 2 game modes.
</p>
<p>
And should you end up enjoying the nostalgic blast of Overwatch: Classic, Blizzard indicates the event won't just be a one-off. "While we're not planning for this to be a single event," it explains, "we will be measuring player response to inform our future plans."

Seven years after being announced, Project Borealis - a fan-developed game based on an unused story treatment for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2-episode-3">Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a> - has a playable ten-minute Prologue on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Project Borealis was formally unveiled by developer Icebreaker Industries back in 2017, as an attempt to make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-valve-writer-reveals-what-may-have-been-half-life-2-episode-3s-story">ex-Valve writer Marc Laidlaw's Epistle 3</a> a reality. Epistile 3, for the uninitiated, was a gender-swapped <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170825025137/http://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/">story synopsis</a> charting the adventures of Gertrude Fremont that many believed detailed the events originally planned Half-Life 2: Episode 3.
</p>
<p>
The Project Borealis team <a href="https://projectborealis.com/blog/">continued to share updates on its progress</a> until March 2020, but then all went silent, suggesting another fan game had met an untimely demise. However, the project's social media feed briefly sputtered to life in 2022 with a <a href="https://x.com/Proj_Borealis/status/1562877476455325697">short video of a crowbar laying in the snow</a>, and now two years later again, it's finally all systems go.

<p>
September brought word Project Borealis had been reborn in Unreal Engine 5 and that Icebreaker would soon be releasing a ten-minute Prologue, set before the events of the full game. And now that Prologue is now here, whisking players to a version of Ravenholm "transformed by time and the elements". As per its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215490/Project_Borealis_Prologue/">Steam page</a>, "The once-familiar town now lies buried under a blanket of snow, hiding the past and new present dangers beneath its pristine surface. As you navigate through this hauntingly beautiful landscape, you'll encounter some classic enemies reimagined and completely new secrets hidden within."
</p><p>
Icebreaker calls Prologue a "condensed, standalone game experience showcasing an early look and feel of the upcoming full Project Borealis game". It promises "completely updated visuals", a "faithful recreation of iconic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> movement and gameplay mechanics", and an original score. And as to why Icebreaker has decided to release this small slice of its bigger project, studio director Postulio recently <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/project-borealis-the-fan-made-effort-to-bring-half-life-2-episode-3-to-life-returns-after-years-of-silence-with-a-new-prologue-teaser/">told PC Gamer</a>, the decision to use Unreal Engine 5 instead of Valve's Source engine had necessitated recreating Half-Life 2's movement, physics, combat, and ambience, and that the team wanted to "make sure we were on the right track".
</p>
<p>
"This also gave us an excuse to refine our own internal processes as a community studio," Postulio added, "until we were left with a pipeline that could produce a 'finished' product." A little more detail on the project and where it's heading next can be found in Project Borealis' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nDJ9k_AWoQ">newly released Update 6 developer video</a>, and the Prologue itself is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215490/Project_Borealis_Prologue/">available to download for free on Steam</a>, but requires a copy of Half-Life 2 to play.
</p>
<p>
It is, then, a bit of an intriguing time for the legendary first-person shooter series. Not only is Icebreaker exploring one possible future for Gordon Freeman, it's heavily rumoured Valve may be returning to the series itself, with August bringing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">reports</a> a "fully-fledged non-VR Half-Life game" was in the works. Just don't expect it to have a '3' in the title.
