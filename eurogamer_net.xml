            <p>Rockstar has released another statement regarding its controversial dismissal of 34 employees across the UK and Canada, who also happened to be union members.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">Rockstar was accused of union busting</a> after it fired staff who were purportedly involved in union activities. Soon after, the company claimed the affected staff were let go due to gross misconduct, but this didn't appease UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB). The organisation swiftly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a> following the dismissals, again noting that all those affected were members of a union.</p>

<p>Rockstar has now doubled down on its defence, stating that unions and any union related activities were not a factor in its decision to dismiss staff. </p>
<p>Rather, Rockstar claims its former employees "distributed and discussed" confidential studio information regarding game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in a public forum, which breached "company policy and their legal obligations".</p>
<p>You can read Rockstar's full statement, as shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">IGN</a>, below:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations.</p>
<p>"Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p></blockquote>
<p>A previous report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">internal company messages were being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers</a>, rather than on a public forum.</p>
<p>In the last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-workers-europe-fight-back-against-exploitation-ai-layoffs-historic-milestone-union-efforts">protests have taken place both in the UK and abroad in support of the fired Rockstar staff</a>.</p>

<p>Rockstar's latest statement on the matter comes just one day after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK prime minister Keir Starmer called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning"</a>. The PM added that ministers would be looking further into these dismissals.</p>
<p>"Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union," Starmer said.</p>
<p>This was the second time in the last month Rockstar has come up in parliament. Back in mid- November, the issue was raised by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West.</p>
<p>"Video game giant Rockstar has sacked more than 30 workers across the UK, including my constituents working at their Edinburgh office," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Jardine said at the time</a>. "I urged Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again."</p>
