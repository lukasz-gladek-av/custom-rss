            <p>Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have now officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">companies have long been in discussion</a>, with actor and Warhammer superfan Henry Cavill set to star and executive produce thanks to his "lore expertise".</p>
<p>Now we have an official statement, with Games Workshop offering Amazon the exclusive rights to both films and television series, as well as merchandising rights.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224">legal notice</a> adds: "Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years."</p>
<p>However, a more <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/">casual statement to the community</a> notes that multiple "stories" are planned, with synopsis and ordering finalised. The first project is "about to go into development proper" - the script is next on the agenda.</p>
<p>"Of course, as with all carefully crafted things, this all takes time... and trust us when we say, everyone involved is las-focused on getting it all just right," reads the statement.</p>
<p>Cavill also shared the news on Instagram, together with his own "pilgrimage" back to the model shop where he bought his first Warhammer models.</p>
<p>"My incredible team and I, alongside the brilliant minds at Games Workshop, have been working away in concept rooms, breaking down approaches to the enormity and magnificence of the Warhammer world," he wrote in the post.</p>
<p>"Together, we've been sifting through the plethora of incredible characters and poring over old tomes and texts. Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though - more to come in time!"</p>

<p>This won't be the first time the companies work together, though, as there's a Warhammer 40K episode in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Amazon's forthcoming Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate the series, Warhammer 40K: Space Marine is one of a handful of games available for free through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-second-batch-of-december-titles-to-celebrate-secret-levels-arrival">Amazon Prime Gaming this December</a>.</p>
<p>Its sequel, released earlier this year, was hugely successful, becoming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">most successful Steam launch for the Warhammer 40K series</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-ceos-supposed-comments-raise-eyebrows-for-saying-games-should-be-about-glory-kills-not-imposing-morals">comments supposedly from the CEO of developer Saber Interactive</a> raised eyebrows for stating that games should be about "glory kills" instead of "imposing morals on gamers".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With just days to go until The Game Awards 2024, developers are taking the opportunity to whip fans into a fury of anticipation by revealing ahead of time that, yes, their games will appear - with showings for both Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 now officially confirmed.
</p>
<p>
Mafia: The Old Country's "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily" was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">announced earlier this year</a>, and developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> has now <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406">taken to social media</a> with a simple, "See you at The Game Awards!". This fourth series instalment is due to launch next year, so the timing makes sense for a more substantial look beyond its initial teaser trailer.
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has been yapping excitedly about it since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">unveiling back in August</a>. And he's now popped up to tease the shooter's impending Game Awards appearance. "It's happening, you guys!," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866164877665919396">wrote on social media</a>. "I will be at The Game Awards with a new trailer for Borderlands 4. I can't wait!"

<p>
"Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer!," Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733">continued</a>. "Also, in addition to a lot of in-game footage, I will share a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence depicting a moment that occurs about half way between the end of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> and the beginning of Borderlands 4. I AM EXCITE!"
</p><p>
Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocket Pair - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">embroiled in a patent infringement lawsuit</a> with Nintendo - has <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1866170665101152345">confirmed a Game Awards appearance</a>, promising fans, "You won’t want to miss it!". And it probably won't surprise anyone to hear <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> will also be at this year's show, his appearance alongside host and pal <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> now almost as inevitable as the setting sun. But what might he reveal? A Death Stranding 2 release date? More of his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">intriguing Xbox horror game OD</a>? Only time, and perhaps a 45-minute show segment, will tell.
</p>
<p>
The Game Awards 2024 airs this Friday, 13th December, at 1am in the UK - but especially enthusiastic sorts can tune in half an hour earlier if they fancy a bit of a pre-show. 2023's event went on well into the wee hours, so if you value your sleep like a sensible person, you can always catch up at a more reasonable time via Eurogamer's coverage.
