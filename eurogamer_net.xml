<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> 2 developer Colossal Order has shared an update on the city builder sequel's long-delayed console release - confirming it still has "more things we need to address" before it can launch, and that it won't be arriving before summer.
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2's Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions were originally due to launch alongside the PC release back in October 2023, but Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">announced a last-minute delay</a> into 2024. Its release was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-launch-delayed-again">delayed indefinitely</a> following Cities: Skylines 2's disastrous launch on PC - which continues to attract <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">complaints about poor performance and simulation issues</a>, despite multiple updates over the 18 months since then.
</p>
<p>
Colossal Order's most recent news on Cities: Skylines 2 console release came last November, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-studio-blames-ongoing-console-delay-on-hardware-limitations">admitted it was struggling to overcome "hardware limitations"</a> impacting performance on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. It noted it had managed to get the game "stable and playable" on consoles by "significantly lowering the graphics quality", but said it wasn't happy with the compromise and wanted to bring graphics quality up to an "acceptable level".

Skip ahead six months and Colossal Order has addressed Cities: Skylines 2's console release once more, and while progress is apparently being made, it sounds like there's still some way to go. "We continue to make steady progress on the console version," it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665875067?l=english">wrote in an update</a>, "and our core focus has been on further improving performance and stability. However, despite these advancements, we have more things we need to address before we reach the level of quality and the experience we want for you as our players."
</p>
<p>
"We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the console release," it continued, "but to set expectations clearly: we will not have a release before summer. We want to avoid any premature estimates and instead commit to providing you with reliable information when we're closer to a launch-ready state. Our goal remains unchanged: to bring Cities: Skylines 2 to console in the best possible shape."
</p>
<p>
News isn't entirely positive on the PC front, either. Colossal Order has also admitted it's struggling with Cities: Skylines 2's custom asset editor - a modding feature it called "crucial" last September, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">announced it was delaying its DLC plans</a> in order to get the asset editor finished and released. But in its latest update, the studio has said the feature is proving "more technically challenging than initially anticipated due to the hefty amounts of built-in assets affected by the changes, but it is moving forward."
</p>
<p>
"Rest assured that we're committed to solving these challenges," it wrote, "and our dedicated team is actively making progress to overcome them. We know how much custom assets mean to you and, honestly, to us, too, and we will continue to keep you informed of our progress as soon as we have something more concrete to share."
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate your patience and enthusiasm," the studio concluded, "and we will share more updates as we continue shaping the future of Cities: Skylines together." It added it'll be back next week when the original Cities: Skylines celebrates its 10th anniversary.

            <p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is reportedly aiming for a Christmas release window.</p>
<p>That's coming from Khary Payton, who plays Marvel hero Black Panther in the upcoming game. Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive">The Direct</a> about Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's release window, Payton said: "We're still working. We're planning on 2025... We're thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited."</p>
<p>So, perhaps this year it will be less about Santa Claus, and more about Marvel claws instead?</p>

<p>"I still can't believe that it's happening," the Black Panther actor continued. "But it's going to be so good. Amy Hennig, who did the Uncharted series, was the director and writer of the series. She is just so amazing and I'm like, 'man, we couldn't have asked for a better head of this project'.</p>
<p>"So I know it's taken a while, but trust me, it is going to be worth it."</p>

<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-teaser-trailer-for-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">first teaser for Hennig's then-unnamed Marvel game back in 2022</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-uncharted-creative-director-amy-hennig-is-working-on-a-new-marvel-game">its announcement back in 2021</a>. Since then, we have been offered a few more smallish snippets, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-details-and-first-look-at-wakanda-revealed-by-writer-amy-hennig">peek at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's take on Wakanda</a>, as well as a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">the game's use of Epic's MetaHuman Creator</a> which gives each character remarkable detail.</p>
<p>"We really wanted the visual fidelity to be high so that you could kind of forget that you're looking at a game, that it should feel and look and sound and smell like you're watching a great Marvel movie or TV show, but you're driving the action," Hennig previously said about the game.</p>
<p>"As a new studio trying to do some groundbreaking stuff with cinematically presented games, the way we invite the most people in is by bringing them something they already know and love, but in a new form."</p>
<p>Now, I just wonder when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">Marvel's Wolverine will get a release date</a>…?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
