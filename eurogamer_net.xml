            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has sold more than one million copies on PC within three days of its arrival to the platform, <a href="https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/read/211821">according to Ruliweb</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> would also pass the three million sales milestone across all platforms following its PC release. As of writing, the game reached a peak concurrent player count on Steam of 192,078, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">a substantial increase over the weekend from its initial peak of just under 100,000 in its first day</a>.</p>
<p>This performance marks an all-time record for South Korean single players games, a style of game that ShiftUp has been championing since releasing Stellar Blade in April of last year.</p>

<p>According to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1934432993210237238">Daniel Ahmad at Niko Partners</a>, a majority of these PC sales stem from China, a playerbase who'd benefit from a PC-only Chinese dub and appropriate regional pricing. This market has proven an exceptionally eager one, both with Stellar Blade and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">Black Myth Wukong's own record breaking Steam release last year</a>.</p>
<p>This stunning PC release comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony execs spoke about bringing its games to different platforms in an annual fireside chat</a>. Sony Interactive Entertainment president Hideaki Nishino and Studio Business Group head Hermen Hulst when asked about how to "protect the value" of the PlayStation console noted that Sony's consoles would remain "the best place to play and publish", but that "the team is always looking for "new and innovative ways to broaden [its] reach".</p>
<p>ShiftUp announced back in May in an investor presentation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">a sequel to Stellar Blade was being developed</a>. The only tidbit of information aside from the confirmation present there was that the game was scheduled to be released before 2027.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Industrious Switch fans have started compiling a fan-made list that tracks which Switch 1 games have seen an improvement - or a decline - in performance when running on their new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Nintendo Switch 2</a> consoles.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l49teu/post_your_tested_games_compatibility_or/">over 350 games have been submitted and over 150 of them comprehensively categorised</a>, recording what performance changes players have identified, regardless of whether or not there has been a formal patch or update deployed by the publisher.</p>

<p>For instance, players who have played ARMS on their new Switch systems - for which Nintendo has deployed a free update for all players - believe they see an increased consistency in framerate, both docked and undocked, as well as dynamic resolution scaling in terms of resolution. However, they do not notice much difference in terms of loading times.</p>
<p>By comparison, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iii">Diablo 3</a>: Eternal Edition also shows increased consistency in framerates and improved loading times, but that hasn't been formally patched at all.</p>

</span></p><p>As the list owner admits, perceptions of what is or isn't an improvement can often be subjective, of course, and a handful of the hundreds of commenters have chimed in to say their experiences are different from those listed in the spreadsheet. However, the thread "isn't meant to decide whether a game is worth buying (now) for you", but is "purely informational".</p>

            <p>Both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> have set new concurrent user records on Steam over the weekend.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, which released 10th June for all, and Stellar Blade, which had its long-anticipated PC debut on 11th, both launched with comparatively few problems, and their success has been underlined by the number of players getting stuck in over the weekend. At the time of writing, Dune: Awakening has secured an all-time concurrent peak of 175.5K players, and Stellar Blade 192K.</p>

<p>That puts both games in the top ten of most-played games of the weekend, with just <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and Apex Legends attracting more players.</p>
<p>The PlayStation-published Stellar Blade made its way onto PC earlier this week and within hours of release, it was already the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">most successful PlayStation-published single-player game on the platform by concurrent count</a>.</p>

<p>In comparison, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690. Only Helldivers 2 has attracted more players at once, but that's, of course, a multiplayer title.</p>
<p>Dune Awakening soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release, quickly surpassing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five-day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within hours of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players and currently has a concurrent record of 175K.</p>
<p>Not sure if either game is for you? In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review</a>, we noted it "has a fair bit of weirdness", but " its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced". Meanwhile, Connor's having a great time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Dune: Awakening thus far, writing in our review-in-progress</a>: "It's too early for a full review, but as of right now, I see little reason not to recommend giving Dune Awakening's unique offering a chance."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
