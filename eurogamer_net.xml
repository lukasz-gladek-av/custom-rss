        <p>And yes, Baymax gets a 'Balalalala' emote.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has just made its Chapter 6 launch trailer available to view in-game, revealing fresh details about the evergreen battle royale's latest revamp.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-season-1-estimated-release-date">Chapter 6 isn't due to launch until this weekend</a>, following Saturday night's big Remix live event finale starring Eminem and Snoop Dogg, so the upload of a trailer in-game now looks like an unfortunate slip-up.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the internet has now pounced on the trailer, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-leaks-point-to-godzilla-crossover">confirms the towering Godzilla as an enormous boss</a> that roams around Fortnite's fresh new Japan-inspired map. 
</p>
<p>
There are also smaller bosses - a huge samurai, a floating demon mask - as well as a giant turtle. Hopefully we don't have to shoot the giant turtle.

<p>
On an even smaller scale, Fortnite looks to be introducing some kind of cute jelly thing as a pet? Previous artwork showed what looked like pet-like creatures, including a cute-looking dragon, hanging out on characters' shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Oh and finally: Big Hero 6's Baymax - part of the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass - will get to do his 'Balalala' thing as an emote.
</p>
<p>
Despite Chapter 6 being a big revamp for Fortnite, there's actually a fair amount here that feels familiar. Samurai swords are back but look similar to their usage in the game previously. Some of the architecture here looks similar to the Japanese-themed biome back on the Chapter 4 map. And the towering Godzilla boss, let's be honest, feels a little similar to the towering Doctor Doom live event. Although this time with fire breath.
</p>
<p>
We're expecting much more to be officially revealed about Fortnite's future this weekend. 
</p>
<p>
Next week, Chapter 6's launch will be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-reviving-original-map-as-permanent-addition-featuring-multiple-classic-seasons">the arrival of the game's Fortnite OG mode</a> - that brings back Fortnite's beloved original map as a permanent addition <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-permanent-og-mode-will-have-its-own-battle-pass">with its own battle pass</a>.

Popular mobile card game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has warned players it will take action against anyone with a rude, inoffensive or inapproproate username.
</p>
<p>
After all, Pikachu and friends appeal to players of all ages, and the app is definitely not a place for username gags on Pokéballs.

"We will continue to strive to provide an environment where everyone can safely and comfortably enjoy their experience. We hope you continue to enjoy Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket."
</p>
<p>
In other words, keep your swears, insults and lewd references to Diglett to yourself.
</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has found a big audience, and raked in well over $120m since its launch last month. Today brings a selection of fresh cards via a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-cards-joining-pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-ahead-of-december-events">new Venusaur PVE event that's live from now until 13th December</a>. </p>

            <p>The next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> developer Round8 Studios will be a sci-fi survival horror, in a marked change from the souslike genre.</p>
<p>As reported by Korean news site <a href="https://www.ebn.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1644423">EBN</a>, the game will utilise Unreal Engine 5 and is targeting a release on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The same report also confirms DLC for Lies of P is slated for the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>A statement from publisher Neowiz said it's too early to disclose progress of the project and that it is one of multiple PC and console games in development - presumably alongside the confirmed sequel to Lies of P.</p>
<p>Still, a swing to survival horror for its next standalone project is quite a change and proves the wide-reaching ambitions of the developer to become a leader in the South Korean games industry.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-sequel-confirmed-as-game-director-teases-dlc">sequel to Lies of P was confirmed last year</a> by director Ji Won Choi. "Our highest priority is developing the DLC and working on our sequel," he said at the time.</p>
<p>While it's unknown where the story will lead in a sequel, hints at the end of Lies of P have certainly had fans speculating on what fairytale could be next for the soulslike treatment, following the game's Pinocchio inspiration.</p>
<p>As for the Lies of P DLC, its existence was revealed shortly after the game's release, though so far only concept art of a ship has been shown. "I can promise you one thing," said Choi with the reveal. "What I just showed you scratches merely the tip of an iceberg."</p>
<p>Following its launch last October, Lies of P sold a million copies in less than a month and, by March of this year had surpassed seven million players (including through subscription services).</p>
<p>It's proven a big success for the developer and is now frequently considered one of the best soulslike games not created by From Software.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-developer-details-playstation-5-pro-enhancements">Lies of P is also receiving a PS5 Pro patch</a> to boost performance.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
