We already knew <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> was set to receive a couple of "surprises" before the end of the year, thanks to some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-surprises-coming-later-this-year-says-director">previous teasing from its director</a> - and it now appears at least some of those are here, courtesy of a big new update for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-to-attract-record-breaking-numbers-of-players">record-breaking</a> action-RPG.
</p>
<p>
Black Myth's new stuff begins with its Keeper's Shrine challenges, which unlock after completing the game once. These come in two flavours - Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends - both bringing back previously defeated foes for a rematch.
</p>
<p>
Return of Rivals is all about one-on-one fights, with players able to challenge former opponents to a duel across one of three levels of selectable difficulty. Gauntlet of Legends, meanwhile, features a number of returning enemies - some with new moves - battled in succession, with difficulty based around customisable curses. Successfully beating a gauntlet rewards rare treasures, but developer Game Science warns challenges won't be available if their corresponding opponents haven't yet been defeated in the main game.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's update (officially known as 1.0.12.16581, number fans), players can now lay their hands on Journeyer's Charts - featuring landscapes organised "for guidance and marking". Which is to say, maps. Journeyer's Charts are initially unlocked after meeting the Keeper in Black Wind Mountain, and new ones can be purchased for each visited territory at shrines. As Game Science so wonderfully puts it, "Let the chart chart the journeyer's journey."
</p>
<p>
And for players looking to shake up their wardrobe, Black Myth's new update brings four special armour pieces added to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year. These can be claimed under "Trailblazer's Gift" at any Keeper's Shrine. 
</p>
<p>
Beyond the big headline additions, Black Myth's 1.0.12.16581 brings a whole host of bug fixes and improvements covering everything from performance and localisation issues to boss tweaks. Oh, and the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection has been added to the music library. All this is available on the Epic Games Store right now, with the update slowly rolling out across other platforms - so you might need to wait a little before you can probe its wares. Full patch notes are <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">available on Game Science's website</a>.
</p><p>
Black Myth: Wukong's latest update arrives just ahead of this year's The Game Awards, where it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">nominated across several different categories</a>: best action game, best art direction, best game direction, Player's Voice award, and game of the year. And if you're curious to know how it fares, the show kicks off this Friday, 13th December, at 1am in the UK. Or just go to bed and read about it all on Eurogamer when you're sufficiently ready to start the day.
</p>
<p>
Will The Game Awards also bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">long-awaited Xbox release date</a> for Black Myth: Wukong (or maybe even a surprise drop in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">similar fashion to Baldur's Gate 3</a>)? All will be revealed soon.

            <p>
Just a day after piquing fan curiosity with the surprise announcement a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update was on the way, developer CD Projekt has revealed exactly what it contains - including expanded customisation options and new photo mode features - <em>and</em> released it into the wild.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's new 2.2 update mightn't be as feature-packed as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-getting-fully-functioning-metro-system-in-next-weeks-21-update">last December's surprisingly substantial 2.1 update</a>, but it still introduces a range of nifty new features, fixes, and quality of life improvements - certainly more than you might ordinarily expect from a game whose development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended</a> seven months ago.
</p>
<p>
On the customisation front, players can now change paint jobs across a whole range of vehicles using the CrystalCoat technology previously only available on Rayfield cars - with Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra, and Villefort all now compatible. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2077 now has a vehicle colour cloning feature (officially known as TWINTONE), so players can save colour changes made to one vehicle and apply them elsewhere.

<p>
In other car-related news, 10 more "most requested" vehicles have been added for purchase via Autofixer (as detailed in the patch notes below), and players might now see Johnny Silverhand appear in the passenger seat - to comment on or react to their actions - once Act 1 is done.
</p><p>
Customisation options have also been expanded on the player side too, with update 2.2 introducing new eye and nail colours, new face and body tattoos, new eyebrows shapes, face scars, cosmetic face cyberware options, and makeup types for cheek, eyes, and lips. Additionally, the Character Creator randomiser now includes a Plain-to-Punk slider, which does pretty much exactly what it sounds like.
</p>
<p>
And once you've pimped your car or your V out to meet your exacting tastes, you can record them for posterity using the improved Photo Mode features. These include the ability to spawn up to three NPCs for a shot, the ability to spawn and adjust light sources, increased camera range, a new Effect Intensity slider, a change to make the Drone Camera free-roaming, plus a variety of feature toggles. It's also now possible to display your favourite photos in V's apartments by interacting with the picture frames.
</p>
<p>
And that's still not quite everything for Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update. It also introduces a whole range of fixes and quality of life improvements, as well as - most intriguingly - "more secrets to discover in Night City." Sounds like it might be time to hit the streets and hunt down some Witcher 4 teases now the game is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">officially in "full-scale production"</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today's Cyberpunk 2077 update - which was developed in collaboration with Virtuos and is available now for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 - comes ahead of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">release on Apple computers next year</a>. You can learn more about its new features via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIlOthAEggI">developer video</a> above, or by perusing the patch notes below.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle's color scheme for a small fee. You'll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you'll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</li>
<li>All vehicles compatible with CrystalCoat™ and TWINTONE™ are marked with a spray can icon on Autofixer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ten most requested vehicles from the streets of Night City are now available for purchase on Autofixer:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mizutani Shion MZ1</li>
<li>Mizutani Shion Targa MZT</li>
<li>Thorton Galena GA32t</li>
<li>Thorton Colby CST40</li>
<li>Archer Quartz EC-L r275</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 640 TS</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 680 TS</li>
<li>Mahir Supron FS3-T</li>
<li>Villefort Deleon V410-S Coupe (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
<li>Mizutani Hozuki MH2 (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Following Act 1, Johnny will now sometimes appear in the passenger seat while V is driving to comment on and react to what's happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We've overhauled Photo Mode and added multiple community-requested features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.</li>
<li>Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) - determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) - locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) - slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SmartFrames™ by Kiroshi allows you to display your Photo Mode shots in-game by interacting with the picture frames in V's apartments. Browse your photo collection in the new Gallery menu tab located alongside Journal, Shards and Tarot. The Gallery pulls .png images from the screenshots folder on your PC or from your console gallery. For more details on SmartFrames™ and the Gallery, see this Support article.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Added more character customization options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>32 eye colors</li>
<li>18 lip makeup types</li>
<li>17 nail colors</li>
<li>10 cheek makeup types</li>

<li>4 face scars</li>
<li>5 eyebrow shapes</li>
<li>4 face tattoos</li>
<li>2 body tattoos</li>
<li>8 cosmetic face cyberware options</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded the Character Creator randomizer to feature a new Plain-to-Punk slider. Whether you're aiming for an understated, casual look or a bold, edgy style for your V, you can now use the slider to strike the perfect balance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Added more secrets to discover in Night City.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quests &amp; Open World</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rephrased objectives for quests that tell you to wait a specific amount of time to progress. The game is designed in a way that doesn't always allow players to simply skip in-game time to advance the objective, instead requiring them continue playing to trigger the next event.</li>
<li>Cyberpsycho Sighting: Where the Bodies Hit the Floor - Fixed an issue where no shard could be found on the cyberpsycho's body, blocking progress.</li>
<li>Dream On - The Trauma Team AV on the roof will now be properly hidden in stealth mode.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Phantom Liberty-Specific</h2>

<li>Balls to the Wall - Fixed an issue where it was impossible to exit the elevator and talk to Yuri because of an invisible wall.</li>
<li>Firestarter - Fixed an issue where fast travel could be blocked if the player saved the game soon after exiting Reed's car.</li>
<li>Gig: Waiting for Dodger - After being freed, Bill and Charles will now be more mindful of their driving and avoid running over Dodger’s goons, preventing any unnecessary combat.</li>
<li>Hi Ho Silver Lining - The VIP section in the Heavy Hearts club will now be accessible to players who couldn't meet with Mr. Hands due to a keycard being required to use the elevator.</li>
<li>I've Seen That Face Before - The garage door preventing players from reaching the meeting point will now be open.</li>
<li>Run This Town - The elevator in the Heavy Hearts club is now back in service, so V can finally meet with Mr. Hands.</li>
<li>Somewhat Damaged - Fixed an issue where the prompt to unplug the cables from the Neural Network system was missing.</li>
<li>The Killing Moon - Fixed the issue of a wall blocking the path when carrying Songbird to the shuttle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed one of the katana finisher animations so that it properly decapitates enemies.</li>
<li>Iconic Synapse Burnout and Iconic System Collapse quickhacks will now be properly affected by the RAM cost reduction buff.</li>
<li>The icons for Tier 5+ and 5++ Behavioral Imprint-synced Faceplate will now be visible on the HUD while driving.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing the Synaptic Accelerator to stay active indefinitely if the player is detected while not in combat.</li>
<li>The car horn will no longer honk when the player reloads a weapon during vehicle combat while playing with a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the NCPD could stop functioning properly after V engages in a shootout in Pacifica between the Voodoo Boys and Trauma Team.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where TV program sound was muted or too quiet.</li>

<li>Fixed the issue of voiceover cutoff during the Ebunike station announcement on NCART.</li>
<li>Fixed ray-traced shadows for V in Photo Mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PC-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will now be able to properly rebind W and S to different actions other than their default settings in the Vehicle category.</li>
<li>Optimized threading system to improve performance by up to 33% on Intel Arrow Lake based CPUs.</li>
<li>Added more Razer Chroma effects for some sections in Phantom Liberty and romance scenes.</li>
</ul>
