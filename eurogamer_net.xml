            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has admitted porting PlayStation-exclusive games to PC is "almost like printing money", and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/ex-sony-exec-says-pc-ports-of-old-ps5-games-are-almost-like-printing-money">Push Square</a>), Yoshida revealed he wanted to bring first-party games to PC sooner, but this wasn't Sony's business model at the time.</p>
<p>"Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles – especially in regions where consoles are not as popular," he said. "The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation."</p>

<p>Beyond those benefits, it also allows Sony to reinvest money into other projects.</p>
<p>"It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title," he said. "So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased."</p>
<p>What's more, releasing games on PC allows PlayStation to spread to new regions where that platform is more popular - China, in particular.</p>
<p>"China is a huge PC game market," said Yoshida. "And China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience."</p>
<p>Beginning with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> in 2020, Sony has gradually been porting its PlayStation exclusive games to PC.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> released on PC, while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is set to follow in April.</p>
<p>And while these releases have seen diminishing returns in terms of player numbers on Steam at least, the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was a huge success for Sony - it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest selling game</a> owing to huge success on PC. That success was hampered, though, by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">Sony's insistence on requiring PSN to play</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">Yoshida also discussed Sony's live service plans</a>, revealing he played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s ill-fated The Last of Us Online, which he described as "great".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Cosy Hobbit life sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game has been delayed once again, this time until 29th July.
</p>
<p>
It's the second hold-up for the game after an earlier delay announced last year. Back in September 2024, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed">Wētā Workshop said it expected the game to arrive in early 2025</a>. Now, there's another five months to wait.
</p>
<p>
A statement <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165">published today on the game's social media account</a> does not go into detail on why the game has been postponed once again, other than to say that Wētā Workshop wanted to ensure "every Hobbit, on every platform, can enjoy the same cosy experience".

<p>
It seems possible that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s recent sale of Private Division, Tales of the Shire's original publisher, may have had some impact on the game's progress. But some Lord of the Rings fans have also raised questions about the game's quality level, based on previous trailers.
</p>
<p>
"We want this game to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth," today's statement notes, "and we are making sure that no matter where you play, you'll feel right at home in The Shire. From foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes, every detail will be just right."
</p>
<p>
It's been reported that Tales of the Shire, alongside other Private Division games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">will now be aided by staff members</a> who previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">quit indie publisher Annapurna Interactive in a mass exodus</a> last year.

            <p>Split Fiction will include crossplay for the first time across all platforms - PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (Windows, Steam, Epic) - via the Friend's Pass function.</p>
<p>This means Hazelight's forthcoming co-op adventure will be playable by two players online across any platform with only one copy of the game required.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> similarly included the Friend's Pass function, but players had to be on the same platform. Now, that's changed for Split Fiction.</p>

<p>As long as you own a copy of the game, you can invite any friend on any platform to join you online for free. The catch is that you both need EA accounts linked to your platform account in order to be friends.</p>
<p>Friend's Pass can also be used with "as many different friends as you want, one friend at a time", reads the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-playstation">FAQ</a>, essentially meaning it's not a one time use code so as long as you own a copy of the game, you can share the experience with an infinite number of friends. The host player will also determine the starting point, meaning they can invite a different friend to continue playing (or restart the game).</p>
<p>A demo version of the game will also be playable for free across platforms using Friend's Pass, or in local couch co-op. It includes the first few levels of the game.</p>
<p>And, of course, the game will be fully playable offline in local co-op without using Friend's Pass.</p>
<p>Further, all progress made while playing using Friend's Pass will be carried over into the full game, whether you're the player joining someone else's game via the function, or you're playing the demo version.</p>
<p>However, Trophies and Achievements will only be unlocked by players that have purchased the full game - that would be the host only, and not the player joining for free.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set for release on 6th March - it's a co-op only game about two authors whose sci-fi and fantasy worlds collide. It follows It Takes Two, which won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 among other accolades.</p>
<p>"What developer Hazelight has essentially done here is build on everything it's done so well with its previous co-op games A Way Out and It Takes Two, and dialled up its ambitions even further," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-riot-and-its-use-of-a-meat-grinder-might-one-up-that-infamous-elephant-scene-from-it-takes-two">hands-on preview of Split Fiction</a> from Victoria.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"It's possible you may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular," they wrote on social media. "If I am, it was not because I stepped away from the character willingly. It's because the employer refused to flip to an interim."</p>

</span></p><p>Supergiant has responded with a lengthy statement, confirming it has not re-cast any characters, but noted its games have not been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons".</p>
<p>"Voice talent has been integral to each of our games," the statement begins. "Recently, questions arose here about how we work with our voice talent, which we want to address."</p>
<p>Supergiant boasts it offers "the strongest AI protections in the industry to our talent, as we think their work is irreplaceable".</p>
<p>It continues: "Our games are intentionally made by human beings; no generative AI is being used in the creation of the voiceover, artwork, or any other content that goes into them.</p>
<p>"We have not re-cast any of our characters in Hades 2, and wish to keep working with each and every member of our wonderful cast.</p>
<p>"We have respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work during the ongoing SAG-AFTRA video game strike. While none of our games have ever been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts for a variety of reasons, we wish SAG-AFTRA the best in their negotiations to compel larger signatory studios to provide the kinds of protections we think actors deserve."</p>
<p>It's unclear what the reasons are for not using SAG-AFTRA contracts, though many of the voice actors from Hades 2 are either in-house staff or British (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>'s Ben Starr, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s Colin Ryan, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler) and therefore not part of the US union. Or perhaps the studio believes its own protections are enough.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Supergiant for more information.</p>

</span></p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likhkirnp22q">follow up thread</a>, Miller emphasised their reliance on SAG-AFTRA for protection, noting this is the seventh month of the strike. "SAG-AFTRA contracts are protected by their legal staff - I can't afford a lawyer without the union," they wrote.</p>
<p>"Clients keep asking me, 'If we include a no-AI rider, will you work non-union or on a 2020 agreement?' Will you be willing to cover the costs of my legal fees if you violate my agreement? Why are you refusing to sign a contract I can enforce?"</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July last year</a>, with AI usage the primary concern of the union.</p>
<p>"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p>
<p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers that have signed the existing Interactive Media Agreement, responded: "We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry."</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke with celebrated voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Bayonetta 3) about the strike and why it's taking so long to reach a resolution.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she says. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developer Innersloth has announced Among Us 3D for PC, with a Steam Next Fest demo set to debut next week.
</p>
<p>
This 3D, first-person version of the game isn't brand new, however. Virtual reality headset fans will notice this is very much Among Us VR without the VR.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Among Us 3D features crossplay with Among Us VR (though not, unsurprisingly, with the original 2D game). Essentially, this new version of the VR version allows a much wider 'flatscreen' PC audience to join in.

<p>
Otherwise, this is the Among Us you know and have probably played before, now with an additional dimension. The game caters for between four and 10 players, and of course lets you customise your bean with hats.
</p>
<p>A new Stardust currency will be introduced to let you acquire more cosmetic items for your bean. Post-launch, the game will add new modes, tasks, collaborations, and additional limited time events. As well as more hats.
</p>
<p>
There's no full release date for Among Us 3D yet, and no word of it appearing outside of PC at all. Still, if you're interested, and if you're a Steam user, you should probably keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">Steam page</a> for when its demo arrives as part of Steam Next Fest in just a couple of days.
