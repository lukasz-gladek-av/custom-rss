A teaser trailer for the film Return to Silent Hill has been revealed, giving us a first proper look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> adaptation, its version of Pyramid Head, and a release window.
</p>
<p>
Christophe Gans is in the director's chair, following his work on the 2006 Silent Hill film starring Sean Bean. Jeremy Irvine (Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Treadstone, War Horse) stars as James.
</p>
<p>
Gans previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">film would be a faithful adaptation of Konami's beloved Silent Hill 2</a>. "I am delighted to partner with Cineverse, which has shown a genuine understanding of fanship," said Gans back in May. "Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, Konami's iconic Silent Hill 2. I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."

<p>
The trailer, above, is only 40 seconds long, but it does show a suitably foggy environment, that iconic shot of James looking in the mirror, and of course some scary nurses. Best of all, it ends with a first look at Pyramid Head.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill is set for release in January 2026.
</p>
<p>
It's all part of a resurgence of Konami's horror franchise, following the success last year of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> will be released next month - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-producer-insists-it-is-an-action-horror-game-and-any-comparisons-to-a-soulslike-are-disingenuous">no, it's not a Soulslike</a>.

            <p>
If you were hoping for more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> - and wondered why it has such a long name - director Guillaume Broche has said the game is "not the end" of the series.
</p>
<p>
Broche spoke with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4&amp;t=321s">MrMattyPlays</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/">TheGamer</a>) about what's next for studio Sandfall Interactive.
</p>
<p>
"Clair Obscur is the franchise name," said Broche. "Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."

<p>
A new game will be on the way, then, though likely not a direct sequel. Broche stated later in the interview he prefers to forget previous work when he "writes sequels".
</p>
<p>
And, as has been noted in previous interviews, Broche was heavily influenced by the Final Fantasy series. So if Clair Obscur is the franchise name, it's likely whatever is next will be completely different to Expedition 33 - just like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s series. 
</p>
<p>
But will it still feature the fantastic turn-based action combat? It's certainly proven popular, so let's hope so!
</p>
<p>
Previously the studio stated it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-exploring-new-content-accessibility-features-and-all-sorts-of-bits-and-bobs-for-future-game-updates">exploring new content and accessibility features</a>, as well as "all sorts of bits and bobs". Further, Broche noted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-switch-2-could-be-interesting-says-director">Switch 2 version of the game</a> "could be interesting". So there's likely more to come from Sandfall besides a possible sequel.
