            <p>Sony has revealed the next round of additions to its PS Plus Catalogue for subscribers, which will be added on 20th May.</p>
<p>The following games will be available later this month for Premium and Extra subscribers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sand Land | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Soul Hackers 2 | PS5</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted - Full Time Edition | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Battlefield 5 | PS4</li>
<li>STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Humankind | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life | PS5</li>
<li>Gloomhaven Mercenaries Edition | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Premium subscribers will get access to PS2 classic Battle Engine Aquila on PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Action-RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sand-land">Sand Land</a> was released last year and features designs from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama - this was his last game before he passed away. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-gives-posthumous-praise-for-sand-land-game">posthumously praised the game</a> in a statement shared after his death: "I haven't watched through all of the gameplay yet," he said. "However, it greatly expands the worldview of the original manga with many new exciting elements. It is high-quality as a stand alone game and I can tell it is a highly satisfying action-RPG game!"</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-getting-an-enhanced-edition-upgrade-on-ps5-series-xs-and-pc">GSC Game World announced a free Enhanced Edition upgrade for Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy</a>, which combines the first three games in the series. It includes a visual upgrade and other improvements, but it's unclear if PS Plus subscribers will have access following its inclusion here in the subscription.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Soul Hackers 2 is a 2022 RPG from Persona-maker Atlus that, confusingly, is the fifth installment in the Devil Summoner series, which is part of the Megami Tensei franchise. If you like anime RPGs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/granblue-fantasy-versus">Granblue Fantasy Versus</a>: Rising is probably also worth a shot, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life">Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</a> is a more relaxed farming experience.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Are you excited to play any of these? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These Catalogue games are in addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-may">free monthly games also available this month</a> to those on the Essential tier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ark: Survival Ascended | PS5</li>
<li>Balatro | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>New additions mean some games will likely be leaving the service this month too, we'll update once we know more.</p>
<p>More details on this month's games can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-sand-land-soul-hackers-2-five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-battlefield-v-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' first "special collaboration" will be a crossover with survival horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, set to arrive on 27th May. 
</p>
<p>
"Step into The Fog," reads a post on social media by the Assassin's Creed account this afternoon. "A new Dead by Daylight quest begins. Slip through the shadows. Survive the ordeal."
</p>
<p>
An accompanying teaser video shows Naoe and Yasuke resting by a campfire, while a figure with glowing red flames around their arms and feet faces them. Exact details on what the crossover will contain are presumably set to arrive at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft revealed that Shadows would get multiple "special collaboration" updates as part of its free post-launch content roadmap</a>. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Today's announcement appears to put a date on Shadows' next big update, in which this first collaboration is included. Other additions expected on 27th May include improvements to the game's photo mode and additional flashy parkour moves.
</p>
<p>
This update will then be followed by at least one further update in June, where a second free story mission will be added. This will feature a new ally that can come hang out at your homebase. June's update is also set to feature new difficulty options, and the ability to wear headgear in cutscenes (a highly requested feature by fans).
</p>
<p>
Beyond June, Ubisoft has said it has plans to add a New Game Plus Mode, additional story missions, and more "special collaborations". 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Assassin's Creed has provided optional post-launch content crossing over with other games, of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-assassins-creed-origins-will-get-a-chocobo-horse">Final Fantasy's Chocobo turned up in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, while multiple Assassin's Creed heroes have themselves crossed over into the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, "even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."

            <p>
A little over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-makes-its-way-to-xbox">its arrival on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>, the original Stalker trilogy is getting an Enhanced Edition, bringing upgraded visuals and more to the post-apocalyptic shooter series on current-gen consoles and PC.
</p>
<p>
Officially titled Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>'s newly announced current-gen update promises a range of additions and optimisations to all three bundled titles - 2007's Shadow of Chornobyl, 2008's Clear Sky, and 2009's Call of Prypiat - alongside a number of platform-specific features.
</p>
<p>
All platforms get visual upgrades, for instance, including enhanced lighting (GSC specifically mentions godrays, screen space reflections, and global illumination), advanced shaders for water and wetness effects, upgraded skyboxes, upscaled textures, and improved 3D models for NPCs, weapons, and environments. That's in addition to improved weapon field-of-vision, and 4K pre-rendered cinematics for a bit of extra storytelling pizzazz.

<p>
Consoles also get keyboard and mouse support, Mod.io integration, and a variety of graphics modes, with Xbox Series X, PS5, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> all offering Quality, Balanced, Performance, and Ultra Performance options. Quality mode renders at a native 4K/30fps, Balanced at an upscaled 4K/40fps, Performance at an upscaled 4K/60fps, and Ultra Performance at an upscaled 2K/120fps. As for Xbox Series S, graphics modes are listed as Quality (native 2K/30fps), Balanced (upscaled 2K/40fps), and Performance (1080p/60fps).
</p>
<p>
Over on PC, GSC Game World is introducing cloud saves, full controller compatibility support, Steam Workshop integration, and Steam Deck optimisation. Full system requirements are <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq">detailed over on the Enhanced Edition FAQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
And here comes the best news; owners of Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy or any of the individual current-gen releases of Shadow of Chornobyl, Clear Sky, and Call of Prypiat on Xbox Series X/S or PS5 will receive the Enhanced Edition versions for free starting 20th May. Similarly, anyone who's purchased the original games on PC will get free Enhanced Editions upgrades, and will continue to have access to the originals too.
</p>
<p>
As for series newcomers, Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy Enhanced Edition will cost $39.99 USD (or your local equivalent) when comes to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 20th May, with individual titles priced at $19.99 each.
