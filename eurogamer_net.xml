            <p>
Obsidian's fun and colourful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> doesn't sound like a one-and-done effort by the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Avowed arrived last week to a positive reception, and now a Bloomberg interview with the game's director Carrie Patel includes the suggestion we'll see more of the franchise from Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
Asked whether Patel's next project would be something new, the director said that work on more Avowed content - be that for this game, or sequels - was more likely.

</figure>
<p>
"Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it," Patel said.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian has invested more than six years in Avowed, and longer in its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe. Development on the project began in 2018, two years prior to the company's acquisition by Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Initially planned as a multiplayer version of Skyrim with a massive open world, Obsidian ditched the game's online component relatively early on. After Patel came on board to lead the game in 2021, the decision was then made to also switch the game's map from open world to multiple large open zones. The game also ended up leaning further into the Pillars of Eternity universe's lore than initially planned, too.
</p>
<p>
"With any game you think, 'OK, we can't climb every mountain  - which ones are really worth the effort for us?'" Patel said. "We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with open zones, and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player's going from one environment to the next."
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>. "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-studio-plans-to-make-its-100th-birthday-by-staying-lean-and-invested">Obsidian said it was planning to still be open for its 100th anniversary</a> - in another 78 years - by staying "lean and invested".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A former Nintendo employee has predicted the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> will launch in June, with a release date announcement due in the forthcoming Direct in April.</p>
<p>The employee, known only as Sean, was sales lead in Nintendo's sales and retail department and appeared on the Kit and Krista podcast - also former Nintendo employees.</p>
<p>"They're going to want the system to be out before the end of the summer," said Sean, discussing a potential release date for Switch 2. "I would say at the start of the summer - end of school year, so you've got the kids in school talking about what they're excited for.</p>

<p>"I think we'll see a June launch, I'm thinking probably mid-June, maybe a little bit later than that. But definitely before the end of the summer that thing's coming out."</p>
<p>There are "good strategic reasons" for this, he said, from that end of school year point, to the ability for retailers to sell Switch 2 bundles at Christmas time. If the console launches at the end of the year, it means "something wasn't ready", Sean suggested.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 hands-on tour</a> begins in April and ends in June, too.</p>
<p>Another point of discussion in the podcast was the price point, specifically the upper limit.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine it being too much more than $400â€¦ maybe $450 is the highest I can imagine," said Sean.</p>
<p>That's based on him not knowing the specific tech specs, though he's "sure" the Switch 2 will have an Nvidia chip and be the next generation of the existing Switch chip. Further, he doesn't think it will have an OLED screen as Nintendo will be making "trade-offs" to hit a specific price point.</p>
<p>What's more, the original Switch likely won't drop in price right away at Switch 2's launch. "Don't be surprised if Black Friday comes around and you can get an OLED Switch for a smoking good deal," he said.</p>
<p>Sean also had some ideas to assist with pre-orders and the launch. That included using pre-orders to judge retailer allocation, but how can Nintendo know it's a real pre-order and not a scammer? Sean suggested tying pre-orders to Nintendo Online accounts when purchasing direct from the company, either to prioritise those pre-orders or require it.</p>
<p>This is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hits-snooze-on-alarmos-public-release">Nintendo required for sales of its Alarmo clock</a>, which Sean suggested was an intentional test ahead of Switch 2 pre-orders.</p>
<p>Another idea he had would be that consoles arrive with software preloaded on them, based on the games customers purchase. This is by no means confirmed, but just a cool idea he'd love to see implemented.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sean dispelled the myth that retailers had information now on Switch 2's launch. Retailers know "nothing" at this point, he said, be that price or launch date. Any articles from retailers are just them guessing, not leaking actual information.</p>
<p>"When we know the launch date, that's probably when retailers will know the launch date, or maybe a week or two in advance of that," he said.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, Nintendo revised its financial forecast as it failed to hit sales targets with the current Switch, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-says-switch-2-anticipation-not-to-blame-for-falling-switch-1-sales">president Shuntaro Furukawa said this wasn't due to interest in the Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo Direct on the Switch 2</a> will take place on 2nd April, where we'll presumably hear about the release date and price.</p>

            <p>
Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza has found its sea legs on Steam, where it launched to the series' second-biggest concurrent player haul to date.
</p>
<p>
A peak of 22,327 PC players played Pirate Yakuza over the weekend, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3061810/charts/#1w">Steam's own stats</a> - avast total higher than every other game in the franchise to date, save Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Steam itself broke its all-time concurrent user record once more - this time to hit 39.92 million online users. Prior to this, the record stood at 39.3 million, from back in December 2024.

</figure>
<p>
While a better start than most of the (many) other Yakuza/Like A Dragon games, including 2023's Like A Dragon: Ishin! and The Man Who Erased His Name, RGG Studio's nautical spin-off still saw around half of the players at launch as last year's Infinite Wealth, which peaked at 46,161 concurrent players total.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, Pirate Yakuza is most definitely a spin-off from the main series. On the other - pirates!
</p>
<p>
"A raucous, absurd spin-off that manages to still feel like a first-rate Yakuza game despite the leftfield setting and delightfully unhinged plot," Matt Elliot wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Eurogamer's Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza review</a>. "All of this somehow coalesces into something that works in defiance of itself."

            <p>Actor Yuri Lowenthal, the voice behind Peter Parker in Insomanic's games, has confirmed the original Spider-Man won't be sidelined in the series' third chapter.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Lowenthal stated there were "very few things" he could say about Insomniac's yet to actually be announced next Spider-Man game right now, but assured fans that "Peter is not gone" by any means.</p>
<p>"He will be a part of the next game and he won't be relegated to the couch, I promise," Lowenthal said. <strong>Beware some Marvel's Spider-Man 2 spoilers below.</strong></p>

<p>Those who have completed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> will know that the game ends with Peter Parker essentially handing the webby torch over to Miles Morales. While Miles as Spider-Man will take care of New York, Peter was going to focus more on his personal life with Mary Jane, and also build the Emily-May Foundation after it got fairly ripped to shreds during the fight with Venom.</p>
<p>The game then rounds out with two mid-credits scenes, clearly pathing the way for that third entry. The first of these scenes sees Norman Osborn - devastated by his son Harry's comatose state, and who blames the Spider-Men for ruining Harry's recovery - popping over to The Raft to visit Dr Octavius. He seems on course to become the Green Goblin, one of the Spider-Man series' main antagonists.</p>
<p>A second scene focusing on Miles' family introduces us very briefly to his mother's new boyfriend Albert Moon, and Albert's daughter, Cindy. Cindy Moon, for those unaware, is another person in the Marvel universe who gets bitten and given powers by a radioactive spider. She becomes the superhero Silk.</p>
<p>Guides writer Marie and I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-marvels-spider-man-2">chatted at length about where the next game could go following Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, and we theorised Miles may take Cindy under his wing and show her the Spidey ropes much like Peter did with him. At first we assumed this would mean Peter would have more of a 'cameo-like' role in the next game, but given what Lowenthal has said, it seems he may have a bigger role than first thought.</p>
<p>What are your hopes for Peter and co in the next Marvel's Spider-Man game?</p>

<p>While Lowenthal's comments have sparked plenty of chatter, Marvel's Spider-Man 3 is perhaps still a way off. After all, the studio still has its Wolverine release in the works.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">Wolverine was first teased back in 2021</a>, during a PlayStation Showcase. At this time, the studio stated the game was still "very early in development". Last month, Insomniac's newly appointed studio head Chad Dezern acknowledged the "pent up excitement" around the game, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">refrained from confirming or denying a 2025 release window for Wolverine</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has hit out at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, saying he "should've never been banned in the first place" despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitting to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June 2024.</p>
<p>Responding to news Twitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating guidelines will now be subjected to varying limited-time bans</a>, Beahm issued a comment from his personal account X/Twitter, saying Twitch "should've never allowed a low-level employee to override the entire ban system".</p>

<p>Although its difficult to verify the identity of this X profile given anyone can now purchase a blue tick, the account was established in 2011 and appears to be Beahm's personal account where he posts outside of his Doc persona.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Although things have been â€˜settled ðŸ˜Žâ€™, Twitch should do the right thing and correct their mistake of permanently banning the Doc by reinstating the channel.</p><p>We shouldâ€™ve never been banned in the first place.</p><p>Twitch shouldâ€™ve never allowed a low level employee to override theâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/qMcHooAsGb">https://t.co/qMcHooAsGb</a></p></div>â€” Guy Beahm (@GuyBeahm) <a href="https://twitter.com/GuyBeahm/status/1892635093531034057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Although things have been 'settled', Twitch should do the right thing and correct their mistake of permanently banning the Doc by reinstating the channel," he wrote. "We should've never been banned in the first place.</p>
<p>"Twitch should've never allowed a low level employee to override the entire ban system, which had already determined we didn't do anything wrong, because of biased opinions of the Doc character.</p>
<p>"They could've reached out and had a quick five-minute call and realise these mutual jokes and bantering never had serious intentions. Pathetic."</p>
<p>Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, claimed an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm.</p>
<p>After a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in September in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel, which was eventually approved.</p>
<p>Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. By the end of January, four months after making "significant" layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-studio-midnight-society-announces-closure-four-months-after-significant-layoffs">Midnight Society announced it was permanently shutting its doors</a>.</p>
<p>Beahm has yet to publicly share the "mutual jokes and bantering" messages he sent to the minor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Brace yourself, Assassin's Creed fans - it looks like early copies of the upcoming instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, have broken the street date.</p>
<p>Unsubstantiated reports are beginning to circulate that not only have some fans been able to download the full game early from the PlayStation Store, physical copies have been prematurely sold, too.</p>
<p><strong>There may be light spoilers after this point</strong>, so only proceed if you're happy to be spoiled!</p>

<p>Perhaps most notably, Assassin's Creed YouTuber The Hidden One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cm-56xcxUo">recently revealed</a> that he knows someone playing the full game on PS5 "because the PlayStation Store made a mistake".</p>
<p>Admitting that he could neither prove it or compel anyone to believe him, The Hidden One then revealed that in the leaked footage, he saw that Animus anomalies are back - something not previously confirmed for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>"In the video [the friend with early access] showed me, the player encounters something Animus in the world," he said.</p>
<p>"A pop up appeared that read: 'Animus systems breached. Stabilise anomalies and gain data fragments to advance your active strand'."</p>
<p>The player was then prompted to "press touchpad to open the Animus menu".</p>

</span></p><p>Over on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit it goes even further, with reports that <a href="https://ibb.co/PvQX2f2g">physical copies have similarly been sold early</a>.</p>
<p>While, as yet, there doesn't seem to be early footage popping up on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> or YouTube, now may be a good time to mute key words on your favourite social media apps, just in case...</p>
<p>Last week, Ubisoft signalled its expectations for Assassin's Creed Shadows in its latest quarterly financial results, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">in which it describes pre-orders for the game as "solid"</a>.</p>
<p>While the company did not divulge exact pre-order numbers, it said they were "in line with those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, the second most succesful entry of the franchise".</p>
<p>Our Katharine said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a> during our recent hands-on time with the game, and praised its dual protagonist gameplay. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait," she wrote.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Beyond games, Jason is perhaps best-known for his roles in Deadwood, 48 Hrs, and Prince of Darkness, although you'll also spot him in movies like Rio Lobo, Impulse, Brewster's Millions, They Live, and Alien Nation. He also guest starred on Murder, She Wrote, The Golden Girls, Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories, and Mad Men.</p>
