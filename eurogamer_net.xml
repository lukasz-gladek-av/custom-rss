            <p>
Excellent indie adventure Dungeons of Hinterberg will belatedly launch on PlayStation next month.
</p>
<p>
A PS5 version will become available on 13th March, after previously arriving for PC and Xbox Series X/S last summer.
</p>
<p>
This new version will also include a "new, secret bonus episode", publisher Curve Games said today - though details of what exactly this will be remain under-wraps. Presumably, the PC and Xbox versions will get this addition via a free update too.

<p>
If you're yet to try Dungeons of Hinterberg, it's an enjoyable Zelda-inspired adventure that splits its time between exploration and combat in various Alpine biomes, breezy dungeons filled with monsters and puzzle-solving, and then a social side set within a nearby town full of residents to befriend and side-quests to take on.
</p>
<p>
"Combat and RPG progression get an ingenious social twist in this disarming slice of fantasy," our Chris Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-of-hinterberg-review">Eurogamer's Dungeons of Hinterberg review</a>, reserving particular praise for the game's overall narrative.
</p>
<p>
"The protagonist's story hinges on burnout, but also the question of how one should spend their time and what they should value," Donlan wrote. "The story that unravels in the village, meanwhile, slowly starts to blur the distinctions the game has been careful to build up, touching on everything from the cost of tourism to the question of authenticity. It's gripping stuff."
</p>
<p>
"If you play games for escapism, there are few this year that did it better," Chris Tapsell added, recommending Dungeons of Hinterberg in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's best games of 2024</a>. "It's a dreamy, warm-hearted, timely and deeply welcome retreat."

Xbox won't switch on? Microsoft has announced you can now head down to high street chain Currys to get your console repaired. 
</p>
<p>
Currys has been named as the UK's first ever Xbox Authorised Service Provider, following the retailer's previous partnership with Microsoft to act as similar for the company's Surface laptops.
</p>
<p>
If you have a broken Xbox Series S or Series X, Currys stores will now host "expert colleagues" who may be able to help, a press release from Microsoft today states.

<p>
Alternatively, Currys can also help get your console booked in to be repaired. Fun fact: this will be within Europe's largest tech repair centre, which is based in Newark, Nottinghamshire. 
</p>
<p>
While consoles out of warranty will presumably not be repaired for free, there is a positive spin to all this which is to encourage people to try and repair goods where possible, rather than simply throwing them away and creating more electronic waste.
</p>
<p>If you're in the US, Microsoft announced a similar partnership last month with uBreakiFix by Asurion, which is now the first Xbox Authorised Service Provider over the pond. It will also seek to repair Xbox consoles, at nearly 700 participating store locations State-side.
</p>
