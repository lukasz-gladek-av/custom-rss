            <p>Coca-Cola has partnered with Xbox to give away a selection of super bright controllers "representing the most popular flavours in the brand's portfolio", such as orange, lemon, exotic, fruit twist, grape, and lemon-elderflower.</p>
<p>As well as Fanta-inspired Xbox Series X console bundles and wireless controllers, there's also hundreds of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions up for grabs, too, although you should probably note that they can only be redeemed by new members and not existing ones, I'm afraid.</p>

            <p>The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep - the Witcher anime heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> next month - will take place in the middle of the live-action show, specifically between episodes 5 and 6, and it includes a scene that was cut from Henry Cavill's first season.</p>
<p>As detailed in this month's <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/sfx/">SFX magazine</a> and shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/the-upcoming-the-witcher-anime-movie-features-a-new-version-of-a-scene-cut-from-the-henry-cavills-first-season/">GamesRadar+</a>, writer Mike Ostrowski and co-writer Rae Benjamin call it "a period of not being together [with Yennefer], or a period of trouble, but still on each other's minds".</p>

<p>The writers say they do not interfere with the live-action show's chronology or timeline, but the anime does include a "fun little scene" that was reportedly cut from the main Netflix series.</p>
<p>What, exactly, that scene entails? We're going to have to wait until the show debuts on 11th February, unfortunately - the writers wouldn't say more. But as we know Anya Chalotra reprises her role as Yennefer in the anime, the writers tease that we'll see more of Geralt and Yennefer's relationship in Sirens of the Deep.</p>
<p>"Geralt cannot let Yennefer go, even though he's trying his best," Ostrowski added. "She haunts him. Even if he wanted to be rid of her, he can't."</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us recently, two and a half years after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">announcement</a>, CD Projekt finally gave it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">big reveal treatment</a> late in 2024, confirming Ciri to be the focus this time around. And now Doug Cockle - voice of former series protagonist Geralt of Rivia both in the games and the anime - has had his say, calling the switch to a new main character, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">"really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>35 years after point and click horror game Last Half of Darkness first released it's coming back, remade from the ground up by the same solo dev who created it.</p>
<p>In honour of the 35th anniversary (well, technically 36th now) of the 1989 original, Bill Fisher has gone back to the start by remaking the first Last Half of Darkness with all-new graphics, a new soundtrack, "enhanced" story, and "even more" puzzles. You can check out the announcement teaser below:</p>

<p>"Your aunt sure was a strange one," the blurb teases. "She was some sort of witch or something. A good witch though, practicing only good spells and magic. In fact, she was working on a potion just before she was killed.</p>
<p>"Now the secret will go to the grave with her... unless you can find the missing ingredients."</p>
<p>"I made it on an XT PC 64k RAM system with a 10mb hard drive over a 9 month period, just working part-time on it," Fisher explained. "Was goofing around with some paint programs seeing if I could make some cool looking rooms and locations. It ended up turning out relatively good so I decided to actually package it. Hired an artist to do the package design and found a box manufacturer, etc. Got it in a couple retail stores locally, and sold a few at some conventions but wasn't really familiar or had the right contacts with the distribution side of things so it never was officially released commercially.</p>
<p>"However, right around that time, shareware was starting to really take off... and turned out to be very successful."</p>
<p>Last Half of Darkness is set to release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3096000/Last_Half_of_Darkness/">Steam</a> on 7th February 2025, although if you missed the original first time around, worry not - <a href="http://lasthalfofdarkness.com/">that's still available</a>, too.</p>

            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> said its brand identity is "evolving" now keeping first-party games exclusive to its own platform is no longer "a path for [Xbox]".</p>
<p>When asked by independent games journalist <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254">Dustin Legarie</a> if, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> would continue to have an "exclusivity window" on Xbox systems, Spencer replied with a strikingly simple: "No."</p>

<p>"There's no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say this game will not go to a place where it would find players, where it would have business success for us," Spencer explained.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is to allow our games to be available.</p>
<p>"Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform, but to keep games off other platforms?" Spencer added."We don't think is the path… that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us."</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>"What we're doing now we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world's best games. 'Cos the world's biggest games are available in multiple places, and more and more creators are asking us, how do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places, and we want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that.</p>
<p>"We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are single platform on single device, whether that's PC, whether that's mobile, whether it's a console.</p>
<p>And we want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on."</p>
<p>When pressed on whether Xbox's change in strategy means it may lose its identity, Spencer was firm about that, too.</p>
<p>"I hear them. I'm pretty active in our playerbase, and I'm active in the community. I listen. I think our identity will continue to evolve, which, frankly, it always has. But when I hear concerns, I hear concerns about is: my library of games safe. Am I still going to be able to play the games. And I think over the years, I'm proud of the commitment we've shown to respecting purchases on our platform through back compat, through cross entitlement, Xbox Play Anywhere, through crossplay. Things that we've done to enable people to continue to play, so I hear that.</p><p>"I see the investments we're making in platform and how we want Xbox to show up in multiple places, and your library to be available there. When I think about buy-to-stream - so when if I buy a game, I'll be able to stream it to devices - this is all about making sure that your library of games that you own on Xbox are playable in multiple places, so I'd say it's in evolution of our identity. But I believe it's an identity that this industry needs.</p>
<p>"When you think about where this industry is now and you see the challenges, the business challenges that are out there for many companies, I think us making games more accessible to more people has just gotta be front and centre for us as an industry so we continue to see great games that we've seen over the years."</p>
<p>The comments echo Spencer's position at the end of last year, when he said there were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">"no red lines" over any Xbox game coming to Nintendo Switch or PS5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
