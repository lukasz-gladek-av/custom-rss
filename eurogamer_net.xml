            <p>Nintendo has announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> Raiders for Switch 2.</p>
<p>This game will serve as a spin-off of the Splatoon series, with players taking on the role of a mechanic. The game was first announced via Nintendo's bespoke Today app, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">shares daily updates on games and franchises under its umbrella</a>. Players will be able to head over to the "mysterious Spirhalite Islands alongside the splat-tacular Deep Cut trio". </p>

<p>In addition to Splatoon Raiders, Nintendo also has <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> version 10.0.0 inbound. This will add new weapons, badges and more to the base game. As per the video shared via the Nintendo Today app, Splatoon 3 players will soon find 30 new weapon kits, the arrival of Urchin Underpass, new stat tracking options for weapon power, while the weapon freshness limit is being increased.</p>
<p>On top of all that, Nintendo has also talked of improved visuals and frame rate for Switch 2 as part of an update coming on 12th June. It has assured that those playing on Switch 2 will still be able to play against those on the original Switch console, as well.</p>
<p>Splatoon 3 was initially released back in 2022, and we here at Eurohamer were rather taken with it. "There are few surprises to be found in Splatoon 3's multiplayer or campaign, but it is the best Nintendo's spectacular series has been to date," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Eurogamer's Splatoon 3 review</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2, well that chap released last week, with many already enjoying the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Want to know more about the console before committing to one yourself? Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Donlan has given us all a Switch 2 review of sorts</a>, with him saying: "I love this console a little bit. I'm glad it's here."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Those looking to get into MindsEye on Xbox on launch day today will need to wait a little longer to get the game's day one patch.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l767j8/mindseye_release_everything_you_need_to_know/">reddit</a>, developer Build A Rocket Boy laid out the release times for its action-adventure thriller from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies, with those here in the UK able to get access from 6pm today (10th June).  While the game is currently available to preload across platforms, Build A Rocket Boy has said an additional update is also recommended after installation.</p>
<p>Update 2 will ensure the game is able to be experienced "as we intended", as it includes "key final refinements". This covers visual polish, performance tuning, stability fixes and general gameplay improvements, the studio has said. The update is available to those playing MindsEye via PlayStation and PC from today, however those on Xbox will have to wait longer due to "varied platform certification" issues.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the studio has not said when the update will be available on Xbox, merely stating it will be released "as soon as possible". We will update you when we know more.</p>
<p>As for the future, Build A Rocket Boy has said today's release "isn't the end" for MindsEye, rather it is "the start of something much bigger". This will see the developer releasing more "updates and refinements" shortly after release, with "plenty more" promised for further down the line.</p>
<p>"We want MindsEye to be a game that continues to grow with its players, and we'll be listening closely to your feedback as we go," the team wrote. "Expect updates, refinements, and adjustments â€“ based on what you're telling us. Launch may be the milestone, but it's far from the final word."</p>

            <p>UK actors' union Equity has applauded the "tenacity and persistence" of SAG-AFTRA video game performers, following news the US union has reached a tentative agreement after almost a year on strike. It now calls upon the industry to negotiate for UK performers too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US union <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">shared news of its tentative agreement</a> with multiple video game companies over the Interactive Media Agreement. The strike, which began last July, will continue until the agreement is finalised.</p>
<p>A key reason for the strike was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">need to protect performers from AI abuse</a>. It's unclear what protections have been included in this new tentative agreement, but SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland has stated the "necessary AI guardrails" have been put in place.</p>
<p>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," said Crabtree-Ireland. "Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains."</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher added: "Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world's most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before."</p>
<p>Here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity members have been unable to strike</a> due to UK law, but the union previously stated it stands "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA.</p>
<p>Now, in a statement shared with Eurogamer, Equity assistant general secretary for recorded media John Barclay has called upon the industry to negotiate for UK performers too, adding: "The UK cannot be the poor relation".</p>
<p>"We applaud the tenacity and persistence of the SAG-AFTRA video game performers who have been on strike for nearly a year pursuing an agreement with some of the biggest media companies in the world," said Barclay. "Important gains have been made and, significantly, agreement has been reached to put in place AI guardrails to defend performers' livelihoods. We look forward to receiving further details of the tentative agreement."</p>
<p>He continued: "Equity UK now calls upon the very same global engagers to meet with us to negotiate an agreement for our video games performers in the world's most lucrative industries that will bring fair rates of pay along with contractual terms covering AI. The UK cannot be the poor relation, especially when the industry and engagers here in the UK are supported by tax breaks. So we call upon the engagers to step up to meet the challenge to make the UK games industry the best it possibly can be for creatives."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-stages-baftas-protest-seeking-improved-conditions-for-performers">Equity members protested outside this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a> in April, calling on the games industry to improve conditions for performers. This includes better pay and terms and conditions for their work, as well as AI protection.</p>
<p>At the start of this year, Eurogamer spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Mass Effect actor Jennifer Hale on why the SAG-AFTRA strike was taking so long</a>. "[AI is] a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she said. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
