            <p>
Xenoblade studio Monolith Soft is now 100 percent owned by Nintendo. 
</p>
<p>
Based in Tokyo, with a second office in Nintendo's home of Kyoto, Monolith Soft has become a key partner studio for the Mario maker over the past two decades, and has provided development support for some of Nintendo's biggest titles, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, Nintendo has increased its stake in the company to fully own it, after initially purchasing 80 percent of Monolith Soft from Bandai Namco in 2007. Nintendo then increased its stake to 96 percent in 2011, while the company's original owners retained a symbolic four percent stake.

<p>
Nintendo has not officially announced the change, but its 100 percent ownership of the company was recently added to Monolith Soft's website, as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-now-owns-100-of-monolith-soft/">Automaton</a>.
</p>
<p>
Monolith Soft began its era as a Nintendo-exclusive studio in 2008 with a range of smaller titles, including Wii shooter Disaster: Day of Crisis and RPG Soma Bringer for Nintendo DS.
</p>
<p>
But it was the 2010 launch of Wii RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> which saw Monolith Soft find its new niche. Three sequels have followed, with Wii U game re-release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition set to launch on Switch in March 2025.
</p><p>
In the background, Monolith Soft has also provided extra development support to Nintendo's own internal development houses. It has assisted Nintendo with all three <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> titles, the past three Animal Crossing games, and is now a regular co-developer on The Legend of Zelda series, with credits on Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
What could the studio be working on next for Switch 2?

            <p>Employees at FromSoftware owner Kadokawa are reportedly optimistic about a potential buyout from Sony due to frustration with current management.</p>
<p>Kadokawa suffered a ransomware cyberattack earlier this year, but employees were left disappointed by the response from current president and CEO Takeshi Natsuno.</p>
<p>As a result, employees are said to be "thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition by Sony", according to a new report from Japanese outlet <a href="https://bunshun.jp/articles/-/75402">Bunshun</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/kadokawas-employees-are-reportedly-optimistic-about-a-sony-buyout-because-theyre-itching-for-a-change-in-leadership/">Automaton</a>).</p>

<p>"The people around me are thrilled at the prospect of an acquisition by Sony," a veteran Kadokawa employee told Bunshun.</p>
<p>"That's because there's a certain number of employees who are dissatisfied with the Natsuno administration, which didn't even bother to hold a press conference after peoples' personal information was leaked in the cyberattack. They expect that if Sony were to acquire the company, they would get rid of the president first."</p>
<p>The cyberattack against Kadokawa included video streaming platform NicoNico, as well as personal employee information as part of 1.5 terabytes of stolen data.</p>
<p>Former chairman Tsuguhiko Kadokawa - part of the company's founding family - was reportedly "surprised, but appeared positive" about a Sony acquisition, according to a Bunshun source at the company.</p>
<p>Kadokawa himself resigned from the company in October 2022 following allegations of bribing an official of the Tokyo Olympic Games. Kadokawa denied the charges.</p>
<p>Conversely, economic analyst Takahiro Suzuki told Bunshun Kadokawa had little to gain from the acquisition. "Kadokawa will lose its independence, and management will become stricter," he said. "If they want to keep developing their business as freely as they have until now, [the acquisition] would be a bad choice. They'd have to be prepared for publications that don't lead to IP creation being put under scrutiny."</p>
<p>News of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony possibly acquiring Kadokawa</a> emerged from a Reuters report last month. The following day, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged the takeover interest from Sony</a>.</p>
<p>"The Company has received an initial letter of intent to acquire the Company's shares, but no decision has been made at this time," said Kadokawa at the time.</p>
<p>Still, the news has in part led to a <a href="https://x.com/xMBGx/status/1866510846098338042">sharp increase in Sony's stock value in Japan</a>, which is currently the highest since 2000. As the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/sony-group-shares-hit-record-closing-high-3035c869?">Wall Street Journal reported</a>, stock value has been on the rise for the past month following strong financial results from Sony and its profitable game segment.</p>
<p>As for what's next from FromSoftware, president Hidetaki Miyazaki stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-2-is-not-in-development-says-fromsoftwares-miyazaki">a sequel to Elden Ring is not in development</a>, but the company does have multiple projects in the works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
We already knew <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> was set to receive a couple of "surprises" before the end of the year, thanks to some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-surprises-coming-later-this-year-says-director">previous teasing from its director</a> - and it now appears at least some of those are here, courtesy of a big new update for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-to-attract-record-breaking-numbers-of-players">record-breaking</a> action-RPG.
</p>
<p>
Black Myth's new stuff begins with its Keeper's Shrine challenges, which unlock after completing the game once. These come in two flavours - Return of Rivals and Gauntlet of Legends - both bringing back previously defeated foes for a rematch.
</p>
<p>
Return of Rivals is all about one-on-one fights, with players able to challenge former opponents to a duel across one of three levels of selectable difficulty. Gauntlet of Legends, meanwhile, features a number of returning enemies - some with new moves - battled in succession, with difficulty based around customisable curses. Successfully beating a gauntlet rewards rare treasures, but developer Game Science warns challenges won't be available if their corresponding opponents haven't yet been defeated in the main game.

<p>
Elsewhere in today's update (officially known as 1.0.12.16581, number fans), players can now lay their hands on Journeyer's Charts - featuring landscapes organised "for guidance and marking". Which is to say, maps. Journeyer's Charts are initially unlocked after meeting the Keeper in Black Wind Mountain, and new ones can be purchased for each visited territory at shrines. As Game Science so wonderfully puts it, "Let the chart chart the journeyer's journey."
</p>
<p>
And for players looking to shake up their wardrobe, Black Myth's new update brings four special armour pieces added to celebrate the upcoming Chinese New Year. These can be claimed under "Trailblazer's Gift" at any Keeper's Shrine. 
</p>
<p>
Beyond the big headline additions, Black Myth's 1.0.12.16581 brings a whole host of bug fixes and improvements covering everything from performance and localisation issues to boss tweaks. Oh, and the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection has been added to the music library. All this is available on the Epic Games Store right now, with the update slowly rolling out across other platforms - so you might need to wait a little before you can probe its wares. Full patch notes are <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149">available on Game Science's website</a>.
</p><p>
Black Myth: Wukong's latest update arrives just ahead of this year's The Game Awards, where it's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">nominated across several different categories</a>: best action game, best art direction, best game direction, Player's Voice award, and game of the year. And if you're curious to know how it fares, the show kicks off this Friday, 13th December, at 1am in the UK. Or just go to bed and read about it all on Eurogamer when you're sufficiently ready to start the day.
</p>
<p>
Will The Game Awards also bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">long-awaited Xbox release date</a> for Black Myth: Wukong (or maybe even a surprise drop in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">similar fashion to Baldur's Gate 3</a>)? All will be revealed soon.

            <p>
Just a day after piquing fan curiosity with the surprise announcement a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update was on the way, developer CD Projekt has revealed exactly what it contains - including expanded customisation options and new photo mode features - <em>and</em> released it into the wild.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's new 2.2 update mightn't be as feature-packed as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-getting-fully-functioning-metro-system-in-next-weeks-21-update">last December's surprisingly substantial 2.1 update</a>, but it still introduces a range of nifty new features, fixes, and quality of life improvements - certainly more than you might ordinarily expect from a game whose development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended</a> seven months ago.
</p>
<p>
On the customisation front, players can now change paint jobs across a whole range of vehicles using the CrystalCoat technology previously only available on Rayfield cars - with Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra, and Villefort all now compatible. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2077 now has a vehicle colour cloning feature (officially known as TWINTONE), so players can save colour changes made to one vehicle and apply them elsewhere.
</p>
<figure>

<a aria-label="REDstreams — Cyberpunk 2077 | Update 2.2 Overview" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIlOthAEggI?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
In other car-related news, 10 more "most requested" vehicles have been added for purchase via Autofixer (as detailed in the patch notes below), and players might now see Johnny Silverhand appear in the passenger seat - to comment on or react to their actions - once Act 1 is done.
</p><p>
Customisation options have also been expanded on the player side too, with update 2.2 introducing new eye and nail colours, new face and body tattoos, new eyebrows shapes, face scars, cosmetic face cyberware options, and makeup types for cheek, eyes, and lips. Additionally, the Character Creator randomiser now includes a Plain-to-Punk slider, which does pretty much exactly what it sounds like.
</p>
<p>
And once you've pimped your car or your V out to meet your exacting tastes, you can record them for posterity using the improved Photo Mode features. These include the ability to spawn up to three NPCs for a shot, the ability to spawn and adjust light sources, increased camera range, a new Effect Intensity slider, a change to make the Drone Camera free-roaming, plus a variety of feature toggles. It's also now possible to display your favourite photos in V's apartments by interacting with the picture frames.
</p>
<p>
And that's still not quite everything for Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update. It also introduces a whole range of fixes and quality of life improvements, as well as - most intriguingly - "more secrets to discover in Night City." Sounds like it might be time to hit the streets and hunt down some Witcher 4 teases now the game is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">officially in "full-scale production"</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today's Cyberpunk 2077 update - which was developed in collaboration with Virtuos and is available now for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 - comes ahead of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">release on Apple computers next year</a>. You can learn more about its new features via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIlOthAEggI">developer video</a> above, or by perusing the patch notes below.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle's color scheme for a small fee. You'll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you'll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</li>
<li>All vehicles compatible with CrystalCoat™ and TWINTONE™ are marked with a spray can icon on Autofixer.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ten most requested vehicles from the streets of Night City are now available for purchase on Autofixer:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Mizutani Shion MZ1</li>
<li>Mizutani Shion Targa MZT</li>
<li>Thorton Galena GA32t</li>
<li>Thorton Colby CST40</li>
<li>Archer Quartz EC-L r275</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 640 TS</li>
<li>Quadra Type-66 680 TS</li>
<li>Mahir Supron FS3-T</li>
<li>Villefort Deleon V410-S Coupe (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
<li>Mizutani Hozuki MH2 (Phantom Liberty only)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Following Act 1, Johnny will now sometimes appear in the passenger seat while V is driving to comment on and react to what's happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We've overhauled Photo Mode and added multiple community-requested features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.</li>
<li>Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) - determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) - locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) - slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SmartFrames™ by Kiroshi allows you to display your Photo Mode shots in-game by interacting with the picture frames in V's apartments. Browse your photo collection in the new Gallery menu tab located alongside Journal, Shards and Tarot. The Gallery pulls .png images from the screenshots folder on your PC or from your console gallery. For more details on SmartFrames™ and the Gallery, see this Support article.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Added more character customization options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>32 eye colors</li>
<li>18 lip makeup types</li>
<li>17 nail colors</li>
<li>10 cheek makeup types</li>
<li>16 eye makeup types</li>
<li>4 face scars</li>
<li>5 eyebrow shapes</li>
<li>4 face tattoos</li>
<li>2 body tattoos</li>
<li>8 cosmetic face cyberware options</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Upgraded the Character Creator randomizer to feature a new Plain-to-Punk slider. Whether you're aiming for an understated, casual look or a bold, edgy style for your V, you can now use the slider to strike the perfect balance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Added more secrets to discover in Night City.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quests &amp; Open World</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rephrased objectives for quests that tell you to wait a specific amount of time to progress. The game is designed in a way that doesn't always allow players to simply skip in-game time to advance the objective, instead requiring them continue playing to trigger the next event.</li>
