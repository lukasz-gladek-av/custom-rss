            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> today receives its fourth major update as early access continues, bringing a new bridge-building mechanic, bug fixes, and some experimental changes.</p>
<p>The bridge-building utilises the same road-building tool and arrives alongside two new maps, one of which includes a huge river, making bridges a necessity. Another watery addition is a stone well upgrade with increased water supply, while taverns can also be upgraded to level two.</p>
<p>Another new feature is an additional Overstock setting, which allows users to control the amount of extra goods placed in stalls or the tavern to exceed what's currently needed.</p>

<p>These additions come alongside a huge number of bug fixes, crashfixes, performance boosts, and more.</p>
<p>There are some experimental changes too, including a rework of cliffs to ensure they're less ambiguous (plus fixed pathfinding errors); changes to building costs to encourage more diverse resource use; amending food consumption to consume all types equally; and changing region strength selection so regions are picked from a finite pool to ensure necessary resources are available.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for this update, 0.8.024, can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Manor Lords is available now on PC across Steam, GOG, Epic, Microsoft, and on PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for its 1.0 release, though updates such as this prove developer Slavic Magic is hard at work.</p>
<p>"There's a confidence to Manor Lords that belies its one-person development, and what's there can be spellbinding, but it's a pastoral idyll that still needs significant development," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-early-access-review-beautiful-foundations-but-missing-important-pieces">Manor Lords early access review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For the uninitiated, House of Dead 2 is, funnily enough, the sequel to Sega's prolific 90s rail-shooter zombie series. In this instalment, you take on the lone role of secret agent James - either alone or in co-op mode alongside fellow agent Gary - with one single mission: to neutralise the dangerous denizens standing in your way.</p>
<p>As well as the features listed above, there will also be a boss mode in which you'll have to speedrun killing all of the game's bosses, and a training mode is available to help you hone your skills.</p>
<p>This is the second of Sega's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, as Matt summarised for us this time last year, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>. With complaints highlighting control scheme issues and performance on last-gen consoles, so it'll be interesting to see how the second remake will be received.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">Sega's The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct.</p>
<p>Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. The duo have also worked on adaptations for the likes of Mortal Kombat (1995) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> (2020), as well as multiple Resident Evil films.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
