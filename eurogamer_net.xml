            <p>While there's been a lot of chatter about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">since it stealth-dropped earlier in the week</a>, Oblivion isn't the only Elder Scrolls game getting some love this week - The Elder Scrolls Online has confirmed its Scribing system is coming for free to all players.</p>
<p>It's still a little way off - an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/306130/view/502823294872846628">update</a> on the official Steam page suggests we'll get it sometime in July - but the team wanted to share the news now as Scribing will be available in the Crown Store from Monday for those playing on the test server, whereas previously, it had only been available to those who owned the premium Gold Road chapter.</p>

<figcaption>Here's our Zoe with some Oblivion tips for new players.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBiRsqE9xC8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Scribing is coming to the base game, free for all players as a claim in the Crown Store, in mid-July with an associated Golden Pursuit! You will see Scribing in the Crown Store on the PTS on Monday as part of this testing," the team announced.</p>
<p>This means the ESO is "not selling Scribing in the Crown Store", and if you missed the associated Golden Pursuit, "you will still be able to claim Scribing from the Crown Store, as this is a permanent move for it to the base game".</p>
<p>"There will be a short window from June to July with the launch of Update 46 and the Gold Road zone moving to ESO Plus and the Crown Store where players who do not currently own Scribing will not be able to purchase/gain access to it," the update concluded.</p>
<p>Not everyone's happy about the news, however, particularly as Bethesda has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622072180">confirmed</a> "nothing is planned at this time" to compensate players who've previously paid to access Scribing.</p>
<p>"What about the people who paid for it originally, though?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107#c599650845622070777">asked</a> one player. "Is anything getting added to the chapter for us? It's been less than a year and the new chapter is already getting depreciated."</p>
<p>"I just bought this the other month, do I get a refund?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622071201">questioned</a> another.</p>
<p>In response, a Bethesda rep said: "No, nothing is planned at this time. However, the Scribing Golden Pursuit is rewarding AND equally available to both those who have already invested time into Scribing, and first-time Scribers. In fact, those who have used Scribing over the last year may find some tasks faster and easier to complete."</p>
<p>"So, why exactly are we still paying for stuff?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622074789">said</a> one respondent. "Suddenly, everything will be available for free to everyone. First the dungeons are stripped from ESO+, now a system goes free that's not even been part of the game for a full year.</p>
<p>"Free stuff for everyone is great (I 100% support sub classes being free), but stripping all the advantages from paying customers, there's less and less incentive to actually buy anything."</p>
<p>ICYMI, Oblivion Remastered stealth-launched just five days ago, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">it's already clocked up over four million players</a>. Remade by port developer Virtuos' Paris studio, in collaboration with Bethesda, this new version is a ground-up remake built in Unreal Engine 5, designed to run at 4K 60fps. Earlier today, however, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-microsoft-store-update-accidentally-deletes-upscaling-options-from-player-settings">a Microsoft Store patch, released "for a few backend tweaks", has inadvertently impacted UI and graphical settings</a> for some players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is selling faster on PS5 than it did on Steam and Xbox, with over 100,000 copies sold since its launch last week.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/indiana_jones_article/">Alinea analyst Rhys Elliott</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-indiana-jones-is-selling-fastest-on-ps5-despite-releasing-months-later/">VGC</a>), who quite rightly adds the caveat that the "overwhelming majority" of Xbox players "came in via Game Pass" and therefore didn't need to "buy" the game if they were members of Xbox's subscription service.</p>

<p>That said, it's thought that in less than a week, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has sold 28 percent faster on PS5 than PC, shifting 117.2K copies on PS5 compared with Steam's 91.2K in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>Alinea posits The Great Circle has been played by around five million players on Xbox.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-features-detailed">PS5 edition gets a handful of new features over Xbox</a>, including DualSense compatibility, which gives you a visual indicator if enemies are on the lookout for Indy. Performance wise, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle "benefits from frictionless loading", as well as "selective installation that prioritises your system language, and SSD optimisation, ensuring a seamless experience with faster streaming and loading".</p>
<p>The game also included a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhanced label on its release, which gives users higher and more consistent framerates when playing, as well as better image clarity thanks to its native 4K resolution and advanced ray tracing.</p>
<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm, and a real eye for spectacle," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p>
<p>"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle makes a successful leap on to PS5 platforms and despite its delayed release, everything we loved about the Xbox experience is intact," Digital Foundry's Thomas wrote in his review of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5-excellent-game-solid-port">PS5 Indiana Jones and the Great Circle port</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Long Dark's final episode, Episode Five, is the "largest episode to date", featuring "between two to three times as much cinematic and story content" as preceding episode Four and about "three-to-four times as big".</p>
<p>Addressing fans in a lengthy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/512956388211687524?l=english">Steam update</a>, Hinterland founder and creative director, Raphael van Lierop said the team "won't be sharing much detail about the episode until he first teaser", but it includes "quite a few systems we haven't used in other episodes".</p>
<p>"We know many of you - like us - have been waiting for years for this story to be completed. And once it's done, we can never go back. So that's really on our minds. The episode can't just be good; it has to be great," van Lierop added.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of story threads to tie up across all the episodes, to wrap up the Wintermute storyline, but also to set the stage for the future of The Long Dark, so we have to take you to several different places and hear from a lot of new people," the director added (thanks, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/512956388211687524?l=english">PC Gamer</a>). "Because of what the story needs, we've focused on narrative more than we have traditionally, and the mission flow for Episode Five is probably more linear than previous episodes as a result."</p>
<p>There will be "many" new locations - "everything in the episode is new to the game and the world, so these will all be places you’ve never seen before" - and as "this final episode of the story has you playing as both Mackenzie and Astrid, you'll also be seeing some of the key characters from previous episodes, so...there's a lot!"</p>
<p>"We're also using new motion-capture tech for our team, to attempt to deliver an ever higher bar for story delivery than we have achieved so far," he added. "These are all things that exist outside the context of Survival Mode, although some of the work in Tales helped set the foundation of some of the things we're attempting in Episode Five.</p>
<p>"I can confidently say that Episode Five will be the most ambitious thing we've done on The Long Dark at Hinterland to date. I know that won't mean much to you until you have it in your hands, but hopefully that gives you some sense of the ambition behind the episode."</p>
<p>The update also confirmed that Tales from the Far Territory expansion is now complete, further visual enhancements are being trialled with the test team, with improvements to shadows, fog, anisotropic filtering, enhanced draw distances, terrain blending, motion blur, and more on the way, albeit "mainly apply to high-end PCs or the top-end consoles".</p>
<p>There'll also be an update for PlayStation and Xbox players in mid-late June.</p>
<p>Nearly a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-long-dark-dev-teases-unannounced-survival-game-that-might-just-be-the-long-dark-2">teasing</a> an 'unannounced survival game' that looked suspiciously like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> 2, developer Hinterland's has officially unveiled its snowy survival sequel. It's called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snowy-survival-game-the-long-dark-is-heading-to-the-city-in-sequel-blackfrost">Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 and it's coming to Steam early access in 2026</a>.</p>
<p>While our first tease of The Long Dark 2 in January didn't go much beyond a slow pan across a slightly ramshackle room, Hinterland's The Game Awards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIAiNhlghY4">announcement trailer</a> shows considerably more, with the wilderness action of its predecessor now expanded to cover towns and even cities gripped by the apocalyptic winter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fallout creator Tim Cain has revealed that he was "ordered to destroy" all of his notes, code, and prototypes from his days at Fallout's original developer and publisher, Interplay, and as a result, no original source code or assets remain.</p>
<p>Making the admission on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F707wIeTX2g">new YouTube video</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-creator-tim-cain-says-he-was-ordered-to-destroy-his-personal-archive-of-the-rpgs-development-individuals-and-organizations-actively-work-against-preservation/">GR+</a>), Cain explained that he was told to destroy everything after he left the Fallout studio, having been told that the studio would "be the archive keeper".</p>

<p>"There's a lot of organisations out there that demand to be the archive keeper, and then they do a terrible job at it," Cain said. "They lose the assets they were in charge of keeping. This has happened multiple times in my career.</p>
<p>"When I left Fallout, I was told 'you have to destroy everything you have', and I did. My entire archive. Early design notes, code for different versions, prototypes, all the GURPS code – gone.</p>
<p>"When they finally, a few years after I left, contacted me and said 'oops, we lost it' I thought they were trapping me into 'we're going to sue you if you say you have it.' Turns out, no, they really lost it."</p>
<p>Cain said the experience shows why programs like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">GOG's preservation work</a> are so important.</p>
<p>"Individuals and organisations actively work against preservation," Cain added. "The amount of stuff that's been lost about Fallout and its early development saddens me. I had it. I had that in digital form and was ordered to destroy it.</p>
<p>"So many other games that came out in the '70s, and '80s and '90s - the code is gone. The art assets are gone. Sure, you can try to crack open the databases and pull out those things, but you're only getting the final stuff. You're not getting the original source code or art[work]. I think it's even happening for the '00s and the '10s and probably now in the '20s. Stuff is being lost."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Cain has plenty of praise for Amazon's TV adaptation</a>, saying of the show: "They had huge sets with amazing production values on them... Amazing props. The acting was phenomenal. It was just surreal to watch Fallout recreated in real life like that."</p>

            <p>The fifth and final season of Netflix's live-action The Witcher show is in production, and we've finally had a peek at Liam Hemsworth in the titular role.</p>
<p>The Witcher and House of the Dragon site, <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, which shared the shot, said it's been "quite a trick" getting a shot of the actual Hemsworth, as he has had two body doubles popping up on location in the UK, too, often confusing onlookers.</p>

<p>As the fourth season hasn't yet aired, it's hard to know where, exactly, in Geralt's chronology we find him, but the sword on his back suggests it's after he was gifted the blade from Zoltan, which has yet to happen on the show.</p>
<p>As the location is "filled with beehives and beekeepers", some think this could be a scene from Andrzej Sapkowski’s Tower of the Swallow, where Geralt encounters beekeepers who direct him to druids. Druid costumes spotted on set seem to strengthen the theory.</p> <div>

<p>The shots also evidence that Hemsworth stuck around to reprise The Witcher role for the final season after assuming it from Henry Cavill, who bowed out of the show at the end of season three. For more shots of Hemsworth - albeit all mainly in the same position and wearing the same costume - head on over to <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>In related news about the game, we recently learned CD Projekt Red has recast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s Ciri. Whilst originally it only sounded as though the character's original actor, Jo Wyatt, had been replaced in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-the-witcher-4s-ciri-has-been-recast">development studio has now confirmed it</a>, albeit without expanding on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt.</p>
<p>Last week, CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-beta-test-invites-a-scam-cd-projekt-warns">warned fans of a The Witcher 4 beta test "scam"</a>, saying it's "been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down".</p>
<p>The studio shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media, writing, "Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
