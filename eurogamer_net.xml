            <p>Workers at Raven Software, the Activision subsidiary known for its contribution to the Call of Duty series, have ratified their first union contract with Microsoft, three years after unionisation efforts began.</p>
<p>Unionisation efforts within Raven Software started in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzards-raven-software-announce-intent-to-unionise">January 2022</a>, following strike action protesting the firing of 12 members of the developer's QA team. Eventually, in May of that year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/qa-testers-at-activision-blizzard-studio-raven-software-successfully-vote-to-unionise">the vote to unionise was won</a>, despite Activision Blizzard's anti-unionisation manoeuvres, which included <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-sent-anti-union-emails-ahead-of-pivotal-raven-software-vote">sending emails asking recipients to "please vote no"</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) has announced workers at Raven Software have "unanimously voted" to <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft">ratify their first union contract between Game Workers Alliance-CWA (GWA-CWA) members and Xbox maker Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>The contract guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years, with "additional raises through merit and promotions, after going 18 months without wage increases and 45 months without promotions".</p>
<p>In addition, the contract promises an "elimination" of crunch time. Seven days notice is now required for any mandatory overtime, and there is to be no "excessive overtime on back-to-back weeks" and "no mandatory overtime of any duration for the majority of weeks in a quarter".</p>
<p>Job descriptions will also become defined with this contract in place, while the promotions process will be made more clear.</p>
<p>"After more than three years of organising and bargaining, seeing it finally pay off feels incredible," Erin Hall, QA tester at Raven Software and member of the bargaining committee, said today. "From day one, we made it a priority to include every voice in the room, and the contract we came out with reflects what we need - better pay, real career paths, and protection from burnout. It's a contract that actually values the work QA does. I'm proud of what we accomplished, and I hope it shows other game workers that organising works - and it's worth it."</p>
<p>"Going from organising to sitting across the table from one of the largest tech corporations in the world was a huge learning curve, but we never lost sight of why we were there," added Autumn Prazuch, another QA tester at Raven Software and bargaining committee member. "We fought hard for raises and job structures that will finally make QA a sustainable career path, and we were able to negotiate limitations on mandatory crunch. Ratifying this contract is a win for game workers everywhere who are ready to take the first step toward a better future."</p>
<p>CWA District 4 Vice President Linda L. Hinton called the contract between CWA members and Microsoft "proof that when video game workers organise, they can win lasting changes in the workplace".</p>
<p>Said Hinton: "By reaching an agreement with Microsoft that puts limits on excessive sustained overtime, also known as crunch, these members are tackling one of the most exploitative practices in the industry and setting new standards for quality assurance testers and video game workers overall.</p>
<p>"We are pleased to welcome these members into the CWA District 4 family."</p>
<p>Today's news comes just a couple of months after workers at ZeniMax Media voted to ratify their first union contract with parent company Microsoft. In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cwa-negotiates-new-contract-for-zenimax-including-substantial-wage-increases-and-a-credits-policy-for-qa-staff">the two parties reached a tentative agreement</a>, following almost two years of negotiations.</p>
<p>As for Raven Software, it is currently working on the next Call of Duty entry - Black Ops 7 - with Treyarch. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">developers have promised this will be the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet</a>. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/raven-software-workers-celebrate-win-following-three-year-battle-for-microsoft-union-contract]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As Rare - known for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Banjo-Kazooie and  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> - gets ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary, a third-party licensed controller themed around the developer's legacy has leaked online.</p>
<p>The controller itself has been built by gaming peripherals manufacturer 8BitDo, and officially licensed with Rare and Xbox. It features Hall Effect sticks, 'Pro Back Buttons' and has an integrated charging dock (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1mh6981/new_wireless_8bitdo_controller_leaked_on_amazon/">reddit</a>). </p>
<p>The controller is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and iOS, and - according to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ">Amazon listing</a>, which has gone live prior to any official announcement from the studio itself - this release will mark 8BitDo's first 2.4G wireless Xbox controller.</p>

<p>"A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone," reads the controller's Amazon page. "Wrapped in signature blue and gold, this special edition features symbolic patterns, game-inspired silhouettes and playful Easter eggs - a tribute to the legacy Rare brought to life."</p>
<p>Those aforementioned silhouettes include bananas (a nod to Donkey Kong), feathers ( Banjo-Kazooie), tentacles (Sea of Thieves) and more. You can see how it looks via the images below.</p>
<p>Amazon's sales page has the controller listed for $89.99, and at the time of writing it appears it will be only available across the pond in the US. Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for comment.</p>

<p>This controller leaked on the same day Rare itself shared an anniversary post on social media, celebrating 40 years in the business.</p>
<p>"From devoted Rare gamers to single-series stalwarts, we want to show our appreciation for anyone who's visited even just one of our worlds," <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">it wrote</a>, with an accompanying piece of art showing characters from Rare's games all gathered together in a theatre (see below).</p>
<p>"For keeping an assorted ragtag of creatives working magic in the Midlands, only two words will do: THANK YOU."</p>

<p>Of course, it has not been an easy time for Rare recently. Just last month, the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled following layoffs at Xbox</a>. Everwild was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a>. At this time, the game was said to be the next "large" project from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of Sea of Thieves.</p>
<p>Soon after Everwild's cancellation, it was revealed Rare's most seasoned creator Gregg Mayles - known for directing the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, as well as his work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a> and many more games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">had left the studio after more than 35 years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-a-rough-year-for-rare-but-at-least-xbox-is-celebrating-its-40th-anniversary-with-a-licensed-controller]]></content:encoded>
