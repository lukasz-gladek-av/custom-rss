A mod putting a playable approximation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> has run into trouble after Rockstar owner Take-Two issued a copyright removal request to its creator's YouTube channel.
</p>
<p>
The mod, developed by Youtuber Dark Space, was an effort to bring GTA 6's map to life in GTA 5 by building on the work of the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/985670-mapping-vice-city-map-discussion-thread-no-leak-footage-allowed/">Mapping Vice City project</a> - a community led attempt to piece together GTA 6's map by scrutinising all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">currently released official media</a> and combining any discoveries with previously leaked map coordinates.
</p>
<p>
Dark Space began <a href="https://x.com/Dark_SpaceYT/status/1882980876201685289">detailing his progress on social media</a> in January and a version 1.0 release of his mod - built from GTA 5 assets - launched last week. However, the project may already have run aground; Dark Space is reining things in after Take-Two's legal team hit his YouTube channel with a copyright removal request.

<p>
"I spent months building a fan-made GTA 6-inspired map inside GTA 5 - something purely made out of passion, not profit," Dark Space wrote in an introduction to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U">new video detailing the week's events</a>. "But shortly after uploading a video showcasing the project, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> took it down. No warning. No conversation. Just gone."
</p>
<p>
"I've also removed the download link even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space continued in the video itself. "But I think it's smarter to get out in front of them rather than waiting for their email that will never come... So why did they remove my video?... Well, my guess is that the map is probably a little too accurate.""
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-map-in-gta-5-mod-suffers-inevitable-take-two-takedown-creator-believes-it-was-probably-a-little-too-accurate-and-could-have-ruined-the-surprise">follow-up interview with IGN</a>, Dark Space admitted he'd anticipated Take-Two might respond the way it did based on previous mod takedowns. "I went into this project knowing it was a possibility," he explained, "and the fact that it happened does not surprise me."
</p>
<p>
"I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get," he continued. "If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two has long been at loggerheads with the GTA modding community, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">shutting down the Liberty City Preservation Project</a> - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of GTA 4's map to GTA5. In 2023, however, it hired Cfx.re - the team behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">RDR2</a> RedM mods (and another group that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-bans-gta5-modders-who-made-their-own-multiplayer">previously faced Rockstar's wrath</a>) - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-enhanced-official-modding-utility-is-on-its-way">currently working on an official "conversion tool"</a> to bring GTA 5 mods into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">recently released PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for GTA 6, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">still targeting the autumn 2025 release window previously announced by Take-Two</a>, despite persistent reports of a delay - although a third-party accessories company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recently claimed the PC version won't arrive until early next year</a>.

Skater and former Jackass star Bam Margera will reportedly feature in Activision's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake</a>, despite being omitted from the publisher's previously released skater roster - supposedly thanks to a last-minute intervention by Tony Hawk himself.
</p>
<p>
Margera made his series debut in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> back in 2001 and has appeared in all subsequent instalments. However, fans quickly noticed his absence when 3 + 4's skater line-up was unveiled earlier this month, with many speculating his omission may be related to the legal issues Margera has faced as a result of his struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, it's been claimed Margera will appear in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> remake after all - albeit as a last-minute addition at Tony Hawk's insistence. That's according to skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bam-margera-will-be-in-tony-hawk-34-after-all-after-hawk-intervened-its-claimed/">spotted by VGC</a>.

<p>
"Well, here's what happened," Bagley explained in a recent livestream. "The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game."
</p>
<p>
Activision hasn't yet commented on the claims, but its currently confirmed skater roster - which includes classic skaters and new additions - is as follows: Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, Bob Burnquist, Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 launches for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store) on 11th July. It's also coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.
