            <p>
It feels like forever since we first laid eyes on Warfarme's 1999 expansion (it was, in fact, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-next-big-expansion-whispers-in-the-walls-gets-weird-with-necramechs-and-retro-earth-tech">little over a year ago during TennoCon 2023</a>), but the free-to-play sci-fi shooter's time-travelling, boyband battling 1999 story expansion finally has a release date: it launches for all platforms on 13th December - which is to say, later today.
</p>
<p>
1999, if you're unfamiliar, catapults players away from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warframe">Warframe</a>'s usual far-flung sci-fi future to an eerily familiar Earth-like world of grungy subways stations and retro tech. And, yes, it really is set in 1999 (New Year's Eve to be exact) - but not the Earth we know, despite its familiar sights.
</p>
<p>
And honestly, pretty much everything about 1999 looks wild, from its new hub area - an abandoned 90s shopping mall full of artificial palm trees, arcade machines, and blaring infomercials - to its meaty new motorbike traversal across its urban open-world sprawl.
</p>

<p>
Then there's its new Syndicate, known as the Hex, consisting of six iconic Warframes in their original proto-forms - including grizzled squad leader Arthur Nightingale, batch designation: Excalibur. And if that's still not enough to convince you to get stuck in, how about the fact 1999 introduces a romance system so you can potential get a New Year's smooch if you play your cards right? Or that, yes, you get to kill a 90s boyband in space.
</p>
<p>
So yes, all this - and more! - will finally be available to Warframe players on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC starting today, 13th December.

There's a brand new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/turok">Turok</a> video game from Saber Interactive.
</p>
<p>
It's called Turok: Origins, and yes, Eurogamer readers, you know what that means. 
</p>
<p>
Turok: Oranges will be launching on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

<p>
Tonight's trailer, debuted during The Game Awards 2024, promised a "new evolution" of the veteran dinosaur-hunting franchise, which has been absent for many years. The last Turok game arrived in 2006 as something of a reboot for the series, six years after the last entry. 
</p>
<p>Now, eight years later, Saber Interactive is having another crack. Notably, this time around Turok: Origins will be a third-person game. Intrigued? There's no release date yet, but we'll update you with more when we have it.

            <p>
It's been six years since developer Ghost Town Games gave the world a sequel to its smash-hit culinary caper <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>, so you might very well be wondering what it's been up in the time since. Well, all is now revealed, with Ghost Town having unveiled its brand-new co-op adventure Stage Fright - which is being published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> studio Hello Games.
</p>
<p>
Hello Games' announcement describes Stage Fright as a mix of "Overcooked style chaotic moments [and] escape room style cooperation" that's designed for two players. It's playable either as a classic couch co-op adventure or by teaming up online.
</p>
<p>
There's not much to share in the way of specific gameplay details, but we do known Stage Fright takes place in a "magical and spooky" setting - "think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> meets Overcooked" - and that it promises a "really charming story" that's "touching, with a real heart".

<p>
"The codename of Stage Fright was Project Attic," Hello Games continues, "because [Ghost Town members] Phil, Oli, and Gemma have been in the attic at the top of their house working on this new game for the last five years, joined by a small team of talented contributors... They have so many stories of the joy Overcooked has brought to families and partners and friends (as well as near divorces). They really want to create more of those moments."
</p><p>
Hello Games says it'll be lending Ghost Town its behind the scenes experience and support as development continues. "But if we're honest," it adds, "it really appeals to us to have fun working with a bunch of creative people we just love spending time with."

            <p>
Capcom has revealed a new Onimusha game is in development.
</p>
<p>
Shown at tonight's The Game Awards, Onimusha: Way of the Sword is set to launch in 2026 - so there's quite a wait.
</p>
<p>
A short clip of gameplay was shown, which appears to eschew the Resident Evil-esque fixed perspectives of the first game for full 3D combat.

<p>
As for the story, it's unclear who the protagonist will be, though he does bear a resemblance to the first game's Samanosuke.
</p>
<p>
Still, there's a good glimpse at some bloody slicing and dicing, as he battles samurai zombies and collects those precious golden orbs. I just hope it can stand apart from the likes of Sekiro, Phantom Blade Zero, and the Nioh games.
</p>
<p>
The first Onimusha game was released on the PS2 in 2001, which was remastered in 2018 for Switch, PS4, and Xbox One (with a PC release a year later). 
</p>
<p>
That was the last release in the series, while the last new console game was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006. It's been a long wait for fans, then.
</p>
<p>
Still, will Capcom appease fans with a return to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a> next?
