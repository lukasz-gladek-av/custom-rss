            <p>Lara Croft's newest actress Alix Wilton Regan has promised she will honour every Lara that has come before with her portrayal of the legendary tomb raider.</p>
<p>At The Game Awards last year, Wilton Regan was announced to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lara-croft-actress-camilla-luddington-bids-farewell-to-tomb-raider-as-alix-wilton-regan-teases-were-just-getting-started">taking over the role of Lara Croft for Tomb Raider: Catalyst and Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis from Camilla Luddington</a>, who appeared in the recent Survivor trilogy.</p>

<p>While Luddington's Lara started the series as an inexperienced and somewhat naive adventurer, she soon grew into a gritty and more than capable killer. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2026-lara-croft-seems-to-be-returning-to-what-made-90s-tomb-raider-great-and-as-a-lifelong-fan-i-couldnt-be-more-excited">Lara from the original Tomb Raider games was for sure a force to be reckoned with</a>, but she also had a sassy confident attitude which immediately endeared fans. So, where will Wilton Regan's Lara land? Will she be familiar to long-term Tomb Raider fans, or will her Lara be something totally different? Well, she will be a mixture of both.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying that to be convoluted," Wilton Regan told the Press X to Continue podcast about her take on Lara Croft, stating she had to go through several rounds of auditions before landing the role. "I think it is genuinely a bit of both."</p><p>The Tomb Raider: Catalyst actress said the phrase she is working with for her portrayal is "no Laras left behind", which I personally love. "I like the idea of 'no Lara is left behind'," Wilton Regan continued. "I've looked at all of the performances. Obviously, I've got all the scripts, so I know where it's going, and, you know, I think all of the Lara's that have previously come before will also be informing as we move into a new era of Tomb Raider, I would say.</p>
<p>"I genuinely, I <em>genuinely</em> think that fans are going to love it… I want to insert a swear word. It's brilliant. I know what we are making, it's brilliant. Wherever you fall, whether it's the original, the remasters, the classics, the Survivor trilogy, wherever on that spectrum… you are going to love it."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">Tomb Raider: Catalyst is due to release next year</a>, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam. It will take Lara to Northern India, following a "mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened the mysterious forces that guard them".</p><p>Before that, though, we also have the remake of the first ever <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> arriving sometime this year. Legacy of Atlantis will place players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">back in the shoes of Lara Croft as she hops from country to country in search of the Scion of Atlantis</a>.</p>

            <p>I'd be lying if I said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> doesn't look (and sound) like one the coolest triple-A games coming out this year. With its post-delay <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/merry-christmas-james-bond-game-007-first-light-has-been-delayed">27th May release date</a> not far away now, marketing and developer chatter are ramping up, and now we've learned about the explicit influences that were added to all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman">Hitman</a> DNA we've able to discern in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s latest.</p>
<p>On 23th February, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-aims-to-channel-batman-arkham-freeflow-combat-with-uncharted-spectacle/1100-6538356/">GameSpot</a> shared juicy bits from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/007firstlight">Game Informer</a>'s recent interview with gameplay director Andreas Krogh, who admits the team looked at triple-A games "on the same scale" for inspiration. After all, even with a reboot, there's set of expectations around what a James Bond game should be, and IO's own style shouldn't get in the way of that if you ask me.</p>
<p>We already know many stealth and immersive sim elements from the recent Hitman trilogy, as well as spectacular and layered level design, have made their way into 007: First Light, but it's good to know IO looked at modern action-adventure classics for the more explosive sequences: "I think you see the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham games</a>, you see those games in it. You also see some modern takes on destructibility in the environment that are not necessarily from the Arkham games, but newer takes like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. We have a deeper system than that because we want to do more of it, and from shooting, you see references that are also from modern games," Krogh explained.</p>
<p>In any case, while some gameplay scenes will railroad players into big set pieces that would make renowned Hollywood action directors smile, the studio hasn't sacrificed the freedom of "choice" it's known for in most scenarios: "We want to set the player up to choose for himself. What kind of player are you? What kind of playstyle do you prefer? Play that way."</p><p>It won't be long before we check for ourselves if everything has come together beautifully, but with a mix of old and new, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-trailer-unveils-lenny-kravitzs-villainous-side">Lenny Kravitz on board as the villain</a>, it seems like IO's take on the property won't be retreading much old ground.</p>

            <p>Xbox's new leadership double-act Asha Sharma (CEO Microsoft Gaming) and Matt Booty (chief content officer Xbox) have stressed the importance of new Xbox gaming hardware to their vision going forward.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">Windows Central</a>, Sharma said: "I am committed to 'returning to Xbox', and that starts with console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon - we'll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here.</p>
<p>"We also know that there are a lot of players who aren't on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too. I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and I want a little bit of time and space to do that."</p>
<p>Matt Booty added: "Our studio system is fully built around being first-party. We're not built to just be a publisher. It is core to our partnership with the Microsoft platform, being involved in early hardware decisions - all the work we've done to get games like Gears of War running great on new devices like the Xbox Ally, and so on. It is embedded within our structure, we're not backing away from that. We're committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team."</p><p>Their comments come after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/future-of-xbox-vague-contradictory-phil-spencer-sarah-bond-asha-sharma-matt-booty">a wave of change unsettled the Xbox business and brand at the weekend</a>, with long-time Xbox figurehead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> retiring from Microsoft after nearly 40 years, and Sarah Bond, the former president of Xbox - presumed to be Spencer's replacement-in-waiting - suddenly departing as well.</p>
<blockquote><em>"This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again" - Asha Sharma</em></blockquote>
<p>Into the leadership void stepped Asha Sharma, a relative unknown to the gaming community, brought over from Microsoft's CoreAI division, and someone who boasts no gaming experience or apparent gaming passion of her own. Matt Booty is a much more known quantity, having led <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> since 2018, and Microsoft's first-party gaming output since 2023.</p>
<p>The suspicion surrounding Sharma's appointment is Microsoft is sunsetting Xbox and reorganising the company around AI - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-likening-new-xbox-heads-job-to-a-palliative-care-doctor-original-co-creator-doesnt-actually-think-xbox-is-dead">Seamus Blackley, the original co-creator of Xbox, was very vocal about</a>. But there are contrasting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">reports that claim Microsoft genuinely wants to reset the Xbox business</a> and turn it around. This "return of Xbox" is something Sharma talked about in her opening memo to staff, and it's something she elaborated on in the Windows Central interview.</p><p>Sharma said: "For me, the spirit of 'return to Xbox' is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on. It's that spirit of surprise, it's the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try - I've heard 'renegade', 'rebellion', and 'fun' used. That's what I was thinking about when I wrote that."</p>
<p>Reports have suggested that Sarah Bond was ousted because of the 'Xbox Anywhere' initiative, largely attributed to her, which hasn't really worked out. Regardless, it's an initiative Sharma will inherit, alongside things such as Game Pass and publishing on PlayStation that have become increasingly central to the Xbox division's core. What will Sharma do with them?</p>
<p>"Right now, I need to learn, candidly, about the 'why' of these decisions, what we were optimising for and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That's the honest answer," she said. "I'm looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan's the plan until it's not the plan."</p>
<p>Sharma also underlined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-head-of-gaming-has-no-tolerance-for-bad-ai-following-concerns-about-the-proliferation-of-ai-slop-and-sharmas-tech-background">her previously stated gen-AI stance</a> by restating that there are opportunities there but she won't allow this to devolve into okaying "slop". "I will not flood our ecosystem with slop," she said. "We won't have careless output, we won't have derivative work. I deeply believe in the words that I shared previously there."</p><p>Matt Booty had an additional remark to make on this, stating: "We've got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down. Our teams are free to use any technologies that might be beneficial, whether it's helping write code or check for bugs - things more in the production pipeline. At the end of the day as Asha said, we're committed to art made by people. Technology is only in support of that."</p>
<p>In closing, Sharma said she would try to "honour and uphold" the culture that Xbox Phil Spencer instilled - "a remarkable human and a remarkable leader" - when he took over Xbox in 2014. "We know that the business has gone through some challenges," she said. "I'm going to use my expertise and the leaders that have the deep gaming depth around the table to help us grow the business, and make sure that we have an incredible next 25 years.</p>
<p>"I will listen, I will learn, I will communicate what we're seeing, and what we're doing. I think from here, the work is proof over promise. Matt and I are in it, every hour of every day of every night; I am fully in this thing. This team has brought it back before, and I'm here to help us do it again."</p>
