After earning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-off-to-strong-start-reportedly-earns-12m-in-four-days">$12m in its first four days</a>, Pok√©mon TCG Pocket has now passed 30m downloads after a week.
</p>
<p>
The smash-hit digital version of Pok√©mon's trading card game is off to a strong start, then - and at this pace looks set to hit 50m downloads faster than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a> did back in 2016. Pok√©mon Go went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-has-now-been-downloaded-1bn-times">rack up 500m downloads in its first three months</a>, climbing to 1bn downloads by August 2019.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket is heavily built around the opening of trading card game packs</a>, something the game's own social media account nodded to when sharing today's news.
</p>
<p>
"T-t-t-thirty million?! How many packs have been opened, then?" the game's social media account wrote on X. Sadly, it did not provide an answer.
</p>
<p>
"On behalf of everyone working on the game and me, thank you for all your support! Seriously. If you haven't downloaded it, try it and let us know what you think."

Nvidia has announced its GeForce Now cloud gaming service will soon introduce a playtime cap of 100 hours a month for paying Performance (previously Priority) and Ultimate subscribers, although additional hours can be purchased for a fee.
</p>
<p>
Nividia shared the news <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/">on Reddit</a>, saying the limit would help it "continue providing exceptional quality and speed - as well as shorter queue times". It also insisted the switch from an unlimited allowance would "comfortably accommodate 94 percent of members".
</p>
<p>
Paying subscribers wanting to use GeForce Now for more than the allotted 100 hours per month - equating to approximately three hours per day - will now need to pay extra, with 15 additional hours costing $2.99 USD for Performance members and $5.99 for anyone subscribed to its Ultimate tier. Up to 15 unused hours will automatically roll over into the next month.

<p>
Nvidia's new restrictions come into affect at the start of 2025, but all existing subscribers - as well as anyone signing up before 31st December this year - will continue to get unlimited playtime until January 2026. The company also notes anyone currently subscribed to GeForce Now's Founders tier will retain their unlimited playtime hours for life, provided there's no lapse in their membership. Changing to an Ultimate subscription, however, will immediately apply the new terms, imposing the 100-hour monthly play limit from January 2026.
</p><p>
In addition to its playtime limitations, Nvidia has announced a number of new GeForce Now benefits. Subscribers to the newly renamed Performance tier will soon be able to stream in 1440p instead of the previous 1080p, and ultrawide resolutions will also be supported. Furthermore, all Performance and Ultimate subscribers will be able to save their in-game graphics settings across streaming sessions.

            <p>
InZoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton, is absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> - to the point a lot of life sim fans are very excited indeed. So the good news is it now has a release date; the bad news is it's been delayed into next year to give it a "stronger foundation".
</p>
<p>
InZoi, which promises a "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will", was initially announced last year, when it was expected to launch for PC sometime in "Q4" this year. Now, however, Krafton has revised that release, confirming Inzoi will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">launching into Steam early access</a> on 28th March next year.
</p>
<p>
In a message announcing the news, InZoi director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim explained the decision to delay the game had been made after reviewing feedback and "analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests". He added the revised release will give the studio time to "improve areas that need attention" and "create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation".

<p>
"It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," Kim continued. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZoi ‚Äî a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZoi a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible."
</p><p>
Players did, of course, get a bit of a look at InZoi back in August, when Krafton briefly released its impressively flexible character creator on Steam. During its five days of availability, the demo saw a peak of over 18K players, one of them being Eurogamer's own Jessica Orr, who shared a little of her character creating adventures right here.
</p>
<p>
"Visually, [the demo is] stunning," she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-old-brands-revitalised-ageing-classics-and-cursed-character-creators">wrote</a>. "It's a little unbelievable how good it looks, actually, even on lower graphical settings. The customisation goes deep too. It's got all the usual bells and whistles, and even a few chimes to boot, as we're treated to entire categories for things like fake nails... Personality customisation doesn't go as deep, from what I can tell in the demo, but it's nice to see inclusive gender and sexuality options there already."
</p>
<p>
InZoi is just one of several Sims-like that have surfaced in recent years. Paradox Interactive's Life by You has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">now been cancelled</a>, but that still leaves the highly anticipated Paralives, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">scheduled to launch into early access sometime next year</a>, and if you fancy something a little more lo-fi, you can also play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490/Tiny_Life/">adorably retro - but still surprisingly robust - Tiny Life</a> on Steam.
