</span></p><p>"We're so thankful for your sold-out interest in TennoCon 2025!" <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/warframe.com/post/3lhmjux6mqk2d">the team said on Bluesky</a> shortly after the tickets were snapped up. "As we provide advance notice of ticket availability, this can result in a longer queue than the number of tickets."</p>
<p>Fans not lucky enough to get a physical ticket this time around, however, can still participate via the virtual experience on 19th July.</p>
<p>"Our team is still hard at work to bring you an incredible virtual experience on July 19, as well as our upcoming TennoCon 2025 Digital Pack and more! We hope to see you all online for a very special day and can't wait to share what we've been working on."</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also gently reminded players that tickets are nontransferable and it "diligently validates tickets at every TennoCon".</p>

            <p>Remember when we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix was hiking prices again, but most of Europe had escaped</a>? Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/07/netflix-increase-uk-subscription-prices-despite-record-audience">The Guardian</a>, the streaming giant has now confirmed above-inflation price rises for UK subscribers, with its most popular non-ad-supported subscription increasing by £2 to £13 - that's an 18 percent hike - and its most expensive tier rising £1 to £19 a month.</p>

<p>Even the cheapest tier, which includes advertisements, has also increased by a pound to £6 per month. It now also costs an additional £1 to add an extra member to a package.</p>
<p>"We will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improve Netflix," the company said, saying the increased fees help the firm "continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members".</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us at the time, the news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter. And it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025, too.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-crys-animated-netflix-series-gets-april-release-date-and-a-limp-bizkit-opener">Netflix's animated adaptation of Devil May Cry is almost upon us</a>. The streaming service has announced the series premieres on 3rd April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
