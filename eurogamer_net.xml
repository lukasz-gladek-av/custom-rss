        <p>"I couldn't be prouder of what [the team has] managed to achieve," Murray tells Eurogamer.</p>

            <p>
We've all heard the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> story by now: controversial launch followed by, as commenters often put it, the greatest redemption arc in the history of gaming. Somewhat remarkably, developer Hello Games' exploratory space sim has now received almost forty major updates since its launch in 2016, all helping No Man's Sky turn its initial "Overwhelmingly Negative" rating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eight-years-after-its-rocky-launch-no-mans-sky-finally-hits-very-positive-reviews-on-steam">into "Very Positive" on Steam</a>. But earlier this week, shortly after the arrival of its Voyagers update, No Man's Sky hit another incredible milestone, reaching its highest Steam player count since its launch nine years ago.
</p>
<p>
Following a peak of 212K Steam players on its initial release (as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/#max">per SteamDB</a>), No Man's Sky's numbers gradually sunk to a low of around 1K by March 2018. But just a few months later, buoyed on by its massive Next update, the game saw its highest Steam player count since 2016, peaking at 97,723. Subsequent releases have continued to increase interest in the procedural space sim, but none have been as enthusiastically received as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-adds-fully-customisable-multi-crew-spaceships-you-can-build-and-fly-with-your-friends">last week's Voyagers update</a>. Player numbers climbed quickly after its arrival, until Monday when, with much of the US off work for Labour Day, they finally reached their highest point since August 2016, with 98,285 Steam players exploring the universe concurrently. It was an impressive moment - especially for a game that's ten next year.

Hello Games boss Sean Murray <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1962598264387108899">celebrated the occasion on social media</a> with his customary exploding head emoji, but has now discussed No Man's Sky's recent success in more detail with Eurogamer. "Most of the time you are working on a game or an update, and you have no idea how it'll be received," Murray explained. "Often during development you lose perspective, and you can't see the wood for the trees. With Voyagers though, even from the earliest days it was obvious there was something really special about just flying around in a ship you built with your friends. It's just something that we've all seen glimpses of in other games, but there's a certain magic about exploring the universe in your own USS Enterprise or Millennium Falcon."
</p><p>
"It has also been one of the hardest things our team has undertaken," Murray continued. "We are still a small team, and this has been a really ambitious feature to add to a game that was released nearly a decade ago. Over the last year we were never fully sure if we could pull it off. I know my name is associated with No Man's Sky, but really it's the team - I couldn't be prouder of what they've managed to achieve. I'm so happy that it's getting the reaction that it has. Many of us have worked on this game for years, or were here for launch - and I genuinely feel the team really deserve this, they've earned it."

<p>
Voyagers is No Man's Sky's 38th major update and heralds the arrival of fully customisable Corvette-class ships. While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-orbital-update-overhauls-space-stations-today">last year's Orbital update</a> introduced a spaceship editor, providing the tools to construct standard-scale vessels for solo occupants, Voyagers takes things to a whole new level. Corvettes allow for an impressive degree of design flexibility, giving players the means to create elaborate - and potentially huge - multi-crew ships, featuring navigable multi-level interiors built from a range of differently themed parts. These can then be further embellished by bolting functional systems and cosmetic components to the exterior for complete personalisation. 
</p>
<p>
About the only wrinkle to all this is the slightly convoluted way parts are acquired in standard mode, meaning it's not quite as simple as dropping into a hangar and designing your dream ship. But that hasn't stopped No Man's Sky players (some using Creative Mode, admittedly) from whipping up a range of incredibly striking Corvettes already. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/">the game's wonderfully chill subreddit</a>, there's evidence of everything from the virtually inevitable - Millennium Falcons, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n73rgn/corvette_star_destroyerish_build/">Star Destroyers</a>, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n7bs9y/bringing_back_the_classics_corvette_style_no/">TARDIS</a> - to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n48azw/space_pirate_time/">space galleons</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n69fmc/my_masterpiece_corvette_the_capitol/">elaborate floating cities</a>, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n3hacg/flew_to_gotham_jacked_some_guy_in_a_gimp_suit/">Batmobile</a>, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n4wxi7/i_finally_created_my_dream_ship_the_10497/">classic Lego Space Explorer</a>, even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n4ec82/no_mans_discish/">Discword itself</a>, drifting through the universe on four turtle-mounted almost-elephants.

Things, as you might imagine, get weirder from there. Behold, for instance, this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n61y8j/behold_the_most_indestructible_ship_in_nms_history/">old-school Nokia phone</a>, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n6a31n/made_a_forklift_corvette_lmao/">forklift truck</a>, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n4inbr/_/">no doubt delicious space-hotdog</a>. Elsewhere, someone's whipped up a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n392wb/the_homer_using_light_boxes/">suprisingly majestic Homer Simpson</a>, and <em>of course</em> we <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n71xhw/we_spent_so_long_wondering_if_we_could_we_never/">have a Thomas the Tank Engine</a>. Murray himself shared a fan's <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1962866703399821490">Formula 1 space-racer</a>, and I'm particulalry partial to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmcrRQCy0DU">pilotable tropical island</a>, which is virtually unrecognisable as a ship when parked in water. My Corvette design efforts look a little tragic by comparison!

But back to Murray and the team at Hello Games. "It's been a crazy twelve months for us," he continued to Eurogamer. "We've launched Worlds Part I and Part II, as well as Voyagers in that time. All huge updates that have really changed No Man's Sky inside and out. Meanwhile Light No Fire is incredibly busy behind the scenes. It's exciting and fun, I've never worked on a team that is this productive and creative. There's a buzz to it day to day, but it's also hard work. We're deep in the trenches right now, fixing issues and fighting fires. And god, it's been a long journey! So these moments, seeing so many folks enjoying the game, seeing us hit big numbers, it's really meaningful. We don't take it for granted. It's the most important thing to us."

            <p>Gameplay footage for the cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prey-2">Prey 2</a> has emerged online over a decade since the games cancellation. The gameplay has been suddenly uploaded onto an otherwise desolate YouTube channel called "David Halsted".</p>
<p>Gameplay footage uploaded includes a playthrough of the demo, the game's opening, a flythrough of the Undercity, a chase prototype and a combat segment titled "agile combat" which shows a gunfight in-action.</p>
<p>Prey 2 was in development back in the 2010's by Human Head under Bethesda, though work on the game stopped in 2011 with the game close to an alpha state according to Human Head co-founder Chris Rhinehart.</p>

<p>After a bizarre situation where development shifted away from Human Head and some reported contractual shenanigans, the game was officially cancelled in 2014. This came via <a href="http://www.gamerheadlines.com/2014/10/prey-2-officially-cancelled-bethesda/">a statement by Pete Hines who stated</a>: "It was a game we believed in, but we never felt that it got to where it needed to be…"</p><p>Many of those original Human Head developers would then get swallowed up by Zenimax Online Studios, developers of The Elder Scrolls Online. Earlier this year,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report"> plenty of these industry veterans would be unceremoniously laid off in Microsoft cuts</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">cancelling a new Sci-Fi RPG</a> Blackbird that <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/canceled-xbox-mmo-project-blackbird">reportedly had a few nods to Prey 2</a>.</p>
