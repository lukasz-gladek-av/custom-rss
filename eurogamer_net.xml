            <p>Ninja Theory's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a> sequel is heading to PS5 this summer as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a> Enhanced Edition.</p>
<p>The previously Xbox console-exclusive is celebrating its one year anniversary, so will now come to Sony's console with new features and haptic feedback implementation. Those new features will also be added in a free update to the Xbox and PC versions of the game.</p>
<p>"We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword," said studio head Dom Matthews in a video shared on social media. "And we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans back to Senua's story."</p>

<p>The first Hellblade, Senua's Sacrifice, was released in 2017 across PS4 and PC, followed by an Xbox One release in 2018 and Switch in 2019.</p>
<p>Ninja Theory was then acquired in 2018 by Microsoft, hence the sequel skipped Sony's console - until now.</p>

            <p>A Skibidi Toilet adaptation from Michael Bay is officially in production.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skibidi-toilet-made-using-half-life-2-assets-reportedly-in-talks-for-michael-bay-movie">project was first floated last year</a>, when it was reported there had been talks to launch a Skibidi Toilet film and TV franchise, with The Rock and Armageddon director attached. It left me scratching my head a bit, to be honest.</p>

<p>But fast forward to today, and those talks are now firmed up, with the news that yes, we are indeed going to be getting a Skibidi Toilet adaptation from Michael Bay.</p>
<p>Media Company Invisible Narratives - of which Bay serves as a chief creative advisor - will be producing, developing, and financing the project. You can see an image of its Skibidi Toilet project on the <a href="https://www.invisiblenarratives.com/">company's website</a> (or you can look at the screenshot I took below).</p>
<p>Bay along with partner Jeffrey Beecroft have reportedly been working on their Skibidi Toilet project since last summer, with a <a href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/michael-bay-skibidi-toilet-film/">press release stating</a> it is "an early creative take on the franchise", which will bring "Bay's signature visual intensity to one of the internet's most unlikely breakout IPs".</p>

<p>Skibidi Toilet, for those still mercifully unaware, is an enormously-popular online animation series made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> and Counter-Strike. It features a race of evil toilets with human heads, and has clocked up a whopping 65bn views on YouTube, another 15bn on Tiktok, and is ubiquitous on Roblox, where countless spin-off games lie.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in adaptation news, yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clash-of-clans-latest-video-game-to-get-the-netflix-animated-treatment">Netflix announced it was gearing up to release a Clash of Clans animated series</a>, which will feature a "determined but in-over-his-head Barbarian who must rally a band of misfits to defend their village and navigate the comically absurd politics of war".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
