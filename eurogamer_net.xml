            <p>Awesome Games Done Quickly has "come to a thrilling close", securing an incredible $2,556,305 - that's £2.1m - for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>
<p>The week-long fundraiser wrapped up last night with a speedrun of Super Metroid after attracting over 2000 in-person attendees and "tens of thousands" of viewers on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.</p>

<p>Speedrunners came from all over the world to "race through a bevy of games new and old", often with "zany incentives and challenges to drive donations", including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4AomNJHzHk">full-blown live concert</a> during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Dr. Doot playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> with a saxophone as a controller - which is embedded above - and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmrIvD1UNFI">an opera performance by trained singer Xem</a> after completing his <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>: Going Commando run. </p>
<p>You can also see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuaWJ-40hFY">FunkopotamusWes’s playthrough of New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a> using his head and feet via motion controls while playing piano.</p>
<p>Since 2010, Games Done Quick has raised more than $54 million (£44.2m) for charities worldwide, including Doctors Without Borders, Malala Fund, Organization for Autism Research, and more.</p>
<p>Next up is Back to Black, the first all-Black speedrunning charity event, which will run 6th-9th February and benefit racial justice nonprofit Race Forward. Summer Games Done Quick returns to Minneapolis, Minnesota to raise funds for Doctors Without Borders in July.</p>
<p>This time last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-the-moment-peanut-butter-becomes-the-first-dog-speedrunner-in-agdq-2024">Shiba Inu Peanut Butter became the first dog to speedrun a game during Awesome Games Done Quick</a>.</p>
<p>Peanut Butter speedran Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES, in 26 minutes and 24 seconds, which is around a minute slower than his own world record, but well within the 30-minute slot he'd been allocated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Four and a half years after it was announced, EA's free-to-play skate sim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate">Skate</a>, is finally ready for playtesting on consoles.</p>
<p>Early adopters who signed up to Skate's early access Insider programme are now receiving invitations to get involved in the playtest and "help shape the future of the game".</p>

<p>Worry not if you've yet to be selected - the team is "invit[ing] new players who are registered as we go" and still actively recruiting testers, so if you'd like to give it a go, head on over to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">official website</a> and express your interest.</p><div>

<p>When developer Full Circle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">first began sharing details</a> of its new Skate project - which is officially known as Skate, rather than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-4">Skate 4</a> - back in 2022, the studio explained it wasn't "a sequel", nor "a remake, a reboot, [or] a prequel". Instead, it was described as an "authentic evolution" of the series intended to reflect "where skateboarding and gaming is in the real world".</p>
<p>Skate will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, PC (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-stake-is-coming-to-pc-via-steam">including Steam</a>), and mobile devices when it releases in early access later this year - some 15 years after the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-3">Skate 3</a>. It will also boast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
