            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> is "not rewarding enough", developer Grinding Gear Games has admitted, amid a plan to "urgently" update the game.</p>
<p>An extensive post on the game's community forum details a number of changes based on feedback from the game's launch weekend last week. Some changes have already been implemented, while others will be deployed in a future patch.</p>
<p>"There are lots more things coming," reads the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">post</a>. "The list in this post are some of the things we felt needed to be more urgently addressed."</p>

<p>A major sticking point is that the game is "not rewarding enough", with a plan to alter items, rare monsters, currency, and map mods.</p>
<p>"This is an area that we have to be very careful when adjusting because it's very hard to reduce drops if we increase them by too much," said the developer.</p>
<p>The rewards given for defeating rare monsters have been boosted, which should improve the endgame. Specifically, the rarity bonus per rare mod has been doubled, the quantity bonus per rare mod has increased by 10 percent, and there's an increased chance of rare monsters inherently having more modifiers.</p>
<p>"These changes will cause rare monster rewards to naturally scale up as you get to higher levels because the number of mods a monster can have increases throughout the campaign and into endgame," the post reads.</p>
<p>Further, the drop rates of various currencies have been raised, while the rewards for the added difficulty of map mods have been "significantly increased".</p>
<p>Other changes to Path of Exile 2 include: an improvement to dodging to prevent players becoming trapped as often; new checkpoints have been added to prevent retreading old ground; the 'Move Only' command no longer namelocks to prevent characters attacking in the wrong direction; and rare monsters will appear on the minimap more easily to boost endgame progression.</p>
<p>The full list of changes can be viewed on the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705">Path of Exile 2 forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-movie-actor-who-leaked-role-in-first-film-hasnt-heard-anything-about-returning-for-sequel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
An actor who leaked his obscure role in Nintendo's then-top-secret Super Mario Bros. Movie has said he's yet to hear whether he's coming back for the sequel. 
</p>
<p>
Actor and comedian Sebastian Maniscalco played Mario's foreman boss Spike in the Super Mario Bros. Movie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-animated-movie-actor-lets-slip-his-obscure-role">a fact he let slip more than a year before the film was released</a>, before Nintendo had shown anything of the project publicly.
</p>
<p>
The random announcement by Maniscalco - and the deep cut nature of the character's inclusion (Spike appeared in NES game Wrecking Crew back in 1985, and little else since) made headlines. Perhaps Nintendo is keen to keep things more tight-lipped this time around?
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Maniscalco says he doesn't rate his chances for a return in the Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel - though not because of his previous statements. Instead, he says, it's because there's yet to be a stuffed toy of him.
</p><p>
"We went to Universal Studios and they had a Super Mario store with all the merchandise," Maniscalco recently told <a href="https://screenrant.com/super-mario-bros-movie-2-foreman-spike-return-sebastian-maniscalco-response/">ScreenRant</a>. "I was with my kids, I go, 'Guys, come on. I'm going to show you daddy's character in a stuffed animal.' No Spike, no nothing. It stopped at me. It was every other character, and then me, I have no animal, no stuffy, no nothing. 
</p>
<p>
"So, the fact that I didn't have a stuffed animal is not giving me a lot of confidence that I'm coming back for the sequel," he continued. "I haven't heard anything, so your guess is as good as mine."
</p>
<p>
Spike could easily be featured in a sequel should Nintendo want to. After all, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-post-credit-scene-hints-at-potential-sequel-chris-pratt-says">post-credits teaser was set back in Mario and Luigi's native Brooklyn</a>, where Spike lived. 
</p>
<p>
But, as yet, Nintendo is still to say exactly what its plans for the next Mario movie are. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">Due to launch in April 2026</a>, rumours abound that the sequel will focus on Donkey Kong this time around - although, as Eurogamer previously rounded up, there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-the-mario-movie-series-may-go-next">plenty of dangling plot threads from the Super Mario Bros. Movie which could point to sequels</a>.

            <p>First-person puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-talos-principle">The Talos Principle</a> is set to receive a "radically overhauled reawakening" in a new, definitive edition.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle: Reawakened, as it's suitably known, will feature an all-new chapter as well as visual and quality of life improvements courtesy of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>It's coming in early 2025 to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, once again courtesy of developer Croteam and publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a>. Check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The original game's DLC Road To Gehenna will be included, while the new chapter In The Beginning will expand the narrative with an origin story.</p>
<p>A new level editor will also be added, aimed at the modding community, though this will only be in the PC version.</p>
<p>Developer commentary, meanwhile, will provide a behind the scenes look at development.</p>
<p>The game will follow last year's sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-talos-principle-2">The Talos Principle 2</a>: "an ambitious sequel that explores bold, if unambiguous territory in its philosophical robot puzzling", according to our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-talos-principle-2-review-a-thought-experiment-to-puzzle-over">Eurogamer review</a>.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle was first released in 2014 on PC, with multiple console versions following. It received critical acclaim for its challenging puzzles and philosophical musings.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
CD Projekt originally planned for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> to briefly visit Night City from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, years before the latter launched.
</p>
<p>
The idea has been discussed by the developer before, but an impressive datamining project has now uncovered the work-in-progress script for the scene, which would have seen Geralt and Avallac'h turn up in CD Projekt's future setting - and not be overly impressed by what they found.
</p>
<p>
This moment would have come as part of The Witcher 3's Through Time and Space questline, and acted as an Easter egg for fans hoping to get a glimpse at what CD Projekt was building next.

<p>
As found by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/witcher-3-modders-just-upended-everything-we-know-about-how-it-was-made-with-a-584-page-breakdown-of-an-early-prototype-that-had-a-150-hour-main-quest-all-thanks-to-a-database-containing-almost-every-single-line-of-text-from-its-development/">What Lies Unseen</a>, and highlighted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/witcher-3-modders-datamine-a-quest-where-geralt-would-have-teleported-to-night-city-from-cyberpunk-2077-technologically-advanced-but-broken-dying/">PC Gamer</a>, the script for the sequence - as it was back around 2012, three years before the final version of The Witcher 3 launched - would have been as follows:
</p>
<p><code>Geralt: What... What is this place? Is this the afterlife?<br>
Avallac'h: No. Just another of the realities the Spiral leads through... Technologically advanced, but broken. Dying.<br>
Geralt: Disgusting. This stench, noise... How can you live here?!<br>
Avallac'h: You should know better. This world is inhabited by humans, not elves.<br></code></p><p>
Insight from What Lies Unseen includes that CD Projekt also planned to have Geralt toss a coin to a begger who would then turn up in Cyberpunk 2077, rich from your Novigrad gold.
</p>
<p>
In the end, Through Time and Space remained in The Witcher 3 - albeit with different sequences that saw Geralt pingpong between the Ddiddiwedht Desert, a poisoned valley, an underwater section and an icy tundra. Less exciting.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, now Cyberpunk 2077 is out, this idea might be easier to make happen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>? CD Projekt recently confirmed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">next project has entered "full production"</a>, and Eurogamer recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">the technical ambition, optimism, and timeframes the developer is working to for it</a>. Perhaps that could look forward to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
