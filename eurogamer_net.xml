Two Point Museum is set to receive a free update next week adding digital exhibits.
</p>
<p>
Two Point's latest management game has players discovering a variety of exhibits to add to their museums, from prehistory to marine life and science. 
</p>
<p>
From 28th August, players will be able to take on expeditions in The Digiverse to add exhibits based on Meat Wizard, Two Point County's in-game video game spoof. The studio has even hinted at a dark secret in the games.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> has brought back the secret Guy Savage mode within the remake. But it turns out this mode wasn't made by Konami alone - Platinum Games (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, Astral Chain) is responsible for the surprise action minigame.</p>
<p>The Guy Savage mode can be played by saving the game and exiting to the menu directly after the torture scene deep into the game. When you re-launch the game, the Guy Savage minigame will start. Alternatively, beat the game and the minigame will be accessible.</p>
<p>Guy Savage was originally based on a <a href="https://x.com/Arc_Hound/status/1054458915851788289">cancelled prototype for Zone of the Enders 3 / Anubis 2</a> which was snuck into the original Metal Gear Solid 3. In Delta, <em>every</em> little Easter egg and trick has been recreated. The same goes for minigames, with Snake vs Monkey coming back (with a surprise appearance from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>).</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an incredibly faithful recreation of the original game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">Eurogamer's review states</a>: "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is faithful, it's a church dedicated to one of gaming's best stealth games. Updates to how the game plays are subtle, and in regard to the new gameplay style, totally optional. So much is left untouched, and that's for the best. Add in some original art, some obscure modes, and let her loose."</p>

            <p>
If I had to make a list of the things in life I have absolutely no interest in, trucks would be pretty near the top. And yet, I am <em>obsessed</em> with developer SCS Software's Truck Simulator series of games. And so, following the news both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are at long last making their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, I'm here to convince you their soothing expanses of endless virtual highway might also be for you, even if you don't know your backhaul from your bill of lading.
</p>
<p>
The downside to this whole not-being-into-trucks thing is, of course, that I'm a terrible guide through the series if you're here for proper hobbyist reasons, so apologies in advance. For me, though, the appeal is not so much the allure of a Hopper Body and the promise of a lubricated Glad Hand, as it is the pure ASMR pleasures of hours spent in empty minded tranquility with naught for company but the swoosh of scenic vistas, the tick of an indicator, the quiet hum of an air-conditioned cabin, and the lulling rumble of rubber on road.
</p>
<p>
I'm being a little reductive, admittedly. Well, a lot actually. Even without delving deep into the Truck Simulator games' more specialist particulars, there's a lot to love. There's the fundamental progression system that sees you doing odd jobs in loaned trucks and then scrambling up the XP tree to unlock new missions, or stockpiling enough cash that you're able to buy your own truck, even start your own business with your own HQ. It's not necessarily a particularly flashy package, but its basic structure is sound enough that it provides an additional layer of focus to your life on the open road. Chuck in the kind of cabin customisation that lets you scatter tatty souvenirs and pizza boxes around the place (honestly, I love this kind of nonsense), occasional community events, and a multiplayer mode enabling up to eight friends to form a convoy - a wonderfully, surprisingly hilarious recipe for chaos with the right (or wrong, depending on your perspective) people - and it's brilliantly compelling, even if you don't give a truck about trailers and the like.

<figcaption>ATS and ETS 2 are coming to consoles.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frPwmR2MEVs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As for the different flavours of sim coming to Xbox and PlayStation, both - if you're not already aware - are fundamentally the same experience, just with a very obvious change of scenery between them. Personally, I'm far more partial to the big skies and breathtaking wilderness of American Truck Simulator than its European counterpart (the sheer uncanny weirdness of ETS2's deeply unconvincing UK expansion was a bit of a turn-off when I tried it a fair few years back), but your mileage - no pun intended - will almost certainly vary.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/08/in-case-you-missed-it-future-games-show.html">SCS' Truck Simulator console announcement</a> is almost completely devoid of specifics, so pretty much all we can say with certainty right now is that ATS and ETS 2 are on the way. I'd assume both will be pretty close to their PC counterparts (minus, perhaps, extended peripheral support and mod availability), especially after all the work SCS has done to improve controller support and upgrade the interface over time. It will, though, be interesting to see how the studio handles the games' years of paid cosmetic, truck, and map expansion DLC. A couple of free packs-ins to help consoles catch up? Starter bundles? Nothing of the sort? Time will reveal all.
</p>
<p>
So there you go; American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are finally making their way to Xbox Series X/S and PS5. And if the thought of the open road and an endless shifting horizon stirs even the faintest twinge of latent yearning, you'd do well to lean in. You too might discover a love for a virtual four-wheeled life of adventure hitherto unknown.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>'s eighteenth season launches next week and is bringing a Persona 5 crossover alongside a brand new hero.
</p>
<p>
The trailer for Season 18 ends with a tease of Joker from Atlus' beloved JRPG, who will likely appear as a skin for an existing hero. No further details are known at present, but hopefully more character skins and references will make their way into Blizzard's shooter.
</p>
<p>
The new hero joining this season is Wuyang, a Chinese "aquatic prodigy" who fights with a Xuanwu Staff and various water abilities as a support character.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> studio Team Cherry already has plans for DLC, with extra content planned in the months and years to come.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">release date was announced for the sequel</a> after seven years in development. Co-founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen spoke to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> about creating Silksong, and what's coming next.
</p>
<p>
"Launching it is obviously quite exciting," said Pellen. "What comes after for us is equally as exciting."

<p>
"The most interesting thing now is what can we add to it next," added Gibson. "We got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."
</p>
<p>
Despite its lengthy development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">Silksong hasn't been in development hell</a>. Instead, hype for the sequel snowballed, resulting in sales of the original game skyrocketing. In turn, this provided the financial freedom for Team Cherry to take its time.
</p>
<p>
Hollow Knight Silksong will be released on 4th September, across PC, Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass).
