            <p>
Apple has been hit by a €500m (£429m) fine from the European Union for violations of its Digital Markets Act (DMA) - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games, which has been warring with the iPhone manufacturer amidst the rollout of its own app store, has been quick to respond.
</p>
<p>
Today, both Apple and Facebook owner Meta have been handed the first major penalties to come from the DMA. Apple has been slapped for App Store practices. Meanwhile, Meta must pay €200m (£172m) over its advertising policies.
</p>
<p>
Issues with Apple's App Store centre on the company's policy of not allowing iPhone and iPad apps to mention or link to alternative storefronts or offers elsewhere - meaning customers are directed to spend solely via the App Store, where Apple takes its 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
This was a key issue behind Epic Games' original beef with the iPhone maker, when it launched the first strike in its now years-long war with both Apple and Google by slipping cheaper, direct payments into Fortnite (and swiftly getting booted from the App Store and Google Play as a result).
</p>
<p>
Apple has always argued that its baked-in storefront was the most secure option for users, and that opening up its systems to alternatives posed risks to itself and to customers. The company has said today it will appeal the decision.
</p>
<p>
"Under the DMA, app developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases," <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085">the European Commission wrote today</a>, announcing its verdict.
</p>
<p>
"The Commission found that Apple fails to comply with this obligation. Due to a number of restrictions imposed by Apple, app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. Similarly, consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers. The company has failed to demonstrate that these restrictions are objectively necessary and proportionate."
</p>
<p>
On top of its fine, Apple has now been ordered to "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future" within 60 days, or risk further fines.
</p>
<p>
And there's further bad news today for Apple as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1086">European Commission has issued its preliminary findings on the company's "user choice obligations", as well as its controversial Core Technology Fee</a> - essentially a tax on major app store developers who choose to publish their games on alternative iPhone storefronts in regions (such as the EU) where Apple has been compelled to allow them.
</p>
<p>
"The Commission takes the preliminary view that Apple failed to comply with this obligation in view of the conditions it imposes on app (and app store) developers," it wrote. "Developers wanting to use alternative app distribution channels on iOS are disincentivised from doing so as this requires them to opt for business terms which include a new fee (Apple's Core Technology Fee). 
</p>
<p>
"Apple also introduced overly strict eligibility requirements, hampering developers' ability to distribute their apps through alternative channels. Finally, Apple makes it overly burdensome and confusing for end users to install apps when using such alternative app distribution channels."
</p>
<p>
These findings have now been passed to Apple, before further action is taken. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Apple for comment. 
</p>
<p>
"Apple is breaking the law by imposing illegal fees, scare screens and restrictions on purchases made outside the App Store," <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-is-breaking-the-law-by-charging-fees-for-steering-imposing-restrictions-on-third-party-stores?sessionInvalidated=true">Epic Games said in a statement today</a>, meanwhile. "Apple's pattern of malicious compliance must end the following technical and commercial restrictions: 
</p>
<p>
"Apple must allow apps downloaded from the App Store to steer customers to third party stores. Apple must not charge any fees on purchases that are made outside of an app. Apple must eliminate restrictions on the language, style and flow that developers can use to link to their website or to access an alternative payment system. In simple words: Apple must end the scare screens they pop up in front of Epic Games Store to deter customers from doing business with us.
</p>
<p>
"Apple must not track, surveil, or require developers to send Apple data about purchases that consumers make outside apps. Apple must allow developers to advertise lower prices and communicate directly with their customers."
</p>
<p>Back in January, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-set-to-pile-pressure-on-apple-and-google-app-store-dominance-as-fresh-investigation-launched">UK's Competition and Markets Authority announced a similar investigation into both Apple and Google,</a> backed by fresh powers granted under the recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> team has announced the release date for its highly anticipated sequel.</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch on Playstation 5 later this year, on 2nd October.</p>

<p>"It's been nearly five years since we shipped <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and in that time we’ve been hard at work making Ghost of Yōtei something special," wrote Sucker Punch's Andrew Goldfarb, announcing today's release date news. </p>
<p>"While the stories are unrelated, it's important to us to make this a worthy follow-up to Jin's journey, and we can't wait for you to experience Atsu's quest for vengeance later this year."</p>
<p>The studio also released a new trailer for Ghost of Yōtei, which you can check out below.</p>
<p>This trailer gives us more insight into Atsu's aforementioned quest for vengeance. We already knew she was seeking revenge for her ravaged home and family life, but now we know just <em>who </em>it is she is hunting down - that would be a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived. She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito," Sucker Punch teases.</p>

<p>Today's trailer is but a small taste of what players can expect on Ghost of Yōtei's release, the developer added. Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for Ghost of Tsushima often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so this remark is in keeping with the studio's overall plan for the sequel.</p>
<p>Those interested in pre-ordering Ghost of Yōtei will be able to do so from next week, with those pre-orders starting on 2nd May (how is it May next week?!). As is the case with many releases these days, there will be a number of different editions to choose from. </p>
<p>Regardless of which edition you plump for, those who do pre-order will receive a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yōtei Six (see below).
</p>

<p>Anyway, onto those editions, and what they include. The standard edition of Ghost of Yōtei which includes the game (obviously) will retail for £69.99 / €79.99. This edition will be available at certain retailers or via the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition of Ghost of Yōtei will also be available for  £79.99 / €89.99. This chap will have the game itself, as well as some bonuses such as The Snake's armor set, as well as an alternate dye for your starting armour. </p>
<p>
Ghost of Yōtei's  Digital Deluxe Edition will also come with a unique horse color and unique saddle dye, as well as an in-game Charm, gold Sword Kit, and an early unlock of Traveler’s Maps. These will help you find statues throughout the world, which in turn will be useful for upgrading your skills.

<p>Lastly, Sucker Punch is releasing a Ghost of Yōtei Collector's Edition. The developer is yet to announce pricing for this edition, but we do know what it will include.</p>
<p>Those who opt for Ghost of Yōtei Collector's Edition will get:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the pre-order bonuses</li>
<li>All in-game items from the Digital Deluxe Edition</li>
<li>A digital copy of the game, as well as a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask</li>
<li>A replica of Atsu's sash, complete with the names of all six members of the Yōtei Six</li>
<li>A replica of the Tsuba from Atsu's katana</li>
<li>A pouch of coins</li>
<li>Instructions to play Zeni Hajiki, a game of skill you'll play throughout Ghost of Yōtei.</li>
<li>A foldable papercraft ginkgo tree along with a wolf at its base</li>
<li>A set of four 5 x 7-inch art cards featuring the sash, the wolf, Atsu's Ghost mask, and our key art</li>
</ul>
<p>As a general point, an account for PlayStation Network will be required to redeem things such as digital items available via a voucher code. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-update-sparks-speculation-of-new-in-game-economy-and-bounty-system">Sucker Punch said it remained committed to Ghost of Yōtei's 2025 release window</a> on PS5. </p>
<p>There had been some speculation the studio and PlayStation may nudge it back a touch to make way for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">a game many expect will dominate the gaming landscape when it releases this autumn</a> (unless it gets delayed).

<p>At the time of writing, there are currently 96 Oblivion Remastered mods <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=updatedAt&amp;page=1">available on Nexus Mods</a> (at least as I can see while not being logged in), but I suspect it will soon pass 100.</p>
<p>These mods include things like <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/100">Faster (And Slower) Levelling</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/97">Slower Item Degradation</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/13">improved HUDs</a>. There's also the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15">Adoring Fan desktop shortcut icon replacer</a>, because <em>of course </em>he is going to pop up.</p>
<p>So, yes, people have certainly been busy since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> debuted yesterday. Meanwhile, I am sitting here just chuffed that I have at least managed to get it installed on my Xbox in the time since last night.</p>

<p>Away from my not-very-impressive-Xbox-flex, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered has pulled in some impressive player numbers for Bethesda and co-developer Virtuos on Steam, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">has an 182,298 concurrent player peak so far</a>. Are you one of them?</p>
<p>Earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
