            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f</a> was one of last year's biggest surprises and marked a return to form for the veteran horror game franchise (if we don't count the SH2 remake). With a strong cast of characters, a 1960s Japan setting, and a dense atmosphere, it made an impression on veterans and newcomers alike. Now, two members of the main cast have been made ambassadors of the city that inspired the game's rural village.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-actors-appointed-tourism-ambassadors-for-japanese-city-that-inspired-the-game">IGN</a>, we've learned about the surprising <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fZn1IovXDYw">YouTube short</a> posted on 2nd February by Takeshi Masago and Tamami Hiraoka, who played Hinako's (the protagonist) father and mother respectively. At first, fans thought they had a serious announcement to make given the video's initial tone, but it all ends with excitement and screaming as they reveal they've been made tourism ambassadors for Gero City in Japan's Gifu Prefecture.</p>
<p>The Kanayama-cho area, filled with "narrow alleyways and old houses" that instantly look familiar, served as the main inspiration for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s fictional Ebisugaoka village. Here's an image of the real-life location:</p>

<p>The wholesome video also serves as the culmination of an ongoing saga that had many of the viewers following the pair of actors' clips together wishing they were married in real life (and hopefully in a healthier relationship than in the game). Many thought for a second they were getting married for real, but they're keeping things professional, so calm down.</p><p>Masago has also been promoting Gero City for a while now, <a href="https://x.com/okuhidashuzo/status/2017953960754286795?s=20">wine brewery included</a>. There's even Silent Hill f themed sake and chocolates now, with the first batch selling out instantly. It's yet another example of a Japan-set mainstream video game bringing lots of attention to certain areas of the country.</p>
<p>Only a few years ago, Tsushima Island got a massive boost to tourism following the release of Sucker Punch's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> too. That also led to the game's lead devs <a href="https://sea.ign.com/ghost-of-tsushima-ps4/169560/news/ghost-of-tsushima-lead-devs-named-ambassadors-of-actual-island">becoming permanent tourism ambassadors of the city</a>.</p>
