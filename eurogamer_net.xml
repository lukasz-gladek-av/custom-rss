            <p>The team at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> studio Build A Rocket Boy is "heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended," it has said, promising more fixes throughout June.</p>
<p>MindsEye released earlier this week, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>. Build A Rocket Boy released a statement yesterday, when it said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">would be prioritising gameplay performance with an update</a>.</p>
<p>"Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak," the developer has since shared on the MindsEye Discord, adding roughly one in 10 players were impacted.</p>

<p>MindsEye has had an unusual lead up to launch, it has to be said. At the end of May, the studio's co-CEO suggested the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio"> game's negative reaction up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the developer</a>. This is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>, which serves as the game's publisher, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">doesn't believe to be the case</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">the studio's Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer left the company</a>, just one week before MindsEye released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
