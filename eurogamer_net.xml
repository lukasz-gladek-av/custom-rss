            <p>
A Minecraft Movie has now amassed more than $550m (£415m) globally since its launch less than two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-minecraft-movie-500-million-the-amateur-china-global-international-box-office-1236367389/">Deadline</a> reports that $270m (£204m) of the film's haul comes from overseas, with the UK its biggest market outside of the US, followed by China, Germany, Mexico and Australia.
</p>
<p>
The viral success of the film has caused it to overperform expectations despite limp critical reviews. In short: kids love it, and have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">loved going to throw popcorn in the air during its meme-tastic Chicken Jockey scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while Minecraft is proving popular, there's still some way for it to go to beat The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which wound up earning $1.3bn (£982m) during the same spring release window back in 2023, setting the record for the highest-grossing film based on a video game. 
</p>
<p>
Can Minecraft beat Nintendo's mascot? Possibly - it seems like Minecraft still has plenty of life left in it yet, even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the film does now include a warning message asking audiences to behave</a>, in an attempt to curb feral behaviour (and possibly because Warner Bros doesn't want a lawsuit involving animal cruelty after someone brought a live chicken to a showing).
</p>
<p>
Regardless of where A Minecraft Movie ultimately ends up, it's happy days for Warner Bros, which is reportedly already in talks over a potential sequel. And, as is the norm for movies hoping to become franchises these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">A Minecraft Movie naturally ends with a teaser for what could come next</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A former developer who worked on the cancelled PlayStation console exclusive Concord has called out online commenters comparing it with Bungie's recently showcased Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Bungie revealed more about its next shooter at the weekend</a> including its release date: 23rd September. Yet the lack of marketing and mixed response to its visual style has sparked comparisons with Concord, and claims that Marathon will be Sony's next flop.</p>
<p>The anonymous developer and artist took to reddit to respond to the comments, asking players to not "punish others for our mistakes".</p>

<p>"Many players know about Concord, and what happened with that project. Concord failed to inspire players, and the message was heard loud and clear," the developer admitted.</p>
<p>"It was gut wrenching to see our project fail, and be the laughing stock of many online. I have learned that failure is what drives me to succeed. No one feels as bad as the people who put their time on the line, hoping it will entertain the masses of gamers across the globe. I am not asking for pity, or even sympathy because, after all this is the name of the game, you win or lose. The margin for success is very thin. I took a chance, and lost.</p>
<p>"Some of you probably smell blood in the water, and probably want to roast me for no longer lurking, and exposing myself. I hope you don't, and see that people create these projects, and work very hard to be the next big thing. Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream, gave me hope, and excitement for what is to come for Marathon.</p>
<p>"I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed."</p>
<p>The developer concluded: "I worked on Concord, and did my best. We came up short, please don't punish others for our mistakes. We are all human beings who are trying to create something special, and Marathon is no different. Be kind, and be cool, as video games are meant to be fun."</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
FromSoftware's seminal action-RPG Dark Souls now has seamless co-op, courtesy of the modder behind similar co-op overhauls for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
Modder Yui initially <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510">made headlines through their work on Elden Ring</a>, stripping away some of its co-operative faff so players could adventure and battle bosses together seamlessly. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ahead-of-elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-3-modder-adds-seamless-co-op-overhaul-nine-years-after-release">similar mod arrived for Dark Souls 3</a> earlier this year, and now it's the turn of FromSoftware's stone cold classic Dark Souls, which gets seamless co-op some 14 years after its original release.
</p>
<p>
Dark Souls' Seamless Co-op mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksoulsremastered/mods/899">available to download now on NexusMods</a> and works very much like Yui's earlier mods, introducing a special custom item used to summon up to five additional players into a game. Once in a multiplayer session participants will notice some major differences compared to how things work in the base game.
</p>

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Here's a look at the Dark Souls Seamless Co-op mod in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqdZ1-uk9h8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
If a players dies, for instance, they'll spawn at the last bonfire they visited rather than being booted from the session, and clearing areas or defeating bosses won't disband play either. Additionally, when one player rests at a bonfire, the world will reset for everyone; NPC dialogue and events are synchronised for all players; all fog walls and barriers designed to restrict multiplayer zones are removed, and game progression made during a multiplayer session will also progress the game in your own world.
</p>
<p>
Yui has also implemented configurable multiplayer difficulty scaling for all enemies, and says that while seamless co-op makes Dark Souls "significantly easier", the mod's default scaling settings should be enjoyable while 'somewhat preserving the game's challenge'. Notably, players can't immediately spawn back into a boss fight on death - they'll instead be turned into a spectator until either everyone in the party is defeated or a player rests at a bonfire.
</p>
<p>
Dark Souls' seamless co-op mod - which also supports Invasions - is currently at the alpha stage, meaning it's "very likely" to contain bugs. Using it won't, however, result in a ban, given it utilises an overhauled peer-to-peer connection system rather than FromSoftware's servers. The mod even creates a different save file to keep things separate in case you want to play the vanilla game at the same time - although Yui warns that attempting to revert a mod saved file to a vanilla save <em>will</em> likely result in a ban.
</p>
<p>
Yui's Dark Souls mod comes ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">FromSoftware's multiplayer-focused Nightreign</a>, in which up to three players can work together to defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">new and familiar challenges from Elden Ring and other From games</a> - including The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a> launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 30th May - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> is also getting its own bit of FromSoftware multiplayer in the form of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">recently revealed The Duskbloods</a>.
