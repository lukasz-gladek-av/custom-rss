            <p>The original Sonic the Hedgehog game was "terribly controversial" at Sega, according to PlayStation's Mark Cerny, who's detailed more on its development in a new interview.</p>
<p>Cerny was lead system architect for Sony's PS4 and PS5 consoles, but began his career at Atari before moving to Sega and founding its Sega Technical Institute in America. It's this team that developed the sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, after the original game was made in Japan.</p>
<p>The first time he saw Sonic the Hedgehog, it was "obvious that game was going to do great," Cerny told journalist Simon Parkin on the <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console/episodes/mark-cerny-lead-system-architect-playstation-4-5">My Perfect Console podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Was there pressure to find a mascot to rival Nintendo's Mario? "The pressure was to make a game that could sell a million copies," Cerny replied, before describing the game as "terribly controversial" due to the increase in resources focused on the game, which ultimately led to Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka's departure from Sega.</p><p>"Part of the idea there was…Let's put much more resource on this project than we usually do," said Cerny. "As I said, what's usual? Three people, three months. So they were going to do, if I remember properly, three people, ten months. But they ended up needing four and a half people for 14 months. I'm a little hazy on the numbers these days. And though it was a success, they blew their budget so badly by putting in a couple of engineers on this that Yuji Naka was just getting yelled at and quit the company."</p>
<p>Cerny admitted "it pays off fantastically well for Sega" due to the success of the game. "But Yuji Naka was pretty tired of the situation by that point." Cerny described Naka as a "top level creator making $60,000 [after a bonus] in their best year and getting yelled at a lot. And he'd had it."</p>
<p>Famously, development on the Sonic series after the success of the first game was split. Development of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 moved to the Sega Technical Institute in America founded by Cerny and included original developers Naka and designer Hirokazu Yasuhara. Meanwhile in Japan, another Sonic game was developed by original co-creator Naoto Ohshima intended to be a sequel, but ultimately became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-cd">Sonic CD</a>.</p>
<p>Cerny noted "nobody realised how big Sonic was going to be" in either Sega Japan or America. "Sonic ships and almost immediately I've got the team ready to work on a sequel and do you want a sequel? And I've got Sega of America saying no, it's much too soon. Do a different game first," he said.</p>
<p>That soon changed following sales of Sonic the Hedgehog over its first Christmas period, quickly leading to the sequel's development by STI.</p>
<p>Cerny described his time at Sega overall as "brutal". "Atari was great, Sega was difficult," he said. "It was a difficult environment with a hard-driving president who was going to force us to success. That isn't to say that there wasn't an incredible amount of cameraderie with the people that I worked with but it was just brutal. Nakayama [president of Sega Japan] would come in and he would just give it to us if he didn't see happening what he wanted to see."</p>
<p>"Getting out of Sega was a very healthy thing," he said, before adding "Nakayama is amazing. He understood games like nobody's business...It's just that working for Nakayama - that was difficult and seven years of that was enough."</p>
<p>Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka has since had something of a fall from grace. After eventually leaving Sega in 2006, he later developed Balan Wonderworld with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> which was considered a critical and commercial flop on its release in 2021. He soon left the company and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-was-removed-as-director-of-balan-wonderworld-before-disastrous-launch">accused Square Enix of removing him as director six months before its launch</a>.</p>
<p>Then, in 2022, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-creator-yuji-naka-reportedly-arrested-for-insider-trading">arrested for insider trading at Square Enix</a>, which led to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-co-creator-yuji-naka-receives-suspended-prison-sentence-for-insider-trading">suspended prison sentence</a>.</p>

            <p>Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> may have its sights currently set on the upcoming James Bond origin story 007 First Light, but that doesn't mean we have seen the last of the studio's Hitman series.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/">Variety</a>,  IO Interactive's head Hakan Abrak assured fellow Agent 47 fans that "of course" there will be more Hitman in the future. Exactly how far in the future, though, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>"Right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you'll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination," Abrak told the publication.</p>
<p>"But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman - because, of course, there's going to be a next Hitman."</p>
<p>And, thank goodness for that! It's always a hoot prowling around the many opulent settings Agent 47 gets sent off to, before (if you are anything like me) running away in a hail of bullets as any attempts at stealth get put back on the shelf.</p><p>As for that aforementioned co-op mode, this will feature two names you may recognise: Stone and Knight. These two popped up in the Hitman Sniper mode. On the co-op mode's eventual release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-hitman-co-op-mode-with-stone-and-knight-is-in-the-works-at-io-interactive">players will be able to pop into "exciting missions" from the Hitman world with their pal by their side</a>. These missions will "challenge" players to rethink how they approach things now they are going in as one of a pair. </p>

<p>In addition to Hitman and 007 First Light, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-confirms-development-of-bold-new-online-fantasy-rpg">IO Interactive also has a multiplayer fantasy project in the works</a>, aptly codenamed Project Fantasy. This upcoming release, which hasn't officially been revealed yet, is "extremely ambitious and really cool and is something [other] than a gun in a suit", Abrak said. "So that's also good to have something new within the creative outlook here."</p>
<p>But, before that arrives, 007 First Light will be shooting onto PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and PC on 27th March next year. The studio has promised a deeper look at the gameplay we can all expect to see as part of a dedicated stream it is hosting tomorrow, 3rd December, at 4pm UK time.</p>

<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>
