            <p>Cygames, the Japanese video game developer responsible for a variety of popular games including Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has announced its intention to create an AI-focused subsidiary company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/">A blog post</a> on the official website states Cygames AI Studio Inc will be developing "AI-based services and tools". A breakdown of key information at the bottom of the post also indicates it'll be involved in operation support and consulting as part of its AI services.</p>
<p>The post also features a paragraph detailing the background for this company, including the reasoning for why it's been established. The statement, translated into English using built-in Google tools, reads: "Generative AI, which has emerged in recent years, is an important technology with the potential to transform accumulated knowledge into the driving force behind the next wave of creativity.</p>

<p>"At the AI Studio, Cygames will pursue AI technology that creators can use safely and securely, drawing on the experience it has cultivated in game development. From research and development of its own models to providing services and tools for production sites, the company will build a unique creative cycle that goes beyond simply improving efficiency to expand creators' creativity</p>
<p>"Through the establishment of the AI Studio, Cygames will take on the challenge of creating new user experiences to realize its vision of being "a company that creates the best content."</p>
<p>Japanese video game companies such as Cygames appear to be largely embracing generative AI technology. In a poll during last year's Tokyo Game Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of companies that responded stated generative AI was being used in development</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has indicated its desire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">to replace much of its QA work with generative AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">Sega too has expressed eagerness to use the tech in spite of "strong resistance"</a>.</p>
<p>Cygames' current golden goose in Western markets, Umamusume: Pretty Derby, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">won the best mobile game award at last year's TGAs</a>.</p>

            <p>Former Xbox exclusive role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> is coming to PlayStation 5, and it'll be released on the game's first anniversary: 17th February 2026 (note: the original PC and Xbox Series S/X release happened on 18th February 2025 but it's only a day's difference).</p>
<p>The benefit of a year-long wait for Avowed on PS5 means there's been a year's worth of game improvements. Among them are expanded/reworked abilities for the Ranger and Fighter skill trees, a New Game Plus mode, a Photo Mode, and the option of playing as a species other than human. You'll be able to play as the big, scaly Amauan, the small furry Orlan, and the broad-shouldered Dwarves. I wish I'd had this choice when I played.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=equGBZBUjVg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>There've also been a host of incidental improvements made to the game since its launch, too, such as squashing bugs, tinkering with items and gear, and so on. These improvements will all be available on other existing platforms, of course, but as they say: you can only make a first impression once.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Avowed made a very good impression on me</a>. It has a slightly dated feel to it, but look past that and there's an adventure here with playful mechanics and a delightfully earnest approach to fantasy - one packed with colour and wide-eyed wonder.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall underestimated just how much players would engage with the game's various sidequests and optional content, and as a result of this extra grinding would find the final boss fight a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>As we all know by now, Clair Obscur became quite a sensation following its release last year. The first game from Sandfall, many weren't sure exactly what to expect on its debut, but before long many were deeply invested in its world and characters. In fact, players were so invested in Clair Obscur, they completed a lot of optional side content and dungeons, leveling up their characters in the process. </p>
<p>This meant, though, that by the time it came to the final showdown (don't worry, I won't spoil it here), a lot of players were actually a lot stronger than Sandfall anticipated, and so the fight itself was a little <em>too</em> easy.</p>

<p>"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Clair Obscur's lead game designer Michel Nohra said in a recent interview with Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">Games Radar</a>).</p><p>Nohra added: "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>"I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur's lead programmer Tom Guillermin believes a lot of this was due to Sandfall's "humility", as no one at the studio really expected the game to become quite such a success.</p>
<p>"We weren't sure if our game was going to be that good," Guillermin said. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon."</p>
<p>Closing, Guillermin said of course the team was "happy about that", however Sandfall just "didn't see it coming".</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>Last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have - perhaps slightly ironically now - proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>
