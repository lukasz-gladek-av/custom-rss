            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.pl/games/peak">Peak</a> has sold one million copies in six days, following a steady day-by-day launch on Steam.</p>
<p>Developed by Landcrab (a collaboration between Landfall and Aggro Crab), the title initially launched to just over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/">11,000 concurrent players on 17th June according to SteamDB</a>. This grew daily, eventually breaching the 100,000 concurrent milestone on Sunday.</p>
<p>As of writing, the game is at the top of Steam's Top Sellers list, following the well-trodden path last walked by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> earlier this month. By all accounts a great success, especially considering this is Landcrab's first release.</p>

<p>In response to Peak passing the million-sales mark, Aggro Crab posted a very snarky and on-brand reaction <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1936733984635179247">on social media</a>: "why did this stupid jam game sell more copies than another crabs treasure im gonna crash out".</p>
<p>The positive reception comes at a good time for the Aggro Crab team, who collaborated with Landfall after funding for Going Under 2 was pulled from beneath the developer. As for Landfall, that team has a rich history of releasing smaller games that make a massive impact. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/content-warning-tops-one-million-sales">Content Warning topped one million sales</a> fairly quickly, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/extremely-silly-battle-royale-game-totally-accurate-battlegrounds-is-an-unexpected-steam-smash">Totally Accurate Battlegrounds</a> was an April Fools Joke that morphed into a surprise hit.</p>
<p>If you were curious as to Aggro Crab's previous work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-crabs-treasure-feels-a-natural-evolution-for-an-underwater-soulslike">Another Crab's Treasure is <em>fantastic</em></a>. It's well worth your time, and it's going cheap these days too! Get your pincers round it, if you can.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/charming-co-op-climbing-game-peak-takes-steam-by-storm-selling-one-million-copies-in-six-days-and-mounting-the-top-sellers-page]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Actor Charlie Cox may be known to many in these parts for voicing Gustave in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, but even though the game has been met with critical acclaim, he personally feels "like a total fraud".</p>
<p>Why? Because it turns out that the actor recorded most of his lines in only about four hours as part of a voice over gig set up by his agent.</p>

<p>In a clip which has been circulated around social media, Cox revealed he is "not a gamer", and while he doesn't want to minimise Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in any way, he hasn't actually played it himself.</p>
<p>"Apparenly the game is awesome," Cox said in the clip, which was filmed during Washington State Summer Con 2025. The actor, who currently portrays Matt Murdoch/Daredevil in the Marvel universe, added he is "thrilled" for developer Sandfall Interactive, and the success its game has had.</p>
<p>"People keep saying how amazing it is," Cox said. All in all, it's a pretty wholesome little video. You can check out Cox's full comment via the embed below (I am afraid it is an X post).</p> <div>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released back in April, and in May the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>. In the time since, Sandfall Interactive has said it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-exploring-new-content-accessibility-features-and-all-sorts-of-bits-and-bobs-for-future-game-updates">exploring new content, accessibility features, and "all sorts of bits and bobs" for future game updates</a>.</p>
