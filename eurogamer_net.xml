            <p>Towards the end of last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-has-at-least-three-marvel-games-in-the-works">EA cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the developer behind it</a>, Cliffhanger Studios. At this time, an email seen by the media said this decision would enable the publisher to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities".</p>
<p>Since then, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> report has revealed a few more details from Cliffhanger Studios' now-cancelled Marvel game, including that the project was looking to build upon ideas from Monolith's Shadow of Mordor game, such as its Nemesis System. The Nemesis system is a clever in-game mechanic, which in Shadow of Mordor tracks a player's actions to create enemies who remember past encounters.</p>
<p>Cliffhanger was going to expand on this mechanism, with playable heroes such as T'Challa, Killmonger and Shuri all competing to earn the title of Black Panther. According to the report, players would select one character to play as, with the others then becoming rivals they could build a relationship with.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game would feature Marvel's fictional race of extraterrestrial shapeshifters, the Skrulls. In the game, the Skrulls would be attempting to invade Wakanda, with some of the alien creatures posing as allies. Meanwhile, other members of the Skrulls "might have remembered the player's behaviour and acted accordingly, sort of like in Shadow of Mordor," the report stated, calling it an "ambitious system".</p>
<p>However, despite its vision, the Black Panther developer had a hard time showcasing the game's procedural narrative experiments, with those close to the project stating that processes were slowed due to the team building both a new game and a new studio at the same time.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the game had begun gaining more momentum prior to its shock cancellation, with many of those laid off only being hired within the last year. However, according to sources, EA executives had been left frustrated by the fact the game had not yet left the pre-production phase, despite it being in the works for nearly four years.</p>

<p>While EA may have cancelled its Black Panther Project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-iron-man-single-player-game-in-the-works">the company still has an Iron Man game in the pipeline</a>. In October 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-iron-man-part-of-three-game-marvel-deal">EA signed a multi-game deal with Marvel</a>.</p>
<p>Away from EA, Amy Hennig's own Black Panther-starring game is also still in development. Known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">upcoming release is slated for next year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">will focus on four central characters</a>: a young Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America; Azzuri, T'Challa's grandfather and the WWII-era Black Panther; Gabriel Jones, a US soldier and member of the Howling Commandos; and Nanali, a Wakandan spy embedded in Occupied Paris.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a> ahead of the event this Friday. This montage of big releases - some already playable, others highly anticipated - is clearly a tone setter for the annual gaming showcase, set to kick off a weekend of new trailers and reveals.</p>
<p>Some notable titles featured in this sizzle reel include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will also be making an appearance too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">its first since an art plagiarism scandal reportedly left morale at Bungie in "free fall"</a>.</p>
<p>As for representation from games you can just go out and buy right now, you've got titles like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>. It's unclear as of yet what sort of presence these games will have at the show, but one can assume smaller updates, post-launch content, and so on.</p>

<p>Indeed many of the games briefly shown off in this new trailer will likely be making some manner of appearance at the show. We know of course that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Death Stranding 2 is getting its own premiere</a> separate from the main Summer Game Fest stage on June 8, and <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1927754199594307658">thanks to a recent Twitter post by Summer Game Fest founder and host Geoff Keighley</a> we know 2K will be there, hopefully with Mafia in hand.</p>
<p>Of course that same tweet does point towards other big studios that surely will be dropping something exciting during the weekend. Studios like Bandai Namco, Capcom, Digital Extremes, Embark and far more have logos proudly spread across official Summer Game Fest material.</p> <div>

            <p>Sci-fi action-RPG Hell is Us will receive a demo later today on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1620730/Hell_is_Us/">Steam</a>, ahead of its release in September.</p>
<p>The demo will be available from 2nd - 16th June but won't be available on console due to "technical constraints". <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1620730/view/515211349279638275">Said developer Rogue Factor</a>: "Please rest assured: Hell is Us will launch simultaneously on PC and consoles, with the same content and the same level of polish. Development is progressing equally across all platforms - this limitation only concerns the demo."</p>
<p>The demo will take place at the start of the game and offer players a taste of its gameplay, though Rogue Factor promises some "key elements, like exploration and the player plattering experience, truly come into their own as the world opens up and the layers unfold".</p>

<p>So what is Hell is Us? The game has been shown at a couple of PlayStation State of Play events - it's a new action-RPG from Mordheim studio Rogue Factor, combining soulslike combat with dungeons filled with puzzles and survival gameplay.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>It's all set in a hostile land without a map or quest markers, meaning players will need to focus carefully on exploration, while battling supernatural creatures due to a mysterious calamity.</p>
<p>And while the soulslike combat is meant to be challenging, the demo will have three difficulty levels and further customisation options.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1620730/view/515211349279638277">PC specs</a> have been revealed as per the image above. Recommended specs are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Graphic Settings:</strong> 1080P 60 FPS AVG High Settings</p>
<p><strong>GPU:</strong> "NVIDIA RTX 2080Ti 11GB or AMD RX 6750 XT 12GB</p>
<p><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel i7-11700K or AMD Ryzen 5 7600</p>
<p><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</p>
<p><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 - 64bit</p>
<p><strong>STORAGE:</strong> 30GB SSD</p>
<p>The Ultra settings on PC suggest an NVIDA RTX 4090, but note this will still be at 30fps.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">hands-on with Hell is Us</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year and was impressed with its immersive exploration.</p>
<p>"The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released next year. But it's that twist on navigation that brings the real magic of a chilling atmosphere."</p>
<p>Hell is Us will release on 4th September across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-lands-september-release-date-as-well-deus-exs-elias-toufexis">game's protagonist RÃ©mi is voiced by Elias Toufexis</a>, best known as Adam Jensen from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
