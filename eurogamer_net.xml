            <p>Nintendo has denied reports that it has been lobbying Japanese lawmakers against generative AI, insisting it "has not had any contact with the Japanese government" about the highly controversial emerging tech.</p>
<p>The denial comes after Japanese politician Satoshi Asano <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974758362157035573">posted an apology on social media</a> after claiming Nintendo was lobbying the Japanese government. This was followed by <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974758362157035573">a further apology</a> earlier today, after which Satoshi deleted the original post.</p>

<p>While the megacorp typically declines to comment on speculation, on this occasion Nintendo was keen to shoot the rumour down and stressed that while it was not lobbying, "whether generative AI is involved or not, we will continue to take necessary actions against infringement of our intellectual property rights".</p>
<p>"Contrary to recent discussions on the internet, Nintendo has not had any contact with the Japanese government about generative AI," the company wrote.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-discusses-ai-use-says-games-will-always-have-a-human-touch">Nintendo recently shared its thoughts on generative AI, and assured fans that its games will always have "a human touch"</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> president Doug Bowser saying: "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers, their artistic capabilities, their insight into how people play. So, there's always, <em>always</em> going to be a human touch, and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p><p>Nintendo's position is at odds with many of its contemporaries.

<p>In fact, a recent survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), the organiser of Tokyo Game Show, showed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in their development</a>.</p>

            <p>A third-party customer service system used by Discord's support teams has been hacked, compromising some user personal data, including government IDs.</p>
<p>Discord has written to some users confirming that on 20th September, personal data was obtained by "an unauthorised party" which gained limited access, including "a small number of government‑ID images such as driver's license and passports from users who had appealed an age determination".</p>
<p>Discord – which is used by millions of gamers across the world – says information shared by users with its Customer Support or Trust and Safety teams was "exposed", including real names, Discord name, email, contact address, limited payment information – including payment type, last four digits of credit cards, and purchase history – IP addresses, and messages and attachments sent to customer support. Limited corporate data, including training materials and internal presentations, was also exposed.</p>
<p>Full credit card numbers or CCV codes, Discord activity or messages, and passwords or authentication data were reportedly not compromised, but Discord has not revealed how many of its millions of users may have been impacted.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service">blog</a> post, Discord insisted that just "a limited number of users who had communicated with customer support" were impacted, and the authorised party did not gain access to Discord directly. It also claimed to have taken "all appropriate steps" by notifying data protection authorities, law enforcement, and "reviewed our threat detection systems and security controls for third-party support providers".</p><p>"Looking ahead, we recommend impacted users stay alert when receiving messages or other communication that may seem suspicious. We have service agents on hand to answer questions and provide additional support," Discord said. "We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the inconvenience and concern this may cause."</p>
<p><em>An earlier edition of this story referred to the breach as "authorised", not "unauthorised". This has been amended. Apologies for any confusion.</em></p>

            <p>As it gears up for what it calls an "exciting day of the Black Ops 7 Early Access Beta coming later today", Treyarch has some "important multiplayer playlist changes" to share with us as the beta continues.</p>
<p>As the developer explains, beta tests are run ahead of full launch to "gather critical in-game data and feedback" to ensure games – especially those with heavy multiplayer aspects – provide "the best experience possible".</p>
<p>That's why the team is working with the community to address early issues and making "some updates" to its playlist plans.</p>

<p>That's why this weekend, in the Open Moshpit playlist, you'll find "skill consideration is drastically reduced when matchmaking, with the goal of providing more varied match experiences and outcomes". As Treyarch explains, this playlist will "match players with and against players of more varied skill differences than in the current Multiplayer matchmaking system". This'll apply to all maps and modes across that playlist.</p>
<p>While not explicitly confirmed, this suggests that the other playlist, Moshpit, will feature more traditional skill-based matchmaking. You can also expect additional Perk changes – "including slot assignment" – when the game releases next month.</p>
<p>"While these updates will not be in the Beta, we’ve heard your feedback and will be sharing more about them on the road to launch," the developer said. "We can also confirm that we will be making reloading while Wall Jumping default behaviour for launch."</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, the team has been "closely following feedback" from Black Ops 7 players on time-to-kill (TTK), which is why you'll see changes to the Dravec 45 and M8A1.</p>
<p>"We currently see these weapons well ahead of the pack in our TTK data, and they also have very high usage, which means they are contributing heavily to combat pacing right now in the Beta," the update continued. "The goal of the changes outlined below is to bring their average performance closer to the other weapons currently available.</p><p>"Time-to-Kill (TTK) and overall weapon balance has been a conversation we've been keeping an eye on, along with evaluating in-game data from day one of the Beta. While we’re starting the Beta with a TTK in the range of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, we’re aware that some players feel it may be slightly faster than desired. As a result, we'll be releasing a weapon balance pass in the coming days to adjust TTK and ensure all weapons available in the Beta are competitive within both their class and their intended role within Black Ops 7."</p>
<p>Here's the rest of the patch notes:</p>
