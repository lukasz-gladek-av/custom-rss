            <p>Nintendo has won a lawsuit against streamer Jesse Keighin, who was sued by the Japanese video game giant for allegedly streaming pirated games before they were released.
</p>
<p>Nintendo also alleged that Keighin had taunted the company, claiming he sent a letter: "boasting that he has 'a thousand burner channels' to stream from and 'can do this all day'". <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/">Outlet Torrent Freak</a> reported that Keighin posted on Facebook: "Should have done more research on me. You might run a corporation, I run the streets."
</p>
<p>Following the successful lawsuit, Colorado federal courts have ordered Keighin to pay $17,500 to Nintendo. The judge presiding over the case did reject two of Nintendo's permanent injunctions however, these being related to the destruction of circumvention devices, as well as an injunction to apply to third parties who were involved alongside Keighin.

<p>The judge deemed the request to destroy these circumvention devices "unclear" and "unreasonable", due to the fact that Keighin used online emulation services. As for an injunction applicable to third parties, the judge rejected the proposal as Nintendo failed to specify who these third parties were.
</p>
<p>The $17,500 figure comes from a $10,000 fine for Keighin's latest infringement, the streaming of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brotherhood, while the remaining $7,500 comes from fifteen separate $500 fines for multiple previous violations of Nintendo's anti-piracy measures.
</p>
<p>This is the latest development in an ongoing war raged by Nintendo against pirates. It was only earlier this month when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-seeks-45m-against-reddit-moderator-accused-of-pirating-switch-games-in-latest-crackdown-against-piracy">Nintendo announced its intent to sue a Reddit moderator accused of pirating its games for $4.5m</a>. Nintendo previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">updated its Nintendo Account Agreement, reserving the right to brick consoles in an attempt to curb piracy</a>.</p>
