            <p>
The studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-is-an-ambitious-new-transmedia-bid">bold Assassin's Creed-meets-Tomb Raider transmedia attempt Unknown 9</a> has signalled an end to the franchise, following the poor performance of last year's initial video game.
</p>
<p>
Unknown 9: Awakening, a generic globe-trotting adventure starring The Witcher TV series' Anya Chalotra, "didn't come near the company's expectations," the boss of developer Reflector Entertainment Herve Hoerdt said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/reflector-entertainment_activity-7287227402995269633-s4i-/">statement</a> today, "and didn't warrant any further exploration in this universe". Ouch.
</p>
<p>
One of the Reflector's two future projects - presumably another Unknown 9 game which had been in the "conceptualisation phase" - has now been cancelled, Hoerdt added. This therefore means the studio was "terminating this development line".

<p>
"This decision correlates directly with the failure of the studio's ambitious and courageous first project, a new IP with a rich transmedia universe," Hoerdt continued. 
</p>
<p>
Reflector had ambitious plans for Unknown 9 as an ongoing series, supported by podcasts, comics, novels, and several web series. While many of these have now been released, some ahead of Awakening itself, following a lengthy delay to the video game, none appear to have made any real impression.
</p>
<p>
Reflector will now go through a second round of redundancies, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-awakening-developers-report-layoffs">previous job losses reported back in November 2024</a>, as the company shrinks to a "single project approach the studio will adopt for the imminent future". 
</p>
<p>
This project is an "existing Bandai Namco IP" and is "shaping up well", Hoerdt concluded.

            <p>Balatro, the poker-themed roguelite, has now passed 5m copies sold.</p>
<p>That's more than double the sales since last August, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">game passed 2m copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>Since then it's released on mobile and has seen a surge in popularity following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">multiple wins at last year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside the mobile release, Balatro was added to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> subscription service, but it would appear those players are not included in these 5m individual sales.</p>
<p>The news was shared on the Balatro social media account, which implored fans to try out more indie games.</p>
<p>"The last few weeks have been pretty wild," the post reads. "To everyone who picked up Balatro after seeing it at thegameawards, we hope you're having an amazing time with it!</p>
<p>"If this is your first time picking up an indie title, try to make it a habit! There's some amazing stuff out there!"</p> <div>

<p>LocalThunk, as the game's solo developer is known, released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-dev-shares-an-excellent-list-of-his-favourite-indie-games-of-2024">list of his favourite indie games</a> at the start of this year, with his top pick being <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>.</p>
<p>Balatro was released in February last year and is available across PC, Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>It won best mobile game, best debut indie game, and best independent game at The Game Awards 2024.</p>
<p>Two months after its release on mobile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">report estimated the game had generated almost $4.4m on mobile alone</a>.</p>
<p>LocalThunk has stated he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-creator-sometimes-regrets-its-success-and-wants-to-stay-anonymous">wishes to remain anonymous</a> and, in a previous interview, admitted he regrets the game's success. "Honestly, yeah," he said. "Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways. I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
