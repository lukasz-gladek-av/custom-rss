            <p>Qiddiya Investment Company (QIC) has now completed its acquisition of the Evolution Championship Series – Evo, as it's more commonly known – and insists that "Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged" under its new parent company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">Fighting game players were up in arms when news broke last year that RTS</a> – a gaming talent agency and owner of the Evo tournament series – would be acquired by the Saudi Arabian mega city project, Qiddiya.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer reported at the time the news broke, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fighting-game-players-in-uproar-after-evos-new-saudi-government-owners-calls-to-support-grassroots-events">the response online from fighting game community members was largely one of disappointment</a>, as various fans of the genre came out to express sadness at the new owner – which is a subsidiary of Mohammed bin Salman's Public Investment Fund (PIF) – and emphasised the importance of supporting grassroots community-run events given Saudi Arabia has been criticised by Human Rights organisations for its prolific use of slavery, the death penalty, and more.</p>
<p>Now, in a <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2026-business-update">statement</a> posted to Evo's website now the acquisition has completed, the organisation said it will "stage major international events" in Tokyo, Las Vegas, and Nice, France, later this year, "as it continues its role as a global platform for competitive excellence, cultural exchange, and community connection".</p><p>"Under RTS ownership, Evo's traditions, values, and identity will remain unchanged, with a continued focus on serving players, fans, and publishers at every level of the industry," the statement said. "Key leadership will remain in place, ensuring long-term stability, including Stuart Saw in his role as Chief Executive Officer at RTS."</p>
<p>Qiddiya's chief strategy officer, Muhannad Aldawood, added: "Evo is a global gaming institution, built on community, competition, and creativity. Through RTS and Qiddiya City, we are committed to supporting Evo's long-term growth in a way that respects its heritage and strengthens its role within the global Fighting Game Community. This is about investing in the future of play, and safeguarding what makes Evo special."</p>
<p>Numerous fans are not convinced, however.</p>
<p>"Support your locals any way you can, folks. I was already on my way out of Evo because I don’t like how corporate the scene has become," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1r94pvj/comment/o69vznc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one commenter. "I don’t even want fighting games to be a scene anymore, just play and watch the games you like, give feedback that you care about, and growth will come organically." Another simply <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1r94pvj/comment/o69zec4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a>: "And this, everybody, is why supporting grassroots locals should still be the priority over pushing big tentpole tournaments."</p>
<p>A number of prolific players and content creators in the fighting game community, like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1pq6xzu/sajam_boycotting_all_evo_events/">Sajam</a>, have pledged not to attend Evo this year.</p>

            <p>Nintendo is reportedly issuing refunds for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> upgrade.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as the new release is officially known, released earlier this week. Following similar Switch 2 upgrades for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-fans-its-happening-nintendo-a-drops-a-surprise-switch-2-upgrade-for-xenoblade-chronicles-x-with-60fps-and-more">for £4.19/$4.99 USD, players with the Switch 1 version can get 4K and "up to" 60fps support in TV mode</a>, plus 1080p and "up to" 60fps when playing in handheld mode. Theoretically, anyway.</p>

</span></p><p>Since its release, however, social media has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4lvwVgaKSg">flooded</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPiBQWGCc34">with</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_69lzj5EGA">complaints</a> about the game's "improved" visuals, with some fans claiming the game looked better <em>before</em> the Switch 2 upgrade. And while some are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1raqtnn/very_important_psa_about_the_switch_2_edition_how/">devising workarounds in an attempt to improve the game</a>, others have gone straight to Nintendo for a refund. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/nintendo_is_refunding_xenoblade_x_upgrade_patch/">And they're getting it.</a></p><p>"Image quality seems sharper, but after a while, the image starts to grow over my perception and just turns bad," explained redditor tamodolo. "Long range textures seem to have [been applied] a convolution filter on it. And the overall image seems to be just FHD being upscales and antialiased with strong filters. Not really a true high resolution game.</p>
<p>"I played the Wii U version in native 4k using Cemu and that version in 4K is incredible! I expected that Nintendo did that for the Switch 2 edition but this is less than any other free update they issued until now."</p>
<p>Tamodolo was so unhappy, in fact, that they wrote to Nintendo requesting a refund.</p>
<p>"I just asked mine saying that the image quality of the upgraded version is worse than the original game (which is true)," they wrote. "They said that they normally don't refund digital games but can do in this case after analysing the problem. (which they did in something like one and a half minute).</p>
<p>"What I wanted to comunicate to Nintendo by doing this: This isn't the Nintendo quality I expected and [received] until now so I'll not pay for something that deliver less quality than a free patch."</p>
<p>They then told other unhappy players to follow suit, and to contact Nintendo via the form on the eShop.</p>
<p>"I [encourage] you all doing this to pass the message to Nintendo that this level of quality for something that is paid isn't acceptable and they need to improve."</p>
<p>"If we continue to ask for refunds, they might actually work on fixing it," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/comment/o6j06u7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">responded</a> one commenter, while another confirmed they too had received a refund, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/comment/o6iwl6s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">writing</a>: "Did the same thing, talked to chat support for like five minutes, and got a refund. Told them pretty much the same thing, the upgrade makes the game look worse (I'm handheld only). No fighting, I just gave them the numbers they asked for and its on its way."</p><p>Eurogamer had good things to say about Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition when we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review">gave it four stars last year</a>, saying that while "not all its additions are for the better... this excavation of Monolith Soft's alien opus remains as fascinating and enthralling as it was a decade ago." Of course, that wasn't reviewed on the Switch 2.</p>
