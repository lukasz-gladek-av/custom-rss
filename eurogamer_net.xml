            <p>Despite reports to the contrary, it doesn't look like Battlefield 6 will cost $80 after all, as publisher EA is shunning the move to that kind of pricing for its games, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>Following EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx">latest financial report</a>, CEO Andrew Wilson took part in an earnings call with investors, where the company exec was asked about other publishers releasing $80 games, like Nintendo did with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>"We're not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage," Wilson replied, adding EA already offers "a fairly broad pricing scheme across our various products" (transcribed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-no-80-games-for-now-were-not-looking-to-make-any-changes-at-this-stage">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Continuing, Wilson said: "When you think about everything from free-to-play through to our premium products and deluxe editions, our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value.</p>
<p>"We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p>
<p>During the same call, it was confirmed that EA had not factored in any price changes to its  current fiscal year earnings guidance, meaning games releasing prior to March 2026 aren't expected to retail for $80. That includes Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-details-including-an-october-release-date-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal">which was recently suggested to be releasing with an $80 price tag attached</a>.</p>
<p>The conversation around game pricing has been more prevalent in recent times. Earlier this year, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford made waves when he suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">if you were a true fan you would purchase Borderlands 4 whatever the price may be</a>. This comment was met with backlash, so the Gearbox exec then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">attempted to justify his comments with a video</a> shared on social media. Here, he admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 would cost. More recently, we found out Borderlands 4 will actually sell for $70, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/randy-pitchford-stoked-about-borderlands-4s-70-price-point-confirms-tonne-of-dlc-on-the-way">Pitchford is "stoked" about that</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, just last week, Microsoft walked back on its previous decision to hike the price of its new first-party Xbox games up to $80 this 'holiday season', saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-bullishly-hiking-xbox-games-to-80-microsoft-confirms-u-turn-starting-with-the-outer-worlds-2">it's sticking to a lower price point "in line with current market conditions"</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-may-not-be-80-after-all-as-ea-shuns-higher-priced-games-for-now]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has postponed its next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update due to a tsunami warning.</p>
<p>The update was initially meant to go out today, 30th July, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-duo-mode-is-finally-on-the-way-with-release-date-confirmed">introduce the much sought after two-player mode</a>, as well as some UI improvements and more Relics filtering options. However, following the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c3r4x9yrrg4t">recent earthquake near the Kamchatka Peninsula</a> - which has seen the cancellation or postponement of several other events, as well as evacuations in some parts of the US west coast and Japan - the developer has pushed the release of the update back.</p>
<p>Instead, the update - known as Patch 1.02 - will now live tomorrow, 31st July. It is scheduled for after 9am UK time.</p>

<p>Additionally, the second cycle of Elden Ring Nightreign's Everdark Sovereign event, which was initially planned to go live following patch 1.02's release, has also been delayed until "after the update file has been distributed". This cycle will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">introduce enhanced Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1950415327042404555">Writing on social media</a>, the Elden Ring Nightreign team thanked players for their "understanding".</p>
<p>Along with the upcoming duo mode, there is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-confirmed-dlc-but-what-could-be-included">DLC for Elden Ring Nightreign in the pipeline</a>, though it remains unknown what this will include or its date of arrival.</p>
<p>Nightreign is FromSoftware's online multiplayer spin-off to its hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, which Ed described as "an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour" in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the developer announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">Elden Ring Nightreign had passed 5m copies sold</a>, while Elden Ring's DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> had passed 10m downloads.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-mode-update-delayed-due-to-tsunami-warning]]></content:encoded>
