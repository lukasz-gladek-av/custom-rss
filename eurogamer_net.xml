            <p>
Rockstar has delayed the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> to 2026.
</p>
<p>
The highly-anticipated sequel will now arrive on 26th May 2026, Rockstar announced today in a short statement. 
</p>
<p>"Hi everyone, Grand Theft Auto 6 is now set to release on 26th May, 2026," the company wrote in a statement shared via social media.</p>
<p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>"With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto 6 is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve.</p>
<p>"We look forward to sharing more information with you soon. Sincerely, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>."</p>

<p>Today's news comes ahead of parent company Take-Two's next financial results briefing, set for 15th May, and days after Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">Borderlands 4's recent launch date change was nothing to do with any other game</a>.
</p>
<p>No other information was announced by Rockstar today - and there's certainly no sign of a new GTA 6 trailer. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">Rockstar released GTA 6's first - and so far only - look at the game back in December 2023</a>, at which point it was set for launch this year.</p>
<p>Rockstar's confirmation of a delay follows months of speculation over whether the game would still make its 2025 launch window, despite assurances from Take-Two that the game was still on track. 
</p>
<p>In November 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6's publisher insisted the game would arrive in autumn 2025</a> despite whispers of a delay, something it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">doubled down upon again just a few months back</a> in February.</p>
<p>"This calendar year is shaping up to be one of the strongest ever for [Take-Two], as we plan to launch <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 on 11th February, Mafia: The Old Country in the summer, Grand Theft Auto 6 in the fall, and Borderlands 4," the publisher noted in a now-outdated earnings report. </p>
<p>And just a month ago, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-date-is-still-secret-because-take-two-boss-wants-to-maintain-the-anticipation-and-excitement">the publisher was still keeping the GTA 6 date close to its chest to "maintain the anticipation and the excitement"</a>. Still, reading back through his comments now, there is a suggestion of caution around announcing a firm date too early. Here's what he said:</p>
<p>"We do have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance, and we found that the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement on the one hand, and balance the excitement with unmet anticipation," Zelnick noted.</p>
<p>The delay is at least good news for other games hesitant to lock down a launch date towards the tail end of 2025. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gta-6-looming-ea-says-its-willing-to-delay-its-biggest-ever-battlefield-to-make-its-launch-all-it-needs-to-be">EA boss Andrew Wilson previously said the company would be willing to delay its next Battlefield</a> - currently expected to release before April 2026 - if "some things happening in the year" meant that "wasn't a great window for us".</p>
<p>Sony, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">waited until last week to confirm an October launch date for Ghost of Y≈çtei</a>, likely its biggest PlayStation launch for the year. Its hard to imagine the company did that without knowing the game would not clash with Rockstar's behemoth.</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta6-active-development-now-well-underway-rockstar-says">first confirmed GTA 6 development was "well underway" back in 2022</a>, following reporting that stated the game's initial scope had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-grand-theft-auto-6-plans-reportedly-featured-four-protagonists-and-three-cities">pared back to allow for a smoother development and the ability to grow the game's world post-launch</a>.</p>

            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has congratulated Sandfall Interactive for its new RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, calling it a "shining example of French audacity and creativity".</p>
<p>Sandfall's game released last week to widespread acclaim. It sold 500k copies in its first day, which then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">grew to 1m copies within three days</a>.</p>
<p>"1m copies and to date, one of the best-rated games in history: and yes, it's French!" Macron wrote in a reply to the studio on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJHKCJyNVZ_/?igsh=a2ZyZWJsYncxejBr&amp;img_index=1">Instagram</a> (Google translated). "Congratulations to Sandfall Interactive and all the creators of Expedition 33. You are a shining example of French audacity and creativity."</p>

<p>The game's account replied in turn with the only acceptable response: a baguette emoji.</p>
<p>"We hope you've enjoyed spotting the nods to our home country throughout," the original post reads.</p>
<p>Despite being set in a surreal and painterly fantasy world, Clair Obscur is filled with silly French references: from battling mimes, to stripy outfits, a twisted version of the Eiffel Tower, and a fair amount of swearing in French.</p>

<p>The game released in the same week as Bethesda surprise-dropped Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion. Yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">Clair Obscur publisher Kepler noted that hasn't harmed sales</a>.</p>
<p>"Proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all," said Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan. "In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p>
<p>Macron's comment recognising the success of a video game is also a welcome u-turn after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-clarifies-view-on-video-games-after-blaming-them-for-riots">he previously blamed the culture around the medium for riots in the summer of 2023</a>. He later clarified on social media he "always considered that video games are an opportunity for France, for our youth and its future, for our jobs and our economy".</p>
<p>"I expressed my concerns at the end of June because video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks," he added. "It is this violence that I condemn, not video games."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valves-invite-only-deadlock-has-an-even-more-exclusive-top-secret-hush-hush-build<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Everyone's now heard of Deadlock, the in-development MOBA from Half-Life maker Valve. Maybe you're even playing it, as part of the game's still-invite-only alpha playtest.
</p>
<p>
But are you playing the top-secret even more invite-only version? Probably not. (Although if you are, feel free to get in touch.)
</p>
<p>
The existence of an even more elusive version of Deadlock was spilled publicly last night when a top Deadlock streamer appeared to load up the wrong version of the game, beaming Valve's more-exclusive version to the world. 
</p>
<p>
This version of Deadlock includes a much larger character roster, as well as updated designs for some of the game's current heroes. New faces include the bellhop-styled Doorman, bespectacled Bookworm, and gothic Vampirebat, among many others. 
</p>
<p>
The streamer in question quickly shut down the game and deleted its archived version - but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">not before the internet inevitably took screenshots</a>.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">Streamer accidentally leaks hero roster of a more "secret" private Deadlock pre-alpha playtest build</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/atahutahatena/">u/atahutahatena</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Deathlock has been in early playtesting now for over a year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">leaks happening pretty much ever since</a>. Valve attempted to keep the game a secret for as long as possible, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">ultimately dropped its confidentiality requirement last August</a>, when a Steam page for the game finally appeared. 
</p>
<p>
Since then, though, Valve has simply kept working on Deadlock (and seemingly multiple versions) in the background, keeping the game invite-only. When will it publicly launch? There's still no word.
</p>
<p>
Matt Cox previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadlocks-biggest-update-yet-marks-a-threshold-moment-nows-the-time-to-grab-yourself-an-invite">checked out Deathlock for Eurogamer</a> back in February this year, and noted how a recent update felt "like a huge leap towards Deadlock's full release, but there's still plenty of time to go, as Valve makes a great game even greater".

            <p>The surprise release of Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered hasn't impacted the sales of French JRPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, its publisher has said.</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive's game was released last week from publisher Kepler and with support from Xbox, but some feared any success would be overshadowed by the Oblivion release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">leaked ahead of time</a>.</p>
<p>However, Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan has drawn a distinction between the two games, adding "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>

<p>"We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity," Handrahan told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a>. "When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p>
<p>"Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass‚Ä¶ so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p>
<p>According to data from Ampere, there's a 35 percent crossover between the two RPGs. On Xbox in particular - the number one platform for both games - 55 percent of Clair Obscur players also played Oblivion. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>
<p>This crossover percentage drops to 22 percent for Steam players, and 16 percent on PS5. However, average playtime on Xbox has been lower - likely due to players dipping in on Game Pass.</p>

</figure>
<p>Handrahan revealed Kepler didn't sign Clair Obscur straight away, but could see the potential of its battle system.</p>
<p>"My CEO, Alexis Garavaryan, had the most contact with them at [an early stage]," said Handrahan. "He saw the potential in it, but thought there were still some parts that needed a little bit more work. So Sandfall went away, did that work, came back, and on the second time of seeing it, our response was extremely, extremely quick."</p>
<p>When another publisher started looking at the game, Kepler had already snapped it up. "We were straight on top of it," said Handrahan. "If you find a game you like, if you find a game that excites you, you really have to act quickly. There's a lot of good games, but the really remarkable stuff comes along relatively rarely."</p>
<p>He also spoke to the game's promotion during Xbox's Summer Showcase alongside the likes of AAA first party games Gears of War and Fable. "It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way," said Handrahan. "Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hit 500,000 sales in just one day, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">quickly rose to a million copies in three days</a>.</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
