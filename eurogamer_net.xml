<p>Of course, Steam's most played games list tends to be dominated by multiplayer games - by their nature, they attract more players.</p>
<p>By contrast, the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> has a peak concurrent player count of 953,426, sitting at ninth in the all-time most played games.</p>
<p>Still, there's clearly interest in FromSoftware's multiplayer experiment.</p>
<p>The game is also available across PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-balance-adjustments-in-day-one-patch">day one patch is available to download</a>, which brings balance adjustments and bug fixes. However, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">FromSoftware has warned</a> some PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p>
