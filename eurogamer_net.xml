            <p>Gwent, the card game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, is finally getting a physical release.</p>
<p>It's been almost 10 years since the release of the video game, which has spawned a couple of spin-off card games in The Witcher: Thronebreaker and mobile app Gwent, but only now is a physical reproduction of the game being created.</p>
<p>The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to replicate the full experience from The Witcher 3, and will have variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p>

<p>It will cost Â£44 and arrive in Q3 2025.</p>
<p>The set is being created by Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games, which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming - an Asterix set is also planned for next year.</p>
<p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said Rob Trounce, marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK.</p>
<p>"After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package - whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p>

<p>It's got full backing from CD Projekt Red too, itself working on the next Witcher game. The company announced last week it has entered "full-scale production".</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke with the developer earlier this year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">learned more about the technical ambitions of The Witcher 4</a> and more.</p>
<p>Now we just need <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> to follow suit with a physical <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-going-to-lose-hours-playing-cards-in-final-fantasy-7-rebirth">Queen's Blood</a> set from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, right?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetEase Games' free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter Marvel Rivals has got off to a rather heroic start on Steam.</p>
<p>Following its debut earlier today, the game - which boasts a vast roster of characters from across the Marvel universe - has managed to already reach a peak concurrent player count of 444,286 over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/">Valve's platform</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, there are still 181,057 Marvel-ites (not sure that is actually a word, but let's go with it for now) still battling it out amongst each other. This number may well rise further again over the weekend, when we are free from the shackles of the work week.</p>

<p>It isn't all numbers and no praise. Marvel Rivals currently sits with a "mostly positive" review average on Steam.</p>
<p>"Marvel Rivals is proving that the competitive multiplayer space does indeed have room for new titles. Just gotta get the execution right," reads one positive review. "Finallyyyyyy, a game that's actually fun," adds another. "First off, the team is amazing, and the gameplay is fantastic - I just love it."</p><p>One area the game is receiving particular praise for, is its roster of characters. Prior to its launch, the team confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-next-five-characters-have-been-confirmed-heres-the-list">Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger, Iron Fist, Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine would all be joining the line up</a>. Other characters include Iron Man, Hulk and Scarlet Witch.</p>

<p>The game itself is described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", and one which on its announcement head of Marvel Games Jay Ong called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-is-a-free-to-play-pvp-shooter-where-heroes-and-villains-fight-together-and-against-each-other">one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects"</a>, and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
