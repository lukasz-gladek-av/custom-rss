            <p>A new report suggests Blizzard has partnered with Korean gaming giant Nexon - owner of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and The Finals studio Embark - to create a shooter of some kind based on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> brand.</p>
<p>The report, published on <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994">Korean site dnews</a> and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-to-reimagine-starcraft-as-a-shooter-secret-project-underway.1429834/">picked up by Resetera</a>, heard from "industry sources" that Nexon signed a "cooperation contact" last year with Blizzard "for content development related to the StarCraft IP". Nexon has reportedly set up a dedicated team for the project and is housing it in its shooting division, suggesting the game is a shooter. Not much is known beyond that, apart from famed StarCraft modder Choi Jun-ho has apparently been hired to guide the team.</p>
<p>This news follows suspicions from earlier this year that Blizzard is preparing a StarCraft-related announcement for BlizzCon this year, in September. Those reports in turn follow talk from last year that Blizzard is working on a StarCraft shooter. Respected reporter Jason Schreier, who'd written an insider-based book about Blizzard's history, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">told IGN</a> that, "They are working on a StarCraft shooter. StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard." Former Far Cry man Dan Hay is apparently in charge.</p>

<p>If this is true, it will be Blizzard's third known attempt to make a StarCraft shooter. The first attempt, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news270306ghost">StarCraft Ghost, was public and was cancelled almost exactly 20 years ago</a>. The second attempt was never announced but was said to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-reportedly-cancels-first-person-starcraft-shooter">codenamed Ares and cancelled in 2019</a>.</p><p>This wouldn't be the first time Blizzard has partnered with another company to adapt one of its major gaming brands. Relatively recently, Blizzard partnered with Chinese gaming giant NetEase to produce mobile game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>, which - even after a falling out between the two companies - remains a key part of the company's Diablo vision. Could Blizzard be doing something similar with Nexon?</p>
<p>Perhaps a more pertinent question is: if this is true, what kind of game will this be? Blizzard games are fundamentally about people playing together - it's one of the company's core tenets - so multiplayer will almost certainly feature in some way. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> is a futuristic multiplayer shooter too, so if this is true, how do you make a StarCraft shooter different enough to live alongside it?</p>
<p>Nexon is the Korean company that famously owns Arc Raiders studio Embark, but which also produced The First Berserker: Khazan last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> in 2023. It also runs a number of online games including Sudden Attack and MapleStory.</p>

            <p>Hey, remember Netflix's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> movie that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">is going nowhere</a> for the time being? No? We don't blame you, as we're having a hard time trying not to forget about it ourselves. Funnily enough, we continue to get more updates on Gore Verbinski's take on the material, which has been dead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-personally-killed-off-the-bioshock-film-heres-why">for nearly 13 years now</a>.</p>
<p>While promoting his latest movie (Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1qwyvlg/hi_rmovies_im_gore_verbinski_director_of_good/">on Reddit</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gore-verbinskis-bioshock-movie-would-have-somehow-included-both-of-the-games-endings">IGN</a>), the original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy director once again commented on that ambitious big-screen adaptation at Universal that was ultimately binned.</p>
<p>"I loved this project when we were getting close to making it at Universal... I was going to dive deeply into the Oedipal aspect and definitely keep it hard R with the Little Sisters, and the 'choices' the protagonist makes... and the consequences," he said at first. As a healthy reminder, this was a $200m R-rated movie that was unsurprisingly deemed too risky. But considering Verbinski's knack for both epic and creepy visuals, it probably would've been visually stunning at the very least.</p>
<p>We'd already heard how the project came undone and was shelved, but most of the creative deets had been locked away in a vault. This time around, Verbinski was chattier than usual, so he revealed a shocking approach to the game's conclusion: "I had worked out a way with writer John Logan to have both endings and I was looking forward to bringing that to the big screen and really f***ing with people's heads." The first game's two endings were all about showing the Little Sisters the best side of humanity and rescuing them... or harvesting their power to become more powerful yourself. A single murder ruined your chances of getting the good ending, essentially penalising players for chasing easier and faster upgrades.</p><p>Verbinski has shown in the past he's also quite good when it comes to loopy narratives (and A Cure for Wellness might be the best example in his career), so I'm also choosing to think he could've totally pulled off a dual ending which offers no definitive answer.</p>
<p>Nowadays, he admits he's still hearing about the current iteration of the project from time to time, but he's not sure "any studio is quite willing to go where I was headed." With Francis Lawrence (The Hunger Games series, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-long-walk-review">The Long Walk</a>) now at the helm and Netflix footing the bill if the project moves forward, there's a good chance the movie could retain some of the needed edge, but we're not expecting a $200m R-rated epic at this point.</p>
