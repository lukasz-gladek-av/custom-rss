            <p>Since the start of 2025, three studio closures along with multiple layoffs have been reported across the industry.</p>
<p>Studios closing down include Toadman Interactive, which developed titles such as  third-person shooter Immortal: Unchained and Hero Defense game Bloodsports TV. The studio also offered support on games including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries">MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on Toadman's closure, parent company Enad Global 7 <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/enad-global-7-initiates-a-wind-down-of-the-operations-in-toadman/">wrote</a>: "This decision does not come lightly and follows several initiatives to turn the subsidiary profitable, including the cost-saving measures executed last year. Ongoing Work-for-Hire (WFH) contracts with Daybreak and Cold Iron will be protected in this process, this means that a complete closure of activities will be optimized to fulfill the contract’s deliverables.</p>
<p>"This will have an immediate effect on all employees not engaged in these contracts."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, Enad Global 7 announced 38 employees at its Piranha Games studio will be laid off. These layoffs come after the most recent game in the studio's Mechwarrior series "performed below expectations".</p>
<p>"The team at Piranha truly delivered a high-quality game that exceeded both internal as well as external expectations in terms of quality, story and gameplay," said <a href="https://www.enadglobal7.com/press-releases/eg7-undertakes-business-optimization-at-one-of-its-studios/">Enad Global 7's CEO Ji Ham</a>. "Despite the phenomenal work by the team at Piranha, the game failed to reach new audiences and expand its core audience as anticipated and therefore has not met the necessary sales targets, which has forced us to undertake necessary actions."</p><p>As well as Toadman, Robocraft 2 developer Freejam has closed its doors. As reported by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocraft-2-canceled-freejam-shuts-down">Tech Raptor</a>, the developer wrote on its discord server that it will now be sunsetting games such as Robocraft 2 and its predecessor, as well as cardboard survival game CardLife. This will be happening "over the coming weeks".</p>
<p>The third studio to reportedly have closed its doors is Counterplay Games, the developer behind PlayStation 5 launch title, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/godfall">Godfall</a>. It was revealed the studio was "disbanded" last month, after it had worked with Jackalyptic Games on a project. "Unfortunately we were unable to continue our partnership into the new year and CPG was disbanded," a Jackalyptic Games employee wrote in a LinkedIn post (thanks, <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/01/10/ps5-launch-exclusive-godfall-dev-counterplay-games-disbanded/">PlayStation LifeStyle</a>).</p>

<p>These closures and layoffs follow last week's news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">Splash Damage had ceased development of Transformers: Reactivate</a>, and that it'll be "scaling down" the studio as result of the game's cancellation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League developer Rocksteady also recently suffered another round of layoffs</a>, this time just before the end of 2024.</p>
<p>It has been a rough time for the video game industry, and in the last couple of years there have been numerous layoffs and studio closures reported.

            <p>Photos purportedly taken on the set of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys-2">Five Nights at Freddy's 2</a> have leaked online, including shots of an ominously dilapidated Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-officially-in-the-works">announced the sequel back in April last year</a>, but we've learned very little since then, making these pictures - which include a rusty sign of the toy animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, and my girl Chica - particularly exciting for some.</p>
<p>It's still unclear if the upcoming movie will be faithful to the second game's prequel timeline which takes place in the late 1980s.</p>

<p>A fan has also allegedly <a href="https://x.com/katsterlingfan/status/1878219889090982325">spotted</a> "some FNAF merch being sold for a possible scene" in the sequel, too.</p> <div>

<p>Whilst not remotely official - so take all this with a healthy dollop of salt - these photos were reportedly taken in River Town, outside of New Orleans. Whilst the OP originally thought it little more than "a little [local] fair" and nothing special, they later saw signs indicating that the area would be closed to the public by 3pm, and then signs for "Extras" and "a bunch of trailers". So make of that what you will.</p><div>

            <p>Chinese megacorp <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has doubled down on its assertions that it is not a Chinese military company, saying that if the US Department of Defense does not "resolve any misunderstanding", it will "undertake legal proceedings".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2025/01/07/ed277c23e9fe0fc870fb9f02350e7658.pdf">public statement</a> - which the company said it makes on a "voluntary basis" - it stressed the firm was "neither a Chinese military company nor a military-fusion contributor to the Chinese defence industrial base" and that while the allegation "does not affect [Tencent's] business", the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">the US Department of Defense made a "mistake" when it publicly classified the firm as a Chinese military company</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the company insisted that the inclusion on the list was simply a misunderstanding, but this subsequent statement takes a much firmer line, saying: "The Company intends to initiate a Reconsideration Process to correct this mistake.</p>
<p>"During the process, it will engage in discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense to resolve any misunderstanding, and if necessary, will undertake legal proceedings to remove the company from the CMC List. The company will make further announcement(s) as and when appropriate."</p><p>As Tom reminded us when this first bubbled up last week, Tencent's reach across the global video games industry is enormous. It owns <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> maker Funcom and UK outfit Sumo Digital, in addition to several of its own companies, such as Pokémon Unite maker Timi Studios. It is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">in discussions with Ubisoft over a potential stock buyout</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speedrunners came from all over the world to "race through a bevy of games new and old", often with "zany incentives and challenges to drive donations", including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4AomNJHzHk">full-blown live concert</a> during <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Dr. Doot playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> with a saxophone as a controller - which is embedded above - and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmrIvD1UNFI">an opera performance by trained singer Xem</a> after completing his <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>: Going Commando run. </p>

<p>Since 2010, Games Done Quick has raised more than $54 million (£44.2m) for charities worldwide, including Doctors Without Borders, Malala Fund, Organization for Autism Research, and more.</p>
<p>Next up is Back to Black, the first all-Black speedrunning charity event, which will run 6th-9th February and benefit racial justice nonprofit Race Forward. Summer Games Done Quick returns to Minneapolis, Minnesota to raise funds for Doctors Without Borders in July.</p>

<p>Peanut Butter speedran Gyromite, a puzzle platformer released on the NES, in 26 minutes and 24 seconds, which is around a minute slower than his own world record, but well within the 30-minute slot he'd been allocated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
