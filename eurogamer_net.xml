<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/isabela-merced-house-of-the-dead-film-adaptation-last-of-us-1236711085/">Deadline</a>, the upcoming House of the Dead film is a "a top Sega priority" after the success of the company's Sonic the Hedgehog films. The adaptation is coming from Resident Evil director Paul W.S. Anderson, who has also written the script. According to the publication, Anderson's House of the Dead film will  have a "fresh take" on the franchise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">Anderson will also serve as a producer</a>, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. In addition, Sega's Toru Nakahara will produce along with Story Kitchen's Dmitri M Johnson, Mike Goldberg and Dan Jevons.</p>
<p>"The House of the Dead is a game I have loved for many years, and I'm beyond thrilled to be bringing this to the big screen with such an exciting talent as Isabela at its heart," Anderson said. "We envisage this as the start of a tentpole franchise which can explore the rich world and lore that Sega has created over a whole series of films."</p><p>Nakahara added: "Working with Isabela is a thrilling opportunity as she embodies the heroine character perfectly, bringing dynamic energy to the production. We're dedicated to crafting a visually striking and immersive experience by introducing compelling actors and terrifying creatures that will bring the House of the Dead universe to life on the big screen.</p>
<p>"With our deep understanding of video game adaptations, we're eager to deliver an electrifying cinematic journey for the franchise's fans."</p>
