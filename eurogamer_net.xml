            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Over the weekend, Sega accidentally leaked sales figures for a number of its key franchises, revealing - among others - the sales of its open zone game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>.</p>
<p>The numbers were accidentally included on the company's latest fiscal report and have since been swiftly removed, but not before fans shared the numbers on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-sammy-fiscal-report-mishap-reveals-sales-numbers-for-a-dozen-titles-lad-iw-1-66m-p3r-2-07m-sonic-frontiers-4-57m-p5r-7-25m-and-more.1224501/">ResetEra</a>.</p>
<p>Total sales of Sonic Frontiers were 4.57m, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a> was 2.43m, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-sonic-racing">Team Sonic Racing</a> was 3.5m. Meanwhile, as officially revealed by the company, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> sold 2.3m units.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the leak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a> has sold 7.25m units - as expected - while Persona 3 Reload just 2.07m units. Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth sold 1.66m units, and Like A Dragon: The Man Who Erased His Name just 960,000.</p>
<p>Sega also officially revealed Metaphor: ReFantazio sold 2m units.</p>
<p>The company critically had a great year in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> was well received by series fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was an outstanding new RPG, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> was one of the best-reviewed Sonic games in recent memory. But this reception seemingly hasn't translated to strong sales.</p>
<p>Still, the figure for Sonic Frontiers does stand out. Released back in 2022, it proves the game has had a long sales tail - even if that's been spurred on by discounts. And, as the pre-eminent 3D game in the series, its sales have continued alongside both the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3 films.</p>
<p>Back in November 2022, Sonic Team head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">Takashi Iizuka stated Sonic Frontiers' open zone design was the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>. There will be high hopes, then, for its presumed sequel.</p>
<p>Sonic Frontiers established the "open zone" design (rather than open world), which emphasised exploration as well as speed and took advantage of current hardware technology (despite its egregious pop-in).</p>
<p>Sonic Superstars, released a year later, has just over half the sales of Sonic Frontiers. A 2D game, it perhaps didn't sit well with fans after the forward-thinking Frontiers.</p>
<p>As for Sonic X Shadow Generations, it has sold well since its release last year, spurred on by the Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film. However, it's still a remake of an older game. And it seems, as much as Sega trades in nostalgia, it's the open zone advancement in design that fans have responded to with their wallets.</p>
<p>The fact Team Sonic Racing has outsold more traditional platformers also bodes well for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Team Sonic is heading in the right direction, and expectations will be high for the original game that follows Sonic Frontiers.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">discussed with Iizuka recently</a>, Sonic has gone from "fighting to survive" to a global megastar in the past 10 years.</p>
<p>"When I moved over from Tokyo to Los Angeles, it was like an â€˜oh my god' moment," Iizuka said. "Like, we need to save the brand, or this brand isn't going to be around for much longer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-leaked-sales-figures-show-sonics-new-frontier-is-heading-in-the-right-direction]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has passed one million sales, making it the best performing Funcom game ever.</p>
<p>Just 18 days since the early adopter launch, the game has managed to do what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> took a year to achieve. Even now, the game is pulling in roughly 175,000 concurrent player peaks.</p>
<p>In an infographic released alongside the milestone announcement it's been revealed players have been eaten by worms 816,720 times, 628,807 deaths have occurred in the game's endgame PvP Deep Desert, and 121,941 guilds have been formed among other interesting tidbits</p>

<p>The game kicked off to a mighty start and has shown little sign of losing momentum. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-hits-142000-concurrent-players-during-full-launch-smashing-past-record">blasted past 142,000 concurrent players on 10th June following its public release</a>. There's been a little bit of controversy via the PvP Deep Desert, as many players aren't finding the fun in perilous free-for-alls. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">The director initially stood firm on the direction of the endgame</a>, but has earlier today announced plans to expand the PvE portion of this region.</p>
<p>Alongside this future change to the Deep Desert, hints at what future major content updates will look like have also been revealed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">We know every three-to-four months a Hagga-Basin-style map should be added</a>, which should do wonders for the crowd who like popping back in to play every once in a while.</p>

"Dune: Awakening is a harsh survival game, an intriguing RPG, and a fierce open world PvP game all in one," it reads.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy has reportedly started the layoff process at the studio, after an underperforming launch.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">written by IGN</a>, states the developer has informed staff the redundancy process has begun, with sources claiming over 100 employees could be impacted.</p>
<p>A source who wished to remain anonymous told IGN the 45-day consultation process had begun, which according to UK law kicks into effect when over 100 layoffs are planned within a 90-day window.</p>

<p>This news comes after a launch which disappointed many eager fans waiting to play the game that had, originally, been touted as a rival to Grand Theft Auto. The game, since its release, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">plagued with bugs, performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-crashes-caused-by-a-memory-leak-developer-says-as-it-remains-committed-to-ensuring-all-players-have-a-great-experience">crashes</a>, and what many have called 'dated design'. Right now MindsEye is rated Mostly Negative on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">though a hotfix has been released</a> to improve the game for those still eager to give it a try. However, even after the patch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">things are still far from perfect</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though the publisher of MindsEye <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief when asked by IGN</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane wrote: "although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch]]></content:encoded>
