            <p>
Nintendo has suggested it's preparing to raise prices across a significant number of Switch products in Canada - including consoles, games, and even Nintendo Switch Online memberships - blaming what it calls "market conditions".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nintendo-switch-pricing-update-892304996.html">said</a> pricing for the Switch family of systems and products in Canada will "change" due to market conditions, with the company confirming Switch, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite are all affected, alongside Switch accessories. Physical and digital Switch games are also impacted, as are amiibo and Nintendo Switch Online memberships.
</p>
<p>
The company hasn't specified when these 'changes' will happen, but revised pricing for all impacted products is set to be shared on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/">Nintendo's Canadian store</a> from 1st August, suggesting that's when all this comes into effect. "Please note," it adds. "This pricing change does not apply to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> system, accessories, or software."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's decision comes amid ongoing trade uncertainty between the United States and Canada, and follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-orders-in-canada">brief pause in the company's Switch 2 launch strategy</a> - for both the US and Canada - earlier this year as it grappled with US president Trump's volley of tariffs.
</p>
<p>
While Nintendo ultimately elected not to increase the cost of Switch 2 in response, it did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">raise prices for various Switch 2 accessories in the US</a>, noting, "Other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions." It's unclear if the price "change" it's now announced for Canada will be expanded to other countries.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo isn't the only console manufacturer to change its pricing in response to recent global trade uncertainty, of course. Back in April, Sony revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">yet another price increase for PS5</a>, blaming a "challenging economic environment", and a month later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Microsoft followed suit</a>, confirming worldwide price increases for Xbox Series X/S and a bump to $80 for some of its games. Shortly after, Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-considers-further-price-rises-as-it-braces-for-500m-tariffs-impact">refused to rule out further price rises</a>, saying it was currently evaluating whether to "pass on" additional costs brought about by US tariffs to consumers.

11 Bit Studios has responded to criticism surrounding its use of generative AI in sci-fi game The Alters, insisting the controversial elements discovered by players were either "temporary" assets "never intended to be part of the final release" or used in a "very limited manner."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit, which has also developed the acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a>, found itself the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation">focus of controversy over the weekend</a> after evidence of AI-generated assets were discovered in The Alters - despite the studio failing to disclose their use on Steam, as mandated by Valve.
</p>
<p>
One image widely circulated on social media showed an in-game background display featuring a text-based "Captain's Log" conspicuously incorporating the giveaway generative AI phrase, "Sure, here's a revised version focusing purely on scientific and astronomical data". But it was the instances of shoddy AI-generated localisation - used alongside professionally translated text - that drew the most criticism. One Portuguese subtitle translation, for instance, began, "Sure! Here is the translated text into Brazilian Portuguese".
</p>
<p>
The discoveries weren't well-received, particularly given 11 Bit's failure to disclose its generative AI usage, but the studio has now responded, insisting some of the offending elements were used in error, while others were down to misjudgement. "We've seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters," it wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i">statement on social media</a>, "and we feel it's important to clarify our approach and give you more context."
</p>
<p>
"AI-generated assets were used strictly as temporary [work-in progress elements] during the development process and in a very limited manner," it insisted. "Our team has always prioritised meaningful, handcrafted storytelling as one of the foundations of our game."

"During production, an AI-generated text for a graphic asset, which was meant as a piece of background texture, was used by one of our graphical designers as a placeholder. This was never intended to be part of the final release. Unfortunately, due to an internal oversight, this single placeholder text was mistakenly left in the game. We have since conducted a thorough review and confirmed that this was an isolated case, and the asset in question is being updated." The studio also shared a screenshot of the controversial assets - including the Captain's Log display - as they appear in-game, adding, "While we do not want to downplay the situation, we also want to clearly show its limited impact on your gaming experience".
</p>
<p>
As for those controversial translations, 11 Bit suggested these were limited to a "few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base." It says these "externally produced" assets were made without the team being "involved in the creative process", and were "added at the final stage of development". As such, "last-minute" translations were required, said to account for "just 0.3 percent" of in-game text. "Due to extreme time constraints," 11 Bit continued, "we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localised using AI to have them ready on launch."
</p>
<p>
"It was always our intention to involve our trusted translation agencies after release as part of our localisation hotfix," the studio added, "to ensure those texts would be handled with the same care and quality as the rest of the game. That process is now underway, and updated translations are being implemented... The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English-speakers. In hindsight, we acknowledge this was the wrong call. Even more so, no matter what we decided, we should have simply let you know."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit didn't address why it had chosen not to disclose the use of AI-generated content on Steam, despite Valve's mandatory requirements, nor has it added the disclosure since being called out. "As AI tools evolve," it concluded, "they present new challenges and opportunities in game development. We're actively adapting our internal processes to meet this reality. But above all, we remain committed to transparency in how we make our games. We appreciate your understanding and continued support as we work towards that goal."
</p>
<p>
11 Bit isn't the only studio to face criticism for its generative AI usage, of course. Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> 3 studio Frontier Developments announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-3-is-ditching-its-ai-generated-art-after-some-initial-feedback">removing the game's AI generated scientist avatar art</a> in response to "some initial feedback", while Activision and Microsoft have respectively been criticised for producing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">AI-generated Call of Duty promotional art</a> and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-muse-microsofts-gen-ai-game-tool-everyone-hates-whats-really-going-on-and-why-is-it-being-marketed-at-xbox-fans">AI-generated playable demo "inspired" by Quake 2</a>. As Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale reported last year, however, for all the controversy surrounding AI, it's clear the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">technology is changing game development forever</a>.
