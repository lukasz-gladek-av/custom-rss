            <p>The Gears of War team is hosting a beta for Reloaded, which will allow participants to "experience all the curb-stomping mayhem of the versus multiplayer" across platforms.</p>
<p>The first round starts this Friday, 13th June, before wrapping up on 15th June. This weekend will focus on the classic Team Deathmatch mode, with the action taking place across maps Gridlock, Raven Down and Gold Rush.</p>

<p>A second beta weekend will then take place between 20th and 22nd June. This time, players will be able to try their hand at the King of the Hill mode, which developer The Coalition describes as "competitive", so bring your A game. King of the Hill will add the Canals map into the mix, with Courtyard and War Machine also popping up for use in Team Deathmatch.</p>
<p>In terms of timings, both weekends' events kick off at 12pm PST on the Friday, which is 8pm here in the UK. The weekends then conclude 48 hours later. If you are keen to participate in Gears of War: Reloaded's beta, there are three ways to get in. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preorder Gears of War: Reloaded digitally for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox on PC, Steam or PlayStation 5</li>
<li>Have an active Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass membership</li>
<li>Own a digital copy of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition (although, you will need to have purchased your copy prior to 5th May)</li>
</ul>
<p>Those that do pre-order Gears of War: Reloaded, along with Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC members, will receive two multiplayer character skins: Adam Fenix (Marcus' old man) and Anya Stroud (the "guiding voice of Delta Squad").</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> is set to receive further updates, including "difficulty reduction", following the release of its Overture DLC.</p>
<p>In a video from director Jiwon Choi, he stated the development team is grateful for feedback and suggestions from players since the DLC was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-shadow-dropped-during-summer-game-fest-following-new-gameplay-trailer">shadow-dropped last week at Summer Game Fest</a>.</p>
<p>"We're reviewing all of it carefully and are already looking into when to implement some of your suggestions," he said. "Among all the feedback, we are paying the closest attention to the combat experience.</p>

<p>"We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended," he continued. "Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction.</p>
<p>"However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in Lies of P, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing."</p>
<p>The details and date for the next patch are unknown, but the director is clearly keen to keep the game's community up to date with the development process. It follows a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519715574346941123">patch alongside the DLC that's added plenty of quality of life changes</a> to the base game.</p>
<p>Since the DLC's release, players have criticised Overture for its high difficulty. In particular, on NG+ even regular enemies are proving challenging.</p>
<p>What has perhaps exacerbated this is that the DLC is only accessible once you reach chapter nine of the main game. It means that, if like me, you started a NG+ run after finishing the game, you'll need to play through it again to reach the DLC. I suspect a lot of players are therefore attempting Overture for the first time on NG+ rather than starting the base game again, raising the difficulty level beyond what was intended for a first run.</p>
<p>While Overture is a paid expansion for Lies of P, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc">base game has received a free update adding new difficulty levels</a>. The original difficulty is now normal, while two easier difficulty levels have been added.</p>
<p>This addition is somewhat controversial for soulslike games, which are known for their high challenge, but it's also ensuring the game is more approachable for a wider audience. And, for me at least, it's making racing through the base game to get to the DLC a lot quicker on easy mode!</p>
<p>Still, it's clear that balancing the difficulty is proving a challenge for the developer with this additional expansion. But that's something even FromSoftware struggled with when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> expansion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> was released - it was criticised by some for being too difficult and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-revises-shadow-realm-blessing-balance">subsequently adjusted</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
