            <p>First-person puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-talos-principle">The Talos Principle</a> is set to receive a "radically overhauled reawakening" in a new, definitive edition.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle: Reawakened, as it's suitably known, will feature an all-new chapter as well as visual and quality of life improvements courtesy of Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>It's coming in early 2025 to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, once again courtesy of developer Croteam and publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a>. Check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The original game's DLC Road To Gehenna will be included, while the new chapter In The Beginning will expand the narrative with an origin story.</p>
<p>A new level editor will also be added, aimed at the modding community, though this will only be in the PC version.</p>
<p>Developer commentary, meanwhile, will provide a behind the scenes look at development.</p>
<p>The game will follow last year's sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-talos-principle-2">The Talos Principle 2</a>: "an ambitious sequel that explores bold, if unambiguous territory in its philosophical robot puzzling", according to our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-talos-principle-2-review-a-thought-experiment-to-puzzle-over">Eurogamer review</a>.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle was first released in 2014 on PC, with multiple console versions following. It received critical acclaim for its challenging puzzles and philosophical musings.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

CD Projekt originally planned for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> to briefly visit Night City from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, years before the latter launched.
</p>
<p>
The idea has been discussed by the developer before, but an impressive datamining project has now uncovered the work-in-progress script for the scene, which would have seen Geralt and Avallac'h turn up in CD Projekt's future setting - and not be overly impressed by what they found.
</p>
<p>
This moment would have come as part of The Witcher 3's Through Time and Space questline, and acted as an Easter egg for fans hoping to get a glimpse at what CD Projekt was building next.

As found by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/witcher-3-modders-just-upended-everything-we-know-about-how-it-was-made-with-a-584-page-breakdown-of-an-early-prototype-that-had-a-150-hour-main-quest-all-thanks-to-a-database-containing-almost-every-single-line-of-text-from-its-development/">What Lies Unseen</a>, and highlighted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/witcher-3-modders-datamine-a-quest-where-geralt-would-have-teleported-to-night-city-from-cyberpunk-2077-technologically-advanced-but-broken-dying/">PC Gamer</a>, the script for the sequence - as it was back around 2012, three years before the final version of The Witcher 3 launched - would have been as follows:
</p>
<p><code>Geralt: What... What is this place? Is this the afterlife?<br>
Avallac'h: No. Just another of the realities the Spiral leads through... Technologically advanced, but broken. Dying.<br>
Geralt: Disgusting. This stench, noise... How can you live here?!<br>
Avallac'h: You should know better. This world is inhabited by humans, not elves.<br></code></p><p>
Insight from What Lies Unseen includes that CD Projekt also planned to have Geralt toss a coin to a begger who would then turn up in Cyberpunk 2077, rich from your Novigrad gold.
</p>
<p>
In the end, Through Time and Space remained in The Witcher 3 - albeit with different sequences that saw Geralt pingpong between the Ddiddiwedht Desert, a poisoned valley, an underwater section and an icy tundra. Less exciting.
</p>
<p>Perhaps, now Cyberpunk 2077 is out, this idea might be easier to make happen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>? CD Projekt recently confirmed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">next project has entered "full production"</a>, and Eurogamer recently revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">the technical ambition, optimism, and timeframes the developer is working to for it</a>. Perhaps that could look forward to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiplayer-being-considered-for-cyperpunk-2077-sequel-says-cd-projekt">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Games Workshop and Amazon Studios have now officially finalised their plans to bring Warhammer 40K to film and TV screens.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">companies have long been in discussion</a>, with actor and Warhammer superfan Henry Cavill set to star and executive produce thanks to his "lore expertise".</p>
<p>Now we have an official statement, with Games Workshop offering Amazon the exclusive rights to both films and television series, as well as merchandising rights.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://investor.games-workshop.com/news-posts/agreementwithamazonforfilmsandtelevisionseries101224">legal notice</a> adds: "Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years."</p>
<p>However, a more <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/">casual statement to the community</a> notes that multiple "stories" are planned, with synopsis and ordering finalised. The first project is "about to go into development proper" - the script is next on the agenda.</p>
<p>"Of course, as with all carefully crafted things, this all takes time... and trust us when we say, everyone involved is las-focused on getting it all just right," reads the statement.</p>
<p>Cavill also shared the news on Instagram, together with his own "pilgrimage" back to the model shop where he bought his first Warhammer models.</p>
<p>"My incredible team and I, alongside the brilliant minds at Games Workshop, have been working away in concept rooms, breaking down approaches to the enormity and magnificence of the Warhammer world," he wrote in the post.</p>
<p>"Together, we've been sifting through the plethora of incredible characters and poring over old tomes and texts. Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though - more to come in time!"</p>

<p>This won't be the first time the companies work together, though, as there's a Warhammer 40K episode in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">Amazon's forthcoming Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate the series, Warhammer 40K: Space Marine is one of a handful of games available for free through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-second-batch-of-december-titles-to-celebrate-secret-levels-arrival">Amazon Prime Gaming this December</a>.</p>
<p>Its sequel, released earlier this year, was hugely successful, becoming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/space-marine-2-most-successful-steam-launch-for-warhammer-40k-series">most successful Steam launch for the Warhammer 40K series</a>.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-ceos-supposed-comments-raise-eyebrows-for-saying-games-should-be-about-glory-kills-not-imposing-morals">comments supposedly from the CEO of developer Saber Interactive</a> raised eyebrows for stating that games should be about "glory kills" instead of "imposing morals on gamers".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
