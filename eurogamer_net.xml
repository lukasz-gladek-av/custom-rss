            <p>
Inkle - the studio behind Eurogamer favourites including Heaven's Vault, A Highland Story, and 80 Days - has unveiled its latest narrative-rich adventure: 1920s boarding school mystery Expelled!, which is coming to PC, Switch, and mobile on 12th March.
</p>
<p>
If Expelled rings a distant bell, that might be because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highland-song-studio-inkle-teasing-1920s-mystery-at-miss-mulligatawneys-school-for-promising-girls">it was originally teased last June</a>, under the name Miss Mulligatawney's School for Promising Girls. At the time, details were scant - its Steam description merely contained a flyer for the titular academy promising, "The best education the 1920s have to offer!" - but now all has been revealed.
</p>
<p>
Expelled is being pushed as a follow-up to Inkle's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/get-away-with-murder-in-inkles-surprise-new-game-overboard">well-received 2021 ocean liner whodunnit Overboard!</a>, and is described as a "next-gen visual novel with a wicked twist". It sees players attempting to clear their name following the fenestration-based attempted murder of a boarding school prefect, all by mounting their own investigation - which might also involve a spot of blackmail and betrayal, depending what they're willing to do to avoid expulsion.

<p>
All this sees players - in the role of scholarship student Verity Amersham, voiced by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler - navigating the simulated story world of a 1920s boarding school (in which students and staff move around independently in real-time, remembering everything they see and responding appropriately) in order to eke out truths and exploit secrets. Players have just one day to solve the mystery and escape punishment through subterfuge and cunning - perhaps even choosing to frame someone else if it'll save their bacon.
</p>
<p>
Inkle says one playthrough of Expelled should last no more than 45 minutes, but each run features new leads and opportunities making it "massively replayable". And it's not just a question of avoiding expulsion; players can also work toward other targets, such as rising to the position of head girl, or solving further mysteries - such as uncovering your best friend's dark secret. And all this is accompanied by a jazz soundtrack featuring music from the likes of George Gershwin, Paul Whiteman, Louis Armstrong, and Bessie Smith.
</p>
<p>
Expelled!: An Overboard! Game launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2963890/Expelled/">Steam</a>, Switch, iOS, and Android on 12th March.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has revealed the theme of its next season, which will launch in just over a week's time, on 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Lawless, as the season is titled, will be the second during the game's Chapter 6 era. Intriguingly, while that began with a distinctly Japanese setting, a first look at next season suggests more of a 'bad bits of LA' vibe.
</p>
<p>
So, what can we see? From a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1889691128221372868">teaser image</a> posted to social media, there's a broken neon Hotel sign and burning wood in a barrel, and what look like discarded gold bars littering the street following some kind of quick getaway. Fortnite is once again going for a bank vaults and heist theme then, it seems.
</p>

<p>
Wanted posters feature a new version of fan-favourite gold lover Midas, now sporting a mullet, and an anthropomorphic pickle man called "Big Dill". These are almost certainly skins set to feature in the season's new battle pass.
</p>
<p>
Big Dill the pickle man looks to be Fortnite's latest fruity character, in the style of Peely the banana. Eagle-eyed Fortnite fans will have spotted the current battle royale Island's pickle farm growing over the past season from a small farm to a giant factory. Is Big Dill its latest produce?
</p>
<p>
Last month, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-cant-believe-this-is-true-but-wickeds-biggest-song-features-a-hidden-fortnite-cameo">hit film Wicked features Fortnite sound effects during a pivotal scene</a>. Work is also continuing on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-x-fortnite-collab-moves-into-stable-branch-exactly-a-year-after-disney-invested-15bn-in-epic-games">Epic Games' big new Fortnite Disney offering, which is now mid-development</a>.
