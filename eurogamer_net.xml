            <p>
Images that look to have been taken inside Rockstar's San Diego office have been posted online, showing a computer screen with what appears to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> running. 
</p>
<p>
As a video game leak, the purported image of GTA 6 itself is essentially meaningless - it simply shows main character Lucia standing next to a wall and some crates. What's more, the image appears to date from the summer of 2021, three and a half years ago.
</p>
<p>
What's unusual here is that the image has been taken within the bowels of Rockstar's own offices, and posted online by someone who seems happy enough to live with the consequences. 
</p>
<p>
The photo and two accompanying video clips, which show a brief glimpse at more of the office surroundings, were first posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F98ox9ku1jfae1.jpeg">reddit</a> by user JustLovett0 around 17 hours ago. "Someone I am close to took it when they worked at the Rockstar office for a few months," they wrote of the image, on a post titled "a photo from mid-2021. I think it's been long enough I can post this."
</p>
<p>
What's shown of the office itself looks relatively generic, though it's clearly the Rockstar San Diego building based on the shape of the windows and frontage that can be seen outside. 
</p>
<p>
Desks nearby house PlayStation and Xbox developer kits, one of which is labelled with a code beginning "SAND", presumably a reference to San Diego.
</p>
<p>
When asked whether their friend was worried about being traced, JustLovett0 wrote: "He is super far from Rockstar now, doesn't work there or in any related field. I'm not worried but I'll probably delete the post soon enough.
</p>
<p>
"Hopefully there's no camera footage from 3.5ish years ago."
</p>
<p>
The post has since been removed, though has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hratml/reupload_of_the_guys_gta_6_leaked_photo_vids_from/">reuploaded</a> elsewhere on reddit. Eurogamer has contacted Rockstar for comment. 
</p>

Back in September 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">a teenage hacker from the UK stole an enormous swathe of in-development GTA 6 footage and files</a>. The now-notorious leak remains one of the most prominent in video game history. Its culprit was later arrested, though was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/teenage-gta-6-hacker-given-indefinite-hospital-order">ultimately deemed unfit to stand trial</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>'s director has appeared to contradict Microsoft, stating the game's Xbox delay is due to the Series S's memory limitations. This is something that the Xbox maker has previously denied.</p>
<p>Writing on Chinese social media platform <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223">Weibo</a>, Black Myth: Wukong producer and Game Science CEO Feng Ji said the Xbox Series S's memory is the reason behind the game's delay on Microsoft's consoles. Lamenting Black Myth: Wukong's absence on Xbox in an otherwise good year for the studio (it recently scooped up a number of awards at the Steam Awards), the director wrote:</p>
<p>"But that 10G shared memory, I can't really get it without a few years of optimisation experience" (translated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukongs-game-director-blames-the-xbox-series-s-10gb-of-memory-for-the-xbox-version-being-delayed.1072326/">ResetEra</a>).</p>

<p>In September of last year however, Microsoft said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">delay to the game's Xbox release of Black Myth: Wukong was <em>not </em>due to "platform limitations"</a>. At this time, there was also chatter that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">Black Myth: Wukong team had entered into an undisclosed exclusivity deal with PlayStation</a>.</p><p>"As we have said before, we're excited for the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> on Xbox Series X/S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms," Microsoft said at the time. "We'd prefer not to comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders but we can confirm that the delay is not due to Xbox platform limitations that have been raised to us."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to both Xbox and Black Myth: Wukong developer Game Science for clarification on the game's Xbox delay.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong broke records on its debut by becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">the most popular single-player game by peak concurrent users in Steam history</a> and establishing itself as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-to-attract-record-breaking-numbers-of-players">most-viewed game on Chinese live-streaming platforms</a> on its first day of release.</p>
<p>It went on to be nominated for Game of the Year at the 2024 Game Awards, however it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2024-winners-list-who-won-what-this-year">ultimately lost out to PlayStation platformer Astro Bot</a>. Following this, Game Science's CEO posted a lengthy statement regarding the action game's apparent snub, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-producer-on-the-game-awards-top-prize-snub-i-came-all-the-way-here-for-nothing">he felt like he "came all the way here for nothing!"</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
