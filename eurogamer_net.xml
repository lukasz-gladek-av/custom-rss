        <p>"Having one single owner simplifies a lot of things."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Newly independent PC digital game shop GOG is interested in getting into publishing indie games - something it apparently couldn't do while part of CD Projekt Red.</p>
<p>It's a notable change for a company that's focused primarily on restoring classic old games as well as selling some newer games - notably CD Projekt Red games - since its launch 17 years ago. But it's one of the areas Michał Kiciński, the company's new owner, told me this newly untethered company can now step into.</p>
<p>"I'm also co-owner of an indie game publishing company called Retrovibe," Kiciński said - Retrovibe being the publisher responsible for retro-styled games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/893680/Project_Warlock/">Project Warlock</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1183800/Shardpunk/">Shardpunk</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1640320/BIOTA/">BIOTA</a>. "So one of the directions which were not that much possible in the past is evolving GOG more into publishing business, and that's something we will certainly discuss.</p>
<p>"No decisions have been made yet," Kiciński added, "but this opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red as one group, because at CD Projekt Red, all publishing activities were connected with their own games, and they didn't want to spread attention into some other topics."</p><p>GOG had before now always been part of CD Projekt, the parent company of CD Projekt Red, but as the company evolved away from game distribution and more towards making its own games, CD Projekt Red grew to encompass the totality of what CD Projekt did and does. That's why GOG was put up for sale last year.</p>
<blockquote><em>"This opens a whole new area of activities for GOG which was not that much possible together with CD Projekt Red"</em></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seeing-red-the-story-of-cd-projekt">Kiciński was one of the founders of GOG, coincidentally, and a co-founder of CD Projekt</a>. But he hasn't worked at the company since 2012, since before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, remaining only as a major shareholder since.</p>
<p>Leaving the safety of CD Projekt Red's orbit might seem like a challenging thing to do, given the prestige of that company and the excitement surrounding its games. GOG leveraged those games with attractive price promotions and enjoyed an elevated position courtesy of its proximity to CD Projekt Red. But the gravitational pull of that burgeoning studio worked both ways.</p><p>"It's quite a common business situation when you have two entities of very different sizes in one group, and naturally, the attention and resources goes to the bigger part and the smaller part has <em>some</em> benefits but also has some difficulties in being a much smaller brother in such an environment," Kiciński said.</p>
<p>The upside for GOG, now that it's privately owned and entirely by Kiciński, is there are no investors to worry about, so decisions can be made quickly and perhaps be riskier as result. GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski noticed the opposite thing creep in during the past 10 years he's been there, as the company grew massively following the release of The Witcher 3.</p>
<p>"CDPR, since I've joined the company, grew so much and became a much more complex organisation, stretched across continents," Gołębiewski said. "GOG is a fairly small and nimble company. Having one single owner simplifies a lot of things in terms of potential decision making or risk appetite. A big company that's listed on a public stock exchange: it's probably a little bit more complicated or complex to execute risky stuff."</p>
<p>"That's a good point," Kiciński added. "I know from the other projects I'm involved in, the decision making process is super easy. I'm super accessible and decisions can be made fast, and also, I'm not afraid of risk as a private investor."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We have a big appetite for the growth of GOG"</em></blockquote>
<p>Besides a possible move into publishing games, there aren't plans to dramatically change what GOG does. The founding principle of finding and restoring old games that no longer work remains a strong one, as does selling games with no DRM. And the close relationship with CD Projekt Red will continue, courtesy of a six-year deal that offers very favourable rates on GOG, I'm told.</p>
<p>It probably also helps that the two companies are neighbours, housed inside the same office complex, and that Kiciński is a major CD Projekt shareholder. The two companies might be separate but they're not entirely separated. Not yet.</p>
<p>But it's early days. The deal was only completed in mid-December and Kiciński wasn't sure it would go through until it did. There were rival bidders. So his first day back in the office today, 8th January when we spoke, marked the proper start of figuring out what's next.</p><p>"What we agreed already is that GOG can improve on what's doing right now," he said. "We also discussed that there is no need for any pivots or changes in philosophy or something like that. GOG has a very special place on the market, very unique values, very loyal customers, and we appreciate that, and we want to build up on that, not changing too much. So that's what was discussed. And we already started discussing the publishing activities possible with GOG.</p>
<p>"And that's it. Then we have a few weeks and months to work out the bigger strategy for the future. But for sure, we have a big appetite for the growth of GOG."</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">Developer Direct stream from Xbox</a> is happening next week, and with it we'll get a "deep dive" into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>. This is the previously announced next entry in the open-world driving series, which will take us to Japan. However, a surprise may have been spoiled early.</p>
<p>Via user <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925?s=20">XBOX INFINITE on X/Twitter</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/14/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leaks-in-fh5/">Xbox Era</a>), we've received what could be the first look at an in-game promotion of Forza Horizon 6 and its pre-order bonuses. When asked about the screenshot, the user claims they got the pop-up after exiting their garage in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>.</p>

<p>The pop-up is placed on top of new art showcasing one of the stunning environments we can expect to visit during the next Horizon Festival. Pre-orders allegedly include an extra vehicle: "Pre-order now and get a pre-tuned and exclusive Ferrari J50 in Forza Horizon 6!"</p>
<p>There's also the promise of "over 550 real-world cars" at launch and the largest open-world in the series yet, with the Premium Edition adding Early Access (on 15th May, thus making the regular release date 19th May), VIP Membership, Welcome Pack, Car Pass, Time Attack Car Pack, and a post-launch Italian Passion Car Pack plus two Premium Expansions. It's all believable if you've been paying attention to past entries and their DLC offerings.</p><p>Xbox and Playground Games haven't confirmed or denied anything yet, but it wouldn't be the first time an in-game pop-up in previous games has revealed what's next in a series, so I'm personally leaning towards someone having pressed a button way too early. Oops.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 is currently set to release exclusively on Xbox Series X/S and PC (Xbox and Steam), but a PS5 port at some point is likely, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-5-ps5-port-tops-5-million-sales-securing-300m-in-additional-sales-for-xbox">its predecessor has already sold over 5m copies on Sony's console</a>.</p>

            <p>Japanese video game developer Cygames has released a new statement regarding its use of AI, after last week announcing its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cygames-ai-studio-formed">intention to create an AI-focused subsidiary company</a>, which stirred up a certain amount of discourse.</p>
<p>Writing on social media platform X, the studio - which is known for a variety of popular games including Umamusume: Pretty Derby - apologised for the "concern" it had caused. It added its original announcement was a "simplified" one, which did not address "any of the current problems and social debates" around generative AI.</p>

<p>Cygames stated that art produced via generative AI is not used in its products, and all of its current games have been "crafted from the technical know-how and manual work" of its staff. It furthered that the studio "won't implement generative AI into [its] products without prior notice" to the community.</p>
<p>On the topic of its community, the studio said it holds those of us who love games - including creators and artists - "in the highest regard". Cygames intends to continue honouring free expression while striving to deliver "the best in entertainment", it closed, with another apology to its fans and supporters.</p>

<p>You, of course, don't need me to tell you how rampant the AI discourse in the industry is at the moment. Just this morning, we reported on Hazelight founder Josef Fares' thoughts about the technology, where the developer said he doesn't see AI "taking over", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-and-it-takes-two-director-josef-fares-doesnt-see-ai-taking-over-but-admits-who-knows-what-happens-in-the-future">nor does he see any issue with using AI as long as it isn't generative</a>. Meanwhile, a number of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">other Japanese studios such as Square Enix</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">Sega have expressed interest in AI use</a>.</p>
<p>As for Cygames, Umamusume: Pretty Derby <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">won the best mobile game award at last year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>
