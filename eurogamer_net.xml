            <p>The upcoming third season of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation will feature a new actor playing WLF member Manny.</p>
<p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/exclusive-the-last-of-us-season-3-set-to-recast-danny-ramirez">nexuspointnews</a>, Danny Ramirez has departed the show due to scheduling conflicts. As such, the role is now being recast, though who will fill Manny's shoes is yet to be determined.</p>

<p>As well as The Last of Us, Ramirez is also known to many as Joaquin Torres/Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He is due to appear in Avengers: Doomsday, as well as in the upcoming Jean-Michel Basquiat biopic Samo Lives.</p>
<p>As for Manny, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-adds-danny-ramirez-tati-gabrielle">when Ramirez was first announced to be joining The Last of Us</a>, the showrunners described his character as "a loyal soldier whose sunny outlook belies the pain of old wounds and a fear that he will fail his friends when they need him most".</p><p>Ramirez's Manny joined fellow newcomers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, Tati Gabrielle as Nora, Ariela Barer as Mel, Spencer Lord as Owen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">Catherine O'Hara as Gail </a>and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Isabela Merced as Dina</a> for the second season of The Last of Us. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, meanwhile, reprised their roles as Joel and Ellie.</p>

<p>Ramirez is not the only key team member to be leaving the show for season three. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer.</p>
<p>While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p>
