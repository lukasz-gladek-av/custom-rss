            <p>Competitive ITV show Hell's Kitchen is now blowing up as an experience in Roblox, with a cartoony version of Gordon Ramsay at the fore.</p>
<p>Since its debut last month, ITV's first-ever Roblox experience has had over 20m visits from aspiring chefs, and boasts 450k daily active users happy to have the show's celebrity chef express disdain at their dishes.</p>
<p>As with Hell's Kitchen on telly, those who participate in the official Roblox experience will be popped onto either the Red or the Blue team. And, while I haven't seen word that Ramsay will call users an "Idiot Sandwich", his Roblox counterpart still shares his disappointment if food isn't up to snuff.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox announced further tools designed to improve the safety of its young audience</a>. These tools included the ability for parents to remotely manage their child's account, view their child's friends list and limit the amount of time made available to play.</p><p>This move followed frequent criticism that the platform was not doing enough to ensure the safety of its audience, which is predominantly children. In July of last year, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Origin, EA's universally-disliked PC storefront and launcher launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reveals-steam-rival-origin">back in 2011</a>, will finally shut down this year, on 17th April.
</p>
<p>
EA has, of course, long since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-ditching-origin-brand-with-new-ea-desktop-app-as-part-of-ongoing-rebranding-efforts">replaced Origin with the EA App</a>, which isn't much better. 
</p>
<p>
From mid-April, any PC users still using Origin will need to switch in order to continue accessing their library of games and gameplay data.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/">statement</a> on EA's support website, the publisher states that it is finally killing off Origin as "Microsoft has stopped supporting 32-bit software". 
</p>
<p>
"If you use Origin, you need to upgrade to the EA app, which requires a 64-bit version of Windows," EA notes.
</p>
<p>
If you have a relatively new PC with a 64-bit version of Windows, downloading the EA App now and ensuring your game saves are ported over is probably a good idea. 
</p>
<p>
Cloud saves should carry across automatically, though games without cloud support will need manual save migration. 
</p>
<p>
Don't have a 64-bit PC? Then it's bad news. "To run a 64-bit version of Windows, make sure your PC has a 64-bit-capable processor," EA helpfully states. "If your PC doesn’t have one, you'll need to use a newer computer to play your games on the EA app."
</p>
<p>
EA typically <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-ea-is-returning-to-steam">also now launches its PC games on Steam</a>, of course, including last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.

            <p>An MMO based on Sony's Horizon IP has reportedly been cancelled.</p>
<p>We first got wind of a Horizon MMO in 2022, when a report stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmo-reportedly-in-the-pipeline">project was in the works at Guild Wars' NCSoft</a>. At this time, a source familiar with both Sony and NCsoft said the two companies had "tentatively agreed to pursue a business partnership in which [NCsoft] will create new games using Sony's promising game IP".</p>
<p>A year later in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-report-of-horizon-mmo-ncsoft-and-sony-announce-strategic-partnership">Sony and NCsoft publicly announced a strategic partnership</a>, designed to "expand beyond console and broaden PlayStation's reach to a wider audience". While neither company referenced Horizon as part of the announcement, it was widely believed the series was a key part of the collaboration.</p>

</figure>
<p>Since then we've heard little more, other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-mmorpg-is-now-essentially-confirmed-to-be-in-development-job-listing-suggests">job listings shared in 2023 which appeared to confirm the Horizon MMO was in development</a> with the codename Project Skyline (with the initial codename being Project H). And now, it appears the MMO has been cancelled before it was even officially announced.</p><p>A report by Korean publication <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025011314314667267">MTN</a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horizon-mmo-developed-by-ncsoft-has-reportedly-been-cancelled.1087482/">ResetEra</a>) states work on Project H and a number of other projects has ceased following a "feasibility review" at NCSoft. "Among them, 'H' and 'J' have already disappeared from the company's organisational chart," reads a translation of the report.</p>
<p>The Horizon MMO was reportedly set for a release on PC and mobile. Eurogamer has reached out to NCSoft and Sony with regards to today's report.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> has been adapted into an official manga comic.</p>
<p>The first chapter is available to read digitally now in English on <a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/viewer/1023739">Manga Plus by Shueisha</a>, while in Japan the manga will feature in V Jump magazine.</p>
<p>The comic comes from artist Yoichi Amano, who previously worked on the Dragon Quest Treasures adaptation, based on Atlus' RPG.</p>

</figure>
<p>So far, this first chapter closely follows the story of the game and uses the canonical name for the young protagonist: Will.</p>
<p>It begins with the ambush from the opening of the game and sees Will exploring the Royal Capital Grand Trad, subject to prejudice, and remembering the past through flashbacks. It's all very familiar if you've played the game.</p>
<p>At least, at first. The manga changes the way Will meets fan-favourite character Strohl leading towards the climax of this chapter, suggesting it won't be a simple recreation of the game. Perhaps other character interactions will be switched up too?</p>
<p>Either way, expect plenty of chapters to run through Metaphor: ReFantazio's lengthy narrative that merges RPG conventions with political commentary in a rich fantastical world.</p> <div>

<p>"Persona veteran Atlus flexes its expertise with a fresh take on high fantasy," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Metaphor: ReFantazio game review</a>. "What it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart."</p>
<p>The game proved popular for Atlus, selling a million copies in its first day to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-surpasses-1m-sales-on-launch-day-to-become-fastest-selling-atlus-game">the developer's fastest-selling game</a>.</p>
<p>The adaptation follows similar work by Kadokawa to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-manga-turns-the-game-into-a-farce">adapt Elden Ring into a manga comic</a>, though its Tarnished protagonist is a hopeless hero. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-elden-ring-anime-adaptation-delayed-but-new-teaser-trailer-shows-work-in-progress">fan-made Elden Ring anime adaptation</a> is also due later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
