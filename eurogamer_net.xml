            <p>A former boss of Amazon Games has detailed why the company couldn't compete with Valve's Steam platform for PC sales.</p>
<p>Ethan Evans was VP of Prime Gaming at Amazon until September 2020, and in a recent post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ethanevansvp_as-vp-of-prime-gaming-at-amazon-we-failed-activity-7295834479036702720-cDmX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAVvKbEB4BSwtr1FhSqcqk72HAWxOtwQlK0">LinkedIn</a> he detailed how Amazon "failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam".</p>
<p>"We were at least 250 times bigger, and we tried everything," he wrote. "But ultimately, Goliath lost."</p>

<p>Amazon tried three times to enter the "online-game-store market", said Evans. The first was by acquiring the small PC games store Reflexive Entertainment and trying to scale it, but this "went nowhere".</p>
<p>The second, after Amazon bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, was to create its own PC games store and utilise the Twitch audience for sales. "Our assumption was that gamers would naturally buy from us because they were already using Twitch," said Evans. "Wrong."</p>
<p>The third effort from Amazon was its Luna streaming service, which competed with Google's own ill-fated Stadia - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stadia-is-shutting-down-in-january">shut down in January 2023</a>. Luna remains live, but Evans admitted neither Amazon nor Google's efforts "gained significant traction". "The whole time, Steam dominated despite being a relatively small company (compared to Amazon and Google)," he said.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? "The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam," said Evans. "It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well."</p>
<p>He continued: "At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.</p>
<p>"We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so. And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either.</p>
<p>"Just because you are big enough to build something doesn't mean people will use it."</p>
<p>Amazon still has its Prime Gaming subscription, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-another-20-games-in-february-including-one-for-xbox">this month includes BioShock 2 Remastered and Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>And after publishing multiple MMORPGs, Amazon Games' next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">King of Meat from ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers</a>.</p>
<p>Steam, meanwhile, has just seen its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-lands-series-second-biggest-start-on-steam">concurrent player numbers peak once again</a> this month, hitting 39.92 million online users.</p>
<p>Steam's other big competitor, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-has-more-pc-players-than-ever-295-million-in-fact">Epic Games Store, also now has more players than ever</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bossa Games, the London-based company behind indie hits <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/surgeon-simulator">Surgeon Simulator</a> and I Am Bread, has announced a second wave of job losses - just a year after it previously shed a third of its staff.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/">statement posted to LinkedIn</a>, company co-founder Henrique Olifers said Bossa had been forced to make "the painful decision to scale back" its size once more.
</p>
<p>
The company will now focus all its efforts on getting its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">open-world airship adventure Lost Skies</a> out the door, before "reshap[ing] into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how many staff have been impacted by these latest layoffs, though Olifers wrote that the changes meant the studio would be "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time".
</p>
<p>
"We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back or teams," Olifers continued, "but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour."
</p>
<p>
The co-CEO blamed the action on a "fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams", though did not elaborate further how Bossa had been affected in particular.
</p>
<p>
At the start of 2024, Bossa was thought to employ around 60 people, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-studios-lets-go-a-third-of-its-staff">layoffs saw 19 jobs lost which Olifers blamed on a "perfect storm of events"</a> at the time: higher development costs, funding delays, and a tougher market for indie games.
</p>
<p>
It's been four years since Bossa last shipped a game - I Am Fish. It remains best known for Surgeon Simulator, which it launched in 2013 and followed up with various other versions for smartphones, Switch and VR.
</p>
<p>
Bossa had previously received funding from NetEase, the Chinese giant that is currently pulling back from many of its gaming studio investments across the globe. 
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tinybuild-acquires-bossa-studios-ips-for-3m">Bossa sold the rights to I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator</a> to US indie publisher TinyBuild, generating a reported $3m.

            <p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-more-netease-studios-like-quantic-and-grasshopper-at-risk-as-firm-reportedly-seeks-buyers">reports circulated over the weekend that NetEase is allegedly pulling back on its international game investments</a> by "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios", NetEase-owned Rebel Wolves has reached out to assuage fears, reiterating that NetEase is a minority shareholder.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to LinkedIn, Rebel Wolves' chief publishing officer and co-owner, Tomasz Tinc said he was aware of the "rumoured situation" but said that Rebel Wolves' ownership largely rested in the hands of studio employees.</p>
<p>The company is currently at work on The Blood of Dawnwalker, a project headed up by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, who is also a studio co-owner.</p>

<p>"First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues," Tinc wrote.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves. NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder."</p>
<p>Tinc also confirmed that production of he Blood of Dawnwalker is "fully funded", and it was working alongside the studio's partners and publisher Bandai Namco to "bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life".</p>
<p>NetEase's backtrack arguably commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese megacorp <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Obsidian's fun and colourful <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> doesn't sound like a one-and-done effort by the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Avowed arrived last week to a positive reception, and now a Bloomberg interview with the game's director Carrie Patel includes the suggestion we'll see more of the franchise from Obsidian.
</p>
<p>
Asked whether Patel's next project would be something new, the director said that work on more Avowed content - be that for this game, or sequels - was more likely.

</figure>
<p>
"Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it," Patel said.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian has invested more than six years in Avowed, and longer in its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> universe. Development on the project began in 2018, two years prior to the company's acquisition by Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Initially planned as a multiplayer version of Skyrim with a massive open world, Obsidian ditched the game's online component relatively early on. After Patel came on board to lead the game in 2021, the decision was then made to also switch the game's map from open world to multiple large open zones. The game also ended up leaning further into the Pillars of Eternity universe's lore than initially planned, too.
</p>
<p>
"With any game you think, 'OK, we can't climb every mountain  - which ones are really worth the effort for us?'" Patel said. "We knew from The Outer Worlds that we could build a really great game with open zones, and that also adds some advantages in terms of letting you really theme your areas more distinctly and intentionally, and provide a sense of progression as the player's going from one environment to the next."
</p>
<p>
"What Avowed lacks in gloss it makes up for with charm, depth and a playful heart," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>. "It's one of this year's most pleasant surprises."
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-studio-plans-to-make-its-100th-birthday-by-staying-lean-and-invested">Obsidian said it was planning to still be open for its 100th anniversary</a> - in another 78 years - by staying "lean and invested".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A former Nintendo employee has predicted the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> will launch in June, with a release date announcement due in the forthcoming Direct in April.</p>
<p>The employee, known only as Sean, was sales lead in Nintendo's sales and retail department and appeared on the Kit and Krista podcast - also former Nintendo employees.</p>
<p>"They're going to want the system to be out before the end of the summer," said Sean, discussing a potential release date for Switch 2. "I would say at the start of the summer - end of school year, so you've got the kids in school talking about what they're excited for.</p>

<p>"I think we'll see a June launch, I'm thinking probably mid-June, maybe a little bit later than that. But definitely before the end of the summer that thing's coming out."</p>
<p>There are "good strategic reasons" for this, he said, from that end of school year point, to the ability for retailers to sell Switch 2 bundles at Christmas time. If the console launches at the end of the year, it means "something wasn't ready", Sean suggested.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 hands-on tour</a> begins in April and ends in June, too.</p>
<p>Another point of discussion in the podcast was the price point, specifically the upper limit.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine it being too much more than $400… maybe $450 is the highest I can imagine," said Sean.</p>
<p>That's based on him not knowing the specific tech specs, though he's "sure" the Switch 2 will have an Nvidia chip and be the next generation of the existing Switch chip. Further, he doesn't think it will have an OLED screen as Nintendo will be making "trade-offs" to hit a specific price point.</p>
<p>What's more, the original Switch likely won't drop in price right away at Switch 2's launch. "Don't be surprised if Black Friday comes around and you can get an OLED Switch for a smoking good deal," he said.</p>
<p>Sean also had some ideas to assist with pre-orders and the launch. That included using pre-orders to judge retailer allocation, but how can Nintendo know it's a real pre-order and not a scammer? Sean suggested tying pre-orders to Nintendo Online accounts when purchasing direct from the company, either to prioritise those pre-orders or require it.</p>
<p>This is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-hits-snooze-on-alarmos-public-release">Nintendo required for sales of its Alarmo clock</a>, which Sean suggested was an intentional test ahead of Switch 2 pre-orders.</p>
<p>Another idea he had would be that consoles arrive with software preloaded on them, based on the games customers purchase. This is by no means confirmed, but just a cool idea he'd love to see implemented.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sean dispelled the myth that retailers had information now on Switch 2's launch. Retailers know "nothing" at this point, he said, be that price or launch date. Any articles from retailers are just them guessing, not leaking actual information.</p>
<p>"When we know the launch date, that's probably when retailers will know the launch date, or maybe a week or two in advance of that," he said.</p>
<p>At the start of the month, Nintendo revised its financial forecast as it failed to hit sales targets with the current Switch, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-boss-says-switch-2-anticipation-not-to-blame-for-falling-switch-1-sales">president Shuntaro Furukawa said this wasn't due to interest in the Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo Direct on the Switch 2</a> will take place on 2nd April, where we'll presumably hear about the release date and price.</p>

<p>Also on the way is Mortal Kombat's Madam Bo Kameo fighter. Initially, she only appeared as a minor NPC in the story campaign, but now she's making her fighting debut, too.</p>
<p>T-1000 and Madam Bo are arriving with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-dlc-announced-animalities-t-1000-conan-and-screams-ghostface-all-on-the-way">Mortal Kombat 1 DLC Khaos Reigns</a>, which will expand the game's story campaign with an all-new cinematic narrative.</p>
<p>"When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger," reads the <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-223900046.html">official blurb</a>. "If they fail, the New Era will be reduced to anarchy."</p>
<p>Kombat Pack 1 - which includes additional fighters to add to the roster - and is out now and contains Omni-Man (Invincible), Quan Chi, Peacemaker (DC’s Peacemaker), Ermac, Homelander (The Boys), and Takeda Takahashi.</p>
<p>T-1000, however, is coming as part of Kombat Pack 2, alongside Scream's Ghostface, Conan the Barbarian, Noob Saibot (voiced by Kaiji Tang) Cyrax (voiced by Enuka Okuma), and Sektor (voiced by Erika Ishii).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza has found its sea legs on Steam, where it launched to the series' second-biggest concurrent player haul to date.
</p>
<p>
A peak of 22,327 PC players played Pirate Yakuza over the weekend, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3061810/charts/#1w">Steam's own stats</a> - avast total higher than every other game in the franchise to date, save Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Steam itself broke its all-time concurrent user record once more - this time to hit 39.92 million online users. Prior to this, the record stood at 39.3 million, from back in December 2024.

<p>
While a better start than most of the (many) other Yakuza/Like A Dragon games, including 2023's Like A Dragon: Ishin! and The Man Who Erased His Name, RGG Studio's nautical spin-off still saw around half of the players at launch as last year's Infinite Wealth, which peaked at 46,161 concurrent players total.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, Pirate Yakuza is most definitely a spin-off from the main series. On the other - pirates!
</p>
<p>
"A raucous, absurd spin-off that manages to still feel like a first-rate Yakuza game despite the leftfield setting and delightfully unhinged plot," Matt Elliot wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Eurogamer's Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza review</a>. "All of this somehow coalesces into something that works in defiance of itself."

            <p>Actor Yuri Lowenthal, the voice behind Peter Parker in Insomanic's games, has confirmed the original Spider-Man won't be sidelined in the series' third chapter.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Lowenthal stated there were "very few things" he could say about Insomniac's yet to actually be announced next Spider-Man game right now, but assured fans that "Peter is not gone" by any means.</p>
<p>"He will be a part of the next game and he won't be relegated to the couch, I promise," Lowenthal said. <strong>Beware some Marvel's Spider-Man 2 spoilers below.</strong></p>

<p>Those who have completed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> will know that the game ends with Peter Parker essentially handing the webby torch over to Miles Morales. While Miles as Spider-Man will take care of New York, Peter was going to focus more on his personal life with Mary Jane, and also build the Emily-May Foundation after it got fairly ripped to shreds during the fight with Venom.</p>
<p>The game then rounds out with two mid-credits scenes, clearly pathing the way for that third entry. The first of these scenes sees Norman Osborn - devastated by his son Harry's comatose state, and who blames the Spider-Men for ruining Harry's recovery - popping over to The Raft to visit Dr Octavius. He seems on course to become the Green Goblin, one of the Spider-Man series' main antagonists.</p>
<p>A second scene focusing on Miles' family introduces us very briefly to his mother's new boyfriend Albert Moon, and Albert's daughter, Cindy. Cindy Moon, for those unaware, is another person in the Marvel universe who gets bitten and given powers by a radioactive spider. She becomes the superhero Silk.</p>
<p>Guides writer Marie and I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-marvels-spider-man-2">chatted at length about where the next game could go following Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, and we theorised Miles may take Cindy under his wing and show her the Spidey ropes much like Peter did with him. At first we assumed this would mean Peter would have more of a 'cameo-like' role in the next game, but given what Lowenthal has said, it seems he may have a bigger role than first thought.</p>
<p>What are your hopes for Peter and co in the next Marvel's Spider-Man game?</p>

<p>While Lowenthal's comments have sparked plenty of chatter, Marvel's Spider-Man 3 is perhaps still a way off. After all, the studio still has its Wolverine release in the works.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">Wolverine was first teased back in 2021</a>, during a PlayStation Showcase. At this time, the studio stated the game was still "very early in development". Last month, Insomniac's newly appointed studio head Chad Dezern acknowledged the "pent up excitement" around the game, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">refrained from confirming or denying a 2025 release window for Wolverine</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
