            <p>Bandai Namco's shuttered MMORPG Blue Protocol project has been extended a new lifeline courtesy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded developer Bokura.</p>
<p>At the end of August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Bandai Namco announced plans to shut down the servers of its anime MMORPG Blue Protocol</a> in Japan and cancelled its release in the West altogether, saying "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>

<p>Now, however, Blue Protocol has been reincarnated as Star Resonance, with some of its original development team joining the new one at Bokura. Although set in the same world as Blue Protocol, Regnas, the team said Star Resonance players can expect a reworked gameplay and storyline.</p>
<p>And it seems Bokura has hit the ground running, too. A <a href="https://bpm.bkrgame.com/web202412/news-detail.html?newsid=18543902">closed beta test</a> is already planned for players on Android devices and PC, although sadly, that's only open to Chinese players for now.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no firm release date either in China, Japan, or beyond. Blue Protocol's servers are due to go dark on 18th January 2025 (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namcos-unsuccessful-mmorpg-blue-protocol-to-be-reincarnated-as-star-resonance-by-chinese-studio/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Ed went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol last year</a>, which was set to follow the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO. However, he had concerns of whether the game could differentiate itself from its key competitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A year has now passed since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-things-we-noticed-in-the-gta-6-trailer-you-may-have-missed">Rockstar's record-breaking first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer</a> landed, and there's been no real news on the game since.
</p>
<p>
While some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-fans-think-rockstars-hidden-yet-another-clue-in-the-moon">fans look to GTA 6's moon for word on when we'll hear more</a>, others are taking matters into their own hands - by going back to last December's trailer and using it to build bits of the game for themselves. 
</p>
<p>
There are several shots in the video below by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FyfT3zs3mQ">Dark Space</a> that, at a glance, could be mistaken for the real thing. The video shows a street from Vice Beach and some of the  downtown Stockyard area recreated using custom assets and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> engine.

Later, Dark Space mocks up a rumoured cutscene, where players will apparently hook a chain to a safe to rip it out of a pawn shop using a truck. As they say, it'll be interesting to see how close to the final game all of this looks - whenever the time comes.
</p><p>
There's also a section where we see the estimated size of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map from above, as a plane flies over both it and the GTA 5 map at the same speed. The inferrance here is that GTA 6's map will be bigger than its predecessor's - though this was to be expected, and exact measurements are likely best saved for the final game.

Rockstar publisher Take-Two has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6 set to launch in late 2025</a>. Next year is a big one for the company, with Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country both also set to arrive between April 2025 and the end of March 2026.

This isn't the first time the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-reveal-trailer-brilliantly-recreated-in-real-life">GTA 6 reveal trailer has been recreated</a>. Earlier this year, fans remade the video using real-life footage and actors.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has released a new job trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Mobile, showing its touchscreen battles for the first time.</p>
<p>The UI for Final Fantasy 14 - as with many MMORPGs - is particularly complex, with each job (or class) having multiple abilities mapped out on a player's hotbar. With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">announcement of Final Fantasy 14 Mobile</a>, many players wondered how this would transition to a mobile touchscreen.</p>
<p>Well now we know. The trailer - <a href="https://weibo.com/tv/show/1034:5108677439324201">shared on Chinese social media site Weibo</a> - includes battle animations for all of the nine starting jobs, with their various job actions located in the bottom right of the screen around a large central primary attack used for continuous combos.</p>

<p>Players can then cycle through abilities, with cooldowns clearly displayed, while health and MP are located at the bottom of the screen as always.</p>
<p>It's tidy but, personally, looks far too small. When some jobs have up to 11 abilities to choose from, those ability icons look impossible to accurately select, while the fonts are tiny.</p>
<p>The trailer also does not include any character movement during battle, perhaps suggesting a simplified battle system without positionals (attacks where position around an enemy is vital for dealing damage). This also means there's no dodging of AoE attacks in this trailer, though perhaps that's indicative of a lazy player relying too much on their healer (we all know this from bitter experience).</p><p>Speaking of healing, the Scholar and White Mage jobs are the only characters in the trailer to switch targets (all others face a single enemy). It's still unclear how switching between friend and foe will work, though appears to be a quick direct tap of the screen - something else that could get fiddly in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Still, it's impressive to see running and appears faithful to the original experience. Fans appear particularly impressed by the Monk and Summoner animations.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 Mobile will be free-to-play without gacha, and will follow the base game A Realm Reborn.</p> <div>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>'s fourth season starts tomorrow, marking the beginning of the end for Rocksteady's current roadmap.</p>
<p>From 10th December, players will be met with DC supervillain Deathstroke. The developer shared news of his debut with an image on social media platform X, although further details on the upcoming season for now remain pretty thin for now.</p>
<p>Rocksteady has thus far only committed to four seasons of content for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. It shared its <a href="https://x.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1749494429768146999/photo/1">2024 roadmap back in January</a>, promising new weapons, environments, gear and more. Things kicked off with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-first-post-launch-season-includes-playable-elseworlds-joker">arrival of The Joker in March</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-second-season-adds-frozone-esque-mrs-freeze">Mrs. Freeze joined in the summer</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-three-debuts-to-less-than-300-steam-players">Zoe Lawton joined for Kill the Justice League's third season</a>. However, her debut didn't particularly spark much enthusiasm among players. Perhaps Deathstroke will have better luck.</p>
<p>Then, after season four comes to an end, who knows what is going to happen with Suicide Sqaud: Kill the Justice League. It is fair to say the game failed to take off the way Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. had hoped.</p>

Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>A report then followed in July, which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega has announced a sequel to its official Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba game, based on the popular manga and anime series.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 will arrive next year across PC via Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and the "Nintendo Switch family of systems".</p>
<p>Like the first game, this will be an arena fighter with a story mode continuing where the original left off. It follows teenage protagonist Tanjiro Kamado and promises fans will be able to "relive many of the exciting moments from 'Entertainment District Arc', 'Swordsmith Village Arc', and 'Hashira Training Arc'".</p>

<p>Over in VS mode, the game will have a huge roster of 40 characters, including a return of all characters in the original game, its free post-launch updates, and paid DLC.</p>
<p>The nine Hashira (the highest rank of the Demon Slayer Corps) will also join in the sequel, including Muichiro Tokito and Mitsuri Kanroji.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles has sold over 4m units worldwide following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-demon-slayer-game-heads-west-in-october">release in 2021</a>, so there's certainly an appetite for this sequel.</p>
<p>The games are developed by CyberConnect2, the Japanese studio known for other anime and manga adaptations like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-z-kakarot">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/naruto-ultimate-ninja">Naruto: Ultimate Ninja</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2's troubled development was due to "passionate managers" not getting along, the series' creator Michel Ancel has said.</p>
<p>The sequel to the cult classic adventure has been in development for almost 20 years (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">longest in history</a>), and has continued despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-quits-video-games-industry-to-work-on-wildlife-sanctuary">Ancel leaving Ubisoft back in 2020 due to retirement</a>. His departure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-says-michel-ancel-left-ubisoft-amid-investigation-into-his-toxic-behaviour">followed an investigation into allegations of toxic leadership</a> by French newspaper Libération.</p>
<p>Ancel has not spoken publicly about the game's development since, but in a new interview with French outlet <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/">SuperPouvoir</a> he has now discussed some of the tensions and accusations made against him.</p>

<p>Passion is a "fabulous energy", said Ancel, but can also lead to clashes. For BG&amp;E2, he stated how the game's art director had wanted to redo everything over and over, that the game's director had wanted a game of generated dungeons, while he "dreamed of a space adventure".</p><p>The trio were unable to agree on a direction, with the development team left not knowing who was ultimately in charge. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot even visited the Montpellier studio, Ancel said, but it wasn't enough and "the game director continued in his stubbornness", said Ancel.</p>
<p>"When I read in Libé that I was the one who was directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was choking," Ancel said. "BG&amp;E2 is the game on which I think I have never questioned a decision.</p>
<p>"In the end, it is all a matter of passionate managers who have not gotten along. I believe that for some time now, these people have been let go and the project has found a certain balance with new leaders."</p>
<p>Ancel added there's a "huge difference" between developing BG&amp;E2 with new technology, and a project with established technology. This complexity "exceeded many people at Ubisoft".</p>
<p>He surmised there was no "single big villain" but multiple concerns left unresolved with managers. "I have my share of responsibility and I should have defended the project better, been more present and more conciliatory with the employees," he concluded.</p>
<p>According to the Libération report into Ancel's toxic leadership, his management of the project resulted in constant changes and fluctuations in scope, leading to "an unusual amount of [staff] exhaustion, depression, and burnout".</p>
<p>Ancel also discussed the end of WiLD, the project from his Wild Sheep studio originally announced in 2014 that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-prehistoric-open-world-adventure-wild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled">reported as having been cancelled in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Though a playable version had been established in 2018, Ancel said the studio chose to upgrade the game from PS4 to PS5. However, despite Sony offering double Ubisoft's budgets to take on the game as publisher, it was turned down and remained with Ubisoft.</p><p>This was during Ancel's burnout and subsequent departure from the industry. Without him there to defend the game, he said, it was "crushed" by Ubisoft due to changes made "without really playing the game", which Ancel described as "a real scandal". The game was later abandoned in 2020 due to no longer matching the original vision.</p>
<p>He added the "editorial department was in full explosion" at this time due to Ubisoft's internal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-exec-tommy-francois-leaves-company">investigation into former editorial vice president Tommy François</a> who had overseen development of WiLD, who was reportedly then fired.</p>
<p>Ancel joked 2018 was therefore "the beginning of the end" for both WiLD and BG&amp;E2, in his eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains in development</a>, it was confirmed again in October this year, with a new creative director once again at the helm.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The first update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-developers-super-thrilled-its-headed-to-playstation">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is here, available across PC and Xbox.</p>
<p>Along with a variety of fixes, this update has notably added full ray tracing (with path tracing) for Nvidia GPUs on PC. The Indy team said you will need to have a minimum of 12GB VRAM to get the most out of this feature, however.</p>

<p>Other PC-specific fixes include improved performance on larger game levels for those players using an 8GB VRAM video-card, and a fix for torch or lighter flames flickering when playing the game at a high refresh rate.</p>
<p>More generally, across platforms, photos that Indy takes when out and about should now appear more quickly when inspecting them from the journal. On the UI side of things, the Adventure Book list will now get updated immediately after unlocking a new book.</p><p>There are also a fair smattering of mission fixes, however I won't go into specifics here to avoid spoilers.

<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm and a real eye for spectacle," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Marvel Rivals' roster of current and upcoming characters includes Marvel Cinematic Universe stalwarts such as Iron Man, Hulk, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Wolverine and Groot, along with other fan favourites such as Iron Fist, Cloak and Dagger and, of course, Squirrel Girl. (Seriously, when is she getting her MCU debut?)

As for how it plays, well, Marvel Rivals has been compared to Blizzard's hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, over the weekend, Blizzard's former boss - the ever-chatty Mike Ybarra - suggested Marvel Rivals was as much of an Overwatch copycat as the widely-discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Horizon Zero Dawn clone Light of Motiram</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-boss-blasts-marvel-rivals-similarity-to-overwatch">Ybarra also seemed to suggest Marvel Rivals had copied Overwatch's character of Widowmaker</a> for Black Widow. The character - played by Scarlett Johansson in the MCU - was created by Marvel legend Stan Lee in 1964.
