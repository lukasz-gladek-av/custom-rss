            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fresh Battlefield 6 details have emerged from a reliable leaker ahead of its big trailer reveal tomorrow, including word the latest instalment of EA's beleaguered shooter series is eyeing up an October release date and an €80 price tag on consoles.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/battlefield-6-date-de-sortie-editions-prix-precommande-on-vous-devoile-toutes-nos-infos-inedites-60267">Dealabs' consistently reliable Billbil-kun</a>, whose sources claim Battlefield 6's previously rumoured 10th October release date is accurate, and that the game will launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in both Standard and Phantom Edition forms - costing €79.99 and €109.99 respectively on consoles and €10 less on PC.
</p>
<p>
As to what the Phantom Edition actually <em>is</em>, it's supposedly a digital-only special edition featuring unspecified in-game content, which Standard Edition owners can upgrade to at any time via a €29.99 Phantom Pack. It's also claimed there'll be no early access with any version.
</p>
<p>
Battlefield 6 pre-orders will reportedly open next Thursday, 31st July, one week after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-is-finally-getting-a-reveal-trailer-tomorrow-heres-when-and-where-you-can-watch-it">game's grand trailer unveiling</a>, which is officially scheduled to take place tomorrow, 24th July, at 4PM BST/8AM PST. This, of course, should also be the point we find out if all of the above is true.
</p>
<p>
We already know some of what to expect, of course, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">various playtest leaks</a> and EA's early confirmation Battlefield 6 would feature a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">modern-day setting, classes, and more</a>. It's going to have to be a pretty special, however, if the publisher has any hope of reaching its<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller">reported 100m player target</a> across Battlefield 6's main game and a separate free-to-play battle royale - a particularly lofty goal after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">disastrous Battlefield 2042</a>.
