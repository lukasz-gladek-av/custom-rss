            <p>Since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> released, there has been much discussion about the game's performances. While all are exemplary, and saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">Jennifer English and Ben Starr receive nominations for Best Performer at this year's The Game Awards</a>, there has since been debate over what exactly it means to be nominated in this category.</p>
<p>You see, another Clair Obscur actor to receive a nomination at The Game Awards was Charlie Cox, known for the likes of Daredevil and Stardust, who provided the voice of the game's protagonist Gustave. However, the character's motion performance was done by French actor Maxence Cazorla.</p>
<p>Back in November, Cox said while he was of course delighted to see his contribution to Clair Obscur recognised, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-charlie-cox-thrilled-by-game-awards-nomination-but-says-gustaves-mocap-actor-deserves-the-credit">as much of the applaud needed to go to Cazorla</a> as well. "Any nomination or any credit I get, I really have to give to him, because I really believe that the performance of that character is down to him, and my voice was just part of that process," Cox said. I recently had the oppertunity to sit down and chat with Cazorla about all things Clair Obscur, and of course our conversation soon turned to Cox's comments.</p>

<p>"First of all, it was an incredible honour for me that Charlie spoke publicly and acknowledged my work. I was deeply moved by his humility and generosity," Cazorla told me, before he shed more light on the process of bringing Gustave to life.</p><p>"We started by doing the performance capture without any particular constraints, approaching it like a film, learning the lines, playing the scenes, and following Guillaume's direction," Cazorla said. "Once the shoot was done and the scenes were integrated into the game engine by the cinematic team, that's when the voice actors stepped in and recorded their performances."</p>
<p>He added that his part in Gustave's overall character and Cox's "happened at different stages of the process", something that "is very common in game production". Cazorla explained once the physical side of the performance was locked in, Cox then went into the studio to record Gustave's lines. "I only discovered the final result months later, directly in the game," Cazorla shared.</p>
<p>"In the end, it's really the combination of these two performances, along with the incredible writing and development work, that gave birth to the character."</p>
<p>But, how did Carzola feel to not receive a nomination for his part in Gustave's character development? Does he feel awards shows should change how they recognise performances generally.</p>
<p>"When it comes to a potential motion capture category, I think it's a delicate subject, because every game is built differently," Carzola replied. "In this case, Clair Obscur is a game where many of the characters are created through collaboration between two actors. For example, Maelle with Charlotte Hoepffner and Jennifer English, Lune with Estelle Darnault and Kirsty Rider, Verso with Ben Starr and myself. Other games might have a single actor doing full performance capture, and some projects even involve stunt performers, motion capture actors, and voice actors all contributing to the same character."</p>
<p>As such, Carzola believes "the fairest way to celebrate performers" is to "celebrate the character" instead.</p>
<p>"That's something the DICE Awards already do, and I think it's a very intelligent approach. If you reward Gustave as a character and his impact on players, you acknowledge Charlie Cox for the voice, myself for the performance capture, but also the writers who shaped his personality, the character artists, and everyone who contributed to bringing him to life."</p><p>Closing, Carzola said: "Video games are, by nature, a collaborative art form, and characters resonate because many artists give them their soul. Celebrating a Best Character category feels more logical to me than isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible."</p>

<p>If you want to hear more from Carzola , my full chat with him is going live in the coming days. Here, the actor discusses how he found out about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, his audition and meeting the team at Sandfall, performing the motion capture for several of the game's characters, and much, much more. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>New details have been revealed regarding the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-file-class-action-lawsuit-over-cancelled-kotor-2-dlc">Knights of the Old Republic 2 false advertisement lawsuit</a> for Switch consoles. This includes an argument made by one expert brought in by Aspyr who stated that the fan-made Restored Content mod the missing DLC was based on had "no economic value".
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-kotor-ii-lawsuit-saga">This information comes from Game File</a>, which broke down the legal battle between developer Aspyr and an individual who sued the company after DLC advertised in a trailer for the Switch version <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-kotor-2-switch-dlc-cancelled-after-third-party-objection-says-aspyr">was cut from the full release</a>.</p>
<p>This report claims Aspyr made several arguments in an attempt to curb the lawsuit, which ended in a settlement earlier this year. These include the claim that the tease for the DLC couldn't have been widely seen, as it appeared at the end of a YouTube trailer. Aspyr's own lawyers argued: "Many YouTube viewers skip [videos] after the first five seconds."</p>

<p>Aspyr also reportedly brought in additional documents in April, including expert testiomy from former Blizzard product manager Frank Gilson. He explained the restored content mod the DLC was based on was fan-made and offered for free. It therefore had no "economic value", a belief that stemmed from the fact the community creates these mods and doesn't charge for them. </p><p>The lawsuit would progress further onto even more colourful topics, including accusations of demonic possession, stemming from a claim that an Aspyr attorney yelled at his client: "as if possessed by a demon". This framing was rejected by the attorney in question, who said he raised his voice so he could finish his sentence and return the conversation to "productive discussion".</p>
<p>There was also the claim it could take decades to learn the appropriate email address in order to get the rights to make a Star Wars game. This comes from a redaction of certain email addresses in documents filed this April. These were redacted as: "[...] they reveal a key trade secret; the identities of the right persons to work with at Lucasfilm to secure access to Lucasfilm intellectual property. Those contacts reflect years, sometimes decades, of work cultivating relationships and revealing them would cause Aspyr lasting business harm."</p>
<p>For a full breakdown of the legal saga that is the KOTOR 2 Switch port, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-kotor-ii-lawsuit-saga">the story can be read in at Game File for paying subscribers</a>.
</p>
<p>While this particular chapter in the Kotor saga was a bit of a messy one, there is hope for fans of the series. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-revealed-from-knights-of-the-old-republic-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson">During The Game Awards, Fate of the Old Republic</a> was revealed, alongside the news that Casey Hudson would be involved. Hudson was famously involved with the original Knights of the Old Republic game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>.</p>

            <p>The rebooted 2013 Tomb Raider made its Switch debut just a matter of weeks ago, and thanks to the "passionate response" from the community, port developer Aspyr may now consider bringing the trilogy's final two entries to Nintendo's platform as well.</p>
<p>The Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy kicked off when the team at Crystal Dynamics dropped an inexperienced and somewhat naive Lara Croft on the storm-riddled shores of Yamatai. Her story then continued in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, which took Lara to Siberia, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, where the trilogy concluded in the sweltering jungles of South America.</p>

<p>Of course, many Switch players are now wondering if these last two entries in the most recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> will eventually make their way to the platform as well, and allow them to finish Lara's rebooted arc.</p>
<p>"We have definitely seen this question," <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/aspyr-explains-how-it-approached-the-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-tomb-raider-definitive-edition-patches-planned/">Aspyr told Nintendo Everything</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-fans-might-get-the-entire-tomb-raider-survivor-trilogy-thanks-to-their-passionate-response">Nintendo Life</a>). The studio added it has already reintroduced Nintendo players to the classic era of Tomb Raider with its remasters of the first six games in the series.</p>
<p>"We've successfully brought back the classic era (1-6) and now the 'origin story' of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms," Aspyr said when asked about future Tomb Raider ports of Rise and Shadow.</p>
<p>"We can't announce anything at the moment but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities," the studio closed. So, would you like to see Rise and Shadow of the Tomb Raider arrive on Switch consoles?</p>

<p>Along with Tomb Raider 2013 arriving on Switch, this month has been a rather exciting one for fellow fans of Lara's. At The Game Awards, two new games were also announced to be in the works. The first - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">a remake of the original Tomb Raider known as Legacy of Atlantis</a> - is due to be released next year. Then, in 2027, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-tomb-raider-catalyst-sits-on-the-series-timeline">all-new series entry known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst will arrive across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam</a>.</p>
<p>There is also Amazon's live-action show still to come, with filming beginning next month. Cast members so far include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver as a character called Wallace</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-tomb-raider-series-adds-white-lotus-star-to-the-cast">Jason Isaacs in an undisclosed role</a>.</p>

<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mobile-game-octopath-traveler-champions-of-the-continent-due-this-year">Octopath Traveller: Champions of the Continent released in Europe and North America</a>, adding controversial gacha mechanics to the series.  Then, in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveler-2-announced-for-nintendo-switch">Octopath Traveller 2 was released</a>. This too proved popular among RPG lovers, iterating on the original and garnering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-some-missteps-octopath-traveller-2-is-a-little-more-refined-than-its-predecessor">a new wave of positive critical reception</a>. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-june-titles-announced">also had a stint on Xbox Game Pass</a>, offering a nice boost.</p><p>Fast forward to this year and we've got Octopath Traveller 0, a recreation of the aforementioned Champions of the Continent without all the oozing microtransactions. It's not perfect by any means, but remains a pleasing RPG experience despite its faults. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveler-0-experiment-failed-square-enix-rpg">Eurogamer's Dom Peppiatt described the game as</a>: "an interesting experiment in trying to make a traditional game out of gacha elements, it's just not a very successful one."</p>
