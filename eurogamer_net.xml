            <p>If you're booting up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> right now, you may notice the return of login queues for EA's latest AAA military shooter. The reason? Well, it's the release of Battlefield 6 Season One and the sudden release of the Redsec battle royale.</p>
<p>The moment the new season and Redsec mode went live, players took to the internet to share their place in the queue. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oibtv4/oh_lawd/">One player managed to snap a 50,000 large line to access the game</a>, not nearly as bad as the queues on launch but a significant number nonetheless.</p>
<p>The battle royale mode, which went live mere minutes ago, is a free-to-play additional game mode. It was officially announced only yesterday, making today something of a surprise shadow drop for the vast majority of the playerbase.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-is-coming-out-tomorrow-and-it-finally-has-a-proper-name">This battle royale mode</a> comes with a giant new map as you'd expect. It's called Fort Lyndon, and it can be experienced as a squad game mode, with no solo queue option as of its launch. There's also the Gauntlet mode for Redsec, which is a knockout style alternative where squads race each other to complete various objectives.</p><p>Finally, players can use Battlefield Portal to create their own custom versions of the Redsec mode, much like they can alter and innovate in Battlefield 6 proper. The Redsec launch trailer (which you can watch above) has added a golf cart that you can drive about, so one can only imagine how many cart-focused creations will flood the Portal in the coming days.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">As for Battlefield 6 Season One</a>, it's coming with a large new map, a new game mode, several new weapons, and gadgets too. So there's plenty to enjoy for those still diving deep into Battlefield 6 some time after its release.</p>

            <p>The Game Music Festival returns to London next year with individual orchestral concerts for the music from Diablo, Hades 1 and 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3">Persona 3</a>-5, and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto, who wrote the music for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy 12</a> (among many other games).</p>
<p>The concerts take place in a couple of locations - the Royal Festival Hall and Fairfield Halls - and will be spread throughout June 2026. The precise running order is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>6th June – The Infernal Symphony featuring music from the Diablo franchise (Royal Festival Hall)</li>
<li>13th June – The Colors of Harmony: Hitoshi Sakimoto 40th Anniversary Celebration (Fairfield Halls)</li>
<li>19th June - An evening with Troy Baker &amp; Austin Wintory (Fairfield Halls)</li>
<li>27th June – Ballads of the Underworld featuring music from Hades &amp; Hades II (Royal Festival Hall)</li>
<li>27th June – Persona Grooves featuring music from Persona 3, 4, 5 (Royal Festival Hall)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://gamemusic.net/">Tickets for a few of the concerts are live already</a>. The Diablo tickets start from £57, which is a good gauge for what the other Royal Festival Hall concerts will cost, though they aren't on sale yet; and the two Fairfield Halls concerts have tickets from £55.</p><p>I went to the Game Music Festival's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-baldurs-gate-3-victory-tour-has-been-extraordinary-but-feels-like-its-finally-coming-to-an-end">unforgettable Baldur's Gate 3 orchestral concert</a> last year and enjoyed it immensely. A full and sumptuous Philharmonia Orchestra brought Borislav Slavov's score to life with passion, and Slavov made a teary appearance on the stage to thank players for their support. Also in the audience were numerous members of the Larian development team and actors from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> cast, including Raphael actor Andrew Wincott, who took to the stage during an encore to perform the character's iconic 'Mortal Lives' boss fight song. The audience - which more resembled a raucous crowd at this point - went wild. It was electrifying.</p>
<p>Earlier that day there had also been a rendition of music from The Last of Us by composer and performer Gustavo Santaolalla, which our Dom watched and was greatly moved by. These concerts were very good last year, then, so there's every chance this new batch will be too.</p>
