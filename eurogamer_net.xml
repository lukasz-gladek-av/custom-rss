            <p>During last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play</a>, the show concluded with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-a-superhero-tag-team-fighter-launching-next-year">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. A superhero tag-team fighter from Arc System Works, the community of die-hard fighting game lovers celebrated the announcement, with some making comparisons to Riot Games' upcoming release: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a></p>
<p>2XKO, itself a tag fighter that has been in development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment">since Radiant Entertainment was acquired by Riot back in 2016</a> had largely had the tag-fighter space to itself for the foreseeable future, with the exception of the endearing but budget title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a>.</p>
<p>However, with this announcement, it looks like Riot Games has a real Marvel rival to contend with. Social media was abuzz with excitement for Marvel Tokon. Justin Wong, perhaps North America's most prominent Marvel vs Capcom player, <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930380603524034820">wrote</a>: "Holy shit MARVEL FIGHTING GAME IS BACK?!".</p>

<p>Yipes, himself a beloved figure in the professional fighting game scene and a legendary Marvel vs Capcom 2 player, was lost for words. <a href="https://x.com/IFCYipeS/status/1930382431057784971">He posted</a>, "!??!?!?!??!?!?!", an apt measure of the overall feeling following the State of Play.</p>
<p>This reveal brought with it immediate comparisons to 2XKO, due to the unavoidable rivalry between the two games. <a href="https://x.com/Alioune85/status/1930405418137727416">Former pro player Alioune</a> summed it up with "If « fuck you 2xko » was a game", whereas <a href="https://x.com/Nushinator24/status/1930382031797792861">one fighting game fan</a> on Twitter reacted by stating: "Game already has a bigger roster than 2xko".</p>
<p>Indeed in the run up to 2XKO's release later this year the game has been seen through a more critical lens following recent announcements and play tests. Game director on 2XKO Shaun Rivera revealed in a Discord Q&amp;A earlier this year that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2xko-will-have-a-smaller-number-than-you-would-expect-when-it-comes-to-champions-at-launch-but-theres-a-good-reason-why">2XKO will have 10 champions at launch</a>, a relatively small number for a tag fighter. That game currently has seven announced fighters, whereas Marvel Hokon blasted out the gate with eight on display.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can’t wait to play it.</p>— Shaun Rivera (@Unconkable) <a href="https://twitter.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>However rather gritting their teeth or keeping thoughts close to their chest, several members of the 2XKO development team praised the new game. Unsurprising, as the team is composed of several former professional fighting game players. Rivera<a href="https://x.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550"> congratulated the Marvel Hokon team on the reveal</a>: "Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can't wait to play it."</p>
<p>Ben Forbes, 2XKO's editor-in-chief, <a href="https://x.com/draggles/status/1930380440315277393">shot out an initial</a> "oh fuck", before following up with: "sorry i was in meetings and had to pay attention MARVELLLLLLLLLLLLLL I'M THERE DAY ONE IRON MAN LOOKS SO SICK AAAAAAAAAA also star lord is dante???? LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO".</p>
<p>All in all it appears to be a "two cakes" situation, with two somewhat similar games clashing in the future resulting in more options for those who love diving deep into 2D brawls. <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930392702568317181">As Wong puts it</a>: "Too many fighting games what a time to be a fighting game fan".</p>
<p>If there are any companies catching strays right now, it's actually Capcom. The developer responsible for the Marvel vs Capcom series up until the poorly received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite">Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite</a>. Folks reacted to Marvel taking the IP to another company with the sort of humour you'd imagine. Take Evo champion Sonicfox, who posted the following image:</p>

<p>Ultimately Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls has made the next year or so dead interesting. Whether Riot Games can capture the hearts and minds with a live service approach, or Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls can cut itself a slice of the pie with some of its own boundary-pushing twists on the genre, is something the two will have to fight over.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-requires-pricey-extra-accessories-and-a-4k-tv-to-fully-complete<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Welcome Tour arrives today alongside the launch of Nintendo's new console, though it cannot be fully completed without also purchasing extra accessories - and a 4K TV.</p>
<p>The minigame collection has already drawn criticism for not being a pack-in game, considering it is designed to show off the capabilities of the Switch 2. Instead, it'll set you back eight quid. Even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">former Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime waded in</a> on the debate.</p>
<p>Yet as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aahea/products/soft.html#other">Nintendo has stated on its website</a> (thanks <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-to-require-a-few-accessories-for-100-completion/">Nintendo Soup</a>), some of the 34 minigames and tech demos require peripherals which are sold separately.</p>

<p>One minigame requires a USB camera; another requires the GL/GR buttons on the Switch 2 Pro Controller (although they're also on the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip with the console); and a 4K TV is required for both a minigame and a tech demo to experience the proper resolution.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that all 12 areas of the game can still be accessed without these accessories, but to 100 percent the game you'll need three medals in every minigame.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller will set you back £74.99, an extra Charging Grip costs £29.99, while the Switch 2 Camera costs £58.99 - although a cute Piranha Plant alternative is £34.99 if you don't mind a poor resolution.</p>
<p>As for a 4K TV, that could cost you hundreds, if not thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>Over in the US, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-raising-cost-of-switch-2-accessories-in-us-due-to-tariffs-but-console-price-to-remain-same-1">Nintendo even raised the price of its accessories to combat US tariffs</a> on the console itself.</p>
<p>"From my slightly extended but still brief time with it, it feels like Nintendo has created, if not the most wildly entertaining, at least the most spiritually accurate take on visiting an actual museum dedicated to a games console," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell on Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>.</p>
<p>"You read a bit, you play around a bit, you go, 'huh,' and have a little ruminate on what you've learned, and move on. If it weren't for all the Joy-Con waggling I'd ideally play this thing with my arms clasped behind my back, head slightly cocked to one side, assuming the official position of the museum attendee."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our Bertie has already had some time with The Alters. "It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p>
<p>As for Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, our Chris called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles" following his time with the game earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Its potential is up there with the games other Remedy staff reference in casual chit-chat around the studio's corridors, from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, yes, to Darktide, Payday, Deep Rock Galactic or even Overcooked," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">Eurogamer's FBC: Firebreak preview</a>.</p> <div>
