            <p>
It's been a good long while since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022. But now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its curious Japan-set follow-up. And thanks to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI">latest Silent Hill Transmissions stream</a>, we've got an eerie new trailer and a few more hints at what's in store.
</p>
<p>
Back during its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">initial 2022 announcement</a>, Konami revealed Silent Hill f is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07. And courtesy of its latest update, now know a little more.
</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is, for instance, set in the 1960s and the rural town of Ebisugaoka - based on Kanayama, Gero in the Gifu Prefecture. Here, we meet our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager" who suddenly finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As the events of Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.

<p>
That idea of "beauty in terror" is a theme Konami and the development team repeatedly highlighted during its latest Transmissions episode, explaining that while Silent Hill f retains the elements of psychological horror long-time fans will associated with the series, it also deals with some more classically Japanese ideas, such as the notion that "when something becomes too beautiful and perfect, it instead becomes deeply unsettling".
</p>
<p>
Addressing Silent Hill f's potentially controversial shift away from the titular town that's been the focus of the series since its first outing in 1999, Ryukishi07 explained that while Silent Hill can be considered a physical place with a dark history, it's equally a series "about portraying characters' struggles with the evil within themselves - sin, discontent, and conflict - in a visually striking way". And this, he noted, is a concept Silent Hill f retains, adding, "It's a gateway into the psychological battles of the human mind."
</p>
<p>
Konami also confirmed the return of long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, although this time he'll only be creating music for Ebisugaoka's Fog World. Music for its Otherworld (known as the Dark Shrine in Silent Hill f) will be composed by Kensuke Inage, whose musical credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, Samurai Showdown, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox-guard">Star Fox Guard</a>. In a message shared during the stream, Inage explained his music will use "imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes", all interwoven with techniques intended to connect the player to the protagonist's "agonist, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Konami teased "creatures that really infiltrate players' psyches", alongside some easter eggs for long-time fans to uncover, despite Silent Hill f's new setting.  And that's pretty much all we're getting for now. Silent Hill f doesn't have a release date yet, but it's set to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, with Konami saying it'll have "plenty more to share in the future". And until then, there's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag157nqMV0Q">new trailer</a>, which you can watch above.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f was one of four new Silent Hill games to be revealed back in 2022. PS5 freebie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s Silent Hill 2 Remake launched last year, and its fourth project, Silent Hill: Townfall, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">being developed by Stories Untold and Observation developer No Code</a>. Annapurna Interactive is still set to serve as publisher, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">a "mass exodus" of staff</a> at the end of last year.

            <p>
Point-and-click fans rejoice! After a long (and, if you're me, impatient) wait, Wadjet Eye Games - the dependably brilliant studio behind the likes of Unavowed and the Blackwell series - is finally ready to share a release date for its intriguing time-travelling adventure, Old Skies. And it's close, launching for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Switch on 23th April.
</p>
<p>
Old Skies, which was originally announced all the way back in June 2022, cast players as Fia Quinn - a time agent for the ChronoZen agency who's been tasked with keeping a close eye on seven travellers as they take their own trips to the past. "Some are simply curious," explains Wadjet Eye. "Others have unfinished business to resolve. And they've all put down a lot of money for the trip, so it's vital that you keep them happy while ensuring they follow the rules. But what could go wrong? It's only time travel, after all."
</p>
<p>
Seven travellers means seven distinct time periods spanning over 200 years of history to explore, with Old Skies taking players from speakeasies of Prohibition to the gangs of the Gilded Age, and even the morning of September 11th where a murder is waiting to be solved. It's got paradoxes to escape, puzzles to overcome - some requiring a spot of temporal thinking - and even the possibility of your adventure coming to a fatal halt. Although, as Wadjet Eye notes, the whole time travel thing means death is not the end.

<p>
Away from the story stuff, Old Skies features some (by Wadjet Eye's standards) positively futuristic 1920x1080 artwork - it marks the first time the developer has eschewed the chunky, distinctly old-school pixels of its past adventures - as well as music by Unavowed composer Thomas Regin, and full voice acting from the studio's "largest cast yet". You can get a general idea of how all that comes together in the trailer above, and Wadjet Eye's also released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAQ9UMzqZUQ">new trailer focusing on one of Old Skies seven cases</a>.
</p>
<p>
So there you go! Old Skies launches on 23rd April via Switch's eShop and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1346360/Old_Skies/">Steam</a>. And speaking as big fan of Wadjet Eye's consistently excellent back catalogue (which, incidentally, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/WadjetEyeGames">currently cheap as chips thanks to the Steam Spring Sale</a>), I can't blimmin' wait.

            <p>
Following a hugely successful launch that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hits-1m-sales-in-just-one-day">over 1m people snapping up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just 24 hours</a>, developer Warhorse Studios continues to plug away at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-post-launch-roadmap-bringing-barbers-horse-riding-and-more">post-release roadmap</a>. And that brings us to today, and the release of the medieval action-RPG's 1.2 update, adding mod support, a barber shop, and "over a thousand" fixes and improvements.
</p>
<p>
According to Warhorse, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>'s 1.2 update features "a host of fixes, improvements, and rebalancing tweaks" designed to ensure "a smoother, more immersive medieval experience". These include combat refinements, enhanced NPC behaviour, more polished animations, and performance optimisations. The update also improves the physics of your parsnip, which (probably) isn't a euphemism.
</p>
<p>
The full list of changes is long enough that it's probably safer to <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2">link to Warhorse's patch notes</a> rather than risk breaking this page. But the flagship additions include Kingdom Come Deliverance 2's aforementioned barber shops and PC-only mod support. Starting with the former, those looking for a natty follicular makeover will be wanting to visit Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. Here, they can change protagonist Henry's hairstyle or pick from a variety of facial hair options, including designer stubble, a full beard, or simply clean-shaven. Regardless, a fresh trim isn't just for aesthetics - it'll temporarily buff Henry's charisma.

<p>
As for mod support, it's described as a new suite of tools offering greater accessibility and direct Steam Workshop integration. "Whether you want to tweak mechanics, expand the world, or forge entirely new adventures, the tools are in your hands," writes Warhorse. "Get ready to create, customise, and bring your own vision to life in the medieval world."
</p>
<p>
Today's 1.2 update - which is available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC - marks the first in a series of free post-launch additions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, previously revealed to include horse racing and a new Hardcode Mode promising a "greater challenge". That's alongside three paid story expansions - Brushes with Death, Legacy of the Forge, and Mysteria Ecclesia - due this summer, autumn, and winter respectively.
</p>
<p>
"It is a hard and maddening slog at times," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle wrote of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">her three star review</a>, "but one that still has its moments where it surprises and quietly delights. Like the original, this isn't an RPG designed to make you feel good - you continue to be little more than a passenger in this historical tapestry, following along behind the horse tails of Henry's betters, and clearing up the mess they leave behind. Some will revel in that work, but I for one won't be chomping at the bit for another sequel any time soon."
