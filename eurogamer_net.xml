            <p>The latest set photos from Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider TV series give us our first look at Martin Bobb-Semple's Zip, as well as Sophie Turner as Lara Croft holding a rather mysterious looking piece of kit.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential spoilers for Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series below</strong> (to be clear, I have no idea what the plot is - for this show and just generally in life - but I don't want to accidentally show you too much too soon if you would rather keep an air of the unknown around the upcoming series).</p>

<p>The latest Tomb Raider set photos appear to take place in the same Surrey woods from earlier set photos, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-sophie-turners-lara-croft-and-her-dual-pistols-on-set-of-tomb-raider">saw Turner parachuting in during the day time</a>. These new images, however, appear to take place at night, with Lara now sporting that aforementioned new kit - a mysterious dagger.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15573351/amp/Sophie-Turner-knife-fight-scenes-motorbike-films-new-Tomb-Raider-series.html">Daily Mail</a>, Turner filmed "dramatic knife fight scenes" during the shoot, so I am now wondering if she went to the woods in search of this (potential) artifact. Though, Lara's gloves are <em>slightly </em>different, so maybe not… I guess we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>In addition to the dagger, Lara also appears to have a retractable pickaxe with her. This tool made an appearance in the animated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> on Netflix if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>As for Zip, Lara's resident tech expert is no longer relegated to being behind an ear piece or computer. As you can see in the images below, Bobb-Semple's Zip is in on the action, and can be seen picking Lara up on a motorcycle.</p><p>I have to admit, I am not sure he is wearing <em>exactly </em>what I would choose to wear if I had to go and scoop my friend up from the dark, rain-soaked woods at night while on a motorbike, but he does look pretty sharp.</p>
<p>Also, I would have liked to see Lara on the front of the bike rather than at the back, but even so, I am very pleased to see motorbikes will be a part of Amazon's Tomb Raider show. Overall, I am really feeling rather optimistic about this adaptation.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, we had a wave of cast announcements for Amazon's Tomb Raider series. As well as Turner and Bobb-Semple, the show will also feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Jason Isaacs as Lara's Uncle Atlas and Bill Paterson as Winston</a>. Additionally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-lara-croft-actress-spotted-on-tomb-raider-set-with-fans-now-speculating-she-will-play-laras-mother-in-amazons-series">former Lara Croft actress Keeley Hawes was also spotted on set in London</a> earlier this year, with many suspecting she will play Lara's mother Amelia on the show's release.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fleabag and Killing Eve's Phoebe Waller-Bridge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. "It's not very often you get to make a show of this scale with a character you grew up loving," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">Waller-Bridge has said of Tomb Raider</a>. "Everyone on board is wildly passionate about Lara and are all as outrageous, brave, and hilarious as she is.</p>
<p>"Get your artifacts out... Croft is coming..."</p>

            <p>The message "Nier Automata will continue" was the stinger concluding today's celebratory showcase for the game, which covered the game's many cameo appearances, spin-offs, and its passing of 10m worldwide sales.</p>
<p>This video, posted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> YouTube channel, covered the game's history of releases and adaptations since its initial release in 2017. Having only recently passed 10m sales, it marks a steady increase from December 2024 when it passed 9m.</p>
<p>This announcement came alongside some new art <a href="https://x.com/NieRGame/status/2024800054004138394">posted to official Nier Automata social media platforms</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this final message mean, aside from the obvious indication that Nier Automata will carry on in some form. Well, there's been little word of a sequel to Nier Automata, despite its widespread acclaim and success. There was Nier: Reincarnation, a mobile sequel of sorts that launched in 2021 and was shut down and made unplayable in 2024. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">Tencent also cancelled another Nier mobile game in 2024</a>, which reportedly "struggled to find a monetisation to offset its high costs.".</p><p>You could kill all hope of a AAA direct sequel in your heart, and instead see the tease as an indication of more cameos in other games. These have proven exceptionally popular whenever they emerge: <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nier-automata-collaboration-pushes-goddess-of-victory-nikke-to-a-half-a-billion-in-revenue/">Goddess of Victory: Nikke saw a 215 percent increase in sales thanks to its Nier Automata collaboration</a>, leaping over $500m in revenue as a result.</p>
<p>One can certainly hope for the former. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> has been largely an absent presence from the world of <em>released</em> video games since the Nier Replicant remake in 2021, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">stating last year the projects he had been working on were cancelled</a>.</p>
<p>What are you hoping for? If you've not played Nier Automata, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-review">Eurogamer's review to see what all the fuss is about.</a> In it, Jeffrey Matulef wrote: "Yoko Taro's eccentric action RPG gets a follow-up that's every bit as surprising as its predecessor with a little help from Platinum Games."</p>
