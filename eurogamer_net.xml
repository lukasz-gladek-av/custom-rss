<p>As ever, Choice membership fees include a five percent donation to charity. This month's charity is DonorsChoose. Here's a little bit about it all:</p>
<p>"DonorsChoose is the leading way to give to public schools. Since 2000, 6.5 million people and partners have contributed $1.8bn to support more than three million teacher requests for classroom resources and experiences.</p>
<p>"As the most trusted crowdfunding platform for teachers, donors, and district administrators alike, DonorsChoose vets each request, ships the funded resources directly to the classroom, and provides thank yous and reporting to donors and school leaders."</p>
<p>You can find more information via <a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/">donorschoose.org</a>.</p>

<p>So, what of the games themselves? Personally, i quite like the sound of Wildmender, pictured above, which is described as a "desert gardening survival game".</p>
<p>Then there's My Time At Sandrock , which fully released in 2023, after a successful Kickstarter in 2020 followed by an early access period in 2022. It's a follow-up to My Time at Portia, and treads a similar path to its gentle farming and life simulation predecessor, though this time set in sandier frontier-esque surroundings.</p>
<p>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, meanwhile, is a supernatural action-RPG from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> studio Don't Nod. We awarded it four out of five stars on its release. "Don't Nod drops the melodrama for a poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Eurogamer's Banishers: Ghost of New Eden review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/you-asked-they-listened-phasmophobias-newest-map-will-be-a-small-one-based-on-a-classic-american-diner</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Kinetic Games has laid out some of its future plans for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>, including a new map coming to the ghost hunting jump-fest.</p>
<p>The upcoming map is known as Nell's Diner, and has been inspired by those classic American diners that often pop up in films when impossibly slim actors eat a plate of bacon loaded waffles with a side of pie, a coffee and a milkshake (why no, I haven't had breakfast yet, why do you ask?). </p>
<p>According to the developer, in terms of size Nell's Diner will be a tad larger than 6 Tanglewood Drive. The team said it recognised that Phasmophobia's smaller maps tend to be more popular, as they allow for "quicker but intense investigations full of memorable moments", and Nell's Diner will accommodate that.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The diner itself is a work in progress right now, and doesn't have a release date, but the current plan is for it to have 13 unique rooms. Of those 13, 11 will be possible ghost rooms, and one is a freezer which will make it harder to use that trusty thermometer to seek out a ghost in there. As is standard, Nell's Diner will also include places to hide during a ghost hunt, which I often forget to seek out whenever the time actually comes to it, and so I do tend to die quite a lot when I play Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>Kinetic Games also shared some concept art for Nell's Diner, which you can see in the header image and below. The developer explained that the diner can be found on its own on a "winding desert highway", and immediately serves up "Phasmophobia's trademark sense of dread and curiosity".</p>
<p>There will also be some environmental story telling with this map when it goes live. "As seen by both the scene outside, as well as the recently abandoned Diner itself - where food still sits warm and tables are cluttered with plates and cutlery - something awful has taken place," the developer teased.</p>
<p>"What exactly has happened is of course up to you as a community to piece together. We're excited to hear your theories!"</p>
<p>Kinetic Games is keeping further details for now under wraps, but has said it will share more closer to the release of Nell's Diner. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Ahead of all that, though, fellow ghost hunters can look forward to the reworked Grafton Farmhouse, which will be launching on 12th August, across platforms. The Phasmophobia team has promised this will offer a "completely different experience" to its sister farmhouse (and recently reworked) Bleasdale.</p>
<p>"Now home to the aftermath of something truly harrowing, Grafton Farmhouse has seen better days," the developer teased. "Players conducting investigations will encounter a layout that, while feeling wholly familiar, offers a ton of new experiences as well as a brand new attic space, new interactions and much more."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Publisher Nacon and developer Rogue Factor have announced demos across both PC and consoles for upcoming slasher Hell is Us.</p>
<p>Hell is Us - which stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-lands-september-release-date-as-well-deus-exs-elias-toufexis">Elias Toufexis, aka Adam Jensen from the Deus Ex series, as the game's protagonist Rémi</a> - is set to release later this year, on 4th September. Ahead of this, the team is releasing a demo across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The demo will be available on 12th August. So, that's just under one week's time.</p>

Not sure yet what Hell is Us is all about? "If war is the closest we get to hell on earth, it's because Earth harbours the worst of demons: humankind," reads the official blurb. "In an isolated country ravaged by infighting, discover the secrets of your past and deal with the repercussions of a mysterious calamity."

</p><p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sci-fi-action-rpg-hell-is-us-gets-pc-demo-out-today-on-steam">Hell is Us team previously released a demo on PC</a>, which plopped players into the start of the game. At this time, the studio said the demo wasn't going to be available on consoles due to "technical constraints". Those constraints have clearly been resolved for next week's demo.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from the upcoming demo, it <em>sounds</em> like it will be the same as the earlier PC demo. In a <a href="https://x.com/HellisUsGame/status/1952756941345747256">post on social media</a>, the studio said: "Oh yes, PC is coming back too!" I have emailed Nacon to ask for clarification on what the demo will include.</p>
<p>The team has promised, though, that this version of the demo on PC will be "even better" than the one that came before. "4k can actually run at 60fps now," the Hell is Us studio said. "Isn't that great? We got you."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/HellisUsGame/status/1952848364900692225">subsequent reply</a>, Rogue Factor confirmed that PS5 will also support 60fps.</p>

<p>Our Lottie had a little shot with Hell is Us last year.</p>
<p>"The narrative already has me hooked - the human story of a country drowned in war, its people barely surviving, running alongside a supernatural mystery of unknown horrors emerging from the dark - while combat mechanics show excellent promise for when Hell is Us is released," she wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-abandons-maps-and-quest-markers-and-channels-brilliant-immersion-in-return">Eurogamer's Hell is Us Gamescom preview</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be giving the demo a go later this month?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/atmospheric-slasher-hell-is-us-is-getting-a-demo-on-xbox-playstation-and-pc]]></content:encoded>
