            <p>Have you heard of a game called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>? Silly question - the chances are you heard little else during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> week. This near fabled sequel finally got a release date after several long years of development, and large parts of our gaming world erupted in response. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-only-is-hollow-knight-silksong-real-ive-played-it-and-its-harder-and-faster-than-the-original-but-is-it-better">The Gamescom queues to play Silksong</a> were enormous. History had happened. The 4th September - mark it in your diary.</p>
<p>But it wasn't good news for everyone. Announcing the date so late in the game's development - a mere two weeks from release - meant a slew of games which already had early September release dates were suddenly in a difficult position. What should they do - hold ground and go against Silksong? Or move?</p>
<p>The choice was easier for some. Silksong, for all its legendary status, is an indie game made by a small team, so it will appeal particularly to players of indie games, especially tricky side-scrolling Metroidvanias. Blockbuster-styled games like moody action adventure Hell is Us should prove more resistant to Silksong-related audience leech, ditto shooters and other games without obvious crossover appeal. It's to indie games we should look to see the Silksong effect - and it didn't take long to be felt.</p>
<p>Swiftly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-delayed-due-to-hollow-knight-silksong-release-the-gta-of-indie-games">role-playing game Demonschool</a> and literal walking simulator Baby Steps lunged out of the way, delaying their releases by a couple of weeks. Then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dorfromantik">Dorfromantik</a> developer Toukana pushed the release of its new game Star Birds back a bit. With each new day came another alteration, so instead of listing each Silksong-related delay game by game, I thought I'd round them up. I thought I'd take a closer look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2025-video-game-release-schedule#section-9">the 2025 release schedule</a> and investigate what has and hasn't moved, and there was a lot more movement than I expected.</p>
<p>The movers:</p>

            <p>A "substantial number" of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta players were playing on or around the minimum recommended specs, according to technical director Christian Buhl.</p>
<p>In an interview with Eurogamer, Bulh broke down some user data for the initial wave of PC players who hopped into the game earlier this month, stating that of the "millions of players" who were jumping in, a sizable portion of them were doing so on lower-end hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking about some of the lengths Battlefield Studios and EA went to to ensure the game was playable by those on older setups, Buhl stated: "We built maps, and had to go to our artists and tech artists to adjust these maps so they were more performant. We've put in a lot of effort across the board to make sure these performance targets were set, and whether you're on min spec or ultra spec you're going to get the experience we're targeting."</p>

<p>When asked how important it is to serve minimum spec players at a time when PC hardware is getting more expensive, due to bloated prices or general economic challenges right now, Buhl responded by saying: "Min spec is certainly one of our most important specs [...] it's super important from both a commercial and business perspective - we want as many people as possible playing the game."</p><p>Buhl continued with an anecdote from earlier in the game's development: "We did a lot of analysis, we did tests on the game on a wide range of hardware above and below our minimum and recommended specs. We figured out what we can hit, what we need to hit from a business perspective, and that was to capture a wide audience on PC. It's been super critical."</p>
<p>When asked what percentage of players were playing at or around that min spec, Buhl could not recall the exact number,  dubbing it a "meaningful percentage". He also noted a number of players below the minimum spec, emphasizing the existence of this group.</p>
<p>In a follow up email after the interview, EA PR would not provide the exact number, pointing to Buhl's prior statement that it was a "substantial number" of players</p>
<p>The current state of affordable computing in the USA, Battlefield 6's primary market, is one of turmoil. Not only has a cost-of-living crisis made the price tag on high end hardware unpalatable for a sizable number of gaming enthusiasts, ongoing political policy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1W_mSOS1Qts&amp;ab_channel=GamersNexus">has had a drastic impact on international trade</a>.
</p><p>Buhl also spoke to Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-really-sucks-battlefield-6-technical-director-bummed-out-about-those-unable-to-play-due-to-secure-boot-requirement-believes-anti-cheat-cat-and-mouse-game-will-never-end">about the anti-cheat used in Battlefield 6</a>, it's ability to curb a sizable portion of cheaters during the betas, and the reality that some players weren't able to play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bios-shock-getting-past-battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-error-was-the-faffiest-thing-a-pc-game-has-ever-required-of-me">due to Secure Boot requirements</a>. Nonetheless, this beta proved exceptionally popular, taking the title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-the-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-one-million-in-steam-pre-orders">as most popular Battlefield beta of all time</a>.</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has plans to release more horror games on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, following the release next month of its latest game Cronos: The New Dawn.
</p>
<p>
"I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true," Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">The Game Business</a>. "I am a huge Nintendo fan. I grew up with Nintendo consoles. The most important horrors, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/eternal-darkness">Eternal Darkness</a>, Resident Evil 0, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>... were available on Nintendo GameCube. It was a gold time for Nintendo fans. In some ways, we would like to be the one to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "We have some plans. We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team."

<p>
Babieno also hinted Bloober has an eye on cosy games, citing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> series as an example of how the genre can cross over with horror.
</p>
<p>
"The best [example] is Luigi's Mansion," said Babieno. "What [Nintendo game director] Kono-san did with this title was pretty impressive. And I believe that there is a huge possibility to repeat such an idea in the future."
</p>
<p>
Could we see the Silent Hill 2 remake on Switch 2. It's currently a console exclusive on Sony's PlayStation 5, but that exclusivity ends after the game's first year on sale - that'll be 8th October.
</p>

<p>
If Cronos: The New Dawn is coming to Switch 2, then perhaps Silent Hill 2 could follow suit in the future. Otherwise there's an opportunity for ports of Bloober's previous games (there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-the-medium-will-be-adapted-to-film-courtesy-of-it-and-annabelle-writer-producer-gary-dauberman">film adaptation of The Medium on the way</a>), or whatever else the studio is working on in the future.
</p>
<p>
Cronos: The New Dawn is out on 5th September across Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows, and macOS. Eurogamer's Ian Higton went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-feels-like-a-combination-of-every-other-survival-horror-game-ive-played-before-it-which-isnt-always-a-good-thing">hands-on with Cronos back in July</a>, but found it a little derivative.
