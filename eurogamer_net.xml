            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has acquired a 15.75 percent stake in Arrowhead Games - the development studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - for $80m.</p>
<p>Tencent has previously founded or acquired shares in a variety of video game companies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">including a new gaming venture with Ubisoft Games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-acquires-riot-games-for-around-usd400-million">total ownership of Riot Games</a>, a major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/den-of-wolves-is-an-intriguing-sci-fi-heist-fps-from-payday-veterans-gtfo-studio">ownership position for 10 Chamber</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-launches-new-publishing-division-level-infinite-dedicated-to-delivering-high-quality-games-to-a-global-audience">its own publishing arm Level Infinite</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/">Speaking to DI</a>, founder John Pilestedt stated that bringing Tencent in as partial owners "opens up opportunities for China as a market. Gaining access to the Chinese player base is the holy grail in the gaming industry."</p>

<p>The remaining 84.25 percent of shares are owned by Arrowhead founders Johan Pilestedt, Emil Englund, Malin Hedstrom, Peter Lindgren, and Anton Stenmark.</p>
<p>A recent financial report reviewed by DI stated Arrowhead had a turnover of 959m SEK, which is around £73,736,551 / $99,877,484.85 / €87,516,806.33, and an operating profit of 729m SEK which is £56,052,445.50 / $75,911,192.99 / €66,526,965.99. That's a lot of cash!</p>
<p>Not too much of a surprise, considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 was PlayStation's fastest selling game ever.</a> The game had recently found itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">the stage for an invasion of Super Earth itself</a> which revitalised the game's player base to its highest point since that period of intense launch hype.</p>
<p>All the while Arrowhead bosses remain supportive of the pursuit of new and interesting ideas rather than trend chasing, with Pilestadt stating at GDC that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales">the industry is doomed to "unnecessary layoffs" by "chasing after the battle royales</a>".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In case you hadn't herd, a little something called the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> released yesterday. Nintendo's latest console arrived in a flurry of red boxes, with many new owners quickly making the most of launch title <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Now, there is one standout star in Mario Kart World. No, not Mario, Luigi, Peach or any other of Nintendo's staple karting racers. Rather, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">the all-new Cow has stolen the hearts of many a Mario Kart World owner</a>, to the point where races are now a mélange of moooo-ving parts.</p>

<p>There have been numerous social media posts showing Mario Kart World races which have been infected with rad cow disease (thank Ian for that pun).</p>
<p>"24 people all cows," reads one translated Mario Kart World post on X, with an accompanying video proving these players aren't doing things by calf measure. "Mario Kart is too chaotic, lol."</p> <div>

<p>"Anyone else's online lobbies look like this in Mario Kart World?" another poster asked with yet another stacked image of bovines getting ready to battle it out (cattle it out?) for that sweet gold cup.</p>
<p>"I've been in three full cow races."</p> <div>

<p>Cow certainly seems popular, with other users just sharing posts of appreciation for the new racer. </p>
<p>"COW MAINS RISE UP MOOO," reads one social media post, complete with their Cow reaching up in victory, udders flying in the breeze like they just don't have a care in the world.</p> <div>

<p>So, have you managed to get your hands (or hooves) on Mario Kart World yet? Who is your go-to racer? My console still hasn't arrived yet, but when it does, perhaps I will see you in one of those lobbies bursting at the seams with Cow!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are yet to play but are planning on it later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-mario-kart-world-defaults-to-smart-steering-but-its-easily-turned-off">know that Smart Steering controls are on by default</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> has arrived on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> as part of its GameCube collection, but the default controls make the game virtually unplayable.</p>
<p>This might shock you for a racing game, but F-Zero GX is all about going really fast. And to do that you need to boost - a lot.</p>
<p>Except by default, the Switch 2 maps accelerate to the A button and boost to the Y button. In order to effectively boost you need to be accelerating, which means hitting both buttons at the same time. And that's practically impossible, especially without hitting the B button which is brake by default.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it's easy enough to remap the controls. Hit the minus button to suspend the game and bring up the options, and from here you can switch any of the controls around.</p>
<p>So what's best? I swapped the Y and B buttons around, so I could boost more easily instead of braking. After all, who hits the brakes in an F-Zero game?</p>
<p>An alternative would be to put boost on X, which is also accessible while pressing A to accelerate, though you'll need to move attacks (on X) to another button. This A and X combo would mimic the original controls that put boost on the kidney shaped Y button above the central A.</p>
<p>Another option would be to put boost on the Switch 2's L button, which is unused by default.</p>

<p>Of course, the real alternative Nintendo wants is for you to buy the GameCube controller, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">that'll set you back almost 60 quid</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">remaining two GameCube classics are The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Soul Calibur 2</a>, but the controls appear much more manageable by default. The collection is available for those with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription.</p>
<p>F-Zero GX was developed by Sega and published by Nintendo for the GameCube back in 2003. Since then, we haven't had a new home console entry in the series (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-99-feels-like-a-battle-royale-in-a-pinball-machine">beyond F-Zero 99</a>). Still, I'm very happy to see Switch 2 technically launch with an F-Zero game, just like the SNES and GBA did - I've missed those camp post-race news reports.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></p><p>Up to 12 players can join the same voice chat, opening up a world of possibilities for you and your crass friends. Game Chat is also free until the 31st March 2026, so you've got almost a year to swear as much as you want and see it transcribed on your Nintendo Switch 2. Bet the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour"> Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> doesn't teach you about that, huh?</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that regardless of any profanity, the Game Chat feature is still a major boon for the console, due to its ability to allow those unable to use the microphone for any reason to type out messages on a virtual keyboard, or alternatively allow those who'd struggle with said keyboard to send messages without much trouble.</p>
