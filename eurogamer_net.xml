            <p>Romance has become increasingly common in role-playing games in recent years, having had central roles in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, to name a recent few. But it was conspicuously absent from Obsidian's latest RPG, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, and I am not the only person to wonder why.</p>
<p>I had a chance to ask game director Carrie Patel why this was the case during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">a post-release interview about Avowed</a>, and it turns out Patel had a lot on the matter to say. "Doing romance and doing romance well are two very different propositions," she said.</p>
<p>For starters, it's important that non-player characters don't lose their sense of self in a game just because you've shown romantic interest in them. "Part of doing romance well means not only a compelling romance path but also one that is faithful to the character being romanced," she said.</p>
<p>"It's always a bit of a letdown when you see a character who has a clear personality, and goals and interests, and suddenly, in the service of this romance that the player has embarked on with them, they now become the player's yes-person; they're happy with whatever you want and lose their sense of personhood."</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=equGBZBUjVg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>Number two: romance shouldn't be the only way you can get closer to, and deeper with, someone. A relationship should not only depend on - or be gatekept by - romantic interest.  "You need an equally compelling platonic path," Patel said, "because it's a shame if romance is the only right way to really get to that full level of depth with a character."</p>
<p>Finally - and Patel said she sees this a lot as developer and a player - if romance is used as a mechanic then it will be treated as one, potentially detracting from why it was there in the first place. "The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship," she said.</p>
<p>Avowed, contrary to popular belief, does have a kind of companion relationship in it, but this isn't telegraphed at all through the game, or teased, or incentivised. You'll come across it if you speak regularly with the companion in question - I don't want to spoil who it is - but the intention was it should come up organically rather than be something you aim for.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that says 'hey this is a thing that can happen' - there's no system that's going to track your status with them - but if you're doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you'll probably come across the option by the end of the game," Patel said. "And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising."</p>

<p>This reminds her of a character from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> - Obsidian's sci-fi RPG, a sequel for which it's working on right now - called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outer-worlds-parvati-holcomb-is-a-rare-but-shining-example-of-asexual-representation">Parvati Holcomb, who we praised on Eurogamer in an article about asexual representation in games</a>.</p>
<p>"What works so well about the Parvati bar scene in The Outer Worlds is it just feels believable and relatable, because who hasn't gotten a drink with a friend and talked them through their romantic predicaments?" Patel said. "And by the same token, finding a relationship - an affection that blooms between you and someone you're spending a lot of time with - that's something that should feel organic and surprising, and not like this meter that you're tracking in the background to see how close you are to reaching the top."</p>
<p>Avowed was released in February to favourable reviews. I called it "one of this year's most pleasant surprises" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Eurogamer's Avowed review</a>, relishing the game's sense of adventure and carefree attitude towards fun. It's very refreshing.</p>
<p>The game seems to have been a success for Obsidian and Xbox, too, leading to the question of what's next for it and the associated Pillars of Eternity series. Will there be a PlayStation 5 version, or an expansion, or a sequel? I put these questions to Patel in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/from-serious-skyrim-to-cheerful-fantasy-obsidian-on-the-evolution-of-avowed-and-grappling-with-the-expectations-that-come-from-your-own-history">my Avowed interview</a> and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Paradox has announced a new core expansion coming to its strategy game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> this April, inspired by Genghis Khan and the Mongols.</p>
<p>Khans of the Steppe will arrive on 28th April as one of four key components comprising the game's fourth chapter.</p>
<p>The expansion will include the Steppe region as players take on the mantle of the Great Khan and lead conquests across the world, fulfilling the prophecy of the "Scourge of God".</p>

<p>Further, it will allow players to experience the traditions and culture of the Mongols as a young Genghis Khan; embrace Nomadic Governments to manage a mobile population; and utilise a new Tributaries system to forge alliances and secure resources.</p>
<p>Alongside Khans of the Steppe, the map will be expanded to include China, Japan and Southeast Asia, with each region having new types of government, special events, character roles and more. This area was previously unseen in the series.</p>
<p>Thirdly, a new event pack will task players with preparing an elaborate coronation to display wealth and power as a new ruler takes the throne.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Crowns of the World pack will unlock immediately on purchase, including six new historic royal crowns, four new hairstyles, and two beard designs for character portraits.</p>
<p>Khans of the Steppe will be available individually for £16.75, or can be purchased as part of the Chapter Four Pack including the other three elements costing £37.15.</p>
<p>The release of the fourth chapter is Paradox's big plan for Crusader Kings 3 in 2025. It follows 2024's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crusader-kings-3s-2024-roadmap-brings-legendary-tales-the-black-death-and-more">third chapter which brought the Black Death</a>.</p>
<p>Last year was a particularly tough time for the Swedish publisher, following a number of high profile cancellations and delays. That included the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">cancellation of The Sims-like game Life By You</a>, delayed DLC for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">performance issues</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parting ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven</a> after nine years on the series.</p>
<p>Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester acknowledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">the company "made the wrong calls in several projects"</a>, which deputy CEO Mattia Lilja and chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation">addressed in an interview with Eurogamer</a>.</p>
<p>"When it's inside the core, even if we make a mistake or we launch something that may be not up to par, we are generally able to fix it over time and we don't stop... we're not abandoning those projects," said Lilja. "We're going to keep working. And when we have games that do work, we show that we understand what people want and we can absolutely give that to them."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
