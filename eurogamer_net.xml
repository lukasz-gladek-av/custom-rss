<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>'s live-action movie adaptation has reportedly found its writer and director, with A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski said to be at the helm.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-quiet-place-day-one-michael-sarnoski-death-stranding-1236360094/">Deadline</a>, Sarnoski - whose other directorial credits include 2021's Nicholas Cage-starring Pig and the upcoming Death of Robin Hood - will serve as director <em>and</em> writer on the project, which is a joint venture between Kojima Productions and A24.
</p>
<p>
A Death Stranding movie was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">initially announced in December 2022</a>, when it was said to be "on the fast track with development underway". Not long after, Kojima revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-taking-an-arthouse-approach-with-death-standing-movie">he's "aiming for a more arthouse approach" with the movie</a>, so it made total sense when last year brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie">news of his partnership with A24</a> - the production and distribution company behind the likes of The Brutalist, Hereditary, Everything Everywhere All At One, and The Zone of Interest.

<p>
Beyond Sarnoski's reported involvement, little has been revealed about the Death Standing movie so far. It'll take place in the same post-apocalyptic setting as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sams-from-all-over-the-world-are-still-delivering-celebrates-kojima-with-latest-death-stranding-milestone">extremely popular</a> first game - which presumably means it'll also features invisible creatures, rain capable of ageing anything it touches, bottled babies able to bridge the gap between life and death, and other outlandish delights - but it's unclear if it'll be a direct adaptation or a brand-new story.
</p>
<p>
Either way, it sound like the Death Stranding movie is still some way off - but it's unlikely series fans will be too concerned given a fully fledged game sequel is launching very soon. As revealed last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> launches for PS5 on 26th June, complete with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">its very own fake Snake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">stop-motion puppet companion</a>.

            <p>
Ubisoft is poised to release another patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and it's the game's most substantial update yet, introducing a range of fan-requested features alongside the likes of enhancements to improve visual fidelity on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ever since Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch at the end of last month, fans have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">sharing their wishlist of features</a>, and Ubisoft has clearly been listening. Tomorrow's 1.0.2 update brings back the "follow path" option seen in previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>, for instance, meaning mounts can now Auto-Follow the road to a marked destination when the pathfinder is enabled. Additionally, horse speeds have been increased in cities.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, players can reset Mastery Nodes in Naoe and Yasuke's skill trees if they fancy trying out different playstyles, and it's also possible to sell and dismantle multiple items to save time. That applies both when trading with merchants and when dismantling items at the Hideout's Forge. And here's another time-saving addition: update 1.0.2 lets players quickly access the Investigation Board by holding down the Option button for a few seconds.

<p>
As for those aforementioned PlayStation 5 Pro enhancements, patch 1.0.2 introduces PSSR - which will need to be manually enabled if you've already been playing on the console - and adds Raytraced Specular support to Balanced mode. This, says Ubisoft, will bring visual fidelity closer to PS5 Pro's Quality mode than Performance mode.
</p>
<p>
There's actually quite a bit more going on in patch 1.0.2, too, including the removal of the 30fps frame rate cap while in the Hideout when using Performance mode on consoles. That's in addition to boss fight balancing, improved Double Assassinations, and improvements to Naoe's responsiveness "in some instances". All the above arrives alongside a sizeable list of bug fixes, as <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/2FUDlIPb2uWk5Ldb8OhKej">detailed in Ubisoft's patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Shadows creative director Jonathon Dumont previously discussed Ubisoft's plans to address fan-requested features post-launch, noting the studio was "always listening and monitoring what players are doing" and considering "constructive feedback". Dumont did, for instance, confirm Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-actively-looking-at-adding-an-even-harder-difficulty-mode">"actively looking at" introducing a tougher difficulty</a>, although that particular addition sounds like it might be further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows has, of course, got off to a strong start, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">topping over 2m players</a> in its first couple of days - a figure Ubisoft says means it's "now surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey". Its critical reception has been positive too, with Eurogamer's Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">calling Shadows "majestic in scope" and "impressive in detail" in his four star review</a>.
