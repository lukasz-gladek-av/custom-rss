Ready at Dawn co-founder Andrea Pessino has detailed some of the issues his company faced during the development of PlayStation 4 exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/order-1886">The Order: 1886</a>.
</p>
<p>
Launched in 2015, Victorian steampunk shooter The Order: 1886 was lauded as a technical marvel and one of the best-looking games on Sony's then-new hardware. But its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-order-1886-review">linear approach and reliance on cinematic sequences rather than gameplay left critics cold</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0">Minnmax</a>, Pessino said changes within Sony during the game's production had added strain to its development - most notably, the internal PlayStation team reshuffle that saw Shuhei Yoshida - who had been working closely with Ready at Dawn's team - become less hands-on.

<p>
"When Shu went to Japan - he was promoted - he became in charge of the whole thing [PlayStation], a lot of people followed him," Pessino said. "There was a whole shuffle upwards. 
</p>
<p>
"Leadership is a delicate balance, one person changes, things change. So everything changed for us after that event. The people we'd agreed on things with had gone... they were still up the chain of command, but you can't bypass it. It's like the military - you can't just go 'hey, Shu!'. So the amount of friction... everything started to change at that point."
</p>
<p>
Pessino declined to go into much more detail on the causes of this friction, other than mentioning that the studio had to spend time discussing "contracts".
</p>
<p>
"It wasn't the only issue but it certainly did not help development in any shape or form," Pessino added, "the fact we were constantly fighting them about the dumbest, stupidest shit possible."
</p>
<p>
Founded in 2003, Ready at Dawn had worked closely with Sony for more than a decade on projects such as PSP installments of Daxter and God of War, as well as the God of War: Origins Collection for PS3.
</p>
<p>
The Order: 1886 was seen as the company's attempt to make its own mark, with a new franchise it could originate and hold the reigns for. Alas, after a mixed response, it was not to be.
</p>
<p>
"One of the problems is so much was cut, a lot of the more subtle narrative parts were lost because so much was chopped away," Pessino said. "Things that were supposed to be interactive became a movie... We were desperate, we needed to ship... We needed at least one more year. And we didn't get it, so it was 'cut, cut, cut'."
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn had pitched a sequel to Sony, and held discussions over its setting. It would have contained multiplayer gameplay, Pessino said, and could have launched three years later in 2018. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Sony chose not to move forward with any sequel plans after the first game failed to find a warm reception.
</p>
<p>
"I actually don't think it was the sales, I think it was the critical reception," Pessino said. "Sony is a very proud group, rightfully so. And the critical reception [to the first game] - if it had even been in the 70s, we would have had the sequel, I'm convinced. Just a few points more, it would have been okay. But because it got into the 60s... it was death.
</p>
<p>
"In a way, it's better that they passed," Pessino continued. "Because if we thought we'd have been screwed before... we'd have signed our life away. We were going to do it just because we wanted to deliver to the players, but we would have been... The budget would have been smaller, we would have been completely at the mercy of whatever decisions because we had no leverage whatsoever. We were not in a decision to negotiate a reasonable contract, they could have done whatever. 
</p>
<p>
"But we would have taken it, because we wanted the chance to redeem the franchise, which we thought certainly had a shot. All of the groundwork was really, really good."
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn subsequently moved to developing VR games, and in 2020 was bought by Meta - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-and-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down-by-meta">until August 2024, when Meta shut the studio down</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-the-order-1886-pioneered-modern-rendering-techniques-in-2015-and-remains-a-stunning-title-in-2023">Digital Foundry revisited The Order: 1886</a> relatively recently, and examined how the game still looked impressive when running at 60fps on PS5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Civilization 7 cross-play between PC and consoles is currently disabled, as developer Firaxis has launched a new update just for the PC, Max, Linux and Steam Deck versions of the game. 
</p>
<p>
"To expedite updates to the PC experience, we will sometimes deploy patches to PC at a different cadence than we do on consoles - including today's Patch 1.0.1," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445806184891583">Firaxis wrote</a>.
</p>
<p>
"As a result, cross-play between PC players and console players is temporarily disabled. This will have no impact on console players attempting cross-platform play with other console players, nor on PC-to-PC multiplayer."
</p>
<p>
Fan feedback to Civilization 7's advanced access period is reflected in today's patch, Firaxis continued, with "some" of the initial issues raised by players addressed.

<p>
Civilization 7 is now generally available, after a week of advanced access which saw the game land with a "mixed" user response on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Today, Firaxis published its PC patch notes for Civilization 7 update 1.0.1 - and thanked fans who had flagged bugs so far. 
</p>
<p>
"We are reading and collecting all of your feedback, and will continue to do so as we roll out improvements going forward," Firaxis said, highlighting its previous pledge to turn the game around.
</p>
<p>
The patch includes a string of gameplay bug fixes, tweaks to the game's AI opponents, and some small improvements to the game's UI. 
</p>
<p>
From a quick scan, there's nothing too meaty here yet - and so it's worth also flagging the work currently being taken on by modders to improve the game themselves. 
</p>
<p>
Take, for instance, the <a href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/sukritacts-simple-ui-adjustments.31860/">Simple UI Adjustments Mod</a>, which adds a series of handy floating tooltips that save you from having to dig through menus to find information about a particular tile. Handy!
</p>
<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis told fans it would "need some time to digest all of your feedback"</a>, but pledged to prioritise community-requested features such as being able to pick starting and ending Ages, and adding hotseat multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
"A competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality," Sin Vega wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer's Civilization 7 review</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Civilization 7 update 1.0.1 - Windows PC/Mac/Linux/Steam Deck patch notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue causing Ages in Epic and Marathon speed games to be shorter than intended.</li>
<li>City States will now turn into Friendly Independent Powers on Age Transition instead of disappearing completely. They will also now start with more units in Exploration and Modern Ages.</li>
<li>Fixed inconsistencies with Naval Combat.</li>
<li>Naval Units will use the correct Combat Strength values when attacking another Naval Unit in all instances.</li>
<li>Naval Units will properly take reciprocal damage after attacking another Naval Unit.</li>
<li>Naval Units will more consistently move into the attacked tile after defeating another Naval Unit.</li>
<li>Completing the final milestone of a Legacy Path no longer adds Age Progress in the Modern Age to ensure you have more time to complete a Victory.</li>
<li>Towns will now switch their focus back to Growing town automatically if they are no longer eligible for their chosen Focus (for example, if their population decreases) until they are eligible again.</li>
<li>Future Civic is now repeatable in all Ages. The cost of Future Tech and Future Civic will now increase more when repeated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue after too many bonuses to Growth where Food needed for the next growth event became negative.</li>
<li>Improvements to Rail Networks aimed at increasing the reliability of Settlements connecting to the Rail Network over water by building Ports. This should apply as long as the Capital either has a Port or is connected by rail to a settlement with a Port.</li>
<li>Made improvements to the Loyalty Crisis in the Antiquity Age, including giving the ability to purchase Villas in towns during this crisis, giving another way to manage the happiness of your settlements.</li>
<li>A note about cross-play multiplayer: To expedite updates to the PC experience, we will sometimes deploy patches to PC at a different cadence than we do on consoles - including today's Patch 1.0.1. As a result, cross-play between PC players and console players is temporarily disabled. This will have no impact on console players attempting cross-platform play with other console players, nor on PC-to-PC multiplayer.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI will now offer high-value Cities less often during Peace Deals.</li>

<li>In Modern, AI will now consider Ideology more before Declaring War or offering Peace.</li>
<li>Other Leaders now have a decreased desire for war if neither party has an Ideology.</li>
<li>Other Leaders now have an increased desire for war with players of Opposing ideologies.</li>
<li>Other Leaders now have a decreased desire for Peace with players of opposing Ideologies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Camera</strong></p><p>

Fixed an issue on native-resolutions where the camera would focus on the lower end of the map when clicking on the minimap.

</p><p><strong>UI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced the Simplified Chinese font with the font used in Civilization VI while we work on additional improvements for future patches.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where some text was cut off on the Global Yields Breakdown screen.</li>
<li>Added a notification for completed Espionage actions, so that you can more easily check the results of their Espionage actions.</li>
<li>City projects no longer appear to be purchasable.</li>
<li>Your current religion is now displayed first in the belief picker tabs.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where Leaders fail to have a portrait when the relationship has changed during gameplay.</li>
<li>Improved the alignment of leader names and portraits on the Age Summary, when viewing the Overview screen of the Victories Rankings.</li>

PUBG: Battlegrounds maker Krafton has said it generated record sales and profit last year - which was its best in the history of the company.
</p>
<p>
Originally launched in 2017, battle royale PUBG shifted to a free-to-play model in 2022 and has seen continued growth ever since. 2024 saw the game hit its best-ever concurrent peak - of 890,000 players.
</p>
<p>
Spending in PUBG across PC and consoles globally last year totalled "nearly" a 1tn korean won - around £556m - breaking Krafton's own record for the game.

<p>
On smartphones, PUBG's breakout spin-off Battlegrounds Mobile India saw its sales rise by 35.7 percent year-on-year, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
Next up for Krafton is its plan to secure a new big franchise IP,  while continuing to update PUBG and grow the game's Indian mobile spin-off. 
</p>
<p>
The company will launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-sims-like-inzoi-delayed-into-next-year-to-give-it-a-stronger-foundation">inZoi, a visually-impressive Sims-like game, on 28th March via Steam early access</a>, following a delay from last year. Could this be Krafton's next big franchise?
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming titles include fantasy extraction RPG Dark and Darker Mobile, underwater survival sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, and pioneer life simulation game Dinkum Together.
</p>
<p>Last year, Krafton hit the headlines when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">scooped up Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft effectively closed the studio</a>. There's no official word - yet - on what that team is up to next, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">Krafton has acknowledged the fan desire for a Hi-Fi Rush sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Robert Yang's next game is Tryhard, a turn-based RPG in the world of rugby described as part of the "sportslike" genre.</p>
<p>Yang is known for his controversial games exploring explicit queer themes of sexuality, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robert-yangs-the-tearoom-appeals-to-censors-by-swapping-cocks-for-glocks">bathroom simulator The Tearoom</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-as-a-burly-sexy-lumberjack-in-this-forestry-sim">sexy lumberjack game Logjam</a>.</p>
<p>Tryhard is decidedly more tame, though judging by its trailer it still includes LGBT+ representation with its relationships.</p>

<p>Set in New Zealand, players will be tasked with managing an underdog rugby club. "Everyone expects you to fail," the Steam description reads. "You've never even played rugby before! But you'll prove them wrong, challenge the champs, and win the Ramphorlie Shield." How very Ted Lasso!</p>
<p>There will be management sim elements, a branching story, relationships to manage and - perhaps most interestingly - rugby matches based on turn-based battles between mixed gender teams.</p>
<p>There's even a dog who can join your team.</p>
<p>Tryhard will be the first full release from Grapefruit Games, a studio co-founded by Yang that has previously worked on artistic and support projects.</p>
<p>As part of the game's announcement, the studio has released its <a href="https://grapefruitgames.com/sportslike/">"sportslike manifesto"</a> to establish the genre. "The sports game is too busy," it reads. "Everyone expects franchise-career modes, motion captured stadiums, sweaty grass physics, and the latest microtransactions."</p>
<p>By contrast, a sportslike game focuses on the way people interact with a sport - not just playing the sport itself, but the people behind the scenes, its news and history, and the lives of players.</p>
<p>The studio suggests a number of already-released games that could be considered sportslikes, including 2017's Golf Story and 2023's Roller Drama.
