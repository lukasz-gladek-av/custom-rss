            <p>The team behind Italian Soulslike Enotria: The Last Song has finally found some resolution to the game's Xbox absence.</p>
<p>As a quick recap, back in March developer Jyamma Games said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-avoiding-elden-ring-dlc">would not be releasing its game on Xbox</a> in order to ensure "a superior experience for PC and PS5 players". At this time, it was suggested the studio would reassess an Xbox release once the game had launched elsewhere, and the Enortria team went on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enotria-the-last-song-ceo-apologises-to-xbox-community-for-a-choice-that-was-forced-to-make">apologise to the Xbox community for this delay</a>.</p>

<p>However, if we fast forward to September, things get a little more involved. The developer announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-indefinitely-on-xbox-as-dev-says-its-being-ignored-by-microsoft">delaying Enotria: The Last Song's Xbox release indefinitely</a>, claiming Microsoft had "decided to ignore us" as it attempted to navigate certification.</p>
<p>When this comment was picked up further, Microsoft went on to apologise to the developer for this apparent oversight. An Xbox release of Enotria: The Last Song was back on the cards. But, when for?</p>
<p>Well, we now have an answer to that question. Enotria: The Last Song will be coming to Microsoft's platform very, very soon. In fact, it arrives tomorrow, 12th December.</p>
<p>"We bring great news for our Xbox players," the team wrote on <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1866521654765265387">social media</a>. "Enotria: The Last Song is finally ready to be released on [Xbox Series X/S]." Hurrah!</p>

<p>Enotria: The Last Song has been inspired by Italian folklore, and while its setting is dappled in Mediterranean sunlight, there looks to be plenty of darkness lurking within.</p>
<p>"The world has been gripped by the Canovaccio - a twisted eternal play that keeps everything in an unnatural stasis," the game's description reads. "You, Maskless One, are the only one without a given role and master of your destiny. Defeat the fearsome Authors that created it and free the world from stagnation, by harnessing the power of Ardore."</p>
<p>Will you be giving it a go on its Xbox debut?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-stealthy-combat-and-samurai-weapons-detailed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has laid out how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' combat systems will work, including how its attack types, enemies and arsenal of weapons will differ between its dual protagonists: shinobi Naoe and samurai Yasuke.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview">update</a> comes a week after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-will-overhaul-stealth-mechanics-but-still-include-insta-kill-assassination-option">similar deep dive into Assassin's Creed Shadows' stealth</a>, as the game's marketing schedule begins ramping up once more following its previous shock delay. </p>
<p>Shadows is now set to arrive on 14th February 2025 as a pivotal title for Ubisoft - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">currently in the middle of talks with Chinese giant Tencent around the company's future</a>.</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, combat once again offers light and heavy attacks, but also new, charged "Posture Attacks" that can be held indefinitely (by holding down the attack button) while you adjust your target.
</p>
<p>
Defensive manouveres once again include dodges (Naoe pulls off a directional roll, Yasuke has a directional dodge-step), parries (Yasuke forces enemies to step back, Naoe pivotes around them) and blocks (unique to Yasuke).
</p>
<p>
The stealth-focused Naoe can become outnumbered when surrounded by enemies, while Yasuke can last longer and pull off a guard-breaking final attack at the end of a combo without pulling off a Posture Attack.

<p>
Both characters can carry two weapons, though Yasuke can also switch between them mid-combo. He can also pull off a unique Sheathed Posture Attack, where he's able to charge up an opening attack while his katana is still sheathed.
</p>
<p>
Naoe has a katana blade, the extendable kusarigama ball and chain, and the tanto dagger - which can be dual-wielded with her Hidden Blade to pull off double assassinations.
</p>
<p>
Yasuke has a long katana, naginata pole arm and kanabo war club for close-up combat, as well as the yumi bow and teppo flint file for ranged fighting - with the former quieter than the other.

<p>
Who will you be using all this weaponary against? Well, the game boasts basic outlaws, Ashigaru conscripts and volunteer army footmen (more aggressive towards Naoe, fearful of Yasuke), roaming samurai ronin, the Samurai Daisho found in military castles, and finally the Guardians - described as "an elite group of badass samurai used as reinforcements".
</p>
<p>
As in past games, flurry attacks will show a blue weapon glint, meaning you'll need to defend an entire sequence in quick succession, while unstoppable attacks again have a red glint. 
</p>
<p>Last month, Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">the "devastating" impact of Shadows' diversity and inclusivity backlash</a>, and explained the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">reasons for Shadows' delay to ensure it arrives with another layer of polish</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hazelight Studios has shared a little behind the scenes video, filmed within its HQ in Stockholm, and in the process dropped a few teasers for its next game.</p>
<p>The game in question is yet to be officially named, with the only word from Hazelight itself being a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-developer-teases-next-project-s-n">mysterious post on social media from October</a>. This post showed a stack of papers and a collection of post-it notes with various annotations scrawled about. The studio's founder Josef Fares was, in fairness, <em>a little more</em> forthcoming with information, adding its name will be "S*** ******N".</p>
<p>Now, though, we are getting closer to The Big Reveal, and the team has released a little video presented by the always entertaining Fares himself, who noted people had called him out for being "cocky". He, however, is fine with this, as he believes when a game is as good as the one Hazelight is cooking up, well, of course he is going to be cocky.</p>

<p>In this same video, Fares also introduces us to the actors playing Mio and Zoe - two characters from the upcoming game, based on Fares' daughters - and gets the team to play some "cool sounds" from the project. The sound they choose to play? It's kind of a squelchy fart noise.</p><p>Then, when one of his fellow developers states the Hazelight team is "fucking shit up", Fares fistpumps his colleague. "We fuck shit up, without fucking up," the founder proclaims, before getting a phone call from The Game Awards' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, Hazelight will be revealing its next project at The Game Awards on Thursday night (or very early Friday morning if you are here in the UK). We here at Eurogamer will be covering the show live, so be sure to join us with a festive tipple or two! Other games also confirmed to be at the show include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-mafia-the-old-country-lead-the-charge-as-more-game-awards-showings-confirmed">Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country</a>, to name but two.</p>

<p>The hedgehog will be available from 18th December and comes with unique abilities to shake up gameplay, once he's been unlocked.</p>
<p>His iconic Chaos Control and Chaos Shift moves will lock enemies and the environment in place. The update will also bring new powers for all characters, including Quick Grind, Perfect Jump, Chain Attack, and Perfect Boost.</p>

<p>Sonic Dream Team was first released at the end of last year, but has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-dream-team-gets-challenging-endgame-mission-in-latest-update">continually updated</a> throughout 2024.

"The vision was to make a game that allowed players to get into an exhilarating flow state. Early on, I was waving my hands around, emulating rollercoasters and halfpipes, while enthusiastically trying to communicate what I meant by flow," he said.</p> <div>
