            <p>Bam Margera will officially return in the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, but as a secret skater.</p>
<p>Margera first appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and returned in each subsequent game in the series. However, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">remake was announced back in March</a>, fans noticed the skater missing from the playable line-up.</p>
<p>Now, Activision has confirmed in a social media post he'll be making his return, along with a video of Margera joking about missing flights in the past due to getting sucked into the second game.</p>

<p>It's unclear why Margera was initially left out of the line-up, with fans speculating it may be related to legal issues he's faced following struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>However, skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">Margera would still appear thanks to the insistence of Tony Hawk himself</a>.</p>
<p>"Well, here's what happened," Bagley explained in a livestream. "The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game."</p>
<p>The last minute addition would perhaps explain why he's a secret unlockable skater, rather than being available from the start.</p>

<p>The confirmed skater roster features both classic skaters and newer additions, including Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, Bob Burnquist, Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome.</p>
<p>The remake of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will arrive on 11th July across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch and PC (Steam, Battle.net, Microsoft Store). It will be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC too.</p>
<p>Fans also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-is-switching-up-how-thps4-works">spotted some changes to the career mode in the fourth game</a> - objectives will now need to be completed under a timer instead of exploring levels freely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game, but developer Toby Fox has announced the RPG will be cross-compatible with both Switch consoles.</p>
<p>That means if you buy the Switch 1 version now, you can get the Switch 2 version later at no additional cost. Similarly, on the PlayStation Store, you get both the PS4 and PS5 versions at once.</p>
<p>Fox also <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-time/">confirmed the release times for the game</a>, with the Switch 2 version being available from 5th June at midnight local time in each respective region. That does mean Japanese players will have access to the game much earlier than those in the US.</p>

<p>For other platforms, though, the game will launch at a specific time globally - that's midnight Japan time on 5th June, meaning it's actually out on 4th June in other countries.</p>
<p>As such, the launch times for the game will be as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am local time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam, Switch, PS4, PS5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am JST</li>
<li>4th June 4pm UK</li>
<li>4th June 5pm CET</li>
<li>4th June 11am EDT</li>
<li>4th June 8am PDT</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Fox shared a handful of trophies that will be available on the PlayStation version of the game. He noted players will need to complete the current "room" where a trophy unlocks in order to receive it.</p>
<p>He added: "But, really, I think you'll enjoy the game more if you don't pay attention to whether you get the trophies."</p>
<p>Deltarune is Fox's follow-up to the cult classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>. Though development began in 2012, it's been released episodically as a series of chapters - the first two were available for free when released in 2018 and 2021 respectively.</p>
<p>This release next month will therefore at long last mark the game's complete release.</p>
<p>"Toby Fox is in a weird position," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-is-a-game-about-playing-and-its-bloody-brilliant">Eurogamer's preview of the first two Deltarune chapters</a>. "On one level, he has every artist's dream: near unlimited resources, plenty of time, and an eager fanbase willing to lick the dregs of an idea from his outstretched fingertip. He can make whatever he likes. But whatever he makes, be it a cupcake or a clothing brand or a package holiday business, will be compared, inevitably, to Undertale."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>That's a wrap on Fallout season two. And what better way to celebrate the end of a hard shoot than peeling off your skin? OK, I can think of many better ways, but that is how actor Walton Goggins decided to share the news.</p>
<p>Goggins plays Fallout's gunslinging Ghoul in the Amazon show, and as his character has been exposed to plenty of radiation and harsh conditions, the actor wears a lot of prosthetics to get the look just right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJZqMmDOBab/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">post on Instagram</a>, Goggins peeled off his Ghoulish outer layer and threw it at the camera. In true Goggins fashion, though, he made it look good.</p>
<p>Fellow Fallout star Ella Purnell, meanwhile, shared a more wholesome photo to mark the end of production. "aaaaand that’s a wrap on @falloutonprime Season 2 folks! 🤓," Purnell, who plays Vault dweller Lucy in show, wrote with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJZnLWFKUHw/?igsh=MTV6OHNxbWN6ZnZ5Zg%3D%3D">an accompanying photo</a> of the actress next to her on-screen dad Kyle MacLachlan.</p>

<p>The Fallout X account also shared the news, writing "Achievement unlocked! Fallout Season 2 has wrapped production." The account shared Goggins' skin shedding shots, so feel free to enjoy those below.</p>

<p>Fallout's first season was a huge hit for Amazon, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they couldn't "wait to blow up the world all over again".</p>

<p>Earlier this year, devastating wildfires raged across multiple districts of Los Angeles, shutting down production across Hollywood and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">impacting the filming of Fallout season 2</a> along with a swathe of other projects.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
