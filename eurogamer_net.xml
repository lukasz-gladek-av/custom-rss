            <p>Toby Fox is still at work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>'s third and fourth chapters, both of which are still expected to release later this year.</p>
<p>Its first chapter launched as a free download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">towards the end of 2018</a>, which was followed up by a second free instalment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">in September 2021</a>. Since then, Fox has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-100-coming-out-next-year">worked to keep fans updated</a> - with both explicit and coded messages - most recently confirming that the team finally has the technology to permit demo saves to carry over into the main game on consoles.</p>

<p>Deltarune charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World. It's a spiritual successor to retro-style RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, though it takes place in a different setting. Initially, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">plan had been to release chapters three, four and five together</a>, and make the game available to purchase. Last year, however, this plan changed, as Fox said chapter 5 was still a way off.</p>
<p>"And I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything. Especially me," Fox explained at the time.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us' Neil Druckmann has said making sequels to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s beloved franchises requires a level of confidence that, believe it or not, he claims he doesn't have.</p>
<p>Speaking during the DICE summit last week with fellow game developer Cory Barlog, the Last of Us' director was asked: "How do you and your teams approach character development over multiple games?"</p>
<p>Barlog said he had "way too much of the Charlie Day crazy conspiracy board" method of planning, referring to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nTpsv9PNqo">that Pepe Silvia scene from Always Sunny in Philadelphia which has become a bit of a meme</a>. But Druckmann, meanwhile, said he had a different approach, as he "never [thinks] about multiple games".</p>

<p>"The game in front of us is so all consuming," Druckmann explained (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-creator-neil-druckmann-says-he-never-plans-for-sequels-that-requires-a-level-of-confidence-i-dont-have">IGN</a>). "I think you're jinxing yourself if you're starting to think about the sequel when you're working on the first game. So when I was making The Last of Us 2, yeah, sure. Every once in a while an idea pops in your head of where it might go if we get the chance to do another one. But I just approach it as, 'what if I never get to do another one?' ...I'm not saving some idea for the future. If there's a cool idea, I'm doing my best to get it into here."</p>
<p>Druckmann said that, when a sequel to a game does come around, it's only then that he looks back on what the studio has already done, to decide where story points and characters can go. "And if I feel like the answer is, they can't go anywhere, then I go, 'I think we'll just kill them off'," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm half joking, but we just find the next game," Druckmann continued. "When we made Uncharted 1, we had no idea we would do the train sequence of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted-2-among-thieves">Uncharted 2</a>, or where Nathan Drake would be. We figured it out when we made Uncharted 2. And eventually, [it was] the same when we worked on Uncharted 3, [and the] same when we worked on Uncharted 4, where we look back and say: 'How do we not repeat ourselves? Where else could this character go? What else could get him back into the adventure?'</p>
<p>"And we have to come up with a new answer. And if we don't have a new answer then we should ask ourselves, is this the right character? Is this the right game for us to work on? Or is it time to find something new?"</p>
<p>Barlog, meanwhile, said he found connecting elements in games today with something he worked on a decade or so ago "magical", although noted this has its own stresses.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely, unequivocally the most unhealthy thing ever, because it is insanely stressful to try to fold and connect each of these pieces," Barlog shared. "Because, give or take five years, there's hundreds of people involved, and then a whole new group of people often are moved in on the next project. That's a bunch of different... perspectives, and likes and dislikes that are going to negatively impact you setting something up that early. And they're going to be like, 'Let's talk about this, because that was kind of the dumb. I don't know if I want to do that.'"</p>
<p>"I think for me that requires a level of confidence I just don't have," Druckmann responded. "Like this is going to be so successful, I know where this is going next. I'm like, I just want to focus on the next five days in front of me, let alone 10 years down the line."</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Druckmann said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">Naughty Dog had a story outline for The Last of Us 3 penned</a> that he hoped "one day can see the light of day". However, at this time, nothing was in development.</p>
<p>Then in 2023, Druckmann reiterated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">Naughty Dog is open to developing Part 3</a>, but only if "[the team] can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love", as it did with Parts 1 and 2.</p>
<p>"With The Last of Us, it's up to us whether we want to continue it or not... If we can't come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2 and that will be the end," Druckmann said at the time.</p>
<p>At the Game Awards in December, Naughty Dog lifted the lid on its upcoming game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">a sci-fi hack 'n' slash called Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will receive post-release DLC, leading to speculation over what could be included.</p>
<p>Over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/">Steam page</a>, the description originally included the line "Additional DLC - Additional playable characters and bosses" (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/elden-ring-nightreigns-steam-page-lets-slip-itll-have-dlc-bosses-and-player-characters/">PC Gamer</a>), though this has since been removed.</p>
<p>The DLC will be available by Q4 2025, though no further details are known.</p>

<p>The Steam page went up alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced-by-fromsoftware">news of the game's release date</a> and pre-orders beginning, all ahead of the network test that took place over the weekend.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-suffers-server-issues-due-to-congestion">network test initially failed</a>, with players unable to access the first session. FromSoftware was forced to reboot the servers due to congestion.</p>
<p>The rest of the test appears to have been a success, giving players a look at what to expect in the final game.</p>
<p>The test features four playable Nightfarers, but FromSoftware has confirmed the final game will include eight. However, it looks like more will be included in the forthcoming DLC.</p>
<p>It's hard to speculate on who these will be, considering we still don't know who the remaining four will be. The existing four from the network test - Wylder, Guardian, Recluse, Duchess - fit the typical all-rounder, tank, mage, rogue classes, but perhaps others will parallel the likes of the Wretch or Samurai classes from the base game.</p>
<p>As for additional bosses, there's plenty of potential for FromSoftware to add to the game, be that through additional Nightlords or special randomised events. We know already it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">cherry-picking from across the Souls games</a> - the network test included the Centipede Demon from Dark Souls 1, for instance, while the game's trailer shows The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a>.</p>
<p>What we've seen so far, though, has been only the bosses leading to one of the eight Nightlords, so there's still potential for the likes of Malenia or Maliketh to show up in the base game. We've seen nothing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> though, so perhaps the DLC could add Messmer or other bosses from the expansion, alongside more enemies from past games?</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">Elden Ring Nightreign hands-on preview</a>, there's plenty of potential for FromSoftware to expand the game into a full live-service offering with constant updates and challenges. However, the existence of (presumably paid) DLC suggests this will be a fixed release instead.</p>
<p>We'll know more by the time Nightreign releases on 30th May this year. Did you get into the network test? What did you think?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
