            <p>The fifth and final season of Netflix's live-action The Witcher show is in production, and we've finally had a peek at Liam Hemsworth in the titular role.</p>
<p>The Witcher and House of the Dragon site, <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, which shared the shot, said it's been "quite a trick" getting a shot of the actual Hemsworth, as he has had two body doubles popping up on location in the UK, too, often confusing onlookers.</p>
<p><strong>There are light spoilers ahead</strong>, so click away now if you're prefer to watch the show without advance knowledge.</p>

<p>As the fourth season hasn't yet aired, it's hard to know where, exactly, in Geralt's chronology we find him, but the sword on his back suggests it's after he was gifted the blade from Zoltan, which has yet to happen on the show.</p>
<p>As the location is "filled with beehives and beekeepers", some think this could be a scene from Andrzej Sapkowski’s Tower of the Swallow, where Geralt encounters beekeepers who direct him to druids. Druid costumes spotted on set seem to strengthen the theory.</p> <div>

<p>The shots also evidence that Hemsworth stuck around to reprise The Witcher role for the final season after assuming it from Henry Cavill, who bowed out of the show at the end of season three. For more shots of Hemsworth - albeit all mainly in the same position and wearing the same costume - head on over to <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>In related news about the game, we recently learned CD Projekt Red has recast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s Ciri. Whilst originally it only sounded as though the character's original actor, Jo Wyatt, had been replaced in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-the-witcher-4s-ciri-has-been-recast">development studio has now confirmed it</a>, albeit without expanding on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt.</p>
<p>Last week, CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-beta-test-invites-a-scam-cd-projekt-warns">warned fans of a The Witcher 4 beta test "scam"</a>, saying it's "been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down".</p>
<p>The studio shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media, writing, "Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty</a> fan had a run-in with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) after trying to get a "replica explosive device" Monkey Bomb onto a plane in the US earlier this year.</p>
<p>The figurine - styled on the in-game version which is used to distract enemies - was showcased online after the organisation shared a number of its more memorable contraband seizes on social media.</p>

<p>"Our officers at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) had a 'What the frag?!?' moment when they discovered this replica explosive device in a passenger's checked bag," the TSA quipped in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1202998258156542">Facebook post</a>, sharing an image that appears to show a phone holder and charger (thanks, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-fan-runs-into-tsa-by-trying-to-take-monkey-bomb-on-plane-3185682/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>"This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage. Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage."</p>
<p>The post racked up thousands of responses, with many taking umbrage with the organisation's decision to seize it.</p>
<p>"So basically, you took a child's toy. If it's not real, did you only take it to post on Facebook?" asked one.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Activision confirmed it was amending crossplay functionality in Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Season 3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-allow-players-to-turn-off-crossplay-in-an-effort-to-limit-cheating">to allow players to restrict matchmaking to consoles only</a>. Effectively, this means console players can turn off crossplay with PC players across all the game's major multiplayer modes in an effort to limit cheating.</p>
<p>While removing crossplay was already available in the game's ranked modes, the new options will extend this to all multiplayer modes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
