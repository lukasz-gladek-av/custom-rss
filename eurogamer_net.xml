            <p>
Roblox has announced it will expand its age estimation requirement to all users of the platform who access its communication features by the end of the year.
</p>
<p>
Back in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">platform introduced new safety features</a>, including an AI used to estimate a user's age through video selfie. Now, in a new statement, the company plans to roll out age verification for all users, through facial age estimation, ID age verification, and verified parental consent.
</p>
<p>
Roblox also plans to limit communication between adults and minors, unless they know each other in the real world.
</p>
<p>
"These added layers of protection will help provide users with access to developmentally appropriate features and content," reads the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-to-expand-age-estimation-to-all-users">statement from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman</a>. "We hope this move sets a standard that other gaming, social media, and communication platforms follow."
</p>
<p>
In addition to age estimation, Roblox has made a number of other advancements in its safety features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing Trusted Connections, as per its <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">previous update</a>, to safeguard communication</li>
<li>Using its open-source AI system Roblox Sentinel to detect early signs of child endangerment</li>
<li>Improving voice and text filters</li>
<li>Rolling out new technology to detect specific servers where large numbers of users are breaking rules</li>
<li>Refining its avatar detection model to scan for player characters breaking rules</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since January 2025, Roblox has shipped over a hundred safety initiatives in an effort to prove its commitment to child safety.
</p>
<p>
This is in response to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">numerous reports of questionable safety</a>, for which Roblox has long been criticised.

            <p>SEGA has announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> R.E.V.O. World Stage - a new and improved version of the 3D fighting game - will be getting a closed beta test on 11th September.</p>
<p>Players on PC eager to take part will have to request access to the closed beta on the Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/">Steam page</a> to hop in, while console players must create a SEGA account to receive a code <a href="https://www.sega.com/">from the campaign website</a>.</p>
<p>The closed beta will feature online matchmaking including a ranked mode, an offline training mode, and an offline arcade mode. So both competitive ranked ladder climbers and combo lab monsters should have plenty to do.</p>

            <p>Mewgenics finally has a release date! The endless cat breeding RPG from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>'s Edmund McMillen will be released on 10th February, 2026 on PC. That's over 13 years since its original announcement!</p>
<p>Alongside this announcement, McMillen (one half of the Mewgenics team) released a gameplay reveal on his personal YouTube account. It's a whopping 50-minutes long, and showcases how the much-anticipated indie will actually play. You can check it out yourself down below.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Mewgenics has been on a bizarre development journey. First revealed in 2012 after the smash hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a>, the game was described as the "strangest project" McMillen had ever worked on. However, this version of Mewgenics was shelved and ultimately cancelled, with McMillen focusing on The Legend of Bumbo until 2018 when he acquired the rights for Mewgenics from Team Meat and began development on the game alongside Tyler Glaiel.</p>

<p>So it's been a wild one. Still, it's awesome to see Mewgenics nearly at the finish line. McMillen and Glaiel are well-respected for good reason. Here's to a future full of weird and wonderful cats</p>
