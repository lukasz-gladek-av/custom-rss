            <p>Toby Fox is still at work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a>'s third and fourth chapters, both of which are still expected to release later this year.</p>
<p>Its first chapter launched as a free download <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-says-the-rest-of-deltarune-has-not-been-made-yet">towards the end of 2018</a>, which was followed up by a second free instalment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapter-2-arrives-this-week-on-pc">in September 2021</a>. Since then, Fox has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-100-coming-out-next-year">worked to keep fans updated</a> - with both explicit and coded messages - most recently confirming that the team finally has the technology to permit demo saves to carry over into the main game on consoles.</p>

<p>"Still console testing," Fox said on social media overnight. "There are fewer bugs, but there's a lot to go through. (Haven't even tested PS5 yet).</p>
<p>"In addition to fixing Ch3/Ch4, we also need to implement having saves from the demo carry over to the main game on consoles... We only received the technology to do this now. I hope it works!"</p>

<p>Deltarune charts the adventures of human teenager Kris and their lizard friend Suzie in the mystery Dark World. It's a spiritual successor to retro-style RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, though it takes place in a different setting. Initially, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/undertale-creator-working-on-deltarune-chapters-3-to-5">plan had been to release chapters three, four and five together</a>, and make the game available to purchase. Last year, however, this plan changed, as Fox said chapter 5 was still a way off.</p>
<p>"And I don't think anybody really wants to wait that long to release anything. Especially me," Fox explained at the time.</p>
