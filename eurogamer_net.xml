            <p>It's been a while since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unmade-bioshock-movie-had-two-game-endings-says-director">BioShock movie</a> was revived... only be stuck in limbo again. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-expect-that-netflix-bioshock-movie-any-time-soon-three-years-on-it-still-doesnt-have-a-finished-script">Slow progress is being made on a script</a>, however, and like many suspected, it seems that director Francis Lawrence's busy agenda has been the main thing preventing it from happening.</p>
<p>Since Netflix's take on the cursed project <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/netflix-bioshock-movie-announcement/">was announced</a> in February 2022, Lawrence has been busy working on two different Hunger Games prequels, The Long Walk, and even the tentative sequels to I Am Legend and Constantine. Now, via <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">Collider</a>, producer Roy Lee has teased <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> <em>could</em> be the filmmaker's next big project after he's done with The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping's post-production later this year.</p>
<p>"We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being The Long Walk and the other being The Hunger Games prequel, which comes out this December. We're just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he's going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it," Lee openly admitted during a chat with Collider's Steve Weintraub. Many cinephiles and video game fans figured this could be the case, especially with the I Am Legend and Constantine sequels being far from locked, but it's reassuring to get a proper update from BioShock's producer.</p>
<p>Netflix and rights-holder Take-Two might also be pushing hard to get the ball rolling on the long-in-the-works adaptation pronto, as the fourth game in the series might get a nice boost after former Gears of War and Diablo head <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">Rod Fergusson joined Cloud Chamber</a> last year to rework and fast-track its troubled development. Fergusson is no stranger to coming in hot to fix and finally release troublesome games, and it seems the powers that be are betting on the game being ready in the coming years, which is why the movie needs to get going soon: "I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game," Lee added.</p><p>After last year's creative shakeup at 2K and Cloud Chamber, we also learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-4-fails-to-impress-at-internal-2k-review-resulting-in-leadership-shake-up-and-revamped-narrartive">a remake of the original BioShock was in development</a> and ultimately binned according to reports. That would've been the perfect thing to release alongside a live-action movie, but now all eyes are on the all-new fourth BioShock... even if we don't know anything about its nature yet.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last week gave us the announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-releasing-pokemon-firered-and-leafgreen-on-switch-consoles-but-youll-have-to-buy-them-as-they-are-skipping-nintendo-switch-online">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen coming to the Switch</a> systems. This would've been celebrated under normal circumstances, but Nintendo and The Pokémon Company chose to skip the Nintendo Switch Online service in favour of a paid re-release of the original games at £16.99 (or $20) each. A silver lining was mention of support for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-home">Pokémon Home</a> service, but now that's up in the air.</p>
<p>From the get-go, the official return of FireRed and LeafGreen to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary felt a bit barebones. With no new content or graphical upgrades to speak of or online play/trading (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-get-nintendo-switch-launch-next-week-priced-at-20-each">only local wireless</a>), the only thing that was half-justifying putting down the cash many would rather spend on an indie was the Home functionality, which allows players to freely transfer Pokémon between games, even those of different generations.</p>
<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1r9qa2g/pokemon_home_compatibility_removed_from_firered/">pointed out by fans</a> shortly after the announcement, mentions of such a feature have been scrubbed from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Pokemon-LeafGreen-Version-3031289.html">eShop listings</a> for both versions of the game. Maybe that simply wasn't meant to be announced before <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/watch-the-new-pokemon-presents-this-pokemon-day-on-february-27-2026">this week's Pokémon Presents stream</a>, or maybe it's only planned to arrive post-launch and the powers that be aren't ready to fully commit yet in case development hiccups happen. As it stands, a potential Pokémon Home integration would be the only new feature being added to the FireRed and LeafGreen ports, so the information could've broken containment earlier than planned.</p>
<p>In any case, it's worth underlining that, at the time of writing, Pokémon Home isn't officially locked for this re-release of the GBA classics, which are priced at £16.99 each and only include a single language per purchase (pick yours carefully if you're biting the bullet). All this hasn't stopped FireRed and LeafGreen from climbing to the top of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html">eShop's charts</a> ahead of their launch on 27th February though.</p>
