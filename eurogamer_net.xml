            <p>Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> staff were fired last month due to internal company messages being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers, a new report has suggested.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games fired 34 staff members for "gross misconduct", though further details have not been officially revealed. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">company has since been accused of union-busting</a>, with UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">launching a legal claim alleging unfair dismissal of staff</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a new video report from People Make Games has revealed messages shared in a Discord server, sourced from a Rockstar insider who believes these may be the cause of dismissal.</p>
<p>Use of the Discord server began in 2022 and was invite-only for employees, with a "general" channel available to all and other channels accessible only for paying union members. Membership to the Discord was limited to either Rockstar employees, or representatives of the IWGB (which the Rockstar union was part of).</p>
<p>Most conversations in the Discord were around salaries, bonuses, and other HR issues - topics protected by the Equality Act of 2010 and relevant to the union members.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-acknowledges-gargantuan-grand-theft-auto-6-leak">major leaks in the past</a>, it's understandable Rockstar would be protective of its work. But it would appear this Discord server contained no confidential information about its games.</p>
<p>The catalyst towards these dismissals, however, appears to be the sharing and discussion in the server of changes to internal Slack policies.</p>
<p>Rockstar employees are unable to access their work emails outside of the office and, as at least one email concerning these internal policy changes was shared after work hours, it was instead discussed in this Discord server, with details and quotes shared.</p><p>People Make Games' source believes at least one server member brought this to Rockstar management, which reportedly led to an internal investigation into the Discord server. The Slack policy changes were initiated in the second week of October and by the end of the month, 34 employees had been fired - as such, the timing of these dismissals is in line with these messages, as the source suspects.</p>

<p>The Slack policy changes themselves include the removal of various miscellaneous chat channels concerning non-work topics, which Rockstar considered a distraction. The "Slack purge", as it became known by employees, proved unpopular and, as such, was discussed separately on the Discord server.</p>
<p>One Slack channel focused on gaming became a place for employees to share industry news on mass layoffs. Union members often reacted with the seedling emoji to show support. Elsewhere on Slack, employees would use emojis such as this (or the Palestine flag) in their status to show support for important causes. All of this was disallowed under Rockstar's new Slack policy.</p><p>"What we've seen time and time again is that Rockstar are desperately trying to prevent people from being able to communicate," IWGB president Alex Marshall told People Make Games. "And all these workers have ever been trying to do is to discuss their pay and conditions in order to try and improve them so they can deliver a game that's loved by millions."</p>
<p>Marshall also explained IWGB's presence in the Discord server is legally sound as it's completely normal for workers, when they join a union, to be supported by union staff.</p>
<p>Rockstar refused to comment on People Make Games' investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to the IWGB's legal case against Rockstar, over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">200 employees at Rockstar have signed a letter to management condemning the firing</a> of their fellow staff members.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">dismissal was also discussed in UK Parliament last week</a>.</p>

            <p>An upcoming Pokémon game may have a darker story than you'd expect given its cheerful look and typical Nintendo vibrancy. With links to the original Pokémon game trilogy and hints at older lore, what appears to be a quirky spin on the franchise might actually have a sadder side if fan theories are spot on.</p>
<p>That game, for those not tuned into all things Pokémon, is Pokopia. This is an Animal Crossing style game in which you play a Ditto, morphed into human form, and find Pokémon spread around the island in order to restore some life to the place. Cool right?</p>
<p>Well, the extended trailer The Pokémon Company released earlier this month does offer some hints at a more dire tale hidden beneath the surface. First of all, while a Pokémon Centre is present, there are no other buildings. Ruins, sure, but no sign of human life. This is stated explicitly by your in-game guide Professor Tangrowth, who hasn't seen a human in a long time.</p>

<p>So what's happened? Well, there are some clues hidden fans believe which point to an important link to early Pokémon games. For one, the Pokédex seen at the start of the extended trailer is a generation one Pokédex, which offers a good starting point for where Pokopia takes place. Secondly, the game is set on an island, a key detail to the puzzle.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/">Pokémon fans believe the game may be set on Cinnabar island from the Kanto region</a>. This location was a key spot where the fire gym was located in the first generation Pokémon games: Blue, Red, and Yellow. However, by the time Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal takes place, the volcano on the island erupts, leaving only the Pokémon centre standing - just like the starting town we see in the Pokopia trailer.</p>
<p>Following this eruption the entire island is evacuated, explaining the lack of people present on the island despite clear evidence of buildings, roads, etc. In case you think this isn't enough evidence, there's actually more proof Pokémon Pokopia takes place on a post-eruption Cinnabar. Ditto, who you take control of in Pokopia, can only be found in one spot in the generation one Pokémon games: Pokémon Mansion. If this games <em>does</em> take place between the generation one and two Pokémon games, where else could a Ditto come from?</p>
<p>If we accept Pokémon Pokopia is set in Cinnabar Island it explains a lot of the new Pokémon we see in the trailer too. Pokémon Mansion is where a lot of experiments on Pokémon took place - it's where Mewtwo was created - so it's not out of the question to say other tinkering may have happened.</p>
<p>Failing that, the new Pokémon like Mosslax could simply be a Snorlax left in the same spot mid-sleep, uninterrupted for a super long time. Without people around, it's not out of the question. Maybe Smearguru is what happens when Smeargle is left alone to paint without interruption. Cinnabar may also explain the ghostly Pikachu we see: Peakychu. If there was a volcanic eruption then, well, maybe they got wiped out? A sad possibility.</p><p>There are alternate theories out there that are equally tantalising. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonconspiracies/comments/1p3sg81/pokopias_world_is_created_by_mewtwo/">Some believe this</a> could be some alternate spin on early Pokémon games where Mewtwo removed humans from the Kanto region. Not entirely off the cards, <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_multiverse">given alternate realities is something the Pokemon franchise has arguably embraced over the years</a>. In the Mystery Dungeon series there are no humans whatsoever, so anything is possible.</p>
<p>It's something fans of the franchise will surely be digging into come March 2026 when Pokémon Pokopia comes out on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Until then, theories and speculation run amok. Or perhaps, a-Muk.</p>
