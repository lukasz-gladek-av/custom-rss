            <p>Return to Silent Hill, the forthcoming film based on Konami's horror franchise, will be a "faithful adaptation" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to distributor Cineverse, which has acquired the rights for the film in the US for theatrical release (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/return-to-silent-hill-theatrical-release-1236391288/">Variety</a>).</p>
<p>Christophe Gans, who directed the 2006 Silent Hill film starring Sean Bean, will return for this new film, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">first announced back in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Said Gans: "I am delighted to partner with Cineverse, which has shown a genuine understanding of fanship. Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, Konami's iconic Silent Hill 2. I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."</p>
<p>"Silent Hill is one of the best video game franchises period and Christophe Gans did a phenomenal job capturing the atmosphere of the games once again with Return to Silent Hill," said Cineverse executive director of acquisitions Brandon Hill.</p>
<p>As previously reported back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">Return to Silent Hill will star Jeremy Irvine as James</a>, known for his roles in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Treadstone and War Horse.</p>
<p>The plot will follow "James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads a press release. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."</p>
<p>The film is yet to receive a release date.</p>
<p>Still, it's good timing following the success last year of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, which faithfully recreated the PS1 horror classic.</p>
<p>"Against the odds, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has delivered a remake that both expands Silent Hill 2 in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer Silent Hill 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>By January this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">remake had sold over 2m copies</a> following its release in October. As part of its latest financial report, Konami yesterday revealed the Silent Hill series had total cumulative sales of 11.5m.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
