            <p>
PC modders have already begun optimising <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, even before Konami has released further updates.
</p>
<p>
The Metal Gear remake has been criticised for its poor performance, with videos shared on social media of jarring stuttering. In particular, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> version has come under fire.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-issues-acknowledged-by-konami-patch-on-the-way">Konami acknowledged a handful of specific issues</a> ahead of launch, though general optimisation wasn't included. In just a couple of days, though, PC modders have taken matters into their own hands.

Modder FrancisLouis, for instance, has created the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/4">Metal Gear Optimiser mod</a> on NexusMods, which "reduces stuttering by optimising shader compilation and assets streaming". FrancisLouis notes results can vary depending on hardware.
</p>
<p>
Other mods - such as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/47">Better Uncap FPS v1.2 from Mstrthief</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/46">Unlocked FPS from Hybred</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/40">Unlock FG and FPS from Velasquez</a> among others - seek to provide an unlocked framerate and other benefits
</p>
<p>
It's clear optimisation is a priority among modders, who have seemingly been able to make improvements quicker than an official patch from Konami - though of course, mods aren't always reliable.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the funniest mod for the game, though, is from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metalgearsoliddeltasnakeeater/mods/33">Fiend</a>, which allows players to swap Snake for Metal Gear creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>.</p>
<p>Kojima has stated in interviews <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-hideo-kojima-wont-be-playing-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">he won't be playing the remake himself</a>, likely due to his acrimonious split from Konami. But that hasn't stopped players putting him in the game instead.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-ceo-blames-unreal-engine-5-issues-on-developers-but-more-support-incoming">Epic boss Tim Sweeney blamed developers for any optimisation issues when using Unreal Engine 5</a> - Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater being one such game to use the engine.</p>

            <p>
Steam users in the UK must now verify their age in order to access store pages for games with mature content, as required by the Online Safety Act.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Valve has released instructions</a> for UK users to opt in using credit card details, which will trigger a Â£0 authorisation. In the UK, you must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a credit card.
</p>
<p>
"Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons," the instructions read.
</p>
<p>
Valve stated this process "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy" in comparison to other age assurance mechanisms. For instance, another mechanism would be using AI to visually identify if a user is over 18.
</p>
<p>
"The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience," Valve continued. "The verification process therefore provides no information about a user's content preferences to payment providers or other third parties."
</p><p>
This requirement on Steam comes as a result of the UK's new Online Safety Act, which is aimed at making the internet safer for children, but regulator Ofcom now requires age verification across all sites and platforms with adult content.
</p>
