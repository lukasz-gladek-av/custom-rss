            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has discussed why the company's PS Vita handheld didn't sell well, stating Sony didn't have the resources to split between two platforms but originally it had similar capabilities to Nintendo's Switch.</p>
<p>Since its release in 2011, the Vita handheld is estimated to have sold 10-15m units - that's far less than the 80m of its predecessor, the PSP, and less than either the Wii U or the GameCube.</p>
<p>Speaking on the Kinda Funny Gamescast, Yoshida suggested why he felt Vita sales under-performed.</p>

<p>"There are multiple reasons why Vita didn't work," he said. "It worked in a way that people loved playing games, especially indie games, on PS Vita. It was lovely hardware."</p>
<p>"Several technical choices we as a company made weren't really good ones," he continued. "One of which was the proprietary memory cards. That was a mistake, people had to spend more money to get the memory cards."</p>
<p>Further, he admitted the back touch "was not necessary". "Sometimes the team made amazing prototypes that felt so good and that misled everyone involved," he said, noting it added cost to the hardware. Similarly the OLED screen increased the production cost of each unit.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Vita dev kit had a video output to allow the handheld to connect to screens, but this was removed for the consumer release.</p>
<p>"It was really a bad idea," Yoshida joked, in a nod to the Switch's capabilities. "The development team removed that feature just to save a few cents of cost."</p>
<p>Yoshida then concluded: "I think the biggest reason Vita didn't do as well as we had hoped was that we had to spread all of our efforts/resources into two different platforms. And we didn't have that resource."</p>
<p>He added Sony didn't have a big enough talent pool across its studios to support both its home consoles (PS3 and PS4) as well as the handheld Vita. And as the consoles were more popular, they were prioritised.</p>
<p>This, Yoshida believes, is why Nintendo has been successful, as the rival company has pooled its resources into a single platform with dual capabilities. He even joked the Switch is the Vita 2.</p>
<p>Still, PlayStation's legacy, said Yoshida, is providing cutting edge technology at affordable prices, so there was never a discussion of combining efforts into a single piece of hardware as Nintendo did.</p>

</figure>
<p>In the same interview, Yoshida also touched on Sony's live-service game aspirations and said he likely would've resisted the move towards live-service games had he been in Hermen Hulst's position as CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>
<p>"For me, I was managing this annual budget, so I was responsible for allocating money to what kinds of games to make," said Yoshida. "If the company was considering [a focus on live-service games], it probably didn't make sense to stop making another God of War or single-player game, and put all the money into these service games.</p><p>"However, what they did after I moved on and Hermen [Hulst] took over is Sony added a lot more resources. I don't think they told Hermen to stop making single-player games. They said 'these games are great, just continue doing that, and we'll give you additional resources to work on these service games and try it'."</p>
<p>He continued: "I'm sure they knew it's risky. The chance of a game being successful in this hugely competitive genre would be small. However, the company, knowing that risk, gave Hermen the resources and chance to try it. I think that’s the way they did it. In my mind, that’s great, and hopefully some games will become successful.</p>
<p>"I'm lucky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> did so well!" he joked, adding: "You cannot plan for success in this industry, that's the most fun part of this business. I hope that this strategy will work in the end.</p>
<p>"If I was in the position of Hermen, probably I would've tried to resist that direction. Maybe that's one of the reasons they removed me from the first-party, because they knew I wouldn't do it!"</p>

The Switch eShop is slow, outdated, stuffed with shovelware and needs a drastic overhaul in time for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. But if you don't want to wait, there's good news today! 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">Switch 2 reveal</a>? What Switch 2 reveal. No, we're talking about the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/eshop">Better eShop</a>, a fan-made project built by website Nintendo Life.
</p>
<p>
This browser-based eShop offers a super-quick interface that plugs into Nintendo's store back-end. It's a much faster way to browse, filters out the hentai, and allows users to still buy games directly from Nintendo.

<p>
Several fan-requested eShop features have been built in as standard, including the ability to read or submit user reviews, and create customisable game search filters. 
</p>
<p>
Filters enabled by default mean you won't see 6247 games that have already been selected as "low quality, low effort or other kinds of spam", five titles listed as "asset flips" and 156 titles "based around hentai".
</p>
<p>
Other cool features include a dark mode, and the ability to toggle on the iconic Wii Shop Channel music. It truly is update day!
</p>
<p>
Upcoming features include Wishlist functionality, screenshots, additional regions (Better eShop currently supports the UK, US and EU) and the ability to mute specific game publishers.
</p>
<p>
"Better eShop was built in less than a week," the site states. "It's quite possible that Nintendo will start blocking us from gathering the data - but until then, we will continue to build and improve the Better eShop."

The recent deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> details will have left Nintendo "really mad" and prompted time-consuming investigations into where information has leaked from.
</p>
<p>
That's according to former Nintendo employees Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang, who worked at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> for more than a decade and experienced the company's processes when leaks erupted previously.
</p>
<p>
"This really does have a disruptive impact in what the company's trying to do now, which is to announce and launch a new console - which is hard enough as it is," Yang said on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzRh5csh7mI&amp;ab_channel=Kit%26Krysta">Kit &amp; Krysta</a> podcast.

<p>
"[Nintendo]'s been disrupted daily, for months, with these leaks, and I'm 100 percent sure they are really mad, to the most severe level. We joke around but... they are very, very, very upset by this."
</p>
<p>
While leaks of information from Nintendo's manufacturing supply chain - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-what-does-the-switch-2-motherboard-leak-say-about-system-performance">such as the Switch 2 motherboard</a> - may be dealt with overseas, the duo discussed information they felt may have trickled out from within Nintendo itself, from the team working on the Switch 2 launch. And when this sort of leak happens, Nintendo always investigates internally.
</p>
<p>
"They do have very good people that investigate these things," Ellis said. "They will eventually get to the bottom of it, but it takes time and it takes a lot of just talking to everybody involved. 
</p>
<p>
"This is hard work, this is a lot of work and the people working on this - and it's not the whole company, it's a small group of people, at this point, who are allowed to know this information - need to focus all of their efforts onto [Switch 2].
</p><p>
"But now... half of their day is going to be eaten up by [questions like] 'I have to talk to you about every step you have taken at this point, who have you talked to, where do you think this could have happened?' And, quite frankly, that's time they don't have."
</p>
<p>
Yang said the pair had been through similar processes during their time at the company, and that teams "basically have another full-time job of being part of the investigation into these leaks". 
</p>
<p>
"It's extremely disruptive, it's a high-stress situation as well because you really feel like you're in the hot seat," Yang concluded.
</p>
<p>
Leaks also limit Nintendo's desire to grow the teams working on under-wraps products, Ellis added, so as to avoid leaks spreading further. This then meant more work, as product launches neared, on a smaller circle of people.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 has been widely-tipped for an imminent reveal, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">reports the console could be unveiled later today</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The expectation is that Nintendo will first show off its long-awaited Switch 2 successor via a brief introductory video focused on the console hardware itself, before a longer look at a later date showcasing Switch 2 games.

            <p>It has been many years since we last heard anything about a new Bloodborne game, despite there clearly being demand for one. And I am not just talking about a brand new game under the Bloodborne banner. There hasn't even been word of a remaster, despite several other PlayStation games such as The Last of Us and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review-the-upgrades-are-worthwhile">Horizon Zero Dawn receiving a console refresh in the last few years</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> and God of War (including sequel Ragnarök) have also seen a PC release, following their time as a PlayStation exclusive. But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-wants-to-know-what-your-favourite-playstation-game-is-as-long-as-it-isnt-bloodborne">the same can not be said for poor old Bloodborne</a>, even though this is many a hunter's dream.</p>
<p>So, why is that? Well, former Sony Interactive Entertainment exec and PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida has a theory.</p>
<figure>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

<figcaption>The Death of Console Exclusives Is Inevitable and I Don't Know How I Feel About It. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipoW24t90fw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes">Kinda Funny Games</a>, Yoshida was asked if we will ever see Bloodborne again, and with a nervous chuckle, Yoshida acknowledged this was a hot topic.</p>
<p>"Bloodborne is one of the most popular asks on my Twitter/X," he replied. "And the people wonder why we haven't really done anything... it should be easy, right?" He joked some fans have become "frustrated" by how many games PlayStation has remastered, and yet Bloodborne has not been one of them.</p><p>Yoshida then continued to state he thinks a very key factor in Bloodborne's lack of a remaster or similar comes down to one quite simple thing - the game's creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> is "so busy", it has just not been possible.</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it," Yoshida reasoned.</p>
<p>Yoshida therefore believes the PlayStation team is simply respecting Miyazaki's wish, and doing just that - not touching it.</p>
<p>Yoshida stressed again this was just his own personal theory as to why news regarding anything Bloodborne-flavoured has been non-existent, but it certainly seems a reasonable assumption. Miyazaki has, after all, been rather tied up with the phenomenon that is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and its DLC <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> in recent years.</p>

</figure>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-discusses-bloodborne-remake-benefits-of-waiting-for-new-hardware">Miyazaki spoke to Eurogamer about Bloodborne</a>, stating he was "very happy" to see so many passionate fans calling for a remake to happen.</p>
<p>"Put simply, it makes me very happy to see it's a title with a lot of specific memories, both for me and the staff who worked on it," he said. "And when we see those passionate voices in the community, of course it makes us feel thrilled, it makes us feel very fortunate to have that and to have those memories."</p>
<p>As for Yoshida, just yesterday it was revealed the former exec had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-lands-first-video-game-voice-role-in-promise-mascot-agency">landed his first voice acting job following his departure from PlayStation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Just weeks after publicly releasing the Liberty City Preservation Project - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of Grand Theft Auto 4's map to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - its developers have confirmed the project is being taken down following conversations with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Liberty City Preservation Project - which modding team World Travel has been working on since 2018 - generated significant interest when it launched earlier this month, giving GTA 5 players a chance to explore GTA 4 protagonist Niko Bellic's old stomping ground. It featured the entire Liberty City map -  complete with traffic, pedestrians, weather, and more - alongside improvements such as overhauled lighting, better textures, and new scenarios.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the mod's enthusiastic reception also set it on a collision course with Rockstar, and the Liberty City Preservation Project is now officially no more. As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-liberty-city-preservation-project-shut-down/">Insider Gaming</a>, lead modder nkjellman announced its end on Discord, writing, "Due to the unexpected attention that our project received and after speaking with Rockstar Games, we have decided to take down the Liberty City Preservation project."

"We appreciate all the support the project has received," nkjellman continued, "and we look forward to continuing to pursue our passion for modding the Grand Theft Auto series."

Nkjellman didn't specify what had drawn Rockstar's ire, but the studio has frowned on similar mods before. Back in 2017, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">called time on the 'Liberty City in GTA5' mod</a>, saying that while it "generally [would] not take legal action against third-party projects involving Rockstar's PC games that are single-player, non-commercial, and respect the intellectual property rights of third parties", it would not allow "use or importation of other IP", including its own. So it seems likely that's where the Liberty City Preservation Project has fallen foul of Rockstar's rules.

Perhaps notable, too, is the fact an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ambitious-mod-project-to-put-liberty-city-in-gta5-canned">official GTA 4 remaster</a> was reported to have been in the works back in 2022. At the time, the project was said to have been shelved due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">poor reception</a> of 2021's GTA: The Trilogy remasters - but the report also referenced a supposedly canned Red Dead Redemption remaster that did eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">show up in 2023</a>. It's possible Rockstar's rumoured GTA 4 remaster is also alive and well, which might have contributed to the Liberty City Preservation Project's swift slap-down. But regardless, 2025 is a massive year for the long-running series, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">currently expected to release this "autumn"</a>.
