            <p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is reportedly aiming for a Christmas release window.</p>
<p>That's coming from Khary Payton, who plays Marvel hero Black Panther in the upcoming game. Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive">The Direct</a> about Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's release window, Payton said: "We're still working. We're planning on 2025... We're thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited."</p>
<p>So, perhaps this year it will be less about Santa Claus, and more about Marvel claws instead?</p>

<p>"I still can't believe that it's happening," the Black Panther actor continued. "But it's going to be so good. Amy Hennig, who did the Uncharted series, was the director and writer of the series. She is just so amazing and I'm like, 'man, we couldn't have asked for a better head of this project'.</p>
<p>"So I know it's taken a while, but trust me, it is going to be worth it."</p>

<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-teaser-trailer-for-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">first teaser for Hennig's then-unnamed Marvel game back in 2022</a>, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-uncharted-creative-director-amy-hennig-is-working-on-a-new-marvel-game">its announcement back in 2021</a>. Since then, we have been offered a few more smallish snippets, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-details-and-first-look-at-wakanda-revealed-by-writer-amy-hennig">peek at Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra's take on Wakanda</a>, as well as a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">the game's use of Epic's MetaHuman Creator</a> which gives each character remarkable detail.</p>
<p>"We really wanted the visual fidelity to be high so that you could kind of forget that you're looking at a game, that it should feel and look and sound and smell like you're watching a great Marvel movie or TV show, but you're driving the action," Hennig previously said about the game.</p>
<p>"As a new studio trying to do some groundbreaking stuff with cinematically presented games, the way we invite the most people in is by bringing them something they already know and love, but in a new form."</p>
<p>Now, I just wonder when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">Marvel's Wolverine will get a release date</a>â€¦?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ubisoft has detailed the exact moment you'll be able to begin pre-loading and then playing the long-awaited <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.
</p>
<p>
The twice-delayed Assassin's Creed Shadows is finally set to arrive on 20th March, in just 15 days. Ahead of then, pre-loading is available right now on Xbox Series X/S - where it weighs in at 107.77GB.
</p>
<p>
If you're playing on PC, pre-loading will begin on 17th March at 4pm UK time worldwide. Lastly, on PlayStation 5, pre-loading will become available on 18th March at midnight local time.

<p>
When the clock strikes midnight on 20th March here in the UK, the console version of the game will become available on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. The PC version unlocks two hours earlier on PC via Ubisoft Connect (that's 10pm on the 19th March) or slightly later at 4am on the 20th if you're on Steam.

Xbox fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1j43ro9/assassins_creed_shadows_global_release_timings/">discussing the launch timings over on reddit</a> have spotted that the game - as with many - will be available first to those in New Zealand. Do with that information what you will. 
</p>
<p>
And finally today, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4XbPPtFyQEtIMWrA9xVDmZ/assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa">comments made by Ubisoft</a> surrounding the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows for Steam Deck have been doing the rounds. The publisher noted last month that the game won't initially be compatible with Valve's handheld due it being below the game's minimum specs - although did not rule out this changing in future.
</p>
<p>
"At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck," Ubisoft said, "due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC."
</p>
<p>Our Katharine recently went hands-on with the game for six hours, and said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
