            <p>We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games has released a half hour documentary all about its upcoming game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>South of Midnlight was first revealed in June last year, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-happy-few-developer-reveals-south-of-midnight-at-xbox-showcase">eye-catching and atmospheric stop motion trailer set in an alternate version of the American Deep South</a>. Described as a "fantastical" and "macabre third-person action-adventure", South of Midnight will place players in the role of a young Weaver named Hazel. And it is Hazel that this newly-released documentary has been named after.</p>

<p>Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary debuted today, and offers a fresh look at gameplay, as well as interviews with the cast and crew, who share more on behind-the-scenes processes and the game's inspiration.</p>
<p>Speaking in the documentary, creative director David Sears reflected on his own childhood, and his sense of exploration and discovery. His imagination led him to start creating his own adventure stories, as he made his way through the world around him. These stories often featured fantastical creatures and monsters.</p><p>It is this sense of adventure and discovery that Sears wants players to feel with South of Midnight. "The genesis of [South of] Midnight was my desire to create a love letter to the South," Sears said. As such, the creatures that Hazel will meet in South of Midnight have been inspired by folktales and urban legends from the South.</p>
<p>"Every region [in South of Midnight] has a distinctive creature, and they rule entirely," the developer said. "Each kingdom is structured so that you understand 'how did a creature become a monster'."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the landscapes are also inspired by real places found within the American Deep South such as New Orleans, with art director Whitney Clayton saying these locations are almost characters themselves.</p>
<p>As well as Sears, Ahmed Best - best known for playing Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars - also features in South of Midnight's documentary. Best serves as the game's performance and voice director. He and the cast note <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-of-midnight-developer-ensured-its-black-heroine-was-created-by-black-women">how important representation is in games like South of Midnight</a>. "When I think about how many games are set in the South with a strong Black female lead, I don't recall that many," said Hazel actress Adriyan Rae. "That in itself shows how important this is." </p><p>"I think it's really cool that a little Black girl could cosplay Hazel with the hair that is growing out of her head," added writer Zaire Lanier. "It is nice to see yourself reflected in a piece of media, and not in a way that feels sterotypical or inauthentic."</p>

            <p>At one point, Nintendo's famously silent lead Link was going to have lines of dialogue in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. However, the developers ultimately agreed it didn't feel right, even though in Echoes of Wisdom, Link isn't the main protagonist.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23485">Famitsu</a>, Echoes of Wisdom directors Satoshi Terada and Tomomi Sano, along with series producer Eiji Aonuma, shared more insight into this year's release. The developers noted that traditionally, the lead in a Legend of Zelda game has remained mute, and this typically means Link.</p>
<p>Please note, there are <strong>minor spoilers for Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom below</strong>.</p>

<p>In Echoes of Wisdom, the series' namesake takes the lead role, and therefore this time it is Zelda who doesn't have any lines of dialogue. This opened up the possibility that Link could finally share some words of wisdom with players, and Aonuma admitted "at first" the green-clad hero was indeed talking (translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/link-was-going-to-speak-in-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-but-nintendo-thought-it-didnt-feel-right/">VGC</a>).</p><p>Terada added he "let Link talk a little bit" when work on the Switch title began. However, it didn't stick, and Terada noted no matter what he made Link say, at the end of the day, it "just didn't feel right".</p>
<p>"Link would never speak like that," Aonuma furthered. "It felt really strange. Nobody knew what Link would say - that's only natural, because he's never spoken before."</p>
<p>To get around this, the Echoes of Wisdom team instead concocted a story which explained why Link is silent, even though he is not the player character. Early in the game, Zelda can come across a journal entry written by Impa's brother, Lueburry. Here, Lueburry explains that Link was "one of the kids" who had been "stolen away" by the strange rifts that had opened up across Hyrule, setting in motion much of the game.</p>
<p>According to this entry, "all of the kids taken by the rifts" had lost something, and in Link's case, this was his ability to speak.</p>

<p>Echoes of Wisdom is not the only Legend of Zelda game to give a reason to Link's silence. In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, Link can read Zelda's diary when making his way through Hyrule Castle. In her writings, the princess said she had slowly managed to get Link to open up to her, but he "feels it necessary to stay strong and to silently bear any burden". This "has caused him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings", Zelda writes.</p><p>"I always believed him to be simply a gifted person who had never faced a day of hardship. How wrong I was..." the Breath of the Wild diary reads. "Everyone has struggles that go unseen by the world... I was so absorbed with my own problems, I failed to see his. I wish to talk with him more and to see what lies beneath those calm waters, to hear him speak freely and openly... And perhaps I, too, will be able to bare my soul to him and share the demons that have plagued me all these years."</p>

<p>For more, earlier this year, Nintendo provided details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-why-nintendo-ditched-link-as-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist">why Zelda was chosen as the protagonist for the Echoes of Wisdom</a>, rather than Link.</p>
<p>The company has additionally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-film-releases-some-time-within-this-decade-so-thats-something">narrowed down the release window for its upcoming Legend of Zelda film</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
