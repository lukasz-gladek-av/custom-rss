            <p>As the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> beta draws to a close, almost 99 percent of later matches were cheater free, Activision has claimed.</p>
<p>The online beta began last week and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-beta-is-out-and-is-already-plagued-by-cheaters">initially seemed to be plagued by cheaters</a>, but a few days later Activision claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-cheaters-banned-within-30-minutes-activision-claims">97 percent of cheaters were banned within 30 minutes of playing</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in a message from Team Ricochet, Activision has stated its anti-cheat tool has gone from strength-to-strength over the course of the beta.</p>

<p>On the first day, it said, 97.5 percent of matches were free of cheaters. And by the fifth day, that rose to 98.8 percent of matches being cheater-free.</p>
<p>"The trend is clear: Each day of Beta, #TeamRICOCHET adapted and improved, preventing and stopping cheaters faster - and ensuring more players experience the clean matches they expect," reads a post from the official Call of Duty Updates account.</p>
<p>"This is the result of years of investment, refinement, and collaboration across teams who care deeply about fair play. Our work doesn't stop here."</p>
<p>The Ricochet anti-cheat will continue learning once the full game is released next month.</p>
<p>"Cheaters were expected," Activision wrote in a previous post on the topic. "But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat.</p><p>"Those who did manage to slip through didn't last long. Most never made it into a match. You may have seen clips of cheaters in the Black Ops 7 Beta. We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media. We're watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt.</p>
<p>"And this is just the beginning. When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet Anti-Cheat's defenses will only grow stronger."</p>

<p>Cheaters have long been an issue in Call of Duty's online multiplayer, with the latest advancements in Ricochet Anti-Cheat being part of Activision's continued efforts to clean up the game. It remains to be seen how cheaters will fare once the game is released, but Activision appears confident in preventing the vast majority of cheaters from reaching a match.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7 will release on 14th November across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>However, it has stiff competition from EA's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, out tomorrow. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls">that game's anti-cheat methods proved successful during its beta</a> in August.</p>
