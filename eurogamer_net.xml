            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> is at long last expanding its trainer level cap.
</p>
<p>
At present, the maximum level for trainers is 50, but from 15th October this will be increased to 80 to rebalance the existing curve for more frequent level ups due to less XP required for each level.
</p>
<p>
As a result, some trainers may jump in level automatically if excessive XP past level 50 has already been gained. Niantic will share more details on how many levels in the future, but noted no trainers will drop in level.
</p>
<p>
Any tasks for Level-Up Research for levels 41 - 50 will be removed, while new tasks will be added for levels 71 - 80. Trainers at level 70 or higher will have an increased chance of becoming Lucky Friends with others.
</p><p>
However, some existing rewards will be removed - notably, the level 50 exclusive jacket. While this will still be in-game for those trainers who have already received it, it will no longer be obtainable. Further, avatar items earned by reaching levels 40 - 50 before the update will not be available after 15th October.
</p>
<p>
To mitigate this, Pokémon Go will host an XP Celebration event from 25th August until 14th October, with extra XP rewards to help players level their trainers ahead of the level cap increase.
</p>
<p>
Event bonuses are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>2x Catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws</li>
<li>+3000 XP for winning raids</li>
<li>+3000 XP for winning Max Battles</li>
<li>Level-Up Research update for level 48 - now reduced from walking 25km eight times in a week to twice in a week</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Trainer Level change will not effect Pokémon levels, which will remain capped at Level 50.
</p>
