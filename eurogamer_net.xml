            <p>
Frogwares, the Ukranian studio best known for its long-running series of Sherlock Holmes deduction adventures, is launching a Kickstarter campaign this Thursday, 6th March, to crowdfund development of its Lovecraft-inspired survival horror sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">announced last year</a>, teasing a "horror-first" evolution of the open-world formula established in the 2019 original. It features a standalone story, albeit one still set in 1920s United States, and its big change is that deduction (previously core to the experience) is now entirely optional - a way to uncover more of the story but never required to progress.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">Kickstarter page</a> is a little light on detail ahead of Thursday's campaign launch - although it does confirm a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC release - but the studio previously explained it would be seeking crowdfunding as a "safety net" during development.

<p>
Frogwares successfully <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">took a similar crowdfunding approach for 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened</a>, as it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sherlock-holmes-developer-frogwares-shares-update-on-life-in-ukraine-amid-ongoing-war-with-russia">shared some harrowing updates</a> during that game's creation.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2's imminent Kickstarter campaign comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-now-sole-publisher-of-the-sinking-city-following-dispute-with-nacon">resolution of Frogwares' lengthy dispute with publisher Nacon</a> over the rights to the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> - a dispute that at one point saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-dev-tells-people-not-to-buy-its-own-game-from-steam">Frogwares urging people not to buy the game</a> after Nacon published an out of date version missing features on Steam. Since last year's resolution, Frogwares has taken over as The Sinking City's publisher, updated the Steam build, and released new DLC.

            <p>Japanese video game producer and design legend Keiji Inafune left Level-5 in the middle of last year, in the middle of development for the next Fantasy Life game.</p>
<p>Level-5 boss Akihiro Hino detailed Inafune's departure in a post on the company's <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/blog/en/">development blog</a>, and described it as an "unexpected challenge" for the Fantasy Life team.</p>
<p>"In mid-2024, Fantasy Life faced an unexpected challenge," Akihiro Hino, CEO of Level-5, wrote. "At that time, producer Keiji Inafune left the company, and we had to reassess and restructure the project."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to Inafune's departure from the company, Hino revealed internal playtests for its upcoming Fantasy Life game - known as Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - had resulted in "harsh evaluations", with changes necessary.</p>
<p>"In response, I decided to take on the role of producer, shifting the core development team from Osaka to our headquarters," Hino said. "While the Osaka team had been dedicated from the start, the project evolved into a collective effort across our whole company - with developers from Fukuoka, Tokyo and beyond, we were able to significantly strengthen our development capabilities."</p>
<p>According to the studio exec, this restructuring allowed the team to expand and "create an environment where we could focus on fine-tuning the game's quality right up until the very end".</p>
<p>Said Hino: "From that point onward, we undertook a complete overhaul of the game: adding open-world exploration and parkour-style actions, restructuring the system's progression flow, improving the core mechanics, and refining the scenario to be even more emotionally impactful."</p>
<p>All of this will "enhance what was already great about the game", Hino continued, stating Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is now nearing completion.</p>

<p>We first got word of Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. At the time of its announcement, the game was set to release in 2023, but it later saw its launch nudged back.</p>
<p>We got a subsequent look at Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time in February last year, along with a peek <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">at the various jobs players</a> will be able to undertake in this time travelling adventure.</p>
<p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/level-5s-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-coming-to-playstation-and-xbox-as-well-as-switch-and-pc">currently slated for release across PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC via Steam on 21st May</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya is still interested in developing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a>, after the PlatinumGames and Microsoft action game was cancelled back in 2017.</p>
<p>Kamiya has now founded a new studio, Clovers, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">developing a sequel to Okami</a>. A new post on the Clovers account includes a video showing "some excitement around Kamiya's desk".</p>
<p>"He was reminiscing about the development of Scalebound while watching YouTube videos," reads the post. "It never made it to release, but even now, he still feels proud of it."</p>

<p>Kamiya is quoted as saying: "I'd love to make it again someday.😊"</p>
<p>He also shared the video on his own social media account, adding: "Let's do it, Phil!"</p>
<p>Scalebound was planned to be an action game with a human protagonist in a fantasy world, with a sidekick dragon.</p>
<p>"He's got his own headphones and smartphone," Kamiya says in the video.</p>
<p>"Just like an isekai reincarnation," a developer responds, referring to the trend in Japanese anime for stories about characters being transported to other worlds (think Spirited Away).</p>
<p>"Yeah, exactly! That's the big trend right now," replies Kamiya.</p> <div>

<p>After more than four years of development, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-microsoft-and-platinum-part-ways-on-scalebound-development-ceased">Xbox One exclusive game was cancelled</a> and Microsoft and PlatinumGames parted ways on the project.</p>
<p>That's not the last we've heard of the game, though. In 2021 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sources-microsoft-and-platinum-part-ways-on-scalebound-development-ceased">Kamiya publicly apologised to Microsoft for Scalebound's cancellation</a>, after discussing the development challenges and admitting: "We weren't experienced enough."</p>
<p>Then in 2022, Platinum president Atsushi Inaba revealed in an interview with IGN <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-would-love-to-resurrect-scalebound-and-wants-to-discuss-it-with-microsoft-properly">Kamiya had been "talking about wanting to work on Scalebound again for a while"</a>. Kamiya himself added: "I'd like to appeal to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> directly! Let's do it, Phil!"</p>
<p>It seems Kamiya is once again trying that tactic to appeal to Xbox boss Phil Spencer. Will it work this time? Is Kamiya now free to resurrect Scalebound with Clovers?</p>
<p>Or maybe he's just jealous that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">PlatinumGames is working with Team Ninja on Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, with the backing of Spencer. Can Phil work his magic this time?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
