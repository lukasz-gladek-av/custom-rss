            <p>
If you've been hankering for a lizard-scented blast of nostalgia, you're in luck; Crystal Dynamics' cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels are being bundled up for a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 16th June.
</p>
<p>
The Gex Trilogy, you might recall, was announced earlier this year, and gathers together the series' original 1995 outing - 2D PS1 platformer Gex - alongside its two 3D sequels, Gex: Enter the Gecko and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, which launched in 1998 and 1999 respectively.
</p>
<p>
Limited Run Games, which is publishing the collection, isn't quite going as far as describing the bundle as a remaster, but it <em>is</em> promising "extras and numerous improvements". There's talk of native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action. That's in addition to artwork and archival material including classic adverts, a music player, and a new interview with the voice of Gex (in the US at least), Dana Gould.

<p>
The Gex Trilogy will initially be available as a digital release when it comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183970/GEX_Trilogy/">Steam</a> on 16th June. However, Limited Run is also planning to give the bundle a physical release later this year, and those wanting to hold Gex's heft in their hands have a couple of options. There's a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-standard-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$39.99 USD Standard Edition</a>, which contains either a disc or a cartridge depending on your platform of choice (the PC version contains a Steam key), plus a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-classic-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$74.99 Classic Edition</a> that also includes a Steelbook, reversible poster, soundtrack selection CD, and a "retro box" resembling a PS1 game.
</p>
<p>
If you really want to go all-out in a fury of nostalgia, however, there's also a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-tail-time-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$199.99 Tail Time Edition</a>, which is available to pre-order from 9th May to 6th July. This includes everything in the Classic Edition (and upgrades the CD to a full soundtrack), then throws in a 7-inch Gex statue, trading cards, a Remote Pin, and a special box featuring artwork from Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. Oh, and there's a 36-inch inflatable Gex to do with as you please.

Crystal Dynamics has, of course, long waved goodbye to Gex, having released the likes of its Legacy of Kain series, Marvel's Avengers, and numerous Tomb Raider titles in the years since. Currently, the studio - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">announced layoffs earlier this year</a> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">assisting Microsoft with its troubled Perfect Dark reboot</a>, and continuing work on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">untitled Tomb Raider game in partnership with Amazon</a>. This latter title was presumably planned to launch alongside Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series, but recent reports have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-reportedly-dead">suggested the Phoebe Waller-Bridge penned show has been scrapped</a>.

            <p>
After a year of faintly enigmatic developer blogs, Paradox has finally unveiled its sort-of-but-not-exactly-mysterious Project Caesar, confirming it to be (just as everyone had expected) Europa Universalis 5 - a "new era for grand strategy".
</p>
<p>
Paradox says Europa Universalis 5 has been in developed for the last five years at Paradox Tinto, a Barcelona-based studio assmembled from 'modders, super fans, and the best developers around the world'. The has been to create "the grandest strategy game" ever, and the result is a "very ambitious" Europa Universalis where players can "do pretty much everything".
</p>
<p>
This time around, players can experience history across a span of five hundred years, formulating their nation's strategy of sustainment and expansion from 1337 to 1837, progressing through the Renaissance era, the age of Enlightenment, and beyond. Key to all this is a "living world" built around "pops". Similar to those seen in other Paradox grand strategy games, these population groups are bound by the likes of a shared culture or religion (300 religions are said to be represented in EU5), and can range from a single person to millions.

<figcaption>And here's the announcment trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKaGSIm9juI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Pops are the primary driving force of a nation's econony, working in buildings such as farms and factories to produce goods feeding into all other aspects of EU5. You'll produce food to sustain the population or keep armies moving, for instance, or goods to trade at markets as required. Pops are also split into social classes - from peasants to the clergy and nobility - and further grouped into estates, each with their own thoughts and agendas. And you'll need to keep these groups happy - perhaps granting them special privileges - to pass crucial policies in parliament.
</p>
<p>
How you spend your time is ultimately up to you - you might opt for growth through trade, diplomacy, or military might - but your strategies will eventually guide you through six ages (traditions, renaissance, discovery, information, absolutism, and revolution) and "thousands of historical events". Each age brings different institutions representing the core ideas of their eras and unlocking new technology trees. So players embracing the Quest for the New World institution will, for instance, find it easier to colonise lands during the age of discovery.
</p>
<p>
All this plays out across a "new and larger" world described as the "most accurate and granular map [Paradox has] ever made for a grand strategy game". The means a greater number of nations and "more varied topographical features" - all promising to make for a radically different experience depending on a nation's set-up, neighbours, and even terrain. Geographical features can dramatically impact battle, for instance, with rivers, mountains, and straits all potentially influencing the outcome of war - just be sure not to leave your production houses empty of workers as you swell your ranks on the battlefield.
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more granular detail to be found in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZcN-eVta8">Europa Universalis 5's 30-minute long announcement video</a>, but one thing Paradox isn't quite ready to talk about yet is a release date. Currently all it's saying is it's "coming soon".
