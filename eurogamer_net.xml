            <p>
After a bit of cheeky teasing earlier in the week that had <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> fans positively salivating, EA has turn speculation into truth: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims">The Sims 1</a> &amp; 2 are getting re-releases to celebrate the series' 25th anniversary. And better yet, they're out today on PC.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 1 &amp; 2 have, of course, long been unavailable in an official capacity on PC, with the 25-year-old original never getting a digital release and its sequel's short-lived Ultimate Collection being yanked from Origin in 2018. A report earlier this week, however - which coincided with some not-entirely-subtle teasing from EA - suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-1-2-reportedly-getting-pc-re-releases-this-week">that was about to change</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And now it's official. The Sims: Legacy Collection and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-2">The Sims 2</a>: Legacy Collection are both available for purchase on PC from today, each providing access to their respective base game and all subsequent expansions. Additionally, EA has released The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle, containing both Legacy Collections and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> base game.

<p>
If you're ready to be catapulted back to the year 2000, The Sims: Legacy Collection costs £17.99 and includes The Sims 1, plus its Living' Large, House Party, Hot Date, Vacation, Unleashed, Superstar, and Makin' Magic packs. It also comes with the Throwback Fit Kit for The Sims 4. The Sims 2: Legacy Collection, meanwhile, costs £24.99 and includes the 2005 base game, The Sims 4's Grunge Revival Kit, plus all the following The Sims 2 expansion packs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sims 2: University</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Nightlife</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Open for Business</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Pets</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Bon Voyage</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Seasons</li>
<li>The Sims 2: FreeTime</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Apartment Life</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Holiday Party Pack</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Family Fun Stuff</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Glamour Life Stuff</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Happy Holiday Stuff</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Celebration! Stuff</li>
<li>The Sims 2: H&amp;M Fashion Stuff</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Teen Style Stuff</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Kitchen &amp; Bath Interior Design Stuff</li>
<li>The Sims 2: Mansion &amp; Garden Stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you want to go all-in, The Sims 25th Birthday Bundle is £34.99. All packs are available for purchase on Steam, the EA App, and The Epic Games Store, and EA Play Pro members on the EA App get access to both collections from today.
</p><p>
All this arrives as part of EA's 25th anniversary celebrations for The Sims, which climaxes next Tuesday, 4th February, with a 25-hour livestream. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">"huge" free 25th anniversary update</a> for The Sims 4 - adding 70+ new items and a new limited-time event - arrives on the same day, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-2007s-surprisingly-alright-the-sims-spin-off-mysims-is-heading-to-switch">MySims: Cozy Bundle that released on Switch last year</a> is coming to PC on 18th March. Now we just need something <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>-related and the celebrations will be complete.

            <p>
A high-profile mod that allows Bloodborne to run at 60fps has been hit by a legal takedown notification from PlayStation, its creator has said. 
</p>
<p>
Noted modder Lance McDonald revealed the legal request from Sony Interactive Entertainment today via a post on social media. 
</p>
<p>
The takedown specifically targets McDonald's famous Bloodborne patch that ups the game's frame-rate, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-modder-releases-60fps-patch">released back in early 2021</a>. It's unclear why PlayStation has finally decided to take action now, four years later.

<p>
"On 21st February 2021, I created and released a patch for Bloodborne which makes the game run at 60fps," McDonald wrote this afternoon.</p>
<p>"Today I received a DMCA takedown notification on behalf of Sony Interactive Entertainment asking that I remove links to the patch I posted on the internet, so I've now done so."
</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted PlayStation for comment.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">On February 21st, 2021, I created and released a patch for Bloodborne which makes the game run at 60fps.

McDonald first announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modder-plans-to-release-a-bloodborne-60fps-patch-but-will-give-sony-a-chance-to-go-first-on-ps5">plans to upgrade Bloodborne's frame-rate</a> by, essentially, hacking the game back in 2020. Initially, however, McDonald held off as hoped Sony would update FromSoftware's beloved Soulslike itself. 
</p>
<p>
However, Sony has never issued a 60fps patch for Bloodborne, or shown any inclination of wanting to do so. Infamously, there's been no word of a PS5 version of the game, either.
</p>
<p>
"There's a real opportunity here for a genuinely crowd-pleasing piece of back-compat magic from Sony," Digital Foundry's John Linneman wrote in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2020-bloodborne-60fps-hack-tested-the-complete-story">deep-dive into how the Bloodborne 60fps patch worked</a> with McDonald himself. "The question is whether the platform holder has any appetite at all to revisit the game."
