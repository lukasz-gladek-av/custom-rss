            <p>Retro peripheral manufacturer Hyperkin has apologised for a "lack of transparency" and "failing to communicate" with its customers.</p>
<p>The company has had a series of fumbles in recent years, with a tendency to announce new products too early. Last year it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-handheld-sega-mega-drive-device-in-the-works">handheld Mega Drive device</a> but has since gone quiet, while back in January it revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soon-you-will-be-able-to-play-your-xbox-with-a-ps5-style-controller">PS5-style controllers compatible with Xbox and PC</a> but without a release date.</p>
<p>Also in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-guitar-hero-controller-will-release-for-the-wii-this-year">Hyperkin revealed its new Hyper Strummer guitar controller</a> for the Wii, but customers accused the company of simply reusing unsold stock of its Wii guitars. The company refuted the accusations and is set to release an <a href="https://shop.hyperkinstore.com/products/hyper-jammer-wireless-guitar-for-pc-ps3-hyperkin?_pos=1&amp;_sid=00762d90e&amp;_ss=r">equivalent controller for PC and PS3</a>.</p>

<p>Now the company has issued an apology in a bid to rebuild trust with its customers.</p>
<p>"The Hyperkin team has taken time to reflect on our values as a company," a statement on social media reads.</p>
<p>"We have overpromised and under-delivered. We failed to properly communicate and let down countless fans in the community with our lack of transparency."</p>
<p>It continued: "Our previously announced guitars are examples of us failing to communicate. There are no excuses and we take full responsibility for these mistakes. Trust is earned, not given, and we recognise that we have a lot of work to do to earn yours back with our modern guitar controller that is still being worked on."</p>
<p>Hyperkin promised to "break the habit", acknowledging its past administration was "eager to announce projects still early in development", which will no longer be the case with the new team the company is building.</p>
<div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>As such it's focused on three areas: improved transparency in communication, "consistent connection" to keep customers informed, and "uncompromising quality" as it meets its goal to "deliver hardware that exceeds expectations".</p>
<p>"For every victory there will be an announcement," it concluded. "For every shortcoming there will be a statement. Thank you to our fans, supporters and multiple communities that have put up with our missteps. We don't want to fail you again."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Lionsgate and Hasbro's upcoming Monopoly movie will be penned by the duo who bought us the criminally underrated Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves film.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/monopoly-movie-lionsgate-luckychap-john-francis-daley-jonathan-goldstein-1236311872/">Deadline</a> reports John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein have been brought onto the project, which is based on Hasbro's classic board game. The twosome's other writing credits include Spider-Man: Homecoming.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lionsgate's Monopoly film will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/barbies-margot-robbie-to-produce-monopoly-movie-with-hasbro">produced by Margot Robbie's production company LuckyChap Entertainment</a></p>

<p>"We knew LuckyChap would be a beacon for the best talent in town, and Lionsgate and Hasbro are thrilled that Goldstein and Daley have decided to join the fun," said Erin Westerman, co-president, Lionsgate Motion Picture Group.</p>
<p>"We've been longtime admirers of their work - telling bold, original, intelligent stories for all audiences. They are the perfect architects for this franchise."</p>
<p>In addition to adapting Monopoly for the big screen, last year it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/barbies-margot-robbie-to-produce-the-sims-movie-adaptation">LuckyChap was working on a film adaptation of Maxis' life-simulation series The Sims</a> alongside EA.</p>

<p>While there's no release date yet for the service, Jackbox Games is hoping to bring a beta version to "one or two smart TV platforms" in spring this year. More platforms and features will then follow.</p>
<p>"It has always been our goal to bring these games to as many people as possible and make them as easy to play as we can," reads a notice on the <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/jackbox-coming-to-your-smart-tv-for-free">Jackbox website</a>. "That is why we are announcing a new Jackbox app that will allow you to play Jackbox Games on your smart TV and other platforms."</p>
<p>If you're yet to play them, Jackbox Games are a collection of party games available on Steam that players can join on their mobile device.</p>
<p>Games include the likes of joke writing game Quiplash, T-shirt design game Tee KO, and the meme creation game Survive The Internet, among many others. The robot rap battle game Mad Verse City is a personal favourite.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-finally-adding-megapicker-for-seamless-minigame-swapping-across-packs">Jackbox added a Megapicker</a> to combine all its various game packs into a single selection, making it easier to switch between games.</p>
<p>It also released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-wants-us-to-answer-questions-like-which-meat-most-wants-to-be-called-daddy-in-its-new-naughty-pack">Naughty Pack of more mature games</a>, though considering most players like to make the basic games rude, it's unclear how popular these have been.</p>
<p>It's unknown if these mature games will be included on TVs to awkwardly play with your family.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There will be some changes to how things work in the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4">THPS4</a> when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> releases this summer. As a reminder, the original release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3</a> included a two-minute time limit in which players could complete a level's challenges. This was removed for Pro Skater 4.</p>
<p>But, while in the OG Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 players were able to skate around levels freely in Career mode and then talk to other characters around the stage to trigger challenges, on the remake's release this July, the game will instead follow a different structure.</p>
<p>Eurogamer can confirm the objectives for players to complete in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be based on a timer for both games. There will also be a Free Skate mode, which has no timer at all, as well as Speed Run and Single Session modes. The Free Skate mode in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will not let players to complete challenges in the same way that they were able to in the original Pro Skater 4 Career mode.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-latest-map">plenty of whispers and speculation</a>, Activision announced Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were finally getting the remake treatment. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store), and Nintendo Switch on 11th July. It will also be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p>
<p>"Developed with attention to detail by Iron Galaxy Studios and in collaboration with Tony Hawk and Activision, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 picks up seamlessly right where the critically acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2</a> game left off," the official blurb reads.</p>

            <p>
Bethesda has reassured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> fans it is still "hard at work" on what's next for its ambitious sci-fi role-playing game, almost six months on from last September's Shattered Space expansion.
</p>
<p>
Starfield arrived in a blaze of marketing back in September 2023, though updates for the game have since slowed. Much of Bethesda's messaging of late on the game's social media channels has been focused on highlighting community-made content.
</p>
<p>
Now, there's a fresh update from Bethesda, acknowledging the wait for news. "We know you're eager for an update," <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493">Bethesda wrote</a>, replying to a fan who contacted the company saying it needed to start communicating what was happening with the game's next update or DLC.

<p>
"We truly appreciate your passion for Starfield," Bethesda continued. "The team has been hard at work, and while we're not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right."
</p>
<p>
Responses from fans include excitement to see what's next, as well as messages speculating that Bethesda is busy working on the game's PlayStation 5 version before pushing forward with any other expansion.
</p>
<p>
"While Shattered Space is quite possibly one of Starfield's most enjoyable storylines to date, it once again struggles to offer any real consequences," our Katharine wrote of the game's first expansion, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">Eurogamer's Starfield: Shattered Space review</a>. "And its new setting feels woefully underutilised."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Bethesda's Todd Howard previously confirmed Starfield would receive at least one more Starfield expansion after Shattered Space</a> - though there's no word on when that will turn up.

            <p>Chinese-speaking users accounted for 50 percent of Steam's playerbase last month.</p>
<p>Valve has released its latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/">Steam Hardware and Software Survey</a>, which revealed a 20.88 percent increase in Simplified Chinese-speaking users in February 2025, making up half of the entire userbase.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-saw-chinese-users-spike-and-exceed-50-of-worldwide-playerbase-in-february-2025/">Automaton</a> noted, February usually brings an increase of Chinese users to Steam as it coincides with Chinese New Year holidays. However, this year's increase was significantly higher than usual - 2024 saw an equivalent increase of 7.26 percent.</p>

<p>English-speaking users are the next highest, accounting for an almost 24 percent proportion of the userbase. Similarly, the Christmas season usually results in a spike in proportion.</p>
<p>The success of Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is likely a contributing factor to this increase in Chinese users. While its player numbers have dwindled since launch, it remains a huge success story and has the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">second highest all-time concurrent player count on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor could be the demo for Mecha Break, a multiplayer mech shooter from Chinese developer Amazing Seasun Games that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed_feb_2025">dominated Steam Next Fest</a> - it reached a <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1897105111476003317">peak player count of over 300,000</a>.</p>
<p>Other contributing factors could be the ongoing success of NetEase's Marvel Rivals that saw its new season launch in this period, as well as the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> at the very end of the month that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam reach its highest ever concurrent player count</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, this upward trend in Chinese-speaking users is likely to continue. If Mecha Break's demo is anything to go by, its full release later this year will be huge.</p>
<p>Then there's the likes of the PlayStation-published Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-soul-aside-launches-in-2025-nine-years-after-devil-may-cry-and-final-fantasy-15-inspired-action-games-reveal">Lost Soul Aside</a>, as well as another Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-fresh-look-at-chinese-fantasy-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> (not to be confused with Wukong), while the free-to-play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-console-launch-delayed-as-neteases-shooter-hits-pc-this-week">FragPunk</a> follows Marvel Rivals as NetEase's next big shooter.</p>
<p>It's clear that Chinese studios are thriving, and that's resulting in a surge of Steam users in the country.</p>
<p>Yet political relations between China and the US are causing friction in the industry. NetEase laid off a number of Marvel Rivals developers from its US team despite the game's success. Reportedly, further downsizing is yet to come, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">NetEase has denied such allegations</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Chinese conglomerate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent was labelled a military company by the US</a> - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">company threatened legal proceedings in response</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has added two more Game Boy titles to its Switch Online subscription catalogue - and you can play them right now. 
</p>
<p>
1994 classic Donkey Kong is the star of the show here - the highly-regarded puzzle platformer that serves as a continuation of the classic DK arcade game, with elements of Donkey Kong Jr, and also the subsequent Mario vs Donkey Kong titles.
</p>
<p>
If you've never played it before, there's a fun surprise after the first four levels - which are the ones found in the original Donkey Kong arcade cabinet. It's safe to say the game is bigger than just those.

<p>
Also available today is Mario's Picross - which is, as you'd expect, Picross puzzles to colour in based on Mario and Mushroom Kingdom designs. Originally released for Game Boy in 1995, this was one of the earliest Picross games, and the first to the west.
