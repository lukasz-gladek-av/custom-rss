            <p>After the success of Marvel Rivals, NetEase is publishing another shooter due for release this week: FragPunk. At least, it's releasing on PC, as its console launch has been delayed without a new release date.</p>
<p>The online shooter was first revealed at last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">Xbox Games Showcase in June</a>, showing off its unique card mechanic that alters gameplay and the environments with wacky effects.</p>
<p>FragPunk releases on PC tomorrow, 6th March, but a message from the official social media account states the Xbox and PlayStation releases need more time due to "unexpected technical challenges".</p>

<p>"Since the announcement of the game, your excitement has been truly inspiring, and we know how much you've been looking forward to launching into battle on both Xbox and PlayStation," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"However, we want to be fully transparent with you: during the console compliance testing process, we encountered unexpected technical challenges in optimisation and adaptation.</p>
<p>"Rather than rushing the console release and providing a potentially poor user experience, we have made the difficult decision to delay the launch of the console versions to ensure that players receive a comparable experience to those on PC."</p>
<p>It's unknown when the console versions will now be released.</p>
<p>However, the developer will compensate players on Xbox and PlayStation by providing all rewards up front, including in-game currencies, cosmetics, experience, and more once the game is out.</p>
<p>Any console pre-orders will be cancelled, but those players will receive in-game currency worth $10 when these versions eventually launch.</p>
<p>"This delay was not an easy decision, but we are committed to delivering the best possible experience for our players, and this additional time will allow us to fully optimise and polish the console versions for launch," the statement continues.</p>

<p>The PC release of FragPunk will include 150+ Shard Cards, 13 playable heroes (called Lancers), and seven maps to battle on.</p>
<p>FragPunk promises an alternative to Valorant - like Riot's shooter it's a five-versus-five free-to-play shooter with teams taking turns to attack and defend.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunks-card-system-ensures-its-set-to-be-your-new-favourite-valorant-competitor">hands-on with FragPunk at last year's Gamescom</a> and was impressed by both the speed of gameplay and its intriguing card system that should help it stand out from other games of the genre.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Eagle-eyed Dungeons and Dragons fans have spotted a fresh reference to everyone's favourite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> vampire, hidden away in the game's new Monster Manual. 
</p>
<p>
Astarion is featured in the 2025 edition of the Monster Manual - or at least, a quote from him is - as spotted by Baldur's Gate 3 fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1j0wrn4/astarion_mentioned_in_the_new_monster_manual/">reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/the-baldurs-gate-3-arization-of-dungeons-and-dragons-continues-as-astarion-gets-2-official-mentions-in-the-new-source-books/">GamesRadar</a>). 
</p>
<p>
"Darling, you are simply delicious," Astarion says, atop the Monster Manual page detailing Vampire Spawn (medium or small Undead, Neutral Evil). And this isn't the first time Astarion has popped up in official D&amp;D lore either.
</p>
<p>
Astarion previously popped up in the official D&amp;D Player's Handbook (2024 edition) as seen in an eye-catching piece of artwork for the daylight spell. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/astarion-hed.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Here, Astarion can be spotted tucked away in the bottom right corner, unafflicted by the spell's effects which have begun to burn up all his vampire spawn brethren. (Astarion canonically is immune to sunlight, thanks to the handy plot device of having his illithid tadpole in his brain).
</p>
<p>
Last year's handbook did not specifically confirm it was Astarion in the artwork, but <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/astarion-from-baldurs-gate-3-appears-in-the-2024-players-handbook.706670/">ENWorld</a> later got acknowledgement from the illustration's artist that it was an official appearance by the character, the rights to which are owned by D&amp;D maker Wizards of the Coast.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian has now wrapped up work on the game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">one final patch that added in Xbox Series S splitscreen support</a>. The studio has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">now begun work on its next game</a>, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">it won't be Baldur's Gate 4 or anything at all to do with D&amp;D</a>. Still, it's highly likely we will see a new entry in the series launch at some point - even if it is from another developer.

            <p>Nintendo has won another lawsuit this week, this time against a pair of counterfeit sellers selling fake amiibo cards on Amazon.</p>
<p>In October 2023, Nintendo and Amazon filed a joint lawsuit against the counterfeiters for allegedly selling fake Nintendo goods, but the sellers failed to respond.</p>
<p>Now a Seattle district judge has issued a default judgement in the companies' favour, awarding over $7m in trademark infringement damages (thanks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/533664/nintendo-7-million-counterfeit-amiibo-lawsuit-trademark-infringement">Polygon</a>).</p>
<p>Specifically, Nintendo sought $705,963 against one seller through several seller accounts, $6.2m against another seller with several accounts, and $47,652 against both for a shared account.</p>
<p>"The Court finds this damages request to be reasonable, in light of the nature of the deceptive scheme, the scope of the sales, the involvement of each Defendant, as well as the need for compensation, deterrence, and punishment," court documents read. "The Court therefore awards Nintendo damages in the amounts and allocations sought."</p>
<p>Amazon shut down the sellers' accounts ahead of filing the original complaint.</p>
<p>"Nintendo utilises both internal and external resources to combat counterfeit and infringing products," wrote lawyers in that original complaint. "Nintendo works with a third-party brand protection service vendor on the detection and removal of product listings violating Nintendo's IP rights that are identified and sold in Amazon's stores. Nintendo works regularly and collaboratively with Amazon to identify counterfeit Nintendo products and to strengthen automated detection and removal of the products from Amazon's stores."</p>
<p>The news follows an announcement from Nintendo yesterday it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">successful in a lawsuit against French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which operates the website 1fichier.com. The decision was "significant" in the company's ongoing fight against pirated games, as well as for "the entire games industry".</p>
<p>Other lawsuit wins include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">against Switch emulator Yuzu</a>, which shut down and paid Nintendo $2.4m, as well as against a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">streamer who broadcast pirated games</a> last year.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most high-profile legal action from Nintendo, though, is its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>. The Pokémon-with-guns game has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-surpasses-32m-players-a-year-after-release-but-nintendo-lawsuit-remains-unresolved">surpassed 32 million players</a> a year after its release, but the legal case currently remains unresolved.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has reacted to online negativity regarding the upcoming Borderlands 4, stating "if you take developer's passion for granted, we'll all pay the price".</p>
<p>Pitchford's words come as part of an exchange on social media with influencer Gothalion, who also serves as audience director for publisher Midwest Games, and kicked off after Gothalion claimed Pitchford had muted a fan for raising some "very valid concerns (mild takes really)" about the next entry in the Borderlands series.</p>
<p>"His critique came from a place of love," <a href="https://x.com/Gothalion/status/1896361473586384983">Gothalion wrote</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/dont-gaslight-me-borderlands-4-ceo-randy-pitchford-begs-fans-to-be-optimistic-about-the-upcoming-fps-otherwise-well-all-pay-the-price/">GamesRadar</a>). "As will mine. Please reconsider. Do better. Make a great Borderlands, and when your longest lasting biggest supporters give feedback and worries, especially respectfully, digest it gracefully."</p>

</figure>
<p>Pitchford, however, did not take warmly to Gothalion's comments, and said the aforementioned mild takes were not a critique, but "shitty negativity that was demotivating" for the Borderlands 4 team.</p>
<p>"Want the best Borderlands? Root for us and cheer us on. If you take developer's passion for granted, we'll all pay the price," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1896371927259980287">Pitchford replied</a>, adding he appreciates criticism and has "never been in short supply" of it.</p>
<p>"Don't gaslight me on his post," the Gearbox exec closed. "It wasn't criticism. It was pessimism. It's toxic for people killing themselves for your entertainment, so fuck that noise."</p>
<p>This is, of course, not the first time Pitchford has been vocal in defence of his studio and media online. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-randy-pitchford-defends-recent-flops-by-comparing-gearbox-to-the-beatles">the CEO compared his company to the Beatles</a>. "I wish everything [we do] could be a hit," he said, "but that is not how it works... The greatest musical act of all time, The Beatles, had a 25 percent hit rate."</p>

            <p>Sony has just released a new update for its PS3 console, which turns 19 this year.</p>
<p>The system software update 4.92 improves system performance, according to the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/">patch notes</a>, and also renews the Blu-ray player encryption key to allow for disc playback.</p>
<p>Updates of this sort are an annual occurrence, as the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) <a href="https://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/video/aacs.html#:~:text=AACS%20(Advanced%20Access%20Content%20System,months%20and%20must%20be%20renewed.">encryption key regularly expires</a> - it's a copyright-protection technology that requires a key to be set on both the disc and the console in order to play new films.</p>

<p>The key also exists on PS4 and PS5, but according to the console manuals, the encryption key is automatically renewed, but on PS3 it must be done in a system update.</p>

<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-3-production-finally-shut-down">ceased manufacturing PS3s back in 2017</a>, around a decade after it first launched. Over 87.4m PS3 consoles were sold, as of March 2017.</p>

            <p>
Capcom has unveiled a bustling in-game event schedule for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, with the first oppurtunity to gain new gear available now.
</p>
<p>
Six events will go live over the next three weeks, each lasting for a week or two, with rewards ranging from new headgear to... more cheese? I guess <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">Monster Hunter Wilds is really leaning into its cheese naan meme</a>.
</p>
<p>
The schedule begins now with Ku-Ku Gone Cuckoo, an event based in the Scarlet Forest which requires you gather special materials to obtain the Mimiphyta α headgear. This runs until 18th March.

            <p>PlayStation has been hit with more layoffs from its Visual Arts studio, following the recent cancellations of multiple live-service games.</p>
<p>The layoffs come amid a restructuring of Sony's US studios, as an unknown number of staff from the San Diego-based Visual Arts studio will be let go this week.</p>
<p>Visual Arts supported first-party development (including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us remasters), and while these new cuts include staff who contributed to the recently cancelled live-service game from Bend Studio among others, <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734">Kotaku</a> has reported the layoffs are more widespread.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted Sony for further details on these layoffs.</p>
<p>The news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">several cancelled projects from Sony</a>, including a live-service game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and another from Bluepoint reportedly based within the God of War series.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony cancelled live-service shooter Concord</a> back in September, admitting "our initial launch didn't land". A month later, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">shut down developer Firewalk Studios</a> as the game would remain permanently offline.</p>
<p>This time last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony laid off 900 staff</a> equating eight percent of its workforce. The reductions were predominantly due to the closure of its London Studio and reductions at Firesprite.</p>
<p>On the flipside, Sony still has its Horizon live-service game in development, which has now added former Bungie senior design lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisjamesproctor/">Chris Proctor</a> to its team as a design director. At Bungie, his focus was on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s weapons.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
