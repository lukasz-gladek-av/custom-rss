<p>Dragon Quest 1 + 2 HD-2D Remake follows the release last year of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake, which went on to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">huge sales success for Square Enix</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">particularly in Japan</a>.</p>
<p>The company began with the third game in the series as it's chronologically the first, with a post-credits scene confirming the release of the first two games.</p>
<p>The Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection will be digital-only and include all three games in one collection. It will launch across all platforms on the same day, 30th October.</p>
<p>"Some excellent enhancements make this the ultimate version of Dragon Quest 3, but it could still do more to make it wholly welcoming to newcomers," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review">Eurogamer review of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>.</p>
<p>As for new Dragon Quest games, series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-dragon-quest-12-is-still-in-development-says-series-creator">Yuji Horii confirmed in February that Dragon Quest 12 is still in development</a>. It was first announced in 2021 but little has been seen since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Last of Us season two finale, which aired early on Monday morning here in the UK, welcomed 3.7 million cross-platform viewers in the US.</p>
<p>This figure is significantly lower than the season's opening episode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-debut-viewing-figures-beat-season-one-premiere">which premiered with 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers</a>. To compare further, The Last of Us' first season finale set an audience record of 8.2 million viewers on its debut.</p>
<p>However in a <a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-0/last-us/influx-viewers-raises-global-audience-over-90-million-last-us">press release</a>, HBO said it expects to see the second season finale's audience "grow significantly" following the Memorial Day holiday weekend, which contributed to lower viewer numbers.</p>

<p>Additionally, the network states the second season of The Last of Us is now averaging close to 37 million global viewers per episode, with that number "growing".</p>
<p>To give more context, following its debut in 2023, HBO said the first season of The Last of Us was averaging nearly 32 million cross-platform viewers per episode in the States. At this time, the company added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">The Last of Us was the most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in both Europe and Latin America</a>.</p>
<p>Viewer numbers have continued to rise since season one's release, and the show's global audience now sits at more than 90 million.</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us picks up five years after the events of the season one finale, with Ellie and Joel - played by Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal - now living in Jackson. New cast members this season include Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara as a new character for the show, Gail</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to its season two premiere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">The Last of Us was renewed for a third season</a>. At this time, showrunner Craig Mazin said: "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the showrunner confirmed The Last of Us TV team is working on a four season plan, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">there's "no way" the show's narrative can be wrapped up in only three seasons</a>.

            <p>It looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a> will be getting a physical release across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40602/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/">ESRB</a> posted about a release for Ninja Theory's sequel across Xbox Series and Playstation 5. This time, though, Microsoft was not listed as the game's publisher, but Limited Run Games was instead.</p>

<p>Limited Run Games is known for publishing physical editions of games which may otherwise remain only available to purchase digitally. So, while an official announcement hasn't been made, this rating all but confirms the physical editions' existence.</p>
<p>In addition to the above releases for Hellblade 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, a new Switch listing for the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a> game has also been added to <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40601/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/">ESRB</a>, again with Limited Run Games listed as publisher. This suggests Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice will also be getting a physical Switch version. The first Hellblade game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2019-hellblade-switch-tech-analysis">originally arrived on Nintendo's platform digitally back in 2019</a>. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Ninja Theory announced Hellblade 2 was set for a PS5 release this summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-coming-to-ps5-in-enhanced-edition">in a package known as Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Enhanced Edition</a>. This release will include new features and haptic feedback, and also be optimised for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. A free update will be coming to the PC and Xbox versions of the game.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, Hellblade 2 did not initially release on PlayStation, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buys-ninja-theory-playground-games-more">Ninja Theory was acquired by Xbox maker Microsoft in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>"We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword," studio head Dom Matthews said at the time of the game's PS5 announcement. "And we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans back to Senua's story."</p>

<p>We were rather taken with Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 on its debut last year, with Johnny Chiodini calling it a "triumphant return to a challenging story" in their review. "Hellblade 2 continues Senua's story with grace, confidence, surprising brutality and thundering conviction," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review">Eurogamer's five star Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>The Hellblade sequel went on to become the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-receives-most-nominations-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">most-nominated game at this year's BAFTA Game Awards</a>, ultimately winning the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">award for Technical Achievement</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Last of Us Part 2 isn't short on death and misery. Seattle is carnage, with warring factions the WLF (Wolves) and the Seraphites (Scars) taking no mercy on each other, and that's before you add Ellie or any of the Jackson community into the mix.</p>
<p>The TV series has remained faithful to most of the game's key deaths. As in Part 2, The Last of Us' second season sees Joel, Nora, Mel, Owen and Jesse murdered, the latter three all in the series finale. One character, however, makes it out alive despite being killed in the game: Alice.</p>
<p>Alice is one of the WLF's canine companions in The Last of Us Part 2, and while she may only be an animation, at the end of the day her death was one that actually hit me hardest when I played the game for the first time. When Ellie makes her way into the aquarium during her search for Abby, Alice is alerted by the noise and attacks her. Ellie then fatally stabs Alice with her switchblade. However, this doesn't happen in the show.</p>
<p>Why? There are two reasons. The first is that The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin, who also penned Chernobyl, felt he couldn't do another pet killing scene. Chernobyl is a historical miniseries which revolves around the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and one moment sees pets culled in a bid to stem the spread of radiation.</p>
<p>"I think you get like one dog murdering episode a lifetime," Mazin said when the topic of The Last of Us' Alice came up during a recent press event (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/601536/last-of-us-season-2-ending-changes-breakdown">Polygon</a>). "There are two cardinal rules in Hollywood. One: don't spend your own money. Two: don't kill a dog."</p>
<p>The showrunner added that "because it's live action, the nature of violence becomes much more, well, graphic. It's more graphic because... it's not like there's an animation between you and it, [and] it's very disturbing".</p>
<p>So, that's Mazin's reason for not including Alice's death in the show's second season, but what was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckman's? Well, essentially, the finale had too much death already, with Ellie herself nearly dying at the hands of the Seraphites, before she proceeds to kill Owen and Mel (and by extension Mel's unborn baby) pretty soon after. Then, before the episode wraps for good, Jesse is shot in the face by Abby, and dies immediately from his wound. It is all quite harrowing as it is, let alone if we then had to also see a dog get murdered in the name of revenge.</p>
<p>"And in our conversation, we're like this [is] probably one too many," Druckmann concluded.</p>
