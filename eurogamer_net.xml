            <p>Just 15 percent of Steam players spent time with new releases - defined as games released in 2024 - this year.</p>
<p>That's according to Steam itself, which gave us a little insight into the broader playing habits of its players as part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/641297020996289523">Steam Replay 2024</a>.</p>

<p>This year, the recap not only shows you how many games you played and when, but also your favourite genres, the achievements you unlocked (the median was 13), the number of games played (for most, this is four), and your longest streak (the average was six days, apparently).</p>
<p>"How many games did you play, and how does that compare to last year? Did you unlock a bunch of achievements? What about your longest streak? These fun numbers and more are in your Replay," Valve teases.</p>
<p>You also get the chance to be humbled by the amount of time you spent with your most-played games of 2024, as well as a quick recap of any playtests you participated in, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-antitrust-lawsuit-expands-to-include-anyone-who-has-paid-a-commission-to-valve-since-2017">A 2021 antitrust dispute brought against Steam has now been expanded into a class action lawsuit</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, the case concerned just two companies - Wolfire Studios and Dark Catt Studios - but a court document recently showed the motion for class certification has been approved. This means the lawsuit now applies to "any developers, publishers, or individuals" who have honoured Steam's 30 percent cut on any and all purchases on or after 28th January 2017.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> marks the close of 2024 with patch 1.1, the studio confirmed it is also working on a next-gen patch for the console version of Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy.</p>
<p>Although only able to commit to a fairly broad "next year", the team said, "we know you've asked us to update the PC versions of the original Stalker games, and we also plan to do that".</p>
<p>"Keep an eye on our social media so you don't miss the exact dates," the studio teased.</p>

<p>In an end-of-year message, GSC said: "Yesterday, a major patch 1.1 for Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl was released. All the time between the release and the Christmas holidays has been dedicated to improving your experience with our game. We hope that many of you will find the time to start, continue, or finish Stalker 2 during the holidays."</p> <div>

<p>GSC said that it will continue to update Stalker 2 in the upcoming year, and will "be ready to share the content roadmap for the game at the beginning of 2025".</p>
<p>"The next-gen patch for the console versions of Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will be released next year," GSC added. "We know you've asked us to update the PC versions of the original Stalker games, and we also plan to do that.</p>
<p>"The amount of support you've shown us since the game's launch still amazes us. Your support is truly a miracle of the Zone. We will see you next year!"</p>
<p>At its launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2</a> was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>.</p>
<p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-receives-first-major-patch-including-a-life-fixes">GSC Game World released the first major patch</a> for Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, which addressed over 1800 issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
