            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> launches today and is currently sitting at the peak of Steam's top sellers rankings, with one analyst estimating it has already made over $100m in sales before coming out.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, Battlefield 6 is the best-selling game on the platform right now, beating out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. It's also the fourth most-Wishlisted game, beaten only by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, Deadlock, and Light No Fire. It's followed by Arc Raiders in fifth, and Kingmakers in sixth place.</p>
<p>According to estimates from video game analyst <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-success-as-battlefield">Rhys Elliot in the Alinea Newsletter</a>, the game has already made over roughly $100m in pre-launch sales on Steam. Elliot also stated the game has over 3.5m wishlists on Steam, as well as 1.8m pre-orders on the platform.</p>

<p>These stats come in the wake of a series of popular open betas for Battlefield 6, during which a concurrent peak player count of 865,233 was reached on Steam alone. These betas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">described as the best performing Battlefield betas ever</a>, led to a surge of interest in the title. So much so that a blast from the past Call of Duty vs Battlefield debate has emerged, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">one EA has not been shy about wading into</a>.</p><p>If you're interested in trying out Battlefield 6 when it launches today, check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6 review</a> first. In it, reviewer Rick Lane notes: "Ultimately though, Battlefield 6 clearly understands what makes the series special, even if it occasionally seems reluctant to accept it. Unlike 2042, the fun is easy to find from the outset, and what problems it has are much simpler to fix. It could be more ambitious, and I'd like more of those larger sandboxes to play in, but overall Battlefield 6 is a reliable reset - and, crucially, a very strong foundation for EA to build upon."</p>

            <p>There are still secrets in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> fans are yet to discover, but its director won't give any hints.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer about the game's forthcoming update and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">the future of the Clair Obscur franchise</a>, director Guillaume Broche discussed inspiration taken from the Final Fantasy games. While there's a reference to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> specifically in the Gestral Village - with characters swapping "Double Dyad cards" in a nod to that game's Triple Triad card game - overall Broche simply took inspiration from the general vibe of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s iconic series.</p>
<p>But are there other secrets yet to be uncovered? "There are, but I don't want to say them because they won't be secrets anymore," Broche told Eurogamer. "Maybe they have been found, but I haven't seen anything about it. There are still a few things, yeah."</p>

<p>Fans have scoured Expedition 33 for hints and references, but it seems some of these weren't intentional.</p>
<p>"The funny thing is [fans] found secrets that were absolutely not secrets originally," said Broche. "And we are just like, ok cool. I guess that's a secret!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">Ahead of the game's release</a>, Broche told Eurogamer he was keen for players to experiment with the game's battle system to create "broken builds" and - as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> speedrunner himself - he was looking forward to seeing no-hit runs of Expedition 33.</p>
<p>So did the community live up to his expectations?</p>
<p>"They are up to my expectations, which were very high," said Broche. "They destroyed the game very fast. My personal speedrun record was broken in one week, maybe even less."</p>
<p>The team did release an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quick-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-will-soon-nerf-the-games-best-move">update to fix one particular ability</a> that proved a little too powerful. But other than that, Broche is "very happy that people found crazy builds that even [he] didn't really think about. It's exactly what we made the system for."</p><p>What he perhaps didn't expect was for the community to discover his workings out. Fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">uncovered a trailer for an early version of the game posted on reddit</a> by Broche in a bid to find voice actors, which showed it in a very early state.</p>
<p>"It was like everybody entered my room and saw my underwear," Broche joked. "I completely forgot that it was still accessible."</p>
<p>"It's funny," he continued, "because I think that not often enough do we see real behind-the-scenes footage of games in general, like the very first prototypes that very often look terrible."</p>
<p>Sandfall CTO and lead programmer Tom Guillermin added the discovery helped to "demystify" the early stage of a project. "I think it's not that bad in the end that people found out," he said. "It's actually the same project in Unreal that we just upgraded iteratively and in the end that's the game people get to play. I think demystifying that great games are not great from the beginning, it's maybe good for the industry and also for the hobbyist as well."</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">release an update to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soon</a>, adding new quality of life options and new story scenes offering "a bit of whee and a bit of whoo".</p>
