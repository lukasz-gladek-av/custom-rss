            <p>Microsoft has begun a substantial layoff process at Xbox. At the time of writing, Zenimax and King are reportedly affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">According to a report by Bloomberg</a>, Microsoft's barcelona-based King Division is losing 10 percent of its staff, which comes to roughly 200 people.
</p>
<p>Staff at Zenimax have also been informed of layoffs across its European offices, though the number of impacted employees is currently unclear. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025">According to a report by Windows Central</a>, Zenimax's London-based marketing team - as well as staff in Rockville, Maryland - are included in these cuts.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">A memo seen by IGN has been sent around the Xbox gaming division by Phil Spencer</a>, confirming layoffs at the company. You can read it in full below:
</p>
<p>"Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organisation. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today's notifications and any organisational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.
</p>
<p>"I recognise that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritise the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p>
<p>"Prioritising our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental - it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.
</p>
<p>"HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.
</p>
<p>"Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey."
</p>
<p>Word of these layoffs began last month, when a report stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">Xbox was set to restructure much of its central-European distribution</a>. At this time, Bloomberg described the then-upcoming redundancies as a "major restructuring", and the fourth case of layoffs to hit Xbox in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-laying-off-3-of-workforce-in-biggest-round-of-cuts-since-2023-report">Xbox cut three percent of its total workforce</a>, which at the time was the biggest loss of staff since 2023. Previously in September 2024, Xbox laid off 650 employees, which it said was to "organise our business for long term success".</p>
<p>This story is developing, and will be updated as more information becomes available.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds has seen key members of its leadership team - including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> - 'replaced' by owner Krafton, just months before the underwater survival sequel's long-awaited early access release.
</p>
<p>
Krafton, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021</a>, announced the leadership changes in a <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">press release</a>. Cleveland - who founded the studio in 2001 and has variously served as designer, programmer, team lead, chief executive office, and franchise creative director since then - is out, alongside chief executive officer Ted Gill, and special projects director Max McGuire.
</p>
<p>
Krafton did not specify a reason for the departures in its announcement, but claimed it had "sought to keep the Unknown Worlds' co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development". All three have been replaced by Steve Papoutsis, who'll oversee the Subnautica developer while maintaining his current role as CEO at Krafton's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. "The company wishes [Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire] well on their next endeavours," Krafton added.

<p>
There are, however, hints throughout Krafton's statement that it wasn't happy with Unknown Worlds' planned timeline for the development of Subnautica 2. There are references to owing "our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible", as well as talk of "delivering the right game at the right time" using "clearly defined metrics and targets". New Unknown Worlds boss Papoutsis is said to "fully [support] this process". Unknown Worlds had previously announced Subnautica 2 was - much like its highly acclaimed proginator - anticipated to remain in early access for two to three years.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 (actually the third game in the acclaimed series, following 2021's standalone Subnautica expansion Below Zero), was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">confirmed to be in the works back in 2022</a>. A first cinematic trailer finally arrived last October, tipping a nod to the sequel's new co-op mode, and additional details have slowly emerged since then in the run-up to Subnautica 2's planned early access release later this year.
</p>
<p>
So far, Unknown Worlds has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">aired small snippets of gameplay</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-talks-silent-protagonist-a-big-ol-ocean-map-and-more-in-latest-qa">some of the things players can expect to see in Subnautica 2</a>. The sequel will, for instance, ditch Below Zero's controversially chatty lead and return to the silent protagonist approach of the first game. That's alongside the introduction of a brand-new ocean planet promising "all-new mysteries, creatures, and experiences", customisable characters, new vehicles, and more.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 doesn't have an early access release date yet, but when we last heard from Unknown Worlds the aim was still to launch it sometime this year.

<p>Prime Gaming is available for Amazon Prime subscribers, offering free PC games each month and more.

<p>As for the games themselves, a personal favourite of mine, Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered arrived back in February of last year. On its release, we awarded the game four stars while acknowledging some of its dated qualities.</p>
<p>"I still love this collection, because it's carefully made and lovingly updated, but also awkward, elbowy, frustrating and prone to leaving me stuck. It's a collection that understands that Tomb Raider was absolutely a game about its controls, and it still should be - even if it doesn't quite know how to deliver on that," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-review">Eurogamer's Tomb Raider 1-3 Remastered review</a>.</p>
<p>Donlan was similarly taken with Toem on its release. "Playful challenges and a warm sense of place and character converge in this cheerful modern classic," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toem-review-a-photography-puzzler-and-a-journey-filled-with-lovely-moments">Eurogamer's glowing Toem review</a>.</p>
<p>Another highlight from this batch of games is Venba. "Food and family converge in this beautiful slice-of-life tale," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/venba-review-tasty-puzzles-and-a-recipe-book">Eurogamer's Venba review</a>, which also boasts four stars.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>'s director has acknowledged the game's controversial nomination for best indie game at The Game Awards 2023, admitting Mintrocket is not an indie studio.</p>
<p>Mintrocket is a subsidiary of South Korean developer and publisher Nexon, but its game was nominated for the Best Independent Game award, ultimately missing out to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with Japanese site <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/635/G063598/20250627083/">4gamer</a>, director Hwang Jae-ho stated "there's nothing indie about [Dave the Diver]" considering it was made at Nexon.</p>

<p>"I wonder if people mistook us for an indie studio just because we're developing games as a small team, or just because our art styles and game systems tend to be unique," he said (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dave-the-diver-director-addresses-controversial-best-indie-game-nomination-from-2023-theres-nothing-indie-about-us-we-didnt-apply-for-it/">Automaton</a>). "For some reason, we also ended up getting nominated for the Best Indie Game award, which caused some people to go, 'Hey, isn't that a Nexon game?', but it's not like we applied for the award ourselves (laughs)."</p>
<p>Nominees for The Game Awards are chosen by an international jury of global game media outlets. As Hwang noted, Nexon therefore had nothing to do with the nomination.</p>
<p>Essentially, the media got it wrong, perhaps due to Mintrocket being considered a small team, or due to the pixel art style.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, ahead of the game's release, Nexon vice president <a href="https://www.gametoc.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=69776">Dae-Hwon Kim stated in an interview</a> Dave the Diver isn't an indie game, despite appearances.</p>
<p>Later, The Game Awards producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> confused matters. "Independent can mean different things to different people, and it's sort of a broad term," he said (as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/keighley-weighs-in-on-debate-over-dave-the-diver-qualifying-for-best-indie-game/">VGC</a>). "You can argue, does independent mean the budget of the game, does independent mean where the source of financing was, does it mean the team size? Is it the kind of independent spirit of the game, meaning a smaller game that's sort of different?"</p>
<p>He then deferred to the 120 global media outlets that voted to determine the interpretation. Now, Hwang is finally ending the debate.</p>
<p>Dave the Diver received widespread critical acclaim and is still receiving updates two years after its release. Its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-delays-in-the-jungle-dlc-but-sure-knows-how-to-soften-the-blow-with-these-other-announcements">In The Jungle DLC has been delayed into next year</a>, however, after first being revealed in 2024.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination]]></content:encoded>
