            <p>Publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> has revealed three new games in its latest digital showcase, all of which are playable at this week's Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>Annapurna is known for publishing well-loved games like Outer Wilds, Stray, the most recent To a T, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cocoon-is-eurogamers-game-of-2023">Eurogamer's 2023 Game of the Year Cocoon</a>. There are always high expectations, then, as to what it's supporting next.</p>
<p>The first of these three games is D-topia, a puzzle-adventure game from Marumittu Games that features a minimalist sci-fi aesthetic as a young boy seeks to question how to find happiness if life is a utopia?</p>
<p>Expect choice-based gameplay and a very cute grumpy cat. It's set for release next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 and 2, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>Next up is People of Note, described as "a full fledged musical, condensed into a video game" - specifically, a turn-based RPG. The trailer shows a young female star in a singing contest, a colourful futuristic world, and musical battles against strange creatures.</p><p>Of course, any music game like this lives and breathes by its songs - thankfully, this sounds like it could have some Kpop Demon Hunters-esque bangers. It's coming from Iridium Studios and will be out next year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>Lastly, there's the Zelda-like adventure Demi and the Fractured Dream from developer Yarn Owl. A "tribute to classic action-adventure games", it features hack and slash combat with puzzle solving and platforming, plus ethereal visuals.</p>
<p>Once again, it's due out next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 and 2, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>"Annapurna Interactive is making its debut at this year's Tokyo Game Show and we couldn't imagine a better way to participate in this iconic event than by showcasing three great new titles from amazing indie studios," said Leanne Loombe, head of games at Annapurna Interactive.</p><p>"From the wonderful puzzle adventure D-topia, to the catchy, innovative turn-based musical RPG People of Note, and a beautiful love letter to the classic action-adventure genre with Demi and the Fractured Dream, these games embody our vision of supporting world-class developers who are pushing the boundaries of artist story telling."</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">majority of Annapurna's staff quit in a mass exodus</a> following a dispute with the company's owner.</p>
<p>Today's showcase was the second since then, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-showcase-everything-announced">February's showcase</a> featuring a number of games now available.</p>
