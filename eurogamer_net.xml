            <p>The upcoming Resident Evil movie reboot from Zach Cregger will be "unlike any of the previous films" in the franchise.</p>
<p>That's coming from the director himself, who was speaking during Sony Pictures' CinemaCon presentation earlier this week.</p>

<p>"There's a moment that comes in almost every Resident Evil game where you find yourself in a dark passageway, your health is almost zero and there's no way around," Cregger said (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-resident-evil-movie-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films-director-promises">IGN</a>). "You have to go through but you know there's something awful for you in the darkness."</p>
<p>Continuing on, the director - whose previous work includes 2022's Barbarian, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">our Matt describes as "wonderfully unpredictable"</a> - added this is "a thrill that the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>" have managed to perfect.</p>
<p>"My movie will be built in the spirit of those games and follows one central protagonist from point A to point B, as they descend deeper into hell," Cregger closed.</p>
<p>As to who that central protagonist <em>could</em> be, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-austin-abrams-1236170177/">The Hollywood Reporter</a> states Euphoria's Austin Abrams (pictured below) is being eyed up for a role in the upcoming film, although nothing has been finalised. Cregger and Abrams previously worked together on upcoming horror film Weapons, which is scheduled to release later this year.</p>
<p>Constantin Film is producing and co-financing Cregger's upcoming Resident Evil adaptation, with PlayStation Productions also on board. Sources told The Hollywood Reporter the reboot "is decidedly on the horror track", and will have "elements of a wilderness survival thriller". </p>
<p>
The Resident Evil film is currently set for release on 18th September, 2026. </p>

<p>Elsewhere in horror news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">last month we got another teaser for the rather horrifying looking Silent Hill f</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's Resident Evil games), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin has addressed those criticising Bella Ramsey for not looking older as Ellie in the show's upcoming second season.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-season-2-craig-mazin-interview-1236169252/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mazin said he understands "the difficulty that some people have where they say, 'She looked like she was 14 in season one. She still looks roughly the same to us, even though now she's 19'."</p>
<p>Mazin added he appreciates Ellie in The Last of Us Part 2 does look "much older" than she did in the first game. However, when it comes to the show, he isn't "interested in the physical aspect" of Ellie's appearance.</p>

<p>"Some people do change quite dramatically and some people don't," Mazin said. "I've been looking at Bella's face for years while editing, and I can see that she's certainly grown. I'm interested in the emotional maturity, and the change in personality."</p>
<p>The Last of Us showrunner added he has "watched Bella grow and become independent and start to find her own two feet separate and apart from her parents", stating it's also about "how do I figure out how to be my own person now and test that full independence?"</p>
<p>This is something he "[feels in] Ellie completely" when it comes to Ramsey's portrayal of the character.</p>
<p>"So, I understand where people are coming from, but when they watch this year, I think they're going to see the difference," Mazin closed.</p>
