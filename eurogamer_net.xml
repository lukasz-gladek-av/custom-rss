            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> - best known for this work on the Nier and Drakengard series - will be writing a new Evangelion series. This series was announced as part of the 30th Evangelion anniversary celebration over the weekend.</p>
<p>This revelation was spotted on <a href="https://www.evangelion.jp/news/260223-1/">the official Evangelion website</a>, in which a small credits page for the upcoming series was posted. In addition to Taro, the show will be directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki and Toru Yatabe, while the music will be composed by longtime Bandai Namco composer Keiichi Okabe.</p>
<p>What this series will be about is currently a mystery, but it comes in the wake of Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time which among other things acted as a firm conclusion to protagonist Shinji Ikari's story. So whether he'll return, or we'll see a drastically different spin on Evangelion, is the big question.</p>
<p>As for Taro's inclusion, his own work is no stranger to Evangelion inspiration and influence. Only a year ago, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-x-nier-automata-taro-yoko-hyung-tae-kim?utm_source=twitter">he credited Neon Genesis Evangelion as one of the main inspirations for Nier Automata</a>, a game that exploded in popularity following its 2017 release. Nier Automata has also had some big news recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-future-developments-teased-as-it-passes-10m-worldwide-sales">with new developments in the series teased following a recent 10m sales milestone stream</a>.</p><p>So is it a good thing that we're getting more Evangelion? Well, if you like the series then obviously more entries in a series you love is great news. You could, however, argue that Shinji's finale in the latest movie where he steps away from the world of Evangelion was also quite a heavy-handed message to the audience too, urging them to move on from Eva. To have that message, then a new series, may conflict with what was a meaningful conclusion. Here's hoping they don't bring Shinji back, basically.</p>
<p>But let us know what you think? What would you like to see from a new Eva series? Do you even want one?</p>
