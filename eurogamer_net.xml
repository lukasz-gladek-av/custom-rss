If you're eager to know what's new in EA Sports FC 26, your day is almost here; EA is giving its latest football iteration the full reveal treatment later this week. And it's also unveiled this year's Ultimate Edition cover star, so you got something to look at while you wait.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, EA Sports FC 26's "full reveal" is scheduled to air this Wednesday, 16th July. Proceedings get underway at 5pm BST, so you've got approximately 47 hours at the time of writing to dig out your best hat in anticipation.  And when you're done, you'll be wanting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24">bookmark the appropriate YouTube page</a>.
</p>
<p>
EA's reveal announcement arrives alongside a <em>second</em> announcement <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSFC/status/1944774028578684977">confirming</a> one of this year's EA Sports FC cover stars: retired Swedish footballer Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡ is EA Sports FC 26's Ultimate Edition cover star, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zlatan-ibrahimovi-accuses-ea-of-using-his-name-and-face-in-fifa-21-without-permission-ea-responds">falling out with the company</a> back in 2020 when he accused it of using his name and face without any agreement in the FIFA games.
