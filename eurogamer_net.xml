<p>"The Game Awards aims to recognise the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content‚Äôs release," the website now says. "Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination.</p>
<p>"Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration."</p>
<p>This now means that remakes like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> could be in contention, as well as DLC like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>.

<p>It also means games with seasonal content like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, Destiny, and other live-service games are also eligible, even if the base game itself released several years ago.</p>

<p>"Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer's Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>, awarding the game an impressive five out of five stars in the process.</p><p>Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 remake has already sold a total of 1m copies</a> across both physical and digital media since its global launch on 8th October.

            <p>20 years after its 2004 debuted, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> has broken its own concurrent player record on Steam.</p>
<p>According to SteamDB, the seminal shooter has secured just over a 61.7K player peak over the weekend, the highest number of simultaneous players the game has achieved since records began in 2008.</p>
<p>In fact, the number I've just written is probably already out of date - the number is still rising and has been all day, having increased several times in the time I've been writing this.</p>

<p>Given this weekend's surprise release of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">special anniversary update</a>, it's possible players are jumping back into the game to revel in nostalgia or possibly check out the new director's commentary. It's also possible - given Valve is currently giving away the game for free - new players are trying it for the first time.</p><p>If you haven't seen it yet, in the accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">documentary now available on YouTube</a>, the Half-Life 2 development team revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-episode-3-doesnt-exist-because-left-4-dead-does">Episode 3 didn't make it after the team switched focus to concentrate on getting Left 4 Dead "out the door"</a>.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> needed an all-hands-on effort to ship, and so we put down [Episode 3] to go help Left 4 Dead," explained developer David Speyre. "It took long enough that by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, well, we missed it. It's too late now. We really need to make a new engine to continue the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>"Now, in hindsight, that seems so wrong. We could have definitely gone back and spent two years to make Episode 3."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Treyarch has enabled, disabled, and is now reintroducing legacy XP tokens in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Along with five multiplayer maps - three of which are brand new - free and premium content, a new Zombies "experience in-season", and full integration with Call of Duty's spin-off battle royale, Warzone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-has-so-much-content-this-infographic-hurts-our-eyes">Black Ops 6's Season 1</a> also introduced something else - legacy XP tokens.</p>
<p>Turns out the latter was an accident, though, as no sooner did players spot legacy XP tokens in the new shooter, developer Treyarch "fixed an issue that incorrectly allowed legacy XP tokens to be activated in Black Ops 6 UI".</p>

<p>If you were frustrated by the fix, you're not alone - which is why Treyarch is exploring a way to do this "correctly" in the future.</p>

<p>"We realise how much players appreciate being able to redeem legacy XP tokens in both BO6 and Warzone, so we are currently testing a way to implement this change correctly in a future update. This allows us time to ensure stability is maintained before we reintroduce this feature.</p><p>"In the interim, players can activate any legacy XP tokens in Warzone. Any tokens applied in Warzone will also apply to Black Ops 6 should you switch titles or modes," Treyarch concluded, before revealing we should hear more about this change "next week".</p>

<p>As well as sharing stunning concept art and gameplay prototypes, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> team reunited in the documentary to talk about the development of Episode 2.</p>
<p>The developers also revealed that Episode 3 didn't make it after the team switched focus to concentrate on getting <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> "out the door".</p>

<p>"Left 4 Dead needed an all-hands-on effort to ship, and so we put down [Episode 3] to go help Left 4 Dead," explained developer David Speyre.</p>
<p>"It was a really tight shipping schedule and it required a lot of work from everybody to get it out the door. It was worth it - I mean, Left 4 Dead came out great. But it took long enough - and this is the tragic and almost comical thing about it - it took long enough that by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, well, we missed it. It's too late now. We really need to make a new engine to continue the Half-Life series.</p>
<p>"Now, in hindsight, that seems so wrong. We could have <em>definitely</em> gone back and spent two years to make Episode 3."</p>
<p>The documentary also delves into specific details like weapon design, such as the ice gun that could be used to create cover, ascend over obstructions, or provide players makeshift ledges to get down the side of mountains, and so on.</p>
<p>But at the end of documentary, Valve boss Gabe Newell admitted that one of the reasons Episode 3 never came to be was because his "personal failure was being stumped".</p>
<p>"You can't get lazy and say, oh, we're moving the story forward. [But] that's copping out of your obligation to gamers. Yes, of course, they loved the story - they love many, many aspects of it, but sort of saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next‚Ä¶</p>
<p>"You know, we could have shipped it. Like, it wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. Like, I couldn't figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."</p>
<p>The team did, however, reflect that if Episode 3 <em>had</em> been realised, we may not have seen other sequels like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead-2">Left 4 Dead 2</a>.</p>
<p>Newell also added that without Episodes, Dota may not have been made.</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the Episodes, there'd be no such thing as Dota. I know that sounds really weird, but it was the things that we learned in developing the Episodes that led to, you know, Team Fortress 2, to more rapid updates."</p><p>The full documentary is available to watch online above. Don't forget that to mark Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary this weekend, Valve also released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-just-got-a-special-20th-anniversary-update-with-a-new-documentary-commentary-and-more">special anniversary update</a>, bundling in commentary, the previously separate Episodes 1 &amp; 2, and more. Oh, and the game's free to keep over the next few days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> players are still struggling to import their world states despite the issue being flagged to BioWare and EA over a week ago.</p>
<p>Regardless of what platform you're playing on, it seems some players can only see default world states.</p>
<p>EA community manager <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14240306/highlight/true#M86201">EA_Shepard acknowledged the issue</a> on the official forums 10 days ago, saying the team was "aware and investigating". Shepard also validated another issue, this one with the Golden Nug, which goes AWOL mid-playthrough or disappears entirely for some.</p>

</div><figcaption>Dragon Age The Veilguard Review: The BEST Bioware Has EVER Been! (Spoiler-Free).<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f0BX-JXzek" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Revealing that they "reported this [to the studio] at the end of the week last week and checked up on this", EA_Shepard recently confirmed that it was "still an open issue" and the team "is still working on this one".</p>
<p>The issue has apparently been further compounded by some players getting confused "around the world state importing into their game".</p>
<p>"When you import your world state, it will say default world state. The name does not change," Shepard explained.</p>
<p>"When you want to import a world state, rename it in the Keep first, import it in the Keep, and then start a new game," they added, acknowledging that when they tried it themselves on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X, only one was successfully imported.</p><p>Shepard also confirmed that there "are ways to try to get it resolved by manually choosing the options and creating entirely new world states after you sync and replay the keep", but acknowledged this "has not worked for all players".</p>
<p>Towards the end of the week, Shepard shared a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14259708/highlight/true#M86454">further</a> update.</p>
<p>"Wanted to let you know I am still looking out for this one," they said. "I know the whole 'we are working on it' message gets old. Believe me, I get it! There is a lot happening and being worked on with Dragon Age so things are a bit slower on other fronts. I am watching it closely though so I have not forgotten about the community!"</p>
<p>"I get that Veilguard support is prioritised at the moment since it's a brand new game, and Keep has always been kinda buggy, but I think I speak for all of us when I ask that this issue be made more of a priority," <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Keep-DA-I-World-State-and-Golden-Nug-Not-Syncing-In-Game/m-p/14262923/highlight/true#M86492">said</a> one player.</p>
<p>As for Dragon Age: The Veilguard? Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>.</p>
<p>"From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
