            <p>
Sony has launched a new "centralised" Beta Program initiative for PlayStation, providing an easy way for the public to sign up help test PlayStation 5 and PC games, as well as various console and app features, ahead of their full release.
</p>
<p>
Sony describes PlayStation's Beta Program as a "easy, centralised place" where players can register to participate in a range of different betas. These are expected to include beta access to PlayStation 5 and PC games, PlayStation 5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even features for Sony's PlayStation website. Anyone interested in participating only needs to sign up once - invites will be send out automatically if a registered user is selected for a specific test, and they're then free to accept or decline that invition as they see fit.
</p>
<p>
"While we try to include as many players as possible in our beta programs," Sony explains in its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/">announcement on the PlayStation Blog</a>, "sometimes we may get more interest than we can accommodate. By joining this program, it enables you to be considered for beta participation, but it doesn't guarantee selection for a beta test."

<p>
Players can <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/">sign up via the 'Beta Program at PlayStation' website</a>, but Sony notes a PlayStation Network account is required and must be in good standing with a current email address. Additionally, participants must meet the legal age requirement in their region, and can only participate when a specific beta test is available in that region.
</p>
<p>
"A big thanks to those of you who have participated in all of the betas we've offered across Sony Interactive over the years," it concludes. "It's about to get easier and more convenient."
