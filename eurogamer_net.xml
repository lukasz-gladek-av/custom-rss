            <p>Sony has quietly expanded the cloud streaming feature on its PS Portal handheld to include a number of games from its Classics Catalogue.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">streaming feature launched back in November</a> last year and allows PS Plus Premium subscribers to stream games directly to the handheld without the need for a PS5 console.</p>
<p>Since then, Sony has been quietly adding to the service, which now includes almost every PS1 and PSP game from the Classics Catalogue in the streaming library (thanks <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps-portal-ps-plus-premium-streaming-update-march-2025">TrueTrophies</a>).</p>
<p>At its launch, the beta allowed players to access "select PS5 games", with over 120 games included. Now players can dive into the likes of Ape Escape, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>, Legend of Dragoon and more.</p>
<p>As it remains in beta, the cloud streaming service is only available in 30 countries, though that does include the UK.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the service can be accessed in: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.</p>
<p>It's unclear when the service will arrive in full globally, but for now it's clear Sony is keen to add to the catalogue of games - even if it's not including news in its regular PS Plus updates.</p>
<p>If you own a PS Portal, instructions on accessing the beta can be found on the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/subscriptions/psportal-cloud-game-streaming/">PlayStation Support website</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">PS Portal</a> was released in November 2023 - it's impressive hardware but does require a strong internet connection to function well. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-already-sold-out-as-scalpers-take-advantage">quickly sold out after release</a>, though scalpers took advantage of demand.</p>
<p>The device is also included in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-uk-ps5-rental-scheme-from-11month">Sony's new PlayStation rental service</a>, priced at Â£6.50 per month. Separately, you can rent PS5 consoles each month, or a PS VR2 too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sony announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-premium-and-extra-games-for-march-revealed">PS Plus Premium and Extra lineup for this month</a>, including the excellent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> and a number of classic Armored Core games from FromSoftware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
