            <p>Nowadays everything is an Xbox, and that includes Sony's PS5. Last month, the console's best-selling games all came from its rival publisher.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/05/playstation-store-april-2025s-top-downloads/?sf277169095=1">shared by Sony</a>, the number one downloaded game on PS5 for April in Europe was the newly-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a>, followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Minecraft.</p>
<p>In the US and Canada it was a similar story: Oblivion top, followed by Minecraft and Forza Horizon 5.</p>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> was also a best-seller (fourth in Europe, sixth in the US) - a game that has been heavily promoted by Xbox and is also available on Game Pass.</p>
<p>Additionally, the previously Xbox exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> has been selling well on Sony's console, too.</p>
<p>Microsoft began its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">"This is an Xbox" campaign</a> in November last year as it builds a "future defined by player choice".</p>
<p>It's been heavily memed, but clearly it's working as games previously exclusive to Xbox consoles make their way to PS5 and top the charts.</p>
<p>Indeed, as we reported back in January this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the best-selling game across both Xbox and PlayStation</a> over the previous quarter. Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">notoriously acquired Activision</a> - and the rights to Call of Duty - back in 2023 for $68.7bn.</p>
<p>Oblivion Remastered released at the end of April and has seen big success on Steam as well as on consoles - within its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-off-to-a-good-start-on-steam">first day it reached a peak of 182,298 concurrent players</a>, which has since risen to 216,784.</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> is deservedly one of Xbox's most successful franchises," wrote Eurogamer's Tom Orry on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-now-has-one-of-the-greatest-racing-games-of-all-time-and-it-feels-like-im-cheating-on-my-xbox">one of the greatest racing games of all time</a>. "PlayStation owners should be rubbing their hands together with glee."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Someone has already decoded the strange, banana-like text in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. They have found the mon-key to unlocking it all, if you will. </p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/random-youtuber-cracks-donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-language-before-launch">Nintendo Life</a>, last week YouTuber 2Chrispy released a video detailing how he had gone about deciphering the strange text seen throughout Donkey Kong Bananza's trailers, gameplay footage, website and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">even the Nintendo Today app</a>.</p>

<p>The YouTuber said after he spotted the language in Donkey Kong Bananza, he began to wonder if Nintendo had in fact hidden a secret alphabet in its upcoming game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/imagining-and-deciphering-writing-systems-for-games">much like it had done in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. And, it turns out it has.</p>
<p>Thanks to more patience than I could ever hope to possess and a good recollection of the Nintendo Treehouse presentation, 2Chrispy used the in-game term 'Chip Exchange' as a starting point. As a reminder, because I had forgotten, during Nintendo's Donkey Kong Banaza Treehouse stream, a notice appeared when the player picked up a Banandium Chip. "Trade these for bananas at any Chip Exchange," this pop up read.</p>
<p>2Chrispy realised the symbol for the Banandium Chip also showed up in the game above a sign with that strange text. The YouTuber noticed the text beneath this symbol had the same number of characters as the word 'Exchange'. Additionally, the text started and ended with the same symbol, which looked a bit like a back to front E. Using this new found information, he started to fill out his "Bananabet", looking for recurring patterns in the game's text and using tools such as a word finder to keep the decoding efforts going.</p>
<p>Other words 2Chrispy managed to find included the likes of 'Welcome' and 'Hint'. There is even an in-game sign players will be able to find, which according to 2Chrispy's translations reads:</p>
<p>"Message. Thank you for reading. Someone."</p>
<p>All in all, this really is quite an impressive feat from the YouTuber, and if you are interested in Donkey Kong Bananza's world building, I really suggest checking out 2Chrispy's video (see below). It's a fascinating and really rather engaging watch.</p>

<p>Our Tom has already had some time with Donkey Kong Bananza, which is coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> on 17th July.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," he wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
