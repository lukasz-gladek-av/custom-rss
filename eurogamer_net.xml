<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance has been hit with more layoffs, parent company Krafton has confirmed, amid claims "most of" its developers have lost their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Word of job cuts at Striking Distance began surfacing earlier today as employees took to social media. Former director of concept art Jesse Lee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/">wrote</a> that "most of the devs were laid off", while former cloud devops engineer Seth Spitkoski <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seth-spitkoski-b0316b68_opentowork-activity-7299777905088217091-fDCU/">said "many" had been impacted</a>.
</p>
<p>
Krafton later confirmed layoffs at the studio in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-callisto-protocol-studio-lays-off-more-employees-but-remains-operational/">statement shared with PC Gamer</a>. "Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile," the company wrote, "which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development."
</p>
<p>
"The studio remains operational," the publisher added, "and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time." Krafton did not reveal the reveal the number of staff impacted by its job cuts.
</p>
<p>
Striking Distance was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield in 2019, and the California-based studio would go on to release sci-fi horror game The Callisto Protocol in 2022. However, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kraftons-share-price-falls-as-the-callistol-protocol-fails-to-hit-its-sales-target">disappointing sales</a>, Schofield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">parted ways with Krafton</a> in 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-developer-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-32-employees">32 employees were laid off</a> amid efforts to "realign the studio's priorities".
</p>
<p>
Since then, Striking Distance has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-callisto-protocol-gets-a-roguelike-spin-off">announced a roguelike The Callisto Protocol spin-off</a>, codenamed Project Birdseye, but no further details have been shared following its reveal.
</p>
<p>
Confirmation of layoffs at Krafton comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone has seen seen the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, Warner Bros. Games San Diego</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Swords</a> shut their doors, with layoffs confirmed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">Marvel Rivals' US development team</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>.

            <p>
Tetris Forever, last year's excellent interactive history of the classic block-dropping puzzler, has added two more games plucked from the series' past as part of its "biggest-ever update".
</p>
<p>
Tetris Forever, if you're unfamiliar, follows the format of developer Digital Eclipse's previous (and consistently superb) interactive documentary experiences - Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/llamasoft-the-jeff-minter-story">Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</a>, and The Making of Karateka - combining archive material, new interviews, and playable games into one fascinating whole.
</p>
<p>
At launch, it featured 15 games - ranging from a recreation of the original Tetris on Electronika 60 to Digital Eclipse's new Tetris Time Warp - and additional versions, including Welltris, have been added since then. And now the roster is expanding further, this time adding MS-DOS versions of Spectrum Holobyte's 1991 Super Tetris and 1988's Tetris (AcademySoft) v. 3.12.

<p>
Super Tetris, Digital Eclipse notes, was an early attempt at creating a Tetris "sequel", requiring players to earn bombs and clear a Matrix already half full at the start. Tetris (AcademySoft) v. 3.12, meanwhile, is the final version of Tetris created within the Soviet Union, and includes a Phantom mode featuring invisible O-Tetriminos.
</p>
<p>
Alongside its two new games, Tetris Forever's latest update brings enhancements to Tetris Time Warp. Its single-player modes now run to Level 30 instead of the previous Level 15, for instance, while multiplayer mode's Time Warp Tetriminos have gained the new Shield power. 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, its single-player 1989 Mode now lets players turn off "modern gameplay" for a more historically accurate experience (and its possible to reduce Matrix rows down from 20 to 18), and there's the new 40-Line Challenge, tasking players with clearing 40 lines as quickly as possible. That's on top of a much-expanded Tetris Time Warp options mode, enabling far greater customisation of visuals, sounds, and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there are adjustments to the Electronika 60 version of Tetris to make it "even more historically accurate", and "many other minor tweaks, bug fixes, and enhancements." All this is available now across all platforms as part of Tetris Forever's latest free update.
</p>
<p>
And if you've even a passing interest in the history and legacy of Tetris, Digital Eclipse's Tetris Forever is well worth your time. Christian Donlan called it a "gorgeous documentary compilation" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tetris-forever-review">four star review</a> last year.
