            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> CEO Dan Clancy has published an <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/">open letter</a> detailing the company's plans for 2025, including new ways of collaborating, mobile improvements, and more monetisation.</p>
<p>After thanking the streaming community for an "amazing" 2024 - "More than ever, in todayâ€™s world, we all want and need to find belonging and connection with other people," said Clancy - the CEO listed new tools and opportunities for streamers, as well as new ways of building connection.</p>
<p>Collaboration is a "core part of Twitch", so following the Stream Together feature added last year, the company is working on shared hype trains and shared sub goals to drive revenue collaboratively. In addition, shared chat will be manageable in the mobile app for IRL streamers.</p>

<p>Speaking of mobile, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitchs-revised-mobile-app-will-arrive-this-summer">Twitch re-launched its mobile app</a> (as announced at TwitchCon Europe), adding a Discovery Feed to find streamers based on recommendations. This year it will continue to revise the app, adding the ability to stream in both landscape and vertical video, and investing in the feed to aid discovery. Clips - short videos of a streamer's best moments - will also be easier to edit.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, Twitch is opening up monetisation for "most" streamers, such as subscriptions and bits. Usually streamers need to reach Affiliate status before monetisation tools kick in, but this year streamers will be able to start earning immediately. Of course, Twitch takes a cut of all monetisation, so it's as much of a benefit to the company as to streamers themselves.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the company is launching a new tool for streamers to let brands know they want to collaborate (sponsored streams are often more lucrative to streamers than subscriptions), and will also launch more promotional events.</p>
<p>Importantly, Twitch is continuing to focus on safety. This month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">Twitch updated its enforcement rules</a>; next it's looking to provide more detail on violations, and will expand moderator tools to make it easier to protect streams.</p>
<p>Lastly, Twitch will expand more of its Guilds (such as the Pride Guild) to a global community and include Ambassadors from around the world.</p>
<p>It's been a quieter start for the year for Twitch compared with 2024. It began last year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">over 500 layoffs</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-isnt-profitable-admits-ceo-in-wake-of-recent-layoffs">Clancy admitted the platform isn't profitable</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-staff-concerned-about-more-layoffs-later-this-year">report later in the year claimed staff were concerned about more layoffs</a> on the way and the future of the platform.</p>
<p>At TwitchCon Europe last year, I spoke with VP of product Jeremy Forrester about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-twitch-safety-growth-and-the-importance-of-finding-community">sustainability of the platform</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo Switch Online's retro game collection is losing its first game - in Japan at least. 
</p>
<p>
Today, Nintendo announced via a <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1895280559703892048">post on social media</a> that 1991 SNES football game Super Soccer will be pulled from the Japanese Nintendo Switch Online catalogue in a month's time, on 28th March. No reason was given for the removal. 
</p>
<p>
For now, Nintendo is yet to say whether Super Soccer will also similarly disappear from other versions of the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue elsewhere in the world. Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for comment. 
</p>
<p>
Is Super Soccer being removed due to a rights issue - as is so often the case with other digital subscription services elsewhere? Will this become more common, as the Nintendo Switch Online catalogue ages? Is this anything to do with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>?
</p>
<p>
Whatever the reason, it's frustrating to see, yet again, another digital games library meant to preserve access to older games being subject to removals such as this. (It was also not an issue on previous Nintendo consoles, where retro games were sold rather than placed behind a subscription.)
</p>
<p>We'll update if we hear more from Nintendo on why Super Soccer has been removed.</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-game-boy-advance-wario-next-week">Nintendo added its first Game Boy Advance title to its subscription service for more than four months</a>. Wario Land 4 arrived on Valentine's Day, and makes up one of the dozens of games available in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">the full Nintendo Switch Online catalogue</a>.

            <p>For reasons totally unrelated to the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has given its team a "special holiday" today, 28th February.</p>
<p>In a memo, staff were advised that as many employees hinted that they may be too unwell to work today, management had decided to give the team the day off as a "special holiday".</p>

<p>"On 28th February, we received a series of puzzling reports from many employees that they might feel unwell the next day, so we decided to institute a special holiday for the company," the memo said (as translated by Google).</p>
<p>It then confirmed a special day's holiday has been awarded to <em>most</em> departments - it's unclear what teams won't be eligible - and stressed to players that the time off would not impact Palworld or Craftopia, with scheduled updates progressing as planned (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/">Automaton</a>).</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds currently boasts an all-time player peak of 987,482</a>, although it seems likely it will smash past this number over the weekend. This makes Wilds one of the most-played games on Steam, surpassing peak player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>In comparison, Monster Hunter World has an all-time player peak of 334,684, meaning Wilds has almost tripled the former's peak player numbers in less than a day.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt awarded it 4/5, saying: "Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades.</p>
<p>"And if it continues Monster Hunter's legacy of generous post-launch support - where the series has traditionally felt the freest to get daft and indulge in its more sadistic tendencies - it'll be fascinating to see how this beautiful new baseline for the series develops."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> looks set to be a smash hit for Capcom, with the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">hitting nearly a million concurrent players on Steam overnight</a>, but the response to the game so far from those played is not all positive, according to Steam user reviews. 
</p>
<p>
On Steam, Monster Hunter Wilds currently sits with a Mixed rating, with  many responses criticising the game's technical performance. 
</p>
<p>
This morning, <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292">Capcom issued a social media post</a> seemingly in response to these early complaints, and said that anyone "experiencing any issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam"  should try updating their graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode and then readjusting their settings. The company also linked to a more detailed <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/047">Capcom support blog</a> with further tips.

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hunters!

<p>
For now, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340">Steam user reviews</a> are awash with complaints regarding the game's performance.
</p>
<p>
"This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimisation I've ever seen," wrote one fan who has already clocked up five hours of playtime. "I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point."
</p>
<p>
"I have been a fan since MH3U," wrote another player. "I have 1000s of hours in MH across all of the games. My beefy rig with a 3080 super and decent CPU can't run this game at an acceptable frame rate."

<p>
"Runs even worse than the beta," wrote a third. "For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this."
</p>
<p>
Still, the game's performance issues at launch don't seem to be putting too many people off from continuing. Currently, 940,000 people are playing Monster Hunter Wilds via Steam - just down from its overnight peak of 987,000. 
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry will be weighing in with its verdict on Monster Hunter Wilds on PC shortly.
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt called it "the most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter yet, even if its attempts to balance the old and new don't always quite coalesce in its ongoing quest to please all audiences".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA has released the source code for classic strategy games in the Command &amp; Conquer series along with Steam Workshop support, opening the game to modders.</p>
<p>The games in question are Command &amp; Conquer (aka, Tiberian Dawn), C&amp;C Red Alert, C&amp;C Renegade, and C&amp;C Generals + Zero Hour, all released under the General Public Licence.</p>
<p>In short, this will continue to preserve the legacy of the games and make it easier for modders to continue creating content.</p>

<p>The news follows the launch of Command &amp; Conquer Ultimate Collection on Steam last year, after which EA commissioned modder Luke "CCHyper" Feenan to research improvements to the games - as detailed in a new reddit post.</p>
<p>In addition to opening the source code, which allows existing C&amp;C communities to continue supporting their work, Steam Workshop support has been added for more games in the series.</p>
<p>All Mission Editor and World Builder tools have been updated, meaning maps can be published directly to the Steam Workshop. In addition, a C&amp;C Modding Support pack has been released, which contains the source Xml, Schema, Script, Shader and Map files for all the games that use the SAGE engine - a long-requested wish from the community.</p>
<p>Lastly, EA has updated its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/modding-faq?isLocalized=true">Command &amp; Conquer Franchise Modding Guidelines</a> to reflect this initiative.</p>

There's a temporary truce in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Galactic War, after a game-breaking bug introduced during maintenance.
</p>
<p>
The issue sprung up yesterday, after Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead issued an update to the game's backend. The problem saw planet liberation rates skyrocket - which is a good thing... until it isn't.
</p>
<p>
"While we know this is fun, we also know that it is breaking the Galactic War mechanic itself," Arrowhead wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1895176702252458384">post on social media</a>. "In short, this is harming the game experience and will have detrimental effects on the war mechanic in the future."

<p>
While players' sudden tide of victory will not be turned back, Arrowhead has frozen the Galactic War so no further damage to the game's balance is done.
</p>
<p>
"We have made the decision to pause the Galactic War temporarily until this is fixed," Arrowhead continued. "We're already starting the process, but we do not yet have an ETA for this fix."
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Helldivers 2 will remain fully playable, but victories will not contribute to the wider goal of liberating planets within the war. 
</p>
<p>
"This is our mistake and we own it," Arrowhead concluded. "We are not going to revert any of the damage done by this error, however, so your major order victory is still secure."

In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-creative-director-takes-sabbatical-promises-to-start-arrowheads-next-game-on-return">Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt announced he was taking a sabbatical</a> after working for 11 years on the series, but would return to begin develoment on the studio's next game.
