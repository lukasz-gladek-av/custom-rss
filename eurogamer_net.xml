<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will return to the world of The Walking Dead by offering up a cache of assets for players and developers to go build themed mini-games with.
</p>
<p>
Characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins. This latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan - responsible for perhaps the series' most grisly moment - as a skin next. 
</p>
<p>
Negan's baseball bat Lucille is among the items from the franchise being added as props to Fortnite. A selection of comic book-inspired walkers (zombies) will also be included. Additionally, you'll be able to switch on a post-processing effect to make in-game experiences have more of a comic book-style effect.

<p>
In a press release, Epic Games said it hoped the assets would inspire The Walking Dead "role-playing survival RPGs, prison escape roguelikes, and chaotic free–for-all shoot 'em ups" to be made in Fortnite.
</p>
<p>
As with previous licenses, such as Lego, creators of user-made experiences agree to share 12 percent of Fortnite's engagement payout with the owner of the property - in this case, Skybound.
</p>
<p>
In other Fortnite news, today's latest update to the game has included files relating to Sabrina Carpenter (as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1904507845845885343">prolific Fortnite leaker ShiinaBR</a>), all but confirming the Espresso-loving popstar as the next icon set to take centre stage in the game's Guitar Hero-esque Fortnite Festival mode.

<p>
Previous stars such as Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg have become available as skins in-game alongside their arrival as the next Fortnite Festival headliner, with a season pass for the mode that includes a selection of digital instrument cosmetics and music tracks by the artist. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, today brings the launch of Fortnite OG Season 3. This takes the classic version of Fortnite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-scrambling-to-solve-the-mystery-of-fortnites-looming-meteor">into the era of the meteor</a> - now, incredibly, seven years ago.

            <p>Sony has released system software updates for both the PlayStation 4 and PS5.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, while we may now be in the PS5 generation, Sony is still issuing updates for PS4.</p>
<p>The latest PS4 update, system software update 12.50, is more typical of the stability updates Sony likes releasing to patch various exploits used to modify or jailbreak consoles. The patch notes are short and very to the point.</p>
<p>"We've improved the messages and usability on some screens," reads a post on PlayStation.com.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ps3-gets-new-system-software-update-19-years-after-release">Sony also released an update for its PS3</a>, a console which is now old enough to buy itself a pint down at the pub here in the UK.</p>
