            <p>The twin suns are setting on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-huters">Star Wars: Hunters</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/zynga">Zynga</a>'s free-to-play arena battler - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zyngas-star-wars-hunters-finally-arrives-in-june-after-years-of-delays">finally released after several delays and set backs</a> - will go offline on 1st October.</p>
<p>The Star Wars: Hunters team said it understood this news was likely "disappointing" for fans, but the "decision was not made lightly".</p>

<p>"Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process," reads the <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/">post announcing the end of Star Wars: Hunters</a>.</p>
<p>In light of this news, season five of Star Wars: Hunters will be extended by three weeks, beginning next week, on 25th March.</p>
<p>A final free content update will then be released on 15th April, when in-game purchases will be disabled. As part of this update, new support Hunter Tuya will join the fray. "Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content," the Star Wars: Hunters team state. "We will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation."</p>
<p>Finally, on 1st October, the game's servers will go offline and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable.</p>
<p>"Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey and for the time youâ€™ve spent playing Star Wars: Hunters," the post closes.</p>

<p>But, while the sun sets on one Star Wars game, it will rise on another. We will get our first look at the Star Wars turn-based tactics game from Bit Reactor and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> during the <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-celebration-japan-2025-panel-schedule">Star Wars Celebration</a> in Japan on 19th April. So, stay tuned for more on that soon!</p>
<p>In other Star Wars news, earlier this month it was reported that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-kotors-troubled-remake-still-coming-suggests-studios-latest-comments">troubled remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic is still coming</a>, despite relative silence from Saber Interactive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
