If you've been considering taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> for another spin (or even a first spin) but want to do it on device small enough you could feasibly play it while, say, spelunking, there's some good news: the "reimagined" mobile version of developer ZA/UM Studio's acclaimed RPG comes to Android devices on 5th August. And if you still need some convincing it'll work on a smaller device, there's even more good news, as the first two chapters are free.
</p>
<p>
Disco Elysium - a sort of hard-boiled noir mystery presented using the conventions of a CRPG - tells the story of an amnesiac, alcoholic detective attempting to solve a murder while in the throes of existential crisis. And Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell enjoyed its verbose, improbably deep psychodrama enough that he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-disco-elysium-is-about-outliving-history">named it one of his faves of 2019</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Edwin is far from its only fan. But ZA/UM - a troubled studio that's been involved an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">absolute mess of litigation and finger-pointing</a> since Disco Elysium's release - didn't exactly impress when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-is-being-reimagined-for-mobile-devices-to-captivate-the-tiktok-user">announced a "reimagined" mobile adaptation earlier this year</a>. "We intend to captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio, ultimately creating an all new, deeply engaging form of entertainment," is how studio head Denis Havel put it.

In truth, though, the reality doesn't seem anywhere near as dubious; essentially, ZA/UM has ditched the original's isometric gameplay in favour of an approach somewhat closer to a visual novel, where players swipe through dialogue options presented against bold 2D artwork. The idea, the studio says, is to create an experience specifically tailored toward "short play sessions that should easily fit into your life". Such as, say, when you're spelunking.
</p>
<p>
When Disco Elysium's mobile version "debuts" for Android on 5th August (suggesting an iOS release may follow), it'll <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZAUM.M0_stable&amp;pli=1">cost £9.99/€9.99/$9.99 USD</a>. But if you're not entirely sold on the idea of ZA/UM's reimagining, you'll be able to play the first two chapters for free.
</p>
<p>
As to what ZA/UM is doing next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-zaums-new-rpg-c4-is-part-espionage-thriller-part-psychedelic-sci-fi">that'll be C4</a>, a new RPG described as being "part espionage thriller, part psychedelic sci-fi". Meanwhile, a whole bunch of former staff (many who split acrimoniously) have announced new projects in a similar vein to Disco Elysium.
</p>
<p>
Over in the UK, there's Dark Math Games and Longdue - two studios comprised of former ZA/UM developers that both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors last year. Longdue is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">working on a "psychogeographic RPG" it's now unveiled as Hopetown</a>, while Dark Math is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">developing a detective RPG called XXX Nightshift</a>. Additionally, former Disco Elysium writer Argo Tuulik has also announced a new RPG, being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">made at his Summer Eternal studio</a>. And finally, Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have also set up their own studio, and were previously said to be making a game with backing from NetEase.
