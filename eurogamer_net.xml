            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> recently celebrated its first anniversary, and to mark the occasion developer Pocketpair outlined its plans for the game's second year, with a roadmap that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">co-op crossplay and an "ending scenario"</a>.</p>
<p>But, why add an 'ending' now? Could it be because of Nintendo's impending legal action against the game? Well, Pocketpair community manager John "Bucky" Buckley tells Eurogamer this 'ending' has actually been "mapped out for quite some time" - and even though it is on its way, it certainly doesn't mean this is 'the end' of Palworld.</p>

<p>"The World Tree, where the 'ending' takes place, has been visible since day one," Bucky tells me. "Many players suspected their journey would end there, and we've been asked repeatedly about when the World Tree will become available so we're pretty excited to finally be opening the area up for players!"</p>
<p>Bucky admits "ending" may not actually be the best way to phrase things, but says he "can't think of a better one" right now.</p>
<p>"While the World Tree will mark the conclusion of this particular journey, it's by no means the end of Palworld," he assures.</p>
<p>As for what else is still to come in Palworld, Bucky promises "exciting things" in the pipeline. "We might have announced the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> collaboration a bit prematurely," he admits, "but everyone, including Re-Logic, was so excited that we thought it'd be fun to share early!"</p>
<p>Pocketpair remains "really excited about the direction [its] headed", Bucky continued, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">Pocketpair's newly-announced publishing division</a> "which aims to fund and support developers in creating cool games".</p>

<p>Of course, Palworld's first year has not been without its challenges.</p>
<p>"There were so many challenges, to be honest," he tells me. "Pre-launch, we started gaining traction online, which was new for us and brought its own difficulties. Post-launch, we faced server problems, bug reporting issues, countless accusations... It was a lot to handle.</p>
<p>"While those issues haven't entirely gone away, they've definitely become more manageable."</p>
<p>Those accusations mostly came with a Pokémon-flavoured edge to them. Before the game was released in early access last January, many dubbed it 'Pokémon with guns' due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-hides-an-unreleased-familiar-looking-pal-creature-in-its-code-fan-says">familiar designs of some Palworld creatures</a> and some in-game mechanics. Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> back in September, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit is targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>

<p>So, what has the team learned from the last 12 months? After all, no one - even Bucky - expected Palworld to take off quite as much as it did. As a reminder, Palworld became the first big mega-hit of 2024, surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam last January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG.</p><p>"As a company, we've learned how to structure our processes better," Bucky tells me. "People often forget that Pocketpair is quite a small team. The methods we've used for our previous games worked well, but Palworld put a spotlight on both our weaknesses and strengths. This year really brought the team together and made us more effective in our workflows."</p>
<p>But, for Bucky personally, he now appreciates the "importance of asking for advice and help as soon as possible" adding: "There are so many incredibly knowledgeable people in this industry."</p>

            <p>Funselektor, the developer behind art of rally, has revealed a co-op off-road exploration game titled: over the hill.</p>
<p>"Explore the world in the golden age of offroading. Drive iconic vehicles from the 60s to 80s by yourself or with friends through challenging trails and beautiful scenery," reads the official blurb. </p>
<p>Tow ropes may be required to get your fellow car enthusiasts out of a tight spot, if the announcement trailer (below) is anything to go by. It all looks a bit like a cosy take on a Top Gear challenges of old, obviously with a lot less yelling of "Poweeeer!" by the hosts, mixed with some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> elements.</p>

<p>The game's biomes have all been inspired by real locations, and while they can be explored with your friends by your side, you can also take to the road (or track) on your own if you just fancy a quiet drive to clear your head. Weather will change around you as the sun sets and night comes, with the developer promising a "dynamic, immersive experience" on over the hill's release. There will also be hidden objectives and challenges dotted around, so something to keep an eye out for.</p>
<p>"After  having developed several games about motorsport, we wanted to go off-track by offering players a vast world to lose themselves at a slower pace," said Funselektor founder Dune Casu.</p>
<p>"In a way, this game is similar to the experience  I've had journeying across North America in my trusty camper van. There's something special  about being in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere, from the peace, the sounds of nature and  less distraction from the civilized world. I hope this game can really drive that feeling home."</p>
<p>If this all sounds like your thing, you can add over the hill to your wishlist on Steam.</p>

<p>As for Funselektor's previous game art of rally, we called it a "blast" on its release in 2020.</p>
<p>"It's as graceful and poised as Michèle Mouton holding a Quattro S2 at an impossible angle, and as stylish as any driving game I've played. There might be more complex takes than art of rally on the discipline out there, but none of them is as quick to get to the appeal of off-roading as this," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/art-of-rally-review-a-slight-yet-stylish-take-on-off-road-driving">Eurogamer's art of rally review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
