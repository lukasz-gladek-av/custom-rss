            <p>Nintendo has announced a Direct, which is set for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Direct will take place on 31st July, at 2pm UK time. It will be roughly 25 minutes long, and include information about games from Nintendo's publishing partners. This will include titles coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>So, what can we either hope for or expect from tomorrow's broadcast? Well, we could always start prepping our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong summoning circles once again. It has to show up some time soon… right? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">Xbox has a playable demo for Silksong at Gamescom this year</a>, but we know that Team Cherry's sought after Metroidvania is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">also primed for both Switch consoles</a>, so it could happen…</p>
<p>Personally, I would also love to hear or see more from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/professor-laytons-new-adventure-turns-him-into-lukes-protege">Level-5's Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</a>. This chap was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">announced during a Nintendo Direct back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we could perhaps hear about a release date for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> on Switch 2. FromSoftware's incredibly successful game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">announced for Switch 2 back in April</a>, though with no date attached to it. The edition coming to Switch 2 will be the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">which includes the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a>, as well as new armour and a new Torrent appearance customisation feature. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">Two new classes are also on the way as part of Elden Ring's Tarnished Edition</a>.</p>
<p>We also may hear more from Supergiant Games, which in April announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">Hades 2 would be a timed console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> is still in early access on PC, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release">developer is gearing up for its full fat release (hopefully) very soon</a>.</p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer will be watching along to bring you the news as it happens. What do you hope to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-direct-announced-for-tomorrow-3]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sandfall Interactive has released a new update for its widely-praised turn-based RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, adding among other changes a Battle Retry prompt.</p>
<p>This has been one of the "most requested" quality of life improvements, the developer said. This new feature does exactly what it says on the tin - if faced with a defeat, players will now notice that a pop-up window appears in the game, which will allow them to give things another go.</p>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>'s retry mechanic, which was a popular inclusion to Atlus' fantasy RPG when it was released last year. This mechanic allowed players to restart a battle without any consequences if things weren't exactly going the way they had hoped they would. If only real life came with a button like that…</p>
<p>But, I digress. Other tweaks within Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's latest update include the Pictos menu now clearly displaying the Lumina cost of each ability, which the team said will allow for "better planning".</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive has also added separate volume sliders, which means players can now independently adjust the volume for exploration and combat phases.</p>
<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 below:</p>
<p><strong>Performance and Visuals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS &amp; XeSS Enhancements: Added Frame Generation and Low Latency Mode support for both DLSS and XeSS (compatible GPUs only). Enjoy smoother gameplay and lower input lag!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Quality of Life Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Battle Retry Prompt: A new pop-up window appears after defeat, giving you the option to quickly retry the battle.</li>
<li>Lumina Cost Display: The Pictos menu now clearly displays the Lumina cost of each ability for better planning.</li>
<li>Autoplay Dialogue: Added an optional autoplay feature for dialogues outside cutscenes. You can toggle it in the settings and during dialogues.</li>
<li>Separate Volume Sliders: Audio settings now lets you independently adjust the volume for exploration and combat phases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added icons to Lune’s Stains to improve readability and accessibility for colorblind players.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>

<li>Characters will no longer gain immortality when using the Second Chance pictos combined with Healing Boon and Protecting Death</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the Rocher holding a crystal occasionally despawning after reentering the Stone Wave Cliffs</li>
<li>Fixed some players being teleported behind the Monolith upon loading a save</li>
<li>Fixed Gameplay modifiers being applied to a New Game save when enabled on other saves</li>
<li>Fixed landing as Esquie without the party spawning, leading to input loss</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Achievements </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed journals vanishing after loading a Save File that was created at the exact moment of picking up that journal</li>
</ul>
<p>The following two trophies should now pop for you when you load your save if you were affected by these bugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed "Expeditioner" and "Trailbreaker" achievements not unlocking if the characters reach a level higher than 33 or 66 after a battle</li>
<li>Fixed 'Connoisseur' and 'Follow The Trail' achievements not unlocking after collecting all required items on some savefiles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Environmental Polish</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Various environmental bugfixes, tweaks and visual polish across multiple levels for a more immersive experience.</li>

<p>Closing, the team promised "more to come in the future", thanking the community for its continued support of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released back in April, and in May the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur may be a painting with a limited colour palette, but the result is a bold and striking vision," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's four star Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-patch-130-adds-fan-favourite-retry-button-as-used-in-metaphor-refantazio-to-make-redoing-boss-fights-a-breeze]]></content:encoded>
