            <p>FromSoftware's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> expansion Shadow of the Erdtree won't be eligible for BAFTA's Best Game award, as it's reserved for full games only.</p>
<p>There's been plenty of debate around whether expansions should be considered award-worthy, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/expansion-packs-new-game-seasons-dlcs-remakes-and-remasters-are-eligible-for-this-years-the-game-awards">The Game Awards in particular noting they are eligible</a>.</p>
<p>BAFTA has taken a different approach, though, confirming to Eurogamer its Best Game award is only for full games, but DLC and other updates are part of the consideration in the Evolving Game category.</p>

<p>"Our Best Game category specifically recognises full games which have released for the first time in the past year," a BAFTA spokesperson told Eurogamer. "DLC, along with other updates and enhancements made to games originally released before 25th November 2023, are part of the consideration in our Evolving Game category."</p>
<p>The news comes as <a href="https://www.bafta.org/stories/best-video-games-2024">BAFTA releases its longlist</a> of nominated games for next year's awards ceremony, with 58 games on the list up for 17 awards.</p>
<p>All games on the list were released between 25th November 2023 and 15th November 2024. Remasters are not eligible for consideration; full remakes are eligible only in craft categories.</p>
<p>DLC is eligible as part of the Evolving Game category and certain craft categories.</p>
<p>It's a noteworthy choice, considering this week's The Game Awards has Shadow of the Erdtree nominated in multiple categories, including Game of the Year. The Game Awards did clarify to Eurogamer there has been no specific change in rules this year, though the public announcement of DLC eligibility was only recently added to its website.</p><p>Shadow of the Erdtree is currently a finalist in the public-voted Players' Voice award, against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a>. Many comments have noted the prevalence of ongoing gacha games and a DLC dominating the category.</p>

<p>BAFTA will avoid this. From its longlist, 10 are up for Best Game: Animal Well, Astro Bot, Balatro, Black Myth: Wukong, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Helldivers 2, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Thank Goodness You're Here!, and Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2.</p>
<p>"The BAFTA Games Awards longlist is our opportunity to celebrate a wide range of outstanding games ahead of the BAFTA nominations on 4th March next year," said Tara Saunders, chair of BAFTA's Games committee. "Today we're shining a light on 58 games, as voted for by our wonderful BAFTA members - 1300 industry professionals whose work brings games to life."</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 was the big winner from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">last year's BAFTA Game Awards</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 won the award for Evolving Game, thanks in part to its Phantom Liberty expansion.</p>
<p>Eurogamer will of course have its own Game of the Year list shortly, in which DLC and expansions will likewise not be eligible. Sorry folks!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A maker of gaming hardware accessories has removed a trailer that showed the blurry outline of what was clearly intended to be Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Accessories manufacturer Satisfye is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">next company to begin selling peripherals for Switch 2</a> - even though Nintendo is yet to formally announce the Switch successor or detail how it'll look. 
</p>
<p>
Product <a href="https://www.satisfye.com/products/zengrip-2-bundle">pages</a> for the ZenGrip 2, a Switch 2 console grip, and a carry case for Nintendo's next console are still live. (Neither specifically use the name "Switch" anywhere, though state they are "Made for Next Gen Console" with the image of a current-gen Switch.)
</p>
<p>
However, a trailer for the products which featured hardware docked into the Switch 2 grip has now been removed - although not before the internet took notice. 
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that the ZenGrip 2's product page states that it is an "Expected Design" and that the accessory "will be tuned to final specifications". That said, now only three months (at most) away from Switch 2 finally being shown, the device's form factor is fairly well known.
</p>
<p>
While some console companies do share product specifications with third-parties ahead of launch to speed up peripheral production, it's likely we've already seen a relatively-final version of Switch 2 via previous leaks. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Purported images of the Switch 2 shell have been floating around online for several months, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">Digital Foundry dubbed as "almost certainly real"</a>. These show a console almost identical in form factor to the current Switch, albeit with a larger screen size, a second small button on the right Joy-Con,  and what look to be magnet attachments on each Joy-Con's side.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-designs-posted-by-3d-model-enthusiast-setting-internets-tongues-wagging">3D-printed plans for Switch 2 based on leaks</a> also exist, which fans have been 3D printing versions of for months just for kicks.
</p>
<p>
Has ZenGrip 2 got insider knowledge? Is it simply trying to get ahead of the competition with a neat stunt to gain attention? Or why not both?
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is yet to announce any details of its next console, other than to confirm it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">will announce Switch 2 properly before 31st March 2025</a>, the end of its current financial year.
