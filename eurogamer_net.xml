            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> players are downright infatuated with one of the more bizarre Mega Evolutions tucked away in the later portion of the game. A Mega Evolution that is making strides in general memery and ridiculous-factor.</p>

<p>That Mega Evolution is of course Mega Starmie, which in Pokémon Legends: Z-A has been given a pair of pointy legs it uses to stroll around the place. It's frankly a silly design, one that many players can't help but scratch their heads at. You can see it for yourself below, but it's literally just Starmie with big purple legs.</p>

<p>With these legs Mega Starmie has been running around in a peculiar fashion, and that's about it. They don't get any extra gems or a <em>third</em> spinning star on their back. Nope, just legs. It is both incredibly underwhelming and a masterclass in how doing less can sometimes mean doing more. These legs are better eye catchers than the other bells and whistles Pokémon Legends: Z-A has slapped on other Mega Evolutions.</p><p>The reaction to these legs has been coming in droves from members of the Pokémon community, who have wasted no time creating art of Starmie's two strong legs. Some believe Starmie's new form to be menacing, having them sprint directly at the viewer with malicious intent.</p>

<p>Others, obviously, find Mega Starmie's legs awesome. Some see it as a display of strength, viewing Starmie's legs as bulky pylons on which Mega Starmie asserts its dominance.</p>

<p>Others see them as appealing in an altogether different way. As shown below, with user Steve Ly on Twitter who interprets Starmie's new legs as sexy boots, and recreating Patrick Star's provocative dance from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCPDVVLUw-4">The Spongebob Squarepants movie's "I'm a Goofy Goober" song</a>.</p>

<p>Others, I believe with justice in their hearts, feel sorry for Mega Starmie and all the ridicule they have been exposed to. To them, Starmie going out there and expressing themselves was a moment of celebration. The online reaction, a moment of tragedy for the starfish.</p>

<p>Look, whether you are amused, inspired, aroused, or emotionally attached to Mega Starmie's new legs, there's no debate that Starmie has stolen the show in terms of Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Evolutions. All it took was two legs and a funny run. Perhaps in creating such discussion, Mega Starmie's new look has proven itself a masterpiece in virality, and ultimately a success when it comes to taking a beloved Pokémon to new heights. Literally, new heights.</p>
<p>It also turns out Mega Starmie might poop too, yet another nugget of joy from Pokémon Legends: Z-A. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-pokemon-do-poop-legends-z-a-confirms-and-have-tummy-troubles-too">If you want to read more about that, you can of course do so on Eurogamer</a>.</p>
