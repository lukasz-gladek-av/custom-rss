            <p>
With Borderlands 4's September release inching closer, publisher Take-Two has announced pricing and a variety of special editions for the shooter. And there's good news for anyone worried an $80 price tag might be on the cards following all that recent hoo-ha; the standard edition does not, it turns out, cross Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford's "real fan" threshold.
</p>
<p>
Pitchford, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">raised more than a few eyebrows last month</a>, when he implied potential customers not willing to spend $80 on Borderlands 4 (amid a hypothetical discussion of its price tag) weren't 'real fans'. His statement - that "real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag - did not go down well, and Pitchford <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">later attempted to justify his comments in a longer video</a>. Unfortunately, he then followed that up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-gearbox-ceo-randy-pitchfords-message-to-cost-sensitive-fans">another ill-conceived social media post</a> irritated fans quickly branded "tone-deaf".
</p>
<p>
But it turns out Pitchford could probably have avoided needlessly annoying the Borderlands community if he'd just held fire a little longer. Take-Two has now confirmed Borderlands 4 will, in fact, cost $70 for the standard edition of the game - but the full story is a little more complicated given regional pricing, variations in platform pricing, and the usual scrum of special editions offering various strands of Borderlands <em>stuff</em>.
</p>
<p>
PC is where you'll pick up Borderlands 4 cheapest; the standard edition costs £59.99 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic</a>, and you'll be paying £69.99 for the same version on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. That then climbs to £89.99 for the Deluxe Edition (which I suppose is now technically the Real Fan Edition given the price) and £119.99 for the Super (Fan?) Deluxe Edition.
</p>
<p>
And in case you're wondering what the difference is, the Deluxe Edition features the game, the Bounty Pack Bundle (which includes four post-launch DLC packs promising new areas, missions, and bosses), plus Vault Cards containing more challenges and rewards, new gear and weapons, four new vehicles, Vault Hunter cosmetics, and the Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin.
</p>
<p>
The Super Deluxe Edition, meanwhile, includes all the above, plus the Ornate Order Pack (featuring Vault Hunter Skins, four Vault Hunter Heads and four Vault Hunter Bodies), and the Vault Hunter Pack. This latter includes two post-launch Story Packs, each bringing a new Vault Hunter, new story and side missions, new map regions, new gear and weapons, plus additional Vault Hunter and ECHO-4 cosmetics.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, Borderlands 4 - now with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-will-dial-down-the-toilet-humour-says-narrative-director">less toilet humour</a>! - launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 12th September.
