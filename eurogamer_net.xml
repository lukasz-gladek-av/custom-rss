Katsuhiro Harada, the boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a>, has moved to reassure fans of the series who spotted him post on LinkedIn that he was now open to new job oppurtunities. 
</p>
<p>
Harada's LinkedIn page still lists him as executive game director, chief producer and general manager at Bandai Namco, where he has served for 30 years and become the face of the Tekken franchise.
</p>
<p>
But Harada has also set his profile to "open to work" status and in a short <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7286913589884465152/">post</a> wrote: "I would like to broaden my horizons by connecting with more people as I look toward the future. I'm interested in roles such as executive producer, executive game director, vice president, business development, business development executive, and marketing."

"Oh, don't worry about this," Harada <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1881164805060567212">wrote</a> on X in response to fans questioning whether he was leaving Bandai Namco and the Tekken series behind. "I meet a lot of people on a regular basis (but I don't actually have that many friends in my private world LOL), I just want to meet more people and expand my horizons in the future. 
</p>
<p>
"I can talk to a lot of people when I turn this option on," he concluded. "Just that."
</p>
<p>
It's now been 12 months since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> launched for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in January 2024. The game has since been kept updated with new characters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-clive-coming-to-tekken-8-as-first-seasons-final-dlc-character">including Final Fantasy 16's Clive</a>, with a second season pass announced for 2025.
</p>
<p>
"A marked improvement over <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> and a perfectly executed balancing act," Lewis Parker wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Eurogamer's Tekken 8 review</a>, "keeping older players happy while revealing its trademark freedom to newcomers".
</p>
<p>Late last year, we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-asked-kfc-to-let-colonel-sanders-join-the-games-roster">Harada had once asked KFC to let Colonel Sanders join the Tekken series' roster</a> - a suggestion that was turned down with a disapproving look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Team Cherry's Matthew 'Leth' Griffin, in charge of PR and marketing, has stated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is "real, progressing and will release".</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have been circulating about the game, sparked by co-creator William Pellen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake">switching his social media profile picture to a cake</a>, which led to fans speculating about an ARG to lead towards a release date.</p>
<p>Sadly, this has now been debunked as a "nothingburger".</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/the-hollow-knight-silksong-arg-turned-out-to-be-us-clutching-at-straws-but-dev-says-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release/">GamesRadar</a> reported, YouTuber <a href="https://x.com/fireb0rn/status/1880411907552911626">fireb0rn posted</a>: "Leth reached out to me to confirm there was no Silksong ARG and that the changes to William's account and the tweet were a nothingburger. Apologies to have misled everyone. The cake was a lie."</p>
<p>Griffin himself then followed up to confirm the game is still in development.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yes the game is real, progressing and will release. &lt;3</p>— Matthew Griffin (@griffinmatta) <a href="https://twitter.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>

<p>So what was that supposed ARG? Last week, Pellen changed his social media handle and switched his profile picture to a slice of chocolate cake. Eager <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans reverse image searched the picture to discover it was from a recipe page posted on 2nd April 2024 - a year ahead of the newly announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>Coupled with Pellen's post ahead of last week's Switch 2 reveal - "something big is coming" - and fans were riled up with anticipation. It seems that was all for nothing, despite the game still being on the way.</p>
<p>Silksong is the hugely anticipated follow up to popular Metroidvania Hollow Knight. It was first announced in 2019 - and Eurogamer went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-the-fast-paced-and-fluid-sequel-hollow-knight-deserves">hands-on with a Silksong demo</a> - but after multiple delays the game is still yet to be released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It has been a year and a day since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> - a game that the internet dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release - burst onto the scene.</p>
<p>Pocketpair's creature catching survival game quickly became the first big mega-hit of 2024, surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam back in January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG.</p>
<p>Now, as Palworld turns one, the team has outlined its plans for the game's second year, with a roadmap which includes co-op crossplay and an "ending scenario".</p>

<p>"We've been updating the game since the start of Early Access, and we'll continue to update Palworld as we prepare for the official release," Pocketpair shared in an update on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/596264277969469557">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>It then highlighted the following points heading to Palworld in the future.</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-op Crossplay</li>
<li>World Transfers for Pals</li>
<li>World Tree / Ending Scenario</li>
<li>Further ways to strengthen and improve Pals</li>
<li>Various new content such as new Pals and technologies</li>
<li>Game Collaborations (Including Terraria)</li>
<li>Improvements to world object placement</li>
<li>Improvements to base Pals</li>
<li>Improvements to optimisation</li>
<li>Improvements to UX</li>

<p>"We look forward to your continued support for Palworld in its second year," the developer wrote, adding that the game's soundtrack is now available for free on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-ywFLxwu-k">Pocketpair YouTube channel</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>Following its monumental debut, Palworld's developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-signs-sony-deal-to-expand-franchise-beyond-video-games">founded a new company known as Palworld Entertainment</a> last year. This company is designed to "accelerate the multifaceted global development" of the game and the brand's further expansion.</p>
<p>It hasn't all been plain sailing for the Palworld team, however. Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> back in September, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit is targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
An annual report into the state of video games has raised eyebrows for suggesting Rockstar will sell the long-awaited behemoth that is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> for $100 - around £80.
</p>
<p>
The amount could be justified by the game's enormous budget and would fit with a similar move by GTA publisher Take-Two back at the start of the current console generation, when it helped lead the charge in raising game prices previously.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">report</a> - published by Matthew Ball of Epyllion - suggests there is "hope" within the wider video game industry that prices do rise closer to an average £80/$100 price point to reflect rising development costs.

<p>
In 2020, the launch of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S saw the average boxed game release shift upwards to around £70 here in the UK. Numerous big budget releases also offer premium editions priced even higher, with added in-game content, or early access dangled as an incentive.
</p><p>
But will it happen? Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad has offered another view, which is that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> has - and continues to - earn so much recurring revenue through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> that a higher price to play the game upfront isn't necessary.
</p>
<p>
"I'd be surprised if this happens," Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1881049643221746005">wrote</a> on X. "If anything Take-Two could afford to lower the price (they won't) to get more people in given how much they earn via GTA Online.
</p>
<p>
"Besides, you don't need to raise prices when a good chunk of pre-orders will be for a $100 SKU with bonuses anyway."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-comes-a-time-when-we-all-declare-the-war-is-over-former-playstation-studios-boss-shawn-layden-on-the-future-of-video-game-consoles">Eurogamer spoke with Shawn Layden, former chairman of PlayStation Worldwide Studios</a>, on the issue of ballooning game costs and what he believes should be done to bring prices down. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid we've built AAA gaming into a kind of cathedral business, and it just can't grow any further," Layden said. "In fact, it's probably grown too far already."

            <p>A Sims fan reckons they've stumbled upon evidence of unannounced MySims games.</p>
<p>According to redditor OyeDiego, pages for the MySims Action Bundle and MySims Beacon Bay briefly popped up on the EA app over the weekend, although neither bundle has been previously confirmed by publisher EA.</p>
<p>To bolster the claim, the poster included a screen recording of what they saw.</p>

<p>"Last night, I found broken pages for MySims Action Bundle and MySims Beacon Bay in the EA app," the poster explained. "Neither had no images nor summaries, just the title, PEGI 7, and a date of 2099.</p>
<p>"It did not leave [sic] me pre-order them, so I saved them to my wish list. Today I couldn't find the games by searching for them, but they were still in my list. But Beacon Bay was causing the app to break. However, the Action Bundle was still intact.</p>
<p>"When I completely restarted the app, both games disappeared from my wishlist and I couldn't find them anymore."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/1i3u3op/ea_app_leak_mysims_action_bundle_and_mysims/">EA App Leak: MySims Action Bundle and MySims Beacon Bay</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OyeDiego/">u/OyeDiego</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/">MySims</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Whilst the OP was unable to assuage all cynics that the video was genuinely taken of the EA App, one poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/1i3u3op/comment/m7q85zx/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> in their defence: "I work as a developer. It would be a lot of work to create an EA app clone just to provide both unfinished pages and 500 error codes. Like, it would take a lot to mimic the UI and setup of the app just for bait.</p>
<p>"I don't see any reason as to why this wouldn’t be real - and the hypothetical response of removing the post kind of pushes people away from wanting to post here over Twitter."</p>
<p>Other fans hypothesise that the action bundle reads as though it's Agents and Skyheroes, whilst <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/Beacon_Bay">Beacon Bay</a> is a throwback that only players of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a> on Nintendo DS may remember, and could well be a brand-new MySims game.</p><p>Is the video real? Who knows. But with TheSims' 25th anniversary coming up, it's certainly plausible that a bundle of older and fan-favourite games could be on the way. We've reached out to EA and will let you know as and when we know more.</p>
<p>Talking of the 25th anniversary, all that kicks off on 4th February with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-marking-series-25th-anniversary-with-huge-free-update-adding-70-new-items">"huge" free The Sims 4 update introducing over 70+ new items</a> spanning both Create a Sim and Build Buy modes. There's talk of turtlenecks and bodysuits, bike shorts, accessories, and hairdos. New furnishings, meanwhile, include "stylish" windows and doors, wood finishes for kitchen cabinets, and even a new playground pirate ship.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
