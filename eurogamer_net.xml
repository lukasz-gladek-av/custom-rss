            <p>
In an announcement set to send shockwaves through wallets everywhere, Lego has announced it will launch Pokémon-themed sets in 2026.
</p>
<p>
Lego's reveal today offers little other than two logos sat next to each other on a website, but already the company's accountants will rubbing their paws. Oh, and there's a Pikachu tail made of Lego too. That's nice.
</p>
<p>"Electrify your imagination in 2026 and get ready to build something we've never built with Lego bricks before!" the company has teased.</p>
<p>
Pokémon has - for a long time - partnered with Mega Bloks to release various buildable sets. No longer, it appears! While Pokémon is not owned by Nintendo per se, the two companies are closely linked, and this announcement follows several <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">successful Lego ranges based around Super Mario, The Legend of Zelda and Animal Crossing</a>.
</p>
<p>
At a guess, I'd say we're likely to see buildable models of Pokémon that you can pop on your desk or in your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/ikea">Ikea</a> kallax, rather than Lego playsets featuring Pallet Town. But I'd love an Ash Ketchum minifigure, Lego, so please do consider it.

<p>Elsewhere in Lego-related news, earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/18-lego-mario-kart-set-leaks-online">Nintendo announced The Lego Super Mario: Mario Kart - Mario &amp; Standard Kart set</a>. This particular set features a buildable Mario complete with a posable head and arms. The Nintendo mascot is sitting behind the wheel of Mario Kart's Standard Kart, described as "the most iconic Mario Kart vehicle of all".</p>
<p>Back in the world of video games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">Pokémon Legends: Z-A will launch for Nintendo Switch</a> (and presumably there will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> version) late this year. It's a bit of a longer wait than we were expecting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles available in March 2025, including promising-looking new British survival game Atomfall - well, if you're a PC or Ultimate subscriber.
</p>
<p>Also included in these latest additions are Mythwrecked, which is the Hades-esque adventure game from the team behind enjoyable indie Röki, and the Blizzard Arcade Collection - which includes a selection of retro classics such as Lost Vikings and Rock &amp; Roll Racing.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late March 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler 2 (Series X/S, now with Game Pass Standard) - 19th March</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (Console, now with Game Pass Standard) - 19th March</li>
<li>Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 25th March</li>
<li>Blizzard Arcade Collection (Console and PC) - 20th March</li>
<li>Atomfall (Cloud and Console via Game Pass Ultimate, and PC) - 27th March</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tunic, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> and Monster Sanctury meanwhile join Xbox Game Pass Core, the lowest-tier subscription formerly branded as Xbox Live Gold.
</p>
<p>
As ever, as Microsoft giveth, so it taketh away. Yet more Yakuza titles are getting the chop from the Xbox Game Pass catalogue, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-march">the previous loss of Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 6 earlier in the month</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> is also going - presumably Capcom would prefer you now play Monster Hunter World.
</p>
<p>
The full list of titles leaving Xbox Game Pass on 31st March are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console)</li>
<li>Lil Gator Game (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Open Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 0 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Kiwami (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Kiwami 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Like a Dragon (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Lamplighter’s League (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Rise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
