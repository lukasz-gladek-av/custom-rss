        <p>Exactly when it'll be switched off remains unclear.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>At some point today, EA will turn the Anthem servers off, rendering BioWare's multiplayer online shooter inaccessible and unplayable, presumably forever. And fond farewells have already started to pour in.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the exact end-time is unclear. All we have officially to go by is today's date, 12th January, and as of this morning, the game's servers were still active for me. Presumably that means they'll remain up until the end of the day, until the clock strikes midnight - but midnight in which timezone? My best guess would be Pacific Time, as that's the timezone EA's Redwood City, California headquarters is located in. 12am midnight PT is 8am tomorrow morning GMT.</p>
<p>But I've also seen suggestions the Anthem servers could come down in line with the game's maintenance window, which was apparently 8am Eastern Time or thereabouts, which is 1pm GMT. I'll keep an eye on it and keep trying to clarify with EA.</p>
<p>Perhaps fuelled by this uncertainty, players have already begun saying their goodbyes to the game. The Anthem subreddit right now is filled with them; it makes for quite touching reading, actually. The general format seems to be people sharing a picture or short clip of their Javelin-suited Freelancer character, while sharing a word or two about the game.</p>

</ul>
<p>There are lots of variations of the "strongest together" sentiment.</p>
<p>The posts highlight what a startlingly attractive game Anthem can be, particularly as you fly around the often stormy jungle world of Coda, through enormous crumbling ruins and alongside flocks of strange birds. I've been playing Anthem this past week in the hope of seeing a community come together one final time and I've been struck again by the beauty of it. Even the streets of your home base in Tarsis are beautiful to wander around - that crumbled, almost Persian-style architectural fortress.</p><p>There has been increased activity in the game, too, as people return for a final fly-around, or as they - as in many cases - finish the game's achievements while they still can. To think that characters they've poured hundreds hours into - and that they're proudly parading around the game's social Launch Bay space - will cease to exist is a sobering reminder of the temporary nature of our virtual, server-based heroes.</p>
<p>Whether anything will happen in Anthem to mark its last moments is also unclear, but I expect it won't, as there appears to be no change anywhere else in the game - the shop still charges for items, and XP and currency is all still awarded in the same way. For all intents and purposes, the game seems untouched. Again, I'll keep an eye out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">Anthem was earmarked for closure in July last year</a>, at which point EA removed the game from digital sale. EA thanked people for their "dedication, passion and support" and confirmed that you won't be able to play Anthem offline. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-very-disappointed-in-anthem-launch-issues">Anthem was originally released in 2019 but failed to catch on in the way EA BioWare hoped</a>. There were plans for a big overhaul - a 2.0 - but they were eventually abandoned, as, it seems, the game was.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>When <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was sort of relaunched with its 2.0 update and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-liberty-is-a-remarkable-expansion-and-a-bittersweet-end-for-cyberpunk-2077">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion, female V took over as the face of the game. More than two years later, and with the RPG still selling well and attracting new players, that hasn't changed.</p>
<p>At some point, fans of the game started to wonder what happened with male V, who had spearheaded all of the game's pre-launch marketing efforts. If you own a physical copy as released in 2020, he’s on the cover by default. As the game fixed what was broken and evolved into one of the best games in recent memory, he became a relic of sorts. Now, the short-haired bloke is nowhere to be found in official promotional materials. This has raised some eyebrows across the internet and given conspiracy theorists a couple of intventive reasons for the change, but the truth is far more simple than simply some market research saying folks preferred female V, or something more sinsiter.</p>
<p>"Male V had whole base game marketing for himself", stated Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski when asked <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbrejiy3ok2w">via BlueSky</a> last week. The team simply decided to go 50/50 for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a>. "One game for each V."</p>
<p>Of course, such a huge change to the initially-troubled game's promotion as it relaunched probably went through deeper discussions than what Sarzynski is saying here. While we don't have the data on the percentage of male and female V runs of the game, the consensus among the most dedicated players is that people enjoy both versions of the character equally. This isn't a clear <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-odyssey-review-a-vast-and-generous-voyage">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a> situation where most folks ultimately agreed Kassandra was far superior to Alexios as a main character.</p><p>The thing is that going with male or female V isn't just a matter of who you prefer for purely aesthetic and voice acting reasons, as the pick also enables or disables certain romantic relationships. Most veterans agree doing at least two runs of the game is recommended to experience its branching narratives and different partners worth meeting (and smooching) while you try to save the character's life.</p>
<p>We're inclined to say female V is ultimately the more substantial choice since it has access to the Judy romance, which adds to the main storyline in ways the other relationships don't, but either way, you're getting excellent opportunities and voice acting across the board. We definitely are curious about actual data behind Cyberpunk 2077's protagonist pick (and life paths for that matter), but if we take Sarzynski at his word, CD Projekt Red didn't give the official swap much thought.</p>

            <p>Tom Clancy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-the-division-2-review-an-accomplished-sequel-with-an-awful-story">The Division 2</a> is still trucking along, and with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-2-kicks-off-10th-anniversary-year-with-the-division-2-survivors-an-updated-take-on-the-survival-extraction-experience">ambitious 2026 roadmap</a> to boot, while development on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-ubisoft-dev-says">the third game</a> continues. More shocking, though, is the apparent tease that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-review">The Division 1</a> is making a return for its 10th anniversary.</p>
<p>We've had no shortage of leaks on Ubisoft’s upcoming releases, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>'s remakes (the latter of which was announced ages ago), but we hadn't heard a peep regarding a remaster or re-release of the first Division game. On 11th January, the noise began when users on X/Twitter like <a href="https://x.com/domen0204">Domen Gaming</a> started sharing a photo of a banner taken at the grand finale of the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/5JKjM9XlbV6Lyd2xNYzkIf/apac-cup-at-fps-day-details">APAC Cup of R6 Siege</a> currently taking place in Tokyo, Japan:</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2010471227387740286?s=20">KAMI</a> on X/Twitter adds folks at the event heard Ubisoft is holding a "10th anniversary commemorative premiere" this weekend, which we assume is later this week unless something was lost in translation. Technically, The Division 1 launched on March 8, 2016, so we're still a ways off from the actual anniversary, but if a re-release of sorts is happening, it makes sense Ubisoft would move it forward a bit to boost its Q1 2026 numbers as much as possible (and we're not ruling out Assassin's Creed or Prince of Persia shadow drops, either).</p><p>Anniversary aside, the timing of the news is odd, as the game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/the-division-yes-the-first-one-gets-a-ps5-update/">finally received a 60 FPS patch on current-gen consoles last month</a>. Moreover, most of the series' community is playing The Division 2 instead, which is the meatier game that will seemingly be supported until the threequel arrives. On the other hand, The Division’s snowy New York City setting remains one of the most captivating and moodiest modern open worlds to the point much of The Division 2's DLC efforts has catered to players who preferred that location over the less inspired Washington DC map.</p>
<p>Unless substantial graphical updates taken from Massive's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-fire-and-ash-player-boost">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> are coming as part of this Definitive Edition, we're only expecting a repackaged and complete edition for newcomers looking to go back to the beginning. We wouldn't rule out a surprise <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> port of the game, though, especially since Ubisoft has been keen to support the young console so far. It would explain this marketing push in Japan and would continue Ubisoft's trend of supporting Nintendo’s hybrid hardware, which has been off to a great start this generation with the excellent Star Wars Outlaws and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/want-to-know-how-assassins-creed-shadows-works-on-switch-2-ubisoft-details-console-specific-features-and-more">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> ports.</p>

            <p>Hytale's founder Simon Collins-Laflamme has revealed the team expects over a million players on the game's Early Access launch day on the 13th January.</p>
<p>This statement, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636">posted on Laflamme's personal Twitter account</a>, came alongside a call-to-action for players to download the game's launcher today to help reduce development-side stress on the day of release.</p>
<p>Hytale, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">a game revived by Laflamme</a> following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">cancellation by Riot Games last year</a>, has seen a surge in interest since the unexpected return. Shortly after switching hands from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> creator to Laflamme and co, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-will-finally-be-launching-early-next-year-after-years-of-development-woes">Early Access plans for the game were revealed back in a matter of months</a>. This, after the game had been in development for roughly ten years.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-release-date-time">In terms of release time</a>, the game is set to launch early morning on Tuesday morning in the Americas, and early evening in Europe, so one would expect it'll steadily gain momentum throughout the week once it launches. Not that we'll be able to track it live, as the game is not releasing to Steam during its initial Early Access period.</p><p>The game<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-price-where-to-buy"> is being sold at three price points via the official Hytale website</a>, starting off at a pretty cheap $19.99 for the standard version. The creator has warned folks ahead of time that this is an Early Access game in the truest sense of the word, so given the shaky history of Hytale expect a few bumps when it first launches.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Hytale when it finally comes out later this week? Let us know below!</p>

            <p>It wasn't Larian's choice to not release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>That's coming from studio head Swen Vincke, who shared this titbit during an AMA which Larian hosted on Reddit towards the end of last week.</p>

<p>Here, the team was asked about potentially getting the critically acclaimed and award winning Baldur's Gate 3 onto Switch 2.</p>
<p>"We would have loved to but it wasn't our decision to make," came Vincke's reply. This was met with a number of disappointed community comments, such as "super bummed by this decision especially if you wanted to do it but somehow were not green lit by [the] publisher…" and "I'm shattered to read this news".</p>
<p>While Vincke did not go into further details about the lack of a Baldur's Gate 3 Switch 2 release, many have surmised it was probably due to licensing issues.</p>

</span></p><p>But, while it doesn't sound like we will be getting Baldur's Gate 3 on Switch 2 any time soon, if ever, there is a little bit more hope that Larian's next game - Divinity - may release on Nintendo's hybrid console. During the same AMA, the studio's technical director noted Larian had just recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">Divinity Original Sin 2 on Nintendo's latest console</a>, saying: "We love the platform." They then assured the community that Larian would of course also keep the Switch 2 in mind for Divinity, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">which it announced during The Game Awards last month</a>, with a rather horrifying trailer.</p><p>At this time, Larian's technical director also said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-will-certainly-consider-a-divinity-switch-2-release">the team was keen to ensure Divinity was playable on Steam Deck when it releases</a> (whenever that may be). The developer remarked that Baldur's Gate 3 was one of the Steam Deck's most played games, and so the studio would do its "best" to get Divinity on there as well.</p>
