            <p>
Hitman developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has cut ties with MMA fighter Conor McGregor, following last week's Irish High Court ruling that found he had assaulted and raped a woman in December 2018.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921">statement</a> released via social media this afternoon, IO said it was no longer associated with McGregor and would "begin removing content" featuring the UFC star from storefronts "starting today". 
</p>
<p>"In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately," the developer wrote. 
</p>
<p>"We take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today."</p>
<p>
McGregor's voice and likeness is used in Hitman for a character named The Disruptor, which previously featured as one of the game's Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
The Disruptor mission returned to the game earlier this month for a limited time, and had been set to be playable until Sunday 8th December. 
</p>
<p>
An additional Disruptor DLC pack meanwhile offers players permanent access to The Ostentatious, an arcade contract featuring The Disruptor, as well as a new outfit, items, and a set of cosmetics for the freelancer house. 
</p>
<p>
Last week, an Irish jury decided McGregor had sexually assaulted a woman in a Dublin hotel six years ago, and was subsequently ordered to pay at least €248k (£206k) in damages.
</p>
<p>
McGregor has said he will appeal the verdict.

            <p>A new trailer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film has been released, showing off its version of the Chao Garden.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not exactly as you remember from the games: it's some sort of mascot café featuring dancing Chao characters and a group of children who ask Tails if he's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detective-pikachu">Detective Pikachu</a>.</p>
<p>Then things turn bad and soon we see Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog in the middle of Tokyo's Shibuya Crossing. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>The trailer offers the best look yet at Shadow (with a gun!), as well as Jim Carrey's two Eggman villains, and Maria Robotnik from Shadow's past.</p>
<p>Despite its real world setting, then, it seems the film will include plenty of elements familiar to fans of the games.</p>
<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 is due out in cinemas on 20th December, just before Christmas. It's fitting the trailer ends with a Christmas scene, in something of a callback to Carrey's performance as The Grinch.</p>

<p>The film will conclude Sega's Year of Shadow, which also included the excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.</p>
<p>Sega also shared with Eurogamer some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-showcases-shadow-the-hedgehog-design-in-never-before-seen-sketches">exclusive design sketches of Shadow the Hedgehog</a> from Sonic Team's Kazuyuki Hoshino.</p>
<p>For the unfamiliar, the Chao Garden allowed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2 players to level up cute Chao critters and then race and battle them against one another. It's a much-requested feature in a potential Sonic Adventure 3 game, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-plans-for-sonic-adventure-3-says-sonic-team-boss-but-wed-love-to-make-it">Sonic Team's Takashi Iizuka has "no plans" for such a project</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
