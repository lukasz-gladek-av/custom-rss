            <p>Roblox has been criticised for its new guidelines on "sensitive issues", described by advocacy groups as "a step backward for both creative expression and social justice".</p>
<p>Back in August, Roblox introduced a <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-to-our-maturity-compliance-questionnaire/3860056">new content descriptor for sensitive issues</a> as part of an improvement to parental control. The descriptor is meant for Roblox experiences themed on social, political, or religious issues, but the company stated it is "not meant to take a stance on any specific issue".</p>
<p>That has now been opposed in an <a href="https://www.womeningames.org/robloxs-new-sensitive-issues-guidelines-a-threat-to-creative-expression-and-social-progress/">open letter to Roblox by advocacy groups</a> Women In Games, Out Making Games, and BAME in Games, each focused on supporting marginalised groups.</p>
<p>"Roblox's recently proposed creator guidelines regarding 'sensitive issues' represent a step backward for both creative expression and social justice," the open letter reads. "These changes threaten to undermine the vibrant, inclusive creative community that has flourished on the platform since 2006, while potentially causing real harm to marginalised groups in society."</p>
<p>Essentially, the letter argues, by introducing these descriptors Roblox is treating issues of equality and human rights as "debatable rather than fundamental".</p>
<p>Roblox's criteria for the descriptor applies to "experiences where a majority of the content, gameplay, or experience details…refers to the sensitive issue", which can include immigration, capital punishment, gun control, marriage equality, pay equity in sports, racial profiling, reproductive rights, and more.</p>
<p>"We support efforts to keep children safe online - especially girls, who face disproportionate harassment and grooming," the open letter continues. "But safety cannot be achieved by silencing content that educates and empowers.</p>
<p>"Issues such as equal pay, reproductive rights, and gender equality are central to girls' and women's lived experiences. Marking these as 'sensitive' risks hiding content that is vital to representation, education, and inspiration."</p>
<p>Suppressing such experiences, the advocacy groups claim, is "false neutrality" and instead of protecting children, "the policy risks teaching Roblox's diverse audience that issues of justice and equality are controversial opinions rather than universal values, thereby reinforcing the very divisions it claims to guard against."</p>
<p>Instead, the groups believe Roblox should rely on internationally recognised age-rating systems like PEGI and the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), instead of "invent[ing] a vague, easily abused 'sensitive issues' label".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Roblox for its response to the open letter.</p>
<p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">Roblox also introduced new safety features</a>, including an AI used to estimate a user's age through video selfie. Earlier this month, it announced this would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">expanded to all users by the end of the year</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> is the latest developer to be impacted by layoffs, as the company's UK studio is set to be closed as part of a workforce restructure that will impact its Swedish studios too.</p>
<p>The studio is known for the Just Cause series (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> developer Avalanche Software, owned by Warner Bros.) and was previously working on an Xbox exclusive called Contraband.</p>
<p>However, that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-exclusive-contraband-reportedly-cancelled-as-avalanche-states-its-active-development-has-now-stopped">project was cancelled by Microsoft back in August</a>, with the studio writing in a statement: "Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future."</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement shared by the company</a> today, the decision to restructure has been made "in light of current challenges to our business and the industry".</p>
<p>It continued: "This review had led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmő and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."</p>
<p>It concluded: "Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities." The statement does not mention Contraband and its cancellation specifically.</p>
<p>Contraband, a co-op smuggling game, was revealed in June 2021 at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, but little of the game has been shown since. Its official trailer has been removed from the Avalanche website, though you can see IGN's video above.</p>
<p>Its cancellation arrived in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">wake of layoffs across Microsoft</a> in July, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">resulted in the cancellation of multiple projects</a> including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft CEO and chairman Satya Nadella later claimed "Microsoft is thriving"</a>, largely due to its investments in AI.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-are-unionising">Avalanche Studios entered a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish unions</a>, which was planned to go into effect by the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>"Over the past years, we've taken significant steps toward making Avalanche one of the best workplaces in the games industry," Avalanche CEO Stefanía Halldórsdóttir said at the time.</p>
