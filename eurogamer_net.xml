            <p>You know the name, you know the number. Yes, it is James Bond 007, but like we have never seen him before.</p>
<p>During PlayStation's State of Play this evening, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> of Hitman fame gave us our first look at 007: First Light. "Earn the Number," reads the official blurb accompanying today's new trailer, which features plenty of those Bond-themes we know and love. The cars, the weapons, the girls, the music. Ahh, I am excited!!</p>
<p>"In 007 First Light, play as James Bond, a young, resourceful, and sometimes reckless new recruit, and discover an origin story for the first time," the developer continues, promising an "all-new game experience from IO Interactive", set for release in 2026.</p>
<p>Before I get more into it, here's the trailer:</p>

<p>"This is Bond as you've never seen him before - the youngest Bond fans have ever met," IO wrote in an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/unveiling-007-first-light-io-interactives-james-bond-action-adventure-game/">accompanying blog post</a>. In fact, this Bond is only 26, which makes me feel ancient (but, you don't look it, Victoria!). </p>
<p>
Anyway, First Light's Bond is "a man with sharp instincts, sometimes reckless, who is still learning when to fight, when to bluff, and when to disappear into the shadows", and he starts off the game as a Navy air crewman. However, various events soon throw him into the thrills and spills of MI6 life, and "this training coupled with his natural instinct, wits, and heart will see him grow into a fully-fledged spy". </p>
<p>I don't know if you can tell but guys, I really can't wait!!</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, IOI said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>, adding the release will not be a "gamification of a movie".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week">007: First Light will also feature again later this week during IO's own showcase</a>, which is scheduled for Friday, 6th June, at 6pm PDT. That's 2am on 7th June for those of us in the UK, but who am I kidding, I will be watching.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Beloved first-person stealth series Thief is being resurrected for a new instalment on PlayStation VR2. It's called Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow and it's out later this year.
</p>
<p>
Thief, the brainchild of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock">System Shock</a> developer Looking Glass Studios, first surfaced back in 1998. Its initial instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thief-the-dark-project">Thief: The Dark Project</a>, was immediately heralded as something of a classic and three further entries followed. Unfortunately, 2014's Eidos-Montréal-developed Thief reboot was poorly received and the series floundered.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, over a decade later, Thief is back in the form of Thief VR: Legacy of Shadow. It'll once again see players slinking through the streets of The City, but this time there's a new protagonist doing the stealthy. Gone is the Garrett of earlier games, this time replaced by Magpie - a "cunning thief orphaned by Northcrest's brutality and shaped by the streets, who steals as the only means to survive".

<p>
After stumbling across a legendary artefact holding a mysterious secret, players embark on a journey across The City that'll see them evading and outsmarting its controlling forces as they seek to expose a "sinister conspiracy". All this, of course, takes the series' classic shadow skulking and gives it a VR twist.
</p>
<p>
"Physically crouch, hide, and move between shadows, using every inch of the environment to stay undetected," Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/thief-vr-legacy-of-shadow-announced-for-ps-vr2-out-2025/">explains on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "Whether you're sneaking through darkened alleys or scaling the rooftops of towering buildings, your every movement feels real. Extinguish light sources with your water arrows, hands, or even a well-aimed breath to deepen the darkness and expand your cover. The VR mechanics allow you to live out the fantasy of stealth in a way that no other medium can replicate."
</p>
<p>
Thief VR is the work of Vertigo Games and Maze Theory, and is being developed in collaboration with Eidos-Montréal. It doesn't have a release date yet, beyond a vague "2025" window, but more details are promised "in the coming months".
