            <p>Did you know there's a 3v3 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> fighting game? Well there is! It's called Ultimate Sonic Smackdown, and you can play it right now.</p>
<p>Indie studio Arcforged has released the game to the public for free. In an announcement trailer released today, you can see a variety of Sonic characters duke it out in 2D. All you've got to do is join the game's official Discord server and get playing!</p>
<p>You may have guessed it from the title, but Ultimate Sonic Smackdown is actually a drastic overhaul of an older fan game: Sonic Smackdown. That game was a traditional 1v1 fighter, and has been playable online via <a href="http://itch.io/">Itch.io</a> or at US tournaments for a while now.</p>

<p>This iteration, four years in the making, is a wilder evolution of the game. A tagging system means more hectic fights, more options for offence, and the opportunity to team up your favourite Sonic characters in your chosen squad. It's the latest in a sparse scattering of Sonic the Hedgehog fighting games, first established by the official, Sega-developed Sonic the Fighters released in arcades in 1996. Its Sega Saturn port was cancelled.</p>
<p>As a tag fighter, Ultimate Sonic Smackdown joins a bizarrely packed collection of similar games coming out soon. You've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a> coming in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> which is bound to come out sooner or later, c'mon guys. Then you've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/invincible-vs">Invincible Vs</a> coming next year, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>! So suddenly, a style of fighting game that had basically no modern representation is stacked with incoming options.
</p>
<p>Sonic has a rich history of fan games. Famously, Sega hired Christian Whitehead to be lead developer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-mania">Sonic Mania</a>, following his work on unofficial ports of older Sonic games. There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-unleashed-available-for-pc-at-last-thanks-to-fan-made-port-with-uncapped-framerate">also a fan-made PC port of Sonic Unleashed</a> which is rad, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-triple-trouble-gets-fan-made-16-bit-makeover">a 16-bit makeover of Sonic Triple Trouble</a> from a few years back.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-fantastic-fan-made-sonic-fighting-game-in-the-wild-and-you-can-play-it-right-now]]></content:encoded>
