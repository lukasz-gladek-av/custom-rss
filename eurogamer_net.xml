            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> has now sold more than 10m copies, and has managed to hit that milestone faster than any other game in the series to date.
</p>
<p>
Capcom trumpeted the sales milestone for its spruced up survival horror classic this morning, though revealed its Resi 4 Remake had actually topped that figure as of 31st December last year.
</p>
<p>
That means the game has shifted 10m in less than two years, having first arrived for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2023.
</p>
<p>
Updated sales figures for other previous Resident Evil releases show Resi 7, which released back in 2017, is now up to 15m. Capcom's Resi 2 Remake, released back in 2019, is now also up to 15m.
</p>
<p>
More recent launches such as 2020's Resi 3 Remake and 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> have also continued to sell, and stand on 10m and 11m units respectively.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250425.html">press statement on these updated figures</a>, Capcom described them as evidence it had "successfully executed its long-term catalogue sales strategy".
</p>
<p>
The Resident Evil franchise has now sold a combined 167m units since its first entry released in 1996, Capcom also noted. What's next? Capcom has said it will continue remaking older games alongside newer launches. So, would you prefer Resi 5 or a Code Veronica Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">alongside your Resident Evil 9</a>?
</p>
<p>"Keeping what works while reimagining what doesn't, this is about as good as remakes get," Aoife Wilson wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-review-a-classic-comes-back-to-life">Eurogamer's Resident Evil 4 Remake review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Elder Scrolls 4's 'duplicate items glitch' is alive and well in Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-includes-famous-voice-actor-flub-and-fans-are-delighted">Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda recently said it only wanted to remaster Oblivion</a>, rather than remake it, to ensure players were experiencing the same game they remember playing back in 2006, but with the benefit of today's technology.</p>
<p>And the Oblivion team has indeed remained faithful with its remastering efforts, even including the original's duplicate items cheat (or, glitch, if you prefer).</p>

<p>This Oblivion glitch is a handy and, let's be honest, welcomingly easy way of doing things compared to the more conventional and long-winded method of getting multiple tools and such as you make your way through the fantasy world.</p>
<p>This glitch can be used for items such as arrows or even, for those money hungry players among us, gold.</p>
<p>As our Marie has discovered, the duplicate item glitch in Oblivion Remastered works <em>slightly </em>differently compared to the original game, but it's still very doable, as it is only really the control commands that have been changed up a bit.</p>
<p>If you too are working your way through Oblivion Remastered, but could really do with a few more of a certain item and simply coming across it organically isn't working out for you, you can find out how to use this glitch to your advantage in our handy guide: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-use-duplicate-items-glitch-oblivion-remastered">How to use Duplicate Items glitch in Oblivion Remastered</a>. This guide covers Xbox, PS5 and PC.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Elder Scrolls 4 news, there are<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda"> now over 100 mods available for Oblivion Remastered</a> even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has said it won't offer any official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>For more, earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Production has started on the film adaptation of horror work sim The Mortuary Assistant, with Willa Holland in the lead role.</p>
<p>Holland - who has previously starred in Arrow and Gossip Girl, although I knew her first as  Marissa Cooper's little sister Kaitlin in The OC - will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as, you guessed it, a mortuary assistant.</p>
<p>Holland is joined by House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire Paul Sparks, who plays Rebecca's boss Raymond Delver in the upcoming film. As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-willa-holland-paul-sparks-1236376119/">Deadline</a>, Rebecca's boss "appears to be a mentor, but also a potential threat".</p>

<p>Indie horror The Mortuary Assistant initially released on PC in 2022, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-finally-coming-to-consoles">becoming available on consoles</a>. As you may have surmised, it casts players as a newly hired assistant at a mortuary who embalms corpses. However, there is a catch - the mortuary is haunted.</p>
<p>Film director Jeremiah Kipp told Deadline he and the game's creator Brian Clarke "respond to character-driven storytelling within a disturbing horror space". Kipp said as Clarke's "influences have been largely cinematic, the whole process has organically felt like an expansion of his unique gameplay".</p>
<p>"We've captured the atmosphere of singular dread that players responded to so powerfully - this movie will be scary as hell," Kipp said.</p>
<p>Clarke added that "seeing the mortuary assistant evolve over the years from a small prototype to a full feature film is beyond anything I could have imagined as a solo developer", calling Kipp an "insanely skilled director".</p>
<p>"It has been one of the highlights of my life working with him," Clarke said. "The entire team at Epic Pictures have done an amazing job capturing the spirit of the game while adding their own unique cinematic flair. It is an honor to see Willa and Paul bring these characters to life along with the rest of the film crew.</p>
<p>"I feel extremely fortunate and can't wait for fans to see The Mortuary Assistant expand into new territory."</p>

<p>The Mortuary Assistant adaptation was first heard of back in 2022, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-getting-a-companion-piece-movie-adaptation">Kipp said the film will be a "companion piece" to the game</a>. According to Deadline's report, the film will expand the game's world further by "delving deeper into the lore of the demonic entities plaguing River Fields".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The most-watched game on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> last year was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, still, after more than a decade on sale. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, Rockstar's ever-evolving <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> is the big draw here - and the developer is still regularly updating the game's online portion with new story beats and quests. But its 25.8m hours broadcast and 1.4bn hours viewed in 2024 is still extraordinary - and also highlights the astronomical potential of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
Outside of GTA, Twitch viewers flocked to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> (1.18bn hours watched), and then the usual evergreen shooters such as Valorant (804m hours), Fortnite (539m hours) and Call of Duty (a combined 451m hours).
</p>
<p>
Overall, gaming content on Twitch was viewed for 15.6bn hours across 2024, and the platform had an average of 105 million monthly visitors. 
</p>
<p>
Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-ceo-reveals-2025-plans-collaboration-mobile-and-more-monetisation">Twitch boss Dan Clancy detailed the company's plans for 2025</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">bumpy 2024 marked by layoffs</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside including improvements to the Twitch mobile app, the company confirmed it would be opening up monetisation for "most" streamers, including the ability to offer subscriptions and bits. 
</p>
<p>
As our Ed wrote at the time, usually streamers need to reach Affiliate status before monetisation tools kick in, but this year streamers will be able to start earning immediately - something that not only benefits the streamer but also Twitch, which takes a cut.
</p>
<p>For more, Ed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-ceo-reveals-2025-plans-collaboration-mobile-and-more-monetisation">chatted with Twitch last year about the future of the company</a> and its approaches to safety, growth, and online communities.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
