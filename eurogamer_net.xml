            <p>
More Xbox first-party titles have been confirmed for PS5 - and it's good news for strategy fans, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/age-of-mythology-retold">Age of Mythology: Retold</a> Edition and Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition both on the way. That's alongside a variety of upcoming expansion releases across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
First up is Age of Mythology: Retold Edition, a remaster of the 2002 original, which comes to PS5 on 4th March. This twist on the Age of Empires strategy formula swaps history for monsters and gods as players battle as either the Greek, Norse, Egyptian, or Atlantean pantheons.
</p>
<p>
Its 4th March arrival coincides with the launch of Age of Mythology: Retold's Immortal Pillars expansion. This includes the new Chinese pantheon, 12 new gods with unique powers and mythological units, a nine-level campaign inspired by Chinese mythology, and seven new maps. PlayStation 5 owners can pick it up alongside the base game, but it also comes to PC and Xbox on the same day. Cross-play is supported across all platforms, and all Mythology: Retold updates will hit Xbox, PS5, and PC simultaneously from this point onward.

<p>
Then, sometime this "spring", PlayStation 5 owners can get their hands on Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition. This includes all the expansions released for the 1999 original, plus improved visuals, gameplay refinements, cross-play, and more. As with Age of Mythology: Retold, new DLC launches alongside Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition's PlayStation 5 release, and will be available across all platforms. Microsoft isn't talking specifics yet but says to expect "fresh new content" and "new civilisations for Ranked play."
</p><p>
In other Age of Empires news, Microsoft has announced two new expansions for Age of Empires 4, both coming in 2025 and both focused on "shorter and repeatable experiences". The first of these, Knights of Cross and Rose, arrives this "spring", promising "two well-known armies inspired by history" plus a "solo mode that will challenge even the most skilled strategists." Additional details can be found in <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/">Microsoft's announcement</a>.

<p>

It continues the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-confirms-multiplatform-future-is-here-to-stay">multi-console release strategy</a> Microsoft's announced last year - one that's so far seen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Grounded, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and Pentiment come to PlayStation, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2 all on the way.
