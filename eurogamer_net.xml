            <p>Void Interactive's tactical FPS Ready or Not is coming to consoles later this year.</p>
<p>Whilst the developer stopped short of confirming a firm release date - "summer" (Q3) is the closest we have right now - it did reveal the shooter would also be coming to Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store, too.</p>
<p>To celebrate, here's a brand new cinematic trailer that debuted at the Galaxies Showcase:</p>

<p>Ready or Not sees you visit Los Sueños, where a surge of crime across the greater Los Sueños metropolitan area has severely depleted resources, threatening to "overwhelm the department's ability to maintain order". In response to the growing threats facing residents, LSPD is mobilising its SWAT teams to respond to high-threat scenarios, including active bomb threats, barricaded suspects, and high-risk hostage situations.</p>
<p>Ready or Not features "immersive tactical gameplay, full flexibility of approach, and authentic equipment that SWAT teams utilise in the field". You can expect 20 single-player or online co-op missions to play with up to four pals, as well as two new missions as part of the Stories from Los Sueños free DLC update.</p>
<p>You'll also get two DLCs that introduce six additional levels, and, in Dark Waters DLC, the UH-60 support helicopter. There are also "dozens of options to customise a player’s entire SWAT team" including armour, weapons, and apparel.</p>
<p>PC players will have access to the new missions in a free update day-and-date with console launch.</p>
<p>Pre-orderers will also secure the M32A1 grenade launcher, MK-V pistol, 590M shotgun, with players who already have the game on PC also getting the freebies. The game will cost £45 ($50 / €50) whether you buy the base game or the Day One Edition, which includes the pre-order items. There's also a £60 ($70 / €70) Deluxe Edition that includes the base game with three DLC packs - Home Invasion, Dark Waters, and an unannounced one - plus the pre-order goodies also bundled in.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after comments suggested it would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access on 17th December, but in a statement on Twitter shortly afterwards, Void Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>. Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA has finally given us our first look at its upcoming Star Wars strategy game, Star Wars: Zero Company.</p>
<p>The single-player turn-based tactics game by Bit Reactor and Respawn was confirmed back in 2022. It's described as a "gritty and authentic original story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars".</p>
<p>Here it is in action:</p>

<p>You play as Hawks, a customisable former Republic officer, and will command an elite squad of "cunning operatives through a gritty and authentic story set in the twilight of the Clone Wars". As an unconventional outfit of professionals for hire hailing from across the galaxy, Zero Company must set aside their differences to overcome nearly impossible odds and take on an emerging threat that will consume the galaxy if left unchecked.</p>
<p>The campaign includes tactical operations and investigations "across the galaxy", whilst between missions, you will develop a base of operations and gather intelligence through a network of informants to stay one step ahead of Zero Company’s adversaries. You'll be able to create and customise your squad of recruited operators while "getting to know a cast of newly authored Star Wars characters".</p>
<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," said Greg Foertsch, CEO and creative director at Bit Reactor.</p>
<p>"It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>
<p>As yet there's no release date, but EA advises it's shooting for a 2026 release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>As we reported earlier this week, Star Wars: Zero Company is a collaboration between EA's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> and developer Bit Reactor, a studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-veterans-form-new-studio-bit-reactor-to-focus-on-turn-based-strategy">founded in 2022 by veterans of XCOM and Civilization developer Firaxis Games</a>. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-three-new-star-wars-games-in-development-at-respawn">one of three new Star Wars titles announced by EA at the time</a>, the others being a follow-up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which released in 2023 - and a Star Wars first-person shooter which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">has since been cancelled</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
