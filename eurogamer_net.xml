            <p>Sonic Unleashed is finally available on PC thanks to a fan-made port with modern quality of life features.</p>
<p>Unleashed is the Sonic game with the rubbish werehog bits, but its actual Sonic levels are brilliant - their mix of sidescrolling and 3D styles formed the basis of games in the series ever since - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-generations">Sonic Generations</a> in particular.</p>
<p>The game was originally released for PS3 and Xbox 360 (as well as PS2 and Wii), and now the 360 version has been unofficially ported to PC as Unleashed Recompiled.</p>

<p>New features include an uncapped framerate, comprehensive visual options to customise, ultrawide support, built-in achievements, and controller icons for whichever controller you use.</p>
<p>In short, this is now the best way to play Sonic Unleashed, although you'll need a legitimate copy of the Xbox 360 game to get it running. You can <a href="https://github.com/hedge-dev/UnleashedRecomp?tab=readme-ov-file">download Unleashed Recompiled on github</a>.</p>
<p>Almost all the modern Sonic games are available on Steam at present, including Sonic x Shadow Generations, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-superstars">Sonic Superstars</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours-ultimate">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-adventure">Sonic Adventure</a> 1 and 2, the Sonic racing games, and even Sonic Lost World.</p>
<p>Sonic Unleashed, then, is a curious omission from Sega. Should this fan-made port be a success, perhaps an official version could be released in future.</p>
<p>Sega's last release was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, which does include an Unleashed-themed level as part of the original Sonic Generations. The new Shadow levels are fantastic.</p>
<p>It's unknown what's next for the series, though Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka said Sonic Frontiers' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-is-cornerstone-of-future-sonic-games-says-sonic-team-head">open zone style is now the "cornerstone of future Sonic games"</a>.</p>
<p>In film land, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 has already been greenlit</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Capcom has explained how to get around a perceived endgame softlock in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>The main mission 5-1: Omens asks players to "Investigate the regions and raise your HR", but some players have already reached the Hunter Rank cap and have been unable to progress.</p>
<p>It turns out, though, the description just isn't very clear. The mission doesn't require players to raise their Hunter Rank but instead earn enough Hunter Rank Points to proceed.</p>

<p>Capcom's latest game in the series is seeing meteoric success, not only peaking on Steam at 1.3 million concurrent players, but propelling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam to its highest ever concurrent player numbers</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the launch hasn't been without its issues - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">PC version in particular has poor performance</a> that's been heavily criticised.</p>
<p>At least Capcom is speedily investigating and fixing any smaller issues that arise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The dust is still settling on this weekend's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-over-yet-quest-steps-rewards-and-black-or-white-best-choose-path-choice-in-pokemon-go">Pokémon Go Tour Unova</a>, but the game is already getting ready for the next big public event - and the highlight of the game's annual calendar - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> Fest 2025.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of its official announcement, the logo for Go Fest 2025 has popped up online, courtesy of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1j285jx/go_fest_2025_logo/">top Pokémon Go fan reddit TheSilphRoad</a>. And, as ever, Pokémon fans have determined which super rare creature will be the focus of the event, via some not-so-subtle clues.
</p>
<p>
This year's logo prominently features several golden gears, which nods to the Mythical Pokémon Magearna. This Steel and Fairy creature was introduced in Gen 7's Pokémon Sun and Moon. 
</p>
<p>
Each year, Go Fest traditionally adds another Mythical creature to the game. Last year's event added Marshadow, while others have added Diancie, Meloetta and Shaymin. (One day we'll get Arceus, hopefully.)
</p>
<p>
Other elements of the logo - its blue and magenta flourishes - strongly hint at Gen 7's Legendary duo Zacian and Zamazenta, meanwhile. These have been released in Pokémon Go previously, but not in their flashier Hero of Many Battles alternate forms. It seems likely these will debut during Pokémon Go Fest 2025 as well.
</p>
<p>
In-person dates for Pokémon Go Fest 2025 have already been announced for the event's big continental meetups - with its European leg taking place in Paris from 13th to 15th June. 
</p>
<p>
Over the pond, Go Fest 2025 is being held in Jersey City, New Jersey from 6th to 8th June. In Japan, Osaka hosts the event from 29th May to 1st June. There's been no word yet on when the event's Global edition will run, though typically it is after all of these.

            <p>A mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has been created that allows for unlimited character and palico edits, essentially bypassing Capcom's monetisation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">As we reported last week</a>, editing your character after the initial setup requires special vouchers that can be bought for £5.79, although Capcom does provide a voucher to change your characters once for free.</p>
<p>It's an egregious inclusion that nonetheless has been part of the games since Monster Hunter World. But thanks to modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/133?tab=description">Ridog8</a>, PC players can have unlimited character edits.</p>

<p>The mod still uses edit vouchers, but they're set to zero and will continue to work. Surely Capcom will find a way to patch this out?</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds only released a few days ago, but already there are plenty of mods available for PC players looking to improve the experience.</p>
<p>For instance, Monster Hunter Wilds includes an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-turn-on-arachnophobia-setting-monster-hunter-wilds">arachnophobia mode</a> in its accessibility settings, but frustratingly that only applies to the smaller eight-legged creatures that crawl around the wilds and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-arachnophobia-mode-turns-eight-legged-critters-into-amusing-blobs">turns them into blobs of goo instead</a>.</p>
<p>But there are larger monsters to hunt that are especially spider-like: the Lala Barina, for instance, with its spindly legs and scarlet webbing; or the Nerscylla that swings like Spider-Man over each battle arena.</p>
<p>Thankfully, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/143?tab=description">Tea Common Shark</a> has created a mod that extends the arachnophobia mode to these larger monsters - they're not quite giant blobs, but at least their spider-like features are mostly disguised.</p>
<p>"I did this mainly because it's funny," the modder joked, "but it might also help those who can't bear to look at them."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Spider becomes Mr Blobby | <span>Image credit: <cite>Tea Common Shark</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Other mods look to improve on some of the key criticisms of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/136">Furiante</a> has created a harder difficult mod that increases monster HP and damage, with multiple values available so hunters can customise the experience to their liking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/16?tab=description">GreenComfyTea</a> has created a mod that adds health bars to monsters, though I'd argue half the fun is not knowing the numbers and watching for that telltale limp instead.</p>
<p>Another complaint are the drab, somewhat washed out visuals of the game, but beyond playing with the game's brightness and saturation options, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/168">SchiggyCGN</a> has created a reshade that makes the game considerably more vibrant. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/94">Other modders</a> have done <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/97">similar work</a>.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>SchiggyCGN's vibrant mod. | <span>Image credit: <cite>SchiggyCGN</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Perhaps most ambitiously, modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/88">Velasquez</a> has created a mod with new graphic presets in a bid to optimise the game's performance. Considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">poor performance of Monster Hunter Wilds on PC</a>, it's great to see modders getting to grips with optimisation before Capcom does.</p>

            <p>
Steam hit another new player record this weekend, with more than 40 million people online at the same time. 
</p>
<p>
Last Friday was, of course, the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> - which soared to a peak of more than 1.38 million concurrent players on Saturday night. That same total was then repeated on Sunday, when a peak of 1.37 million concurrent players jumped back into the game.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Monster Hunter Wilds is the second-most played game on Steam, behind evergreen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, but ahead of other stalwarts such as PUBG and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds has clearly been a huge hit</a>, with a Steam play count three times higher than any previous Monster Hunter game, let alone anything else publisher Capcom has ever launched, Resident Evil included.
</p>
<p>
It's not all been plain sailing for the game, however. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-responds-after-monster-hunter-wilds-steam-success-is-marred-by-performance-complaints">User reviews for Monster Hunter Wilds remain "Mixed" on Steam</a>, with only 53 percent of players currently saying they'd recommend the game, and a fair amount of criticism for its technical performance on PC right now.

<p>
Digital Foundry echoed that on Friday, going as far as saying the team "can't recommend the PC version" as "substantial technical problems must be addressed".
</p>
<p>
"To sum up, lower-end graphics cards with lower VRAM allocations should avoid Monster Hunter Wilds until these issues are rectified," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-weve-got-issues">Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia wrote</a>. "Higher-end hardware can brute-force the game's shortcomings to some degree, but it's still hard to recommend such a flawed technical outing - or even derive optimised settings."
</p>
<p>
Other criticism has surfaced for the series' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-you-can-change-your-monster-hunter-wilds-character-once-for-free-before-capcom-makes-you-pay-up">need to pay if you want to keep changing your Monster Hunter Wilds character</a> - though you do get one edit for free.

            <p>Can you feel it? Spring is in the air. The mornings are brighter, birds are singing and flowers are starting to break free from their wintery soil confines. And, to kick off the upcoming season, Xbox has more Game Pass news to share.</p>
<p>While we still don't have the first full batch of March monthly newcomers (although we can expect that very soon, so stay tuned), the Xbox team has revealed eight games leaving its Game Pass subscription service within the next two weeks, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-5-review">Yakuza 5</a> Remastered.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last month, a little game you may have heard of - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-balatro-has-shadow-dropped-on-game-pass">Balatro - became available via Xbox Game Pass</a>. We here at Eurogamer are rather fond of Balatro, naming it one of our favourite games of 2024. "It's a work of marvellous depth and winning simplicity, and rightly one of the best and most memorable games you'll play this year," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2024-ranked">Eurogamer's round up of the 50 best games of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>For everything else on Microsoft's subscription service, you can check out our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Xbox Game Pass guide</a> detailing the many titles available.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whilst the NSPCC acknowledges the risks that come with online gaming, the NSPCC also hears from many young people on the benefits of playing games, both online and offline, with one 14-year-old saying: "Sometimes I get overwhelmed with everything going on around me.</p>
<p>"My new support worker knows I love board games, and he showed me I can play Cluedo online! It’s part of my strategy now when I need a distraction, it feels really good to have plans to help me cope."</p>
<p>"The NSPCC is excited to announce the launch of the Game Safe Steam sale. The proceeds will help us to support children and young people through services, such as Childline," said Lewie Procter, head of gaming partnerships at the NSPCC.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled that popular games, such as Cluedo, Hypnospace Outlaw and Yes, Your Grace, are on sale, giving gaming fans a chance to make a difference.</p>
<p>"We want to thank Steam for partnering with us and to the developers and publishers for supporting this brilliant initiative. We are proud to work with them and look forward to continuing to raise awareness of online safety on gaming platforms."</p>
