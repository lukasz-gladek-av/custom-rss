            <p>The Duffer brothers, creators of Stranger Things, have said the final battle of the TV series was partially inspired by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. Matt Duffer was apparently playing the game while devising the showdown.</p>
<p>Note: there are spoilers for the final battle ahead.</p>
<p>"We were thinking about D&amp;D and I was playing Baldur's Gate 3 at the time," <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/">Duffer told Variety</a>, "and we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat [the mind flayer] was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realised — either through self-acceptance or they've resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they're absolutely primed. They're the ultimate team, and it's the party working all together to defeat this thing.</p>
<p>"And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that's where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons and something like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>. Because that's how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle."</p><p>The final battle of Stranger Things pits nearly the entire cast of goodies against a colossal spidery crab monster in the wasteland of Dimension X. This is the physical manifestation of the shadowy mind flayer we see repeatedly through the series, and which Henry Creel, AKA Vecna, partners with - he takes up residence literally inside the beast.</p>
<p>Links to Baldur's Gate 3 are to be expected of course, with both entertainment properties being heavily rooted in, or based upon, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and both revolving around a mind flayer plot. In Stranger Things it's more euphemistic, however, used as a kind of lingo the central characters - the kids - apply to strange enemies they face. In BG3 you face an actual mind flayer threat, coincidentally also having to destroy the mega-mind controlling it (which isn't a giant spidery crab).</p>
<p>Whether Matt Duffer played Baldur's Gate 3 for inspiration or for entertainment purposes is unclear - the interview doesn't touch upon it - but I expect it's a bit of both. The Duffer brothers have said before that they aren't, despite appearances, long-serving D&amp;D fans - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXSsXbFfwXU">they didn't grow up playing it</a>. Perhaps BG3 was a more approachable way into learning the game.</p>
<p>Matt Duffer also didn't clarify which other video game references were in the final Stranger Things battle, though if you ask me, that mind flayer spider crab thing looks a lot like a corpser from the Gears of War series. It being a giant enemy crab also brings to mind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-genjidaysofblade-ps3">Sony's infamous 'giant enemy crab' meme from Genji: Days of the Blade</a>.</p>

            <p>The top five games played on the PlayStation in 2025 by US players were exactly the same as in 2024, according to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker.</p>
<p>This information, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">published on social media by senior director at Circana Mat Piscatella</a>, states that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> took the top spot in 2025, followed by Call of Duty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto V</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, then Minecraft. This is interesting as this list is an exact replication of the top five games played on US PlayStations in 2024.</p>
<p>Looking at the top five games played on US Xbox's in 2025, there's a slight different in the order of the games which take the top five spots, but the games themselves remain the same. In 2025, Fortnite took the number one spot, followed by Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V, Minecraft, and Roblox. Whereas in 2024, Call of Duty was number one, followed by Fortnite, Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, then Roblox at number five.</p>

<p>It's safe to say that, judging by these stats, the upper echelon of popular games right now are somewhat cemented in place right now. With the biggest live service games bringing in absurd profit and player engagement metrics, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-on-earth-do-you-find-lasting-meaningful-success-with-a-live-service-game-developers-answer-the-billion-dollar-question">it's a tricky task to break into the space and survive</a> let alone thrive. A year after its launch, <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/20696836/epic-apple-trial-epic-games-exhibit.pdf">Fortnite made over $5bn,</a> and has shown little sign of slowing down ever since.</p><p>That should provide some context as to why developers keep attempting to make big live service hits, as if they can catch on the potential profits are staggering. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders would be an example of this going well</a>, while examples of these sorts of games not catching on are far more numerous. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/free-to-play-big-team-pvp-warhaven-announces-closure-just-4-months-after-its-early-access-launch">Just look at Warhaven</a>, which shut down only four months after its early access release.</p><p>

Will 2026's top five list be different? Even with Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">having hit a bit of a roadbump with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> performing exceptionally well, it's likely the top five list itself will stay very similar. If <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">Grand Theft Auto VI wasn't delayed to November</a> perhaps we'd have seen a passing of the torch to the sequel, but oh well.
