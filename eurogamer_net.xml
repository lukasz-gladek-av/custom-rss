            <p>
Sony has whipped out its wallet and snapped up precisely 2.5 percent of publisher Bandai Namco as part of a "strategic partnership" that primarily appears to be focused on expanding audiences within the realm of anime and manga.
</p>
<p>
The news, of course, follows Sony's move to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">become FromSoftware owner Kadokawa's largest shareholder</a> last year. And while it might be tempting to conclude this new Bandai Namco is part of a nefarious scheme to lock FromSoftware in a PlayStation-shaped bunker, the reality probably isn't quite so Machiavellian.
</p>
<p>
Sony's decision to increase its shares in Kadokawa last December was - as with today's Bandai Namco deal - primarily about the anime market. In Kadokawa's case, it was said the increased partnership would allow Sony to adapt the company's IP (Kadokawa is a major name in anime publishing) into live-action film and TV dramas globally, as well as co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works, and more.
</p>
<p>
And it's a similar story with Bandai Namco. In a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/">joint statement</a> announcing Sony's acquisition of 16m shares in the company as part of a new "strategic partnership", the pair wrote, "Through this business alliance and Sony's investment in Bandai Namco... [we] will focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated."
</p>
<p>
This will involve implementing initiatives to expand the "works as well as products and services based on IP developed by Bandai Namco, leveraging Sony's strengths in areas such as the production and distribution of anime and other video content, as well as merchandising."
</p>
<p>
There was also talk of the companies "merging their strengths to create new and emotionally moving experiences for fans" in order to "maximise the value of IP" as part of the 68bn yen/$464m deal. There was not, however, any mention of a PlayStation-exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2.
</p>
<p>
Sony's recent anime-focused activity follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-completes-usd1bn-crunchyroll-buyout">$1bn purchase of streaming service Crunchyroll</a> in 2020. That deal, it said at the time, would create an "unprecedented opportunity to serve anime fans like never before and deliver the anime experience across any platform they choose, from theatrical, events, home entertainment, games, streaming, linear TV."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has finally been revealed officially, courtesy of a brand-new trailer premiered on YouTube. A legal disclaimer URL featured at the end of the trailer may have given away a release window too!
</p>
<p>The trailer itself shows in-engine footage, but not gameplay. You see all the Battlefield staples: tanks, helicopters, fighter jets, all blasting away at each other and demolishing buildings. The trailer sets up a private miltary force called Pax Armada too, which appears to the be antagonistic force in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>.
</p>
<p>The trailer started up with a in-engine camera feed where discussions can be heard about various modern war talk, different countries, whispers about who isn't present in the room, and quiet chatting about the upcoming statement from the President of the USA. This then led straight into the trailer.</p>

<p>The trailer ends with a date for an upcoming multiplayer reveal, which will take place on 31st July. You can wishlist the game now. In addition, the final shot of the trailer features a disclaimer that the game contains in-game purchases. </p>
<p>Typing in the disclaimer URL featured in this disclaimer takes you to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/game-disclaimers">a page on Battlefield 6's standard edition</a>. On this page you can read the following sentence on the standard edition pre-sell offers: "This promotional offer expires October 10, 2025. Code expires October 10, 2027." This indicates that pre-sell offers end on October 10, and that a release date for Battlefield 6 may be October 11, 2025.
