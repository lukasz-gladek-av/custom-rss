            <p>
Mario Kart fans are pouring over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">yesterday's reveal of a new entry in Nintendo's racing series for Switch 2</a> - and have come up with a few more clues on how the game might play. 
</p>
<p>
Our first look at Mario Kart 9 - or whatever it ends up being called - was, on the surface, a pretty straightforward affair. We saw one racetrack, 12 returning characters and not a lot else.
</p>
<p>
Except for the fact, as we noted yesterday, there are now 24 spaces on the track's starting grid. Huh! Let's hope Nintendo has improved its online servers to allow for 24 players.
</p>
<p>
Overnight, fans have analysed the trailer in more detail - with an eye to working on what Mario Kart 9's main 'gimmick' might be. We've had underwater racing and gliders, anti-gravity tracks, and now... could Mario Kart 9's big change revolve around conserving fuel?
</p><p>
One fan spotted a rather conspicuous fuel tank added to the side of Mario's otherwise familiar kart, labelled "1-UP Fuel". The same fan also pointed to the mysterious glowing power-up seemingly placed outside a pit-stop burger joint - perhaps a fuel-replenishing power-up.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">haven't seen anyone else talk about this but the gimmick of mario kart 9 is definitely a fuel tank<br>karts have conspicuous fuel tanks now and there's something on this track that doesnt look like an item box <br>it'll be a resource you can use freely to boost <a href="https://t.co/bhGnEOe8Xo">pic.twitter.com/bhGnEOe8Xo</a></p>â€” chloe (@payapaberii) <a href="https://twitter.com/payapaberii/status/1879956048762794250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

<p>
Another fan pointed to the presence of a large gas station by the track itself, with a large sign that reads: "Fire Flower Gas Station". 
</p> <div>

<p>
Other changes  noted yesterday include slight tweaks to Mario and Donkey Kong's character designs. (We think they now deliberately look more similar to those seen in the Super Mario Bros. Movie!)
</p>
<p>
For lots more chat about Mario Kart 9 - including our theories on whether the game might be open-world, or feature user-made courses, be sure to watch the latest episode of the Eurogamer Newscast, below.

            <p>Nintendo said it believes "in giving proper credit" to those who work on its games, after recently omitting the original development team at Retro Studios from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>'s credits.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a remaster of 2010's Wii release, which was originally developed by Retro and published by Nintendo. This year's remaster, however, has been helmed by Forever Entertainment, which is front and centre of the new release's credits. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-removes-retro-studios-staff-from-credits">Nintendo has omitted the original developers from the ending</a>,  simply stating the HD remaster was "based on the work" of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> team.</p>
<p>Now, in a statement to Eurogamer regarding its crediting policy, Nintendo said: "We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process."</p>

<p>Nintendo did not state why then it had still omitted the original Donkey Kong Country Returns team from the HD remaster's credits. We have asked for further clarification on this, and will update if we hear more.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously been called out for missing those who worked on a game from its credits. </p>
<p>In 2023, former Retro Studios engineer Zoid Kirsch said he was "let down" by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-retro-studios-engineer-let-down-by-metroid-prime-remasters-lack-of-credit-for-original-team">lack of individual credits in Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo voiced their disappointment at not being credited for work on high-profile games</a>.</p>

            <p>Riot Games is running in-game events from next week to raise funding for those impacted by the LA fires.</p>
<p>After hundreds of thousands of people were placed under evacuation orders and the devastation of the wildfires sweeping across Los Angeles became apparent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">Riot was one of several video game companies to reach out to employees</a> to tell them to take care of themselves ahead of work.</p>
<p>Now Riot is inviting its players to support those impacted by the catastrophe via in-game donations through <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and Valorant.</p>
<p>From 22nd-30th January, Valorant's EX.O Collection will become a Give Back Bundle, with proceeds from weapon skins and accessories in the bundle going to the Riot Games Social Impact Fund, a donor-advised fund account sponsored by ImpactAssets.</p>
<p>In League of Legends, from 23rd January until 5th February, proceeds from Firefighter Tristana - who will be unvaulted for this fundraiser - will also go to the Riot Games Social Impact Fund.</p>
<p>Riot also launched a "double-donation" campaign last week, tripling the charitable contributions of its staff to organisations like the California Fire Foundation, Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation, International Medical Corps, American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen. Riot has also made direct donations to the California Fire Foundation and International Medical Corps to support relief efforts.</p><p>"While these are incredibly difficult times and there is a long road to recovery ahead, Iâ€™m grateful that weâ€™re collectively in this together - no matter where we are in the world," said CEO A. Dylan Jadeja. "Thank you for all of your support."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Japanese police have arrested a man accused of modifying and selling Nintendo Switch consoles.
</p>
<p>
It's the first time someone under suspicion of breaking the country's Trademark Act by handling modded Switch consoles has been arrested, <a href="https://news.ntv.co.jp/n/rkc/category/society/rcc5bf23d3d9bd40b5bc4da1bb34648d49">NTV News</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-man-arrested-for-selling-modded-nintendo-switch-consoles-setting-a-new-precedent/">Automaton</a>) reports, potentially setting a new, harsher precedent for the future.
</p>
<p>
The 58-year-old suspect is believed to have made a business out of modifying second-hand Switch consoles so that they play pirated games, and reselling these modded units for 28,000 yen (about Â£150) apiece.

<p>
The man, who has reportedly admitted to the charge, also offered a bundle of 27 pirated games to play on the modded consoles for an additional fee.
</p>
<p>
Today's news comes just days after the deputy general manager of Nintendo's Japanese intellectual property department said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-attorney-explains-why-its-strengthening-measures-against-illegal-emulation">the company was beefing up its stance against illegal emulation</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is of course no stranger to legal action when it feels its products are under threat, and has made an example out of individuals in the past.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jail-term-for-nintendo-pirate-gary-bowser-was-unique-opportunity-to-set-example-court-documents-reveal">Nintendo lawyer pressed to ensure the maximum five-year jail time was handed down to the infamous Gary Bowser</a> - who worked as part of another business that enabled Switch piracy - as it would be "a large benefit to further education of the public".
</p><p>
Speaking last year, Bowser - now freed from prison but in financial debt to Nintendo due to fines for the rest of his working life - said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-says-nintendo-wanted-to-send-a-message-with-sentence">his sentence had been designed like a message</a> "to other people that [are] still out there, that if they get caught ... [they'll] serve hard time".

            <p>Director and writer David Lynch, known for his surreal work across film and television, has passed away at the age of 78.</p>
<p>Announcing his death on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl?rdid=581XjlBlb3GqM8zP#">Facebook</a> yesterday, Lynch's family wrote: "It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time. Thereâ€™s a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole'. Itâ€™s a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way."</p>
<p>While Lynch is best known for his work on TV series such as Twin Peaks and films like Mulholland Drive, the creator is also a memorable part of PlayStation's history, responsible for several iconic PS2 adverts which arrived with that unmistakable Lynchian brand of surrealism and shades of neo-noir.</p>

<p>The most famous of these adverts is the brilliantly bonkers black-and-white affair known as Welcome To The Third Space. Kicking off with a wailing siren, a voice asks through a speaker: "Where are we?" A man walks through a corridor, his head detaches from his body, it reattaches, an arm comes out from his mouth.</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Third Place," quacks a suited duck. </p>
<p>The iconic trailer was shared by <a href="https://x.com/PlayStationAU/status/1880104053184811213">PlayStation Australia</a> in the early hours of this morning. "RIP David Lynch," PlayStation AU wrote. You can experience the trailer once again in the video above.</p>

<p>Posting on social media last night, Remedy boss and Alan Wake writer Sam Lake shared his sadness at Lynch's passing. "David Lynch has been a huge inspiration to me and a huge influence on my work," he wrote. "Rest in peace."</p>
<p>In a separate post, Lake revealed that Remedy's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> team had used the code name "Big Fish" for its surreal sequel, a nod to Lynch's autobiography and self-help guide Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity.</p>
<p>"I think David Lynch is swimming with the big fish now," Lake shared with an image of the book. "His influence goes far and wide and will live on."</p>

            <p>Nintendo's share price has dropped in the wake of the Switch 2's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about">"safe" debut</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/1/17/nintendo-shares-tumble-as-switch-2-reveal-disappoints-fans">Al Jazeera</a>, stocks fell by as much as 7.2 percent after the hardware's formal announcement. Prices did bounce back a little, but by 4pm local time, share prices were still down 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>That said, since the end of last year, Nintendo's share price <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NTDOY/?guccounter=1">has been so strong</a>, the Japanese firm's stock value still sits on a near all-time high.</p>

<p>Whilst many factors contribute to a company's share price - and we still don't yet know all the technical specifications - it's widely speculated that due to the furore generated by the rumours over many weeks and months and the perceived lack of innovation between the two generations of hardware, the reception to Switch 2's debut from some quarters was somewhat flat.</p>
<p>"I can't have been the only person watching <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">the Switch 2 reveal</a> yesterday hoping to be surprised - the only person hoping to be Nintendo-d," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about">wrote our Bertie</a>, lamenting the new console's comparative lack of innovation."</p>

            <p>After eons of waiting, Nintendo has <em>finally </em>debuted its next console. Yes, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> - as we can now call it officially - was revealed yesterday, with a brief teaser video full of magnetic Joy-Cons and some really rather yummy noises.</p>
<p>We here at Eurogamer have our own thoughts on Nintendo's reveal (be sure to check out Bertie's feature<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-switch-2-is-the-end-of-innovative-nintendo-theres-much-to-be-sad-about"> If Switch 2 is the end of innovative Nintendo, there's much to be sad about</a> and Donlan's one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-the-switch-2-is-safe-then-im-jason-statham-and-i-want-to-star-in-it">If the Switch 2 is safe, then I'm Jason Statham and I want to star in it</a>, for two sides of the discussion).</p>
<p>But, what of those outside of the EG walls? Well, several have jumped on the Switch 2 train and shared their thoughts, even sausage roll bakery chain Greggs.</p>
