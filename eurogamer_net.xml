        <p>BBC investigation shows just two of Play Store's 45 highest-grossing games adhered to ASA standards.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The most popular mobile games "are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes".</p>
<p>That's according to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c748ww9y9nno">BBC</a>, which said an investigation into the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store discovered just two games correctly advertised that they contained randomised in-game purchases.</p>

<p>Of the 45 investigated, 26 games were labelled in the online store as including loot boxes, 22 of which "were being actively advertised at the same time". Only two of those 22 games properly disclosed loot boxes in their advertising, with the Play Store's highest-grossing game, Monopoly Go, "among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts".</p><p>"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions," said Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers and Gamblers Education Trust, adding the findings were "deeply concerning".</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the ASA told the BBC: "This is an ongoing area of our work, and we're closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly."</p>
<p>This time last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-games-industry-to-restrict-access-to-loot-boxes-for-children">UK games industry agreed to restrict access to in-game loot boxes for children</a> via a set of industry guidelines.</p>
<p>The industry's trade association UKIE worked with the UK government to draft 11 Industry Principles as part of "improved protections for children, young people and adults following concerns raised about loot boxes". The Principles include the need to flag the existence of loot boxes in a game prior to purchase, a clear list of the probabilities for loot box contents, and the need for an easy refund policy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-inquisitions-final-expansion-originally-forced-you-to-blow-up-skyhold<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
An early plan for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>'s climactic Trespasser expansion would have seen players forced to blow up their beloved base, Skyhold.
</p>
<p>
Skyhold is where the bulk of Inquisition is set - a towering, upgradable and expandable castle that fills up with your close companions and other followers, and acts as a hub for the Inquisitor in their fight back against Corypheus. It's the game's equivalent to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>'s Normandy, and is a big reason why many fans love the game.
</p>
<p>
Newly-posted concept art from Trespasser's early days shows Skyhold was once set to be sacrificed during the events of the expansion in dramatic style - something that would have fitted the add-on's narrative arc, perhaps, though would also have been heart-wrenching for players after 100 hours building it up.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Dragon Age veteran Matt Rhodes <a href="https://x.com/mattrhodesart/status/1862140792527085614">revealed</a> that Skyhold was due to be blown up in "an earlier version of the story". 
</p>
<p>
"Sten would arrive to arrest you for meddling with magic, but Dagna has reverse engineering their explosives," Rhodes wrote. "You leave a trap for when they return, sacrificing Skyhold in the process."

<p>
Long-term Dragon Age fans will remember Qunari warrior Sten from earlier games. Ultimately, he did not appear in Inquisition or Trespasser at all.
</p>
<p>
At a guess, it sounds like this might have happened at the start of Trespasser, which ultimately still does not feature Skyhold. Instead, it begins with the action moved elsewhere from the off.
</p>
<p>
The launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has brought back a wave of nostalgia from developers who worked on the series previously, with insight from franchise creator David Gaider recently shining a light on the characters of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-writer-probably-cried-harder-than-i-ever-have-in-my-life-writing-dorians-story">Dorian</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creator-discusses-taking-on-inquisitions-cassandra-after-original-writer-left-amidst-abuse">Cassandra</a>.

        <p>"If a creator uses hateful slurs on their stream but not in-game, we can still issue a penalty."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>From 3rd January 2025, Riot Games will ban content creators for bad "off-platform conduct".</p>
<p>In a message posted to Valorant's social media channels, the developer said that "if a creator uses hateful slurs about an opposing player or teammate on their stream" - even if it's not via its in-game comms - it will "still issue a penalty as if that behaviour occurred in-game".</p>

<p>"Our intention with this update is to help protect players from harmful behaviours they can experience across the various places that touch their gaming experience," Riot explained.</p>
<p>"This update applies very specifically and only to content where Riot's games are the background of the content produced. Though we aren't going to proactively monitor everything that happens across social media, it is now within our rights to issue penalties in-game when that content is brought to our attention."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Riot Games will now ban content creators that engage in "Off-Platform Conduct" - specifically when Riot's games are in the background </p><p>Example: "if a creator uses hateful slurs about an opposing player or teammate on their stream, but not in game over chat or voice comms, we can… <a href="https://t.co/GBiKgx78A8">pic.twitter.com/GBiKgx78A8</a></p></div>— Valorant News (@ValorINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/ValorINTEL/status/1861902078261830090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"As an example, if a creator uses hateful slurs about an opposing player or teammate on their stream, but not in-game over chat or voice comms, we can still issue a penalty as if that behaviour occurred in-game.</p>
<p>"TL;DR - if you say or do things that break our Terms of Service while broadcasting or creating content about our games, we can restrict access to your Riot accounts (and suspend your Partner privileges if you are part of our Partner Program)."</p><p>This is just the latest initiative from Riot to clamp down on toxicity in its playerbase. In a frank discussion about the "current state of player behaviour" in Valorant earlier this year, Riot Games' head Anna Donlon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-studio-head-tells-toxic-players-to-play-something-else-we-wont-miss-you">outlined upcoming changes designed "to make our community a better place"</a>.</p>
<p>Though Donlon acknowledged at the time that the development team had no plans to "sanitise gaming" or suppress harmless banter, she said players should not be expected to "grow a thicker skin" when playing video games.</p>
<p>"There's no room in our community for the most egregious behaviours, and we're not going to compromise on that point," she said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a>: Legion, the game which imagined a post-Brexit London that wasn't too far off from the truth, is getting a follow-up - but it's not a video game. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Watch Dogs: Truth is an audio drama series available via Audible, with choose-your-own-adventure elements that let you pick various options at the end of every episode.
</p>
<p>
Truth once again delves into the London-based activities of hacktivist group DeadSec, featuring returning character Bagley - a sentient AI.
</p>
<p>
Joining the cast for Truth are a number of names you might have heard of or seen before: Doctor Who companion Freema Agyeman (she played Martha opposite David Tennant, and also popped up in Torchwood), Russell Tovey (who played Alonso in that Titanic episode with Kylie Minogue, though is really more famous for Being Human) and David Morrisey (yes, he was The Governor in The Walking Dead, but he also played someone who thought he was The Doctor in another David Tennant Doctor Who Christmas special).
</p>
<p>
Also in the cast are T'Nia Miller and Gary Beadle. I don't believe either of them have been in Doctor Who.
</p>
<p>
"Listeners of this thrilling story will once again join the fight for truth whilst guided by the self-aware AI, Bagley, as they make decisions at the end of each episode, with choices that shape the hacking collective's next move, profoundly impact character relationships and ultimately, the success of the resistance effort," Ubisoft says of Watch Dogs: Truth.
</p><p>
"Across the series, listeners will have the fate of the city in their own hands, as the government's cyber intelligence force (SIRS) orchestrates a sinister campaign of message manipulation and fake news, which leads DedSec to fight back using its revered tactics to battle against alarming disinformation."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-golds-blind-assassin-hero-provides-the-perfect-formula-for-audio-drama">Ubisoft previously partnered with Audible for Assassin's Creed Gold</a>, a series that cleverly featured a blind hero (played by Star Wars: Rogue One's Riz Ahmed), with Buffy the Vampire Slayer's Anthony Head as Sir Issac Newton. (Head was also in Doctor Who.)
</p>
<p>
While there's no sign at all that Ubisoft is working on a Watch Dogs 4, the publisher is clearly keen to keep the brand alive via other means. 
</p>
<p>
Nearly a decade after its first announcement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-dogs-movie-finally-finishes-filming">Ubisoft's mysterious Watch Dogs movie finally finished filming in September</a>.
