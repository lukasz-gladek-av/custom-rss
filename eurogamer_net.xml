            <p>
And here we go again! Barely a month into 2026, developer Hello Games is back with another major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, kicking off its tenth anniversary year in style. Assuming your idea of style is trucking, hauling, and tossing stuff around with gravity guns. that is (it's certainly mine).
</p>
<p>
All the above arrives today, 11th February, as part of No Man's Sky new Remnant update - which, by my reckoning and terrible maths, is the exploratory space sim's 39th major update. Following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-space-wreck-salvaging-and-expanded-ship-building-as-its-busy-year-continues">December's Breach release</a>, Remnant is all about hauling; or more specifically, it's about industrial enterprise - processing scrap into "rare and highly prized resources".

<p>
That might not sounds as immediately enticing as, say, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-adds-fully-customisable-multi-crew-spaceships-you-can-build-and-fly-with-your-friends">fully customisable multi-crew space ships</a>, but read the fine print and it starts to get a lot more exciting. For one, Remnant introduces trucks, tipping flatbeds, and haulers players can construct and customise, cramming them full of salvage and debris to cart back to new Waste Processing Plants for reclamation. As Hello Games explains, "Build your own brightly coloured incinerators, spider legged sci-fi explorer, or heavily armed military vehicles with tank tracks."
</p><p>
Key to all this hauling is the new Gravitino Coil, a powerful anti-gravity module for the good ol' multi-tool that, says Hello Games, turns No Man’s Sky "into a physics playground". With the Gravitino Coil equipped, players can hoist, fling, and carry large objects - which, continues the studio, creates a "fun and tactile new loop of searching for wrecks, loading trucks full of cargo and hauling across the alien landscape to industrial yards to gain new loot and rewards." Just watch out for the highly volatile scrap during transportation. Oh, and if you were wondering, yes, it IS possible to use the Gravitino Gun as a weapon - just pluck up something heavy (Sentinels included) and throw.

Last but not least, Remnant brings a new limited-time Expedition. This community focused event tasks travellers with tidying up and reclaiming a planet covered in wrecks and salvage. Rewards for completion include "dozens" of vehicle parts, plus a new armour set incorporating padded fabrics and ornate steam punk detailing. Full <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/remnant-update">update patch notes can be found here</a>.
</p>
<p>

As for what else Hello Games has in store for No Man's Sky's tenth anniversary celebrations, that remains a mystery for now. All it's saying currently is its customary closing teaser, "More will follow... Our journey continues." And might 2026 also be the year we finally learn more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">the studio's intriguing procedural planet sim Light No Fire</a>? We shall see!

            <p>Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is almost here, and that means we'll be hearing more and more about it in the coming weeks as the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">breaks into Steam's top sellers</a> and gets more folks talking. Regardless of what ends up happening after launch, it seems the relaunched marketing campaign is working wonders in the post-<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> era.</p>
<p>Now, via <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ">Marathon HQ</a>, we've learned new details on the game's customisation and weapon options. Moreover, it appears that Chinese influencers, streamers, and games media <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ/status/2021252272982753431">were mostly blown away</a> by what they saw during a recent event.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>When it comes to launch-day skins, it seems the game will feature <em>at least</em> six skins for each Runner, one based on each faction. The X/Twitter post above shows screens from the event and some of those early cosmetics. Considering how paper-thin other multiplayer games are on that front at launch, Bungie might be off to a great start when it comes to unlockables.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ/status/2021252272982753431">full rundown of information</a> extracted from the event is even juicier, as it reveals 28 guns with "two or more skins" will be available at launch; some cosmetics even alter the model, so you won't have to wait very long to get substantial visual redesigns. On that front, there was praise for the "massive upgrade" the game's overall look has received since last year, with many voices saying the environments are "giving off a much darker and mysterious tone."</p><p>When it comes to systems and mechanics, it looks like the skills and perks are fairly flexible when it comes to builds, something worth taking into account when you team up with a group of Runners. Another highlight was how expensive meds and shields were, at least during this preview session, with early-game PvP also being described as a "guaranteed loss" even if it's tempting to take on human enemies that are described as "loot pinatas."</p>

</figure>
<p>The PvE crowd might also be in for a surprise, as it appears the NPC enemies are ruthless and "constantly calling in reinforcements" instead of going offline once a hot area is cleared. On top of that, watch your surroundings, since "environmental hazards like poison gas vents, perimeter turrets, and landmines are everywhere as well."</p>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-new-footage-impressions-chinese-event-seasons-roguelike/">Wccftech</a> also shared some extra tidbits from the event, with a special focus on the game's ongoing narrative, which will be told through "roguelike adventure" seasons during which players have to get stronger to tackle increasingly difficult runs as mysteries unfold. As a reminder, if you're killed in action, you'll lose your valuable loot and equipment.</p><p>At this point, it's safe to say Marathon's take on the extraction shooter subgenre will be completely different from Arc Raiders, so it'll be interesting to see how these two heavy hitters coexist together if Bungie's latest doesn't land with a thud.</p>

            <p>Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Ellie in Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and its sequel The Last of Us Part 2, has shared her thoughts on the divisive second season of HBO's TV adaptation.</p>
<p>While the first season of The Last of Us was met with praise, the show seemed to falter a bit with season two. There were a few quibbles, with many debating whether or not the TV team was right to reveal Abby's motivations so early in the season, among other issues with pacing, character development and so on. </p>
<p>But, season two was always going to be a tricky board to tread. Even the award-winning The Last of Us Part 2 received some very vocal pushback on its release in 2020. So, what does Johnson make of the renewed discussions around The Last of Us following season two's release last year?</p>
<p>"I feel like with The Last of Us, people really love that story, including me, and it's very, very passionate fans. And sometimes that passion feels really great, and sometimes it feels not great," Johnson told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-ashley-johnson-backlash">The Direct</a>. "But you know, I understand it. I understand loving something so much, and wanting it to be what you want it to be."</p><p>Johnson added it "can be hard sometimes", because "when you are making these things, and on your side of things, you're passionate about it, and excited about it, and hopefully those two things can meet". However, the actor noted that sometimes "they do not", and this can be difficult.</p>
<p>"I mean, anytime you're working on anything, you want people to like it, and you want people to love it as much as you," Johnson explained. "But I love The Last of Us in every form, and I am so happy that I get to be a part of [telling] that story."</p>
<p>As well as her part in bringing the games to life, Johnson also had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-the-last-of-us-episode-nine">cameo in the first season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, as Ellie's mother.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer. While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p><p>As for the future of the series, it is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">suspected the upcoming third season will be its last</a>. Since then, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-third-and-perhaps-final-season-adds-two-new-cast-members">Clea DuVall and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. will both join The Last of Us for the show's upcoming season</a>.</p>

            <p>One of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2's biggest shockers</a> was having Wasteland veteran <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-veteran-ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-dollars-and-a-sandwich-for-his-voiceover-work-in-the-original-game">Ron Perlman</a> (who's done voice acting for the entire game series) show up in a quick cameo role as a mysterious CGI'd super mutant.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers for Fallout's Season 2 finale ahead.</strong></p>
<p>After the last episode, which dropped last week, we didn't get any answers regarding this new player or where the teased "war" might be going. We know the Fallout universe has a lot going on beyond the current scope of the show, and while it seems we'll eventually get to see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-ending-explained-your-biggest-burning-questions-answered">even the giant mech Liberty Prime</a> one way or another, we'd be surprised if the creatives manage to cram every iconic bit of the games into the live-action adaptation.</p>
<p>That said, co-showrunner and writer Geneva Robertson-Dworet revealed during <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">an interview for The Direct</a> the plan is to have more of Ron Perlman's super mutant helper in the show: "I hope people know that he is a larger character in this world, in our minds." She also went on to underline she's always seen him "as a big role" that's part of their tendency to hint at wars happening elsewhere in the Wasteland.</p><p>It might be a while before he shows up again though, as those conflicts "maybe aren't in the region of the Wasteland where our characters currently are." Perlman's green-skinned guy has been seen helping The Ghoul near New Vegas, however, so we'd be shocked if he is nowhere to be seen in Season 3 even if the larger war the showrunners are hinting at isn't on the immediate horizon.</p>
<p>First up, Lucy and Maximus will have to deal with the Legion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-funko-pop-might-have-just-spoiled-a-fallout-season-2-plot-point">after its change in leadership</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://collider.com/fallout-season-2-finale-explained-colorado-location-geneva-robertson-dworet-frances-turner/">The Ghoul is heading to Colorado</a>... but that may also take a while to pan out.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">full chat with The Direct</a> is an interesting read that goes into more of the world-building ambitions of the team behind the show. For example, the powers that be aren't shying away from stating the Brotherhood of Steel might have a larger role moving forward and as we get to see other chapters.</p>
<p>It's a world of possibility out there, and as long as the show's ratings <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">remain healthy</a>, I'm sure both Bethesda and Amazon MGM Studios are happy to keep it going.</p>
