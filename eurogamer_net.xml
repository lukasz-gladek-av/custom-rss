            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will not be returning to iOS in Japan next year "as promised" because, according to Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, Apple has allegedly launched "another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking".</p>
<p>In a series of messages posted to X/Twitter, Sweeney explained that whilst Apple had been "required to open up iOS to competing stores", it has instead introduced additional fees, including a 21% "junk fee" on third-party in-app payments, 15% for purchases made on the web, and a "new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores".</p> <div>

<p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/">announced</a> earlier this week that it would be making changes to iOS in Japan, including new options for developers to distribute apps and process payments, acknowledging that the changes have been implemented to comply with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA).</p>
<p>"Sadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised," CEO Sweeney wrote. "Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores [on 18th December], and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.</p>
<p>"Apple chose poorly. Again."</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, he added: "They're charging a competition-crushing 21% junk fee on third-party in-app payments, and 15% for purchases made on the web (a practice the US District Court already found to be illegal in the contempt of court proceeding that Apple lost and the 9th Circuit Court upheld)." He then linked to a page on <a href="https://t.co/QDtWekKflY">Apple's website</a>.</p><p>"They're introducing new anticompetitive warning screens meant to mislead customers into believing their privacy and financial security are at risk when dealing with Apple competitors. They're imposing a new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores, and intend to surveil all transactions within them using a mandatory reporting API."</p>
<p>He closed on calling the changes "an egregious Apple imposition on distribution and payments they have no involvement with, and a practice the US courts already found to be illegal and upheld on appeal".</p>
<p>"Obviously, real competition won't happen, and consumers won't benefit, when Apple abuses its position between users and competitors to obstruct honest dealing between them," Sweeney concluded. "This is another sad day in the history of relationships between platform makers, developers, and consumers, and we will be raising our complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission."</p>
<p>It's the latest in the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method</a>, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut. The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple in May by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">"in wilful violation" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing"</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney has previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is changing vehicle availability on its Breakthrough maps to improve pacing and "vehicle availability" for attackers and defenders.</p>
<p>The changes, coming first to New Sobek City, are "part of a set of changes across multiple Breakthrough maps", and will be "actively monitor[ed]" to assess how they impact gameplay.</p>

<p>"Over the last few days, we’ve been rolling out a set of changes across multiple Breakthrough maps, starting with our earlier test on New Sobek City," the team explained in a social media post. "These changes are aimed at improving overall pacing and vehicle availability between Attacker and Defenders, and we are actively monitoring how these changes are impacting gameplay."</p> <div>

<p>Interestingly, the team is transparent that these change may not "perform well", but did commit to roll[ing] back some or all of these changes as our focus remains on steadily improving Breakthrough overall".</p>
<p>The team closed on thanking players for their "patience, support, and feedback as we continue to tune the mode", hinted further updates would be coming in the New Year, and wished everyone "happy holidays".</p>
<p>The last big update came earlier this month, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-addresses-primary-community-complaint-improves-hit-registrations-and-netcode-ahead-of-winter-offensive-update">Battlefield 6 received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update</a>, which went live on the 9th December. It's part of the team's wider work to enhance both components of online play and is especially noteworthy, as issues with online netcode and hit registration have been sources of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>This update came shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of its games post-launch were cheater-free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>
