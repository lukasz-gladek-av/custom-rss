            <p>GOG has joined the European Federation of Game Archives, Museums and Preservation Projects (EFGAMP) as it continues to push for game preservation.</p>
<p>The PC game platform is the first Polish institution to join EFGAMP, which was founded in 2012 to represent over 20 organisations focused on collecting and preserving digital games. It's the largest organisation in Europe of its kind.</p>
<p>"GOG was created with video game preservation in mind," said GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski, emphasising the company's game preservation ambitions.</p>

<p>"Classic games and the mission to safeguard them for future generations have always been at the core of our work. Over the past decade, we've honed our expertise in this area. The GOG Preservation Program, which ensures compatibility for over 100 games and delivers hundreds of enhancements, is just one example of this commitment. We were thrilled to see the Program warmly received not only by our players but also by our partners and the gaming industry as a whole."</p><p>He continued: "As a European company, we feel a responsibility to lead in preserving gaming heritage. Joining EFGAMP reinforces this commitment. Our next step is to expand institutional collaboration with museums and governmental and non-governmental organisations worldwide. We hope our experience will contribute meaningfully to their efforts. We are also discussing exciting new game preservation projects, which we look forward to sharing soon."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">Yoshida announced he would leave PlayStation</a> back in November last year. He was the boss of PlayStation Worldwide Studios from 2008 - 2019, after which he was focused on PlayStation's indie developer support.</p>
<p>In 2023, he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-shuhei-yoshida-awarded-bafta-games-fellowship">awarded the BAFTA Games Fellowship</a> for his contributions to the industry.</p> <div>

<p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation," Yoshida said in November, announcing his departure. "And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p><p>"You know, the company's been doing great," he continued. "I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation."</p>
<p>I'm not sure anyone expected him to move into voice acting, though.</p>

            <p>Chinese conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> and Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family are reportedly considering a new venture using a foundation of Ubisoft assets.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture?leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> (paywall), the two companies will create this venture and then move select Ubisoft assets over, with sources close to the matter stating this is an attempt to give Ubisoft's value an overall boost.</p>
<p>Tencent and Ubisoft are said to be in the process of evaluating which assets to include in this venture. "A potential deal would allow Tencent to own a stake in the venture and gain more control over some of Ubisoft’s intellectual properties, while boosting its video game business outside of China," the report reads.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, no final decisions have been made with regard to this alleged venture between Tencent and Ubisoft. However, we already knew Ubisoft was looking at ways to try and increase its value.</p>
<p>As outlined earlier this month, the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry maker has appointed advisors to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". Meanwhile, last October, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Tencent and Ubisoft were considering a buyout</a>. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">similar report was then released in December</a>.</p><p>Last year was a particularly bumpy one for Ubisoft. The company suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, as well as staff walkouts, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">disappointing sales for titles such as Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Ubisoft additionally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulled the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>, and shuttered a number of studios.</p>
<p>In the last week, Ubisoft delayed the next instalment in its Assassin's Creed series - Shadows - once again. The upcoming game was initially due to release in 2024, before its launch was then pushed to 14th February.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Assassin's Creed Shadows will now release on 20th March</a>, Ubisoft announced last week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
