<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has been an enormous success - like, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-fourth-expansion-releases-really-really-soon">a 100m downloads enormous success</a> - so inevitably, there are now other, similar franchises that would like a piece of that action.
</p>
<p>
What other franchise like Pokémon are we talking about? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-had-to-scale-back-a-little-bit-and-hire-security-guards-palworld-developer-reveals-nintendo-lawsuit-reaction">No, not Palworld</a>. (Don't make things worse for yourselves, PocketPair.) We mean, Digimon, of course. 
</p>
<p>
So, here's Digimon Alysion - an upcoming free-to-play online card battler with a slightly odd name that publisher Bandai Namco likely hopes will get just a sniff of Pokémon's success. 
</p>

<p>
Footage of the game shows battles against an opponent where each player has a selection of Digimon, represented by cards, on the field. This is intercut with CGI sequences showing characters gesticulating, Pokémon Trainer-like, at the cards. It's unclear if this is actual gameplay. 
</p>
<p>
From my limited knowledge of Digimon, which is basically watching the anime 15 years ago, I recognised several creatures featured in that original generation of Digimon monsters. Nostalgia!
</p>
<p>
The trailer concludes with the message: "Project Start!" suggesting it still may be some time before Digimon Alysion actually arrives. When it does, its set to pop up on both the iPhone App Store and Google Play for Android.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">Pokémon TCG Pocket announced an overhaul of its much-criticised trading feature</a> following fan backlash - though the changes won't take effect for several months.

            <p><strong>UPDATE 11.45am UK: </strong> Thronefall developer Grizzly Games has responded to the use of its name and logo by the company behind Flight Simulator 2025 - the Microsoft Flight Sim rip-off that uses AI art which Eurogamer spotted via a PlayStation Store listing earlier today.</p>
<p>"Thanks for contacting us and thank you for bringing awareness to this topic," Thronefall developer Paul Schnepf Games said in an email to Eurogamer. "We're not associated with Grizzly Games Ltd. and they're using both our name and logo illegally. 
</p>
<p>"Furthermore they seem to incorporate the absolute opposite of our values, of what we stand for and what we’re trying to give to the gaming community. Unfortunately our legal resources are limited as a two-person indie team, but honestly I'd love to see this kind of stuff being stopped, especially since it's not only happening to us but lots of indie devs that just lack the legal power."</p>
<p>We'll update again if we hear from Sony - or the other Grizzly Games.</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11am UK:</strong> 
Flight Simulator 2025 is now available to Wishlist on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10014255">PlayStation Store</a> - but it's nothing to do with Microsoft. 
</p>
<p>
Trophies for the game caught the eye of Flight Sim fans overnight via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jfkg5q/trophies_live_for_flight_simulator_ps5_that_hasnt/">reddit</a>, though it quickly became clear this wasn't a leak of the actual Flight Sim landing on Sony's console. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Flight Simulator 2025 features what looks like AI-generated art for its cover image, and has been made by a developer named Grizzy Games Limited.
</p>
<p>
A quick search online brings up the <a href="https://www.grizzly-games.com/#games">Grizzly-Games.com website, which features a long list of supposed mobile projects </a> that also feature clearly AI-generated artwork for their title covers. 
</p>
<p>
These mobile games - Idle Command: Supply Frontline, Merge Blocks Magic Numbers, Color Page ASMR: Drawing Art, etc - all have links to download the apps via the Google Play store, but all of these links are broken. It's unclear if these games ever existed.
</p>
<p>
The single game with actual gameplay visible is City Outlet: Store Empire, which looks to be a tycoon game based in a corner of a shopping mall. You can see a trailer of it below:
</p>

<p>
If the name Grizzly Games sounds familiar, then it's because this developer shares its name with the developer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thronefall-kingdom-building-hack-and-slash-and-the-spirit-of-lumines">popular indie action title Thronefall</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the team behind City Outlet: Store Empire and Flight Simulator PS5 is also using the same Grizzly Games logo of the Thronefall team.
</p>
<p>
We've contacted both Grizzly Games for more. We've also contacted Sony, which looks set to imminently launch Flight Simulator 2025 on PlayStation.
</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that a knock-off game has been discovered on the PlayStation Store. What <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-looks-like-a-suika-game-rip-off-set-to-launch-on-playstation">looked like a Suika Game rip-off was set to launch on PlayStation previously</a>. Meanwhile, in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-rubbish-god-of-war-rip-off-on-the-xbox-store">we discovered a rubbish God of War rip-off on the Xbox store</a>. And in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-knock-off-removed-from-nintendo-eshop-as-sony-stakes-copyright-claim">Sony launched a copyright claim against a rip-off of The Last of Us on the Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>
<p>
For now, perhaps hold off a pre-order of Flight Simulator 2025. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">real Microsoft Flight Simulator seems likely to actually turn up on PS5 at some point</a>.

            <p>Jack Black is set to play Steve in A Minecraft Movie, but that wasn't always going to be the case. Originally, Black was actually going to play a talking pig. No porky pies here - really, a talking pig.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/">Variety</a>, Mojang senior director of original content Torfi Frans Ólafsson revealed Black's switch to become Steve happened "very, very, very late" in the game. Ólafsson stated the team "needed an expert and host" in the film, and so Black went from being envisioned as a talking pig to becoming Steve.</p>

<p>Now, if you saw the trailers with Jack Black as Steve, and said to yourself (or even out loud), 'hang on, that isn't Steve! That's just Jack Black in a blue shirt!'. Well, you weren't alone, and the A Minecraft Movie team is aware of those reactions.</p>
<p>"This is not my Steve or your Steve - this is Jack Black's Steve," Ólafsson said of the part. "A lot of fans responded when they saw the first teasers and trailers, like, 'Hey, wait a minute -- this is just Jack Black. This isn't Jack Black being someone else.' And maybe it is, because this is literally him interpreting this character and what it means to him."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Jack-Black-as-minor-Steve-in-A-Minecraft-Movie.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, Ólafsson got the cast and crew Xboxes for the trailers while on set, and booted up private Minecraft servers. The Mojang exec said Black logged over 100 hours on the blocky game, and became "the most passionate player" on set.</p>
<p>"He was just completely manic, hoarding stuff in the mines, searching for lapis lazuli because he liked the way it sounds," Ólafsson told the publication. "He kept saying it: 'Can I talk about lapis lazuli in the movie?'"</p>
<p>So, I guess listen out for mentions of Minecraft's blue mineral when the film releases next month.</p>
<p>To tie in with the upcoming film, the Minecraft team has also made that leaked movie pack for the game official. The  'A Minecraft Movie' in-game Hero Pack will be available from today, 20th March.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>The Minecraft Movie is set to release on 4th April. Along with Black's Steve, the film also stars Jason Momoa as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison.</p>
<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for Netflix back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
