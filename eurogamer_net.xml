            <p>It's been nearly a decade since the first reveal of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-soul-aside-launches-in-2025-nine-years-after-devil-may-cry-and-final-fantasy-15-inspired-action-games-reveal">Devil May Cry and Final Fantasy 15-inspired RPG action game Lost Soul Aside</a>. Now the wait is <em>almost </em>over - though things are now going to take a little longer than expected.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside is still set to debut later this year but - in order to allow for some extra polish and whatnot - it will not arrive quite as soon as initially planned, its developer has said. "To match the standards Ultizero Games have set for ourselves, we are going to take some additional time to polish the game," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3378960/view/507326880609731162?l=latam">Lost Souls Aside game director and studio head Yang Bing explained on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>As such, Lost Soul Aside will now release on 29th August. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-nearly-a-decade-of-development-playstation-published-action-game-gets-a-release-date">initially slated for 30th May</a>, which was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-the-pc-requirements-for-elden-ring-nightreign">same day as Elden Ring's co-op spinoff Nightreign</a>. Bing said the team was "truly grateful" for all those who have responded positively since the game's announcement, and everyone involved wants to make sure Lost Soul Aside releases with a "high-quality game experience" for fans.</p>
<p>The upcoming game is being published by PlayStation, and will be launching across PC and - of course - PS5.</p>
<p>"Embark on an epic odyssey to save your younger sister – and the whole of humanity – from mysterious dimensional invaders from beyond the starlit skies in Lost Soul Aside," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/">official game description over on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>"Run the gauntlet of formidable enemies and colossal bosses in this breathtakingly stylish single player action-adventure RPG; chaining weapon and spectacular attack combos in high-octane, dynamic combat. Adapt your fighting style, solve puzzles, and evolve incredible abilities on a truly heroic quest."</p>

            <p>
Nintendo Switch owners with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepares-for-switch-2-with-original-console-update-adding-gameshare-virtual-game-cards-and-more">the console's latest system update</a> have noted that it is no longer possible to play the same digital game online across two systems simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
Previously, a Switch designated as a primary console could load up a digital game and play online alongside the owner of that game logged in via a second Switch.
</p>
<p>
Now, this "loophole" has been closed, due to the introduction of Nintendo's new Virtual Game Cards system which treats digital games as if they were physical cartridges.
</p>
<p>
Users can still play a single copy of a digital game while playing offline, however. This is possible if you turn on a new  Online Licenses option (buried in your Profile's user settings), which lets you play a digital game even if you don't have the Virtual Game Card - as long as it's not being played elsewhere or, crucially, as long as it is being played elsewhere but on a Switch that is set offline.
</p>
<p>
"If this option is enabled, purchased digital software will be playable while the console is connected to the internet, even when the virtual game card for that software isn't loaded to the console," Nintendo's explanation of the Online License setting states. 
</p>
<p>
"However, when using an online licence, only the user signed int to the Nintendo Account that was used to purchase the software will be able to play it, it will not be playable for other users on the console. Your virtual game cards can be used to play software regardless of this setting. Online licences cannot be used on multiple consoles at the same time. The online licence and virtual game card for a software title cannot be used at the same time."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has tested this for ourselves, and confirmed this system is now in place.
</p>
<p>For instance, if console A shares a virtual game card with console B, only console B can access the game when both consoles are online. However, with the Online Licenses option switched on, if console B plays the game offline, console A is unable to tell if the game is being played and will still allow access.</p>

<p>
Reacting to the changes, fans on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-now-blocks-playing-the-same-game-online-on-two-switchs-simultaneously.1177164/page-3">ResetEra</a> have a mixed response. "So Virtual Game Cards are a downgrade," wrote one user. 
</p>
<p>
"A major downgrade," wrote another. "My wife and I played hundreds of hours of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and Animal Crossing together off of a single digital purchase."
</p>
<p>
"You can play online while game sharing on PS and Xbox," noted a third. 
</p>
<p>
Another new feature added in today's Switch system update is GameShare, which will alleviate this change somewhat - but only for select games on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
GameShare lets you play supported software with a nearby Switch 2 owner, including on a Switch 1. But support for this will be on a game-per-game basis - and will require a Switch 2. So it won't help anyone looking to continue sharing Splatoon 3 or Animal Crossing on Switch 1 in the same way.
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is now just over a month from launch - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/someones-already-beaten-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-on-switch-2-a-month-before-the-console-is-available">someone has already beaten the new version of Zelda: Breath of the Wild already</a> at a demo event. Fans have also discovered that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">many third-party physical Switch 2 games do not actually have the game on the card</a>, and will still require a download.

            <p>Gearbox's Borderlands 4 got its release date moved up yesterday, but this wasn't because of anything to do with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. Oh no, sir.</p>
<p>As announced yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Borderlands 4 will now release on 12th September</a>, which is just over a week earlier than originally planned. Many surmised this was a tactic to make sure that the launches of Borderlands 4 and GTA 6 - both franchises under the Take-Two umbrella - were spaced further apart.</p>
<p>However, this <em>honestly </em>isn't the case, so says Gearbox's Randy Pitchford.</p>

<p>According to the Gearbox head, this date shift is "100 percent" down to the studio's "confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates".</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966">Writing on social media</a>, Pitchford said: "Our decision is literally zero percent about any other product's actual or theoretical launch date."</p>
<p>So, that clears that up, then.</p>
<p>We will learn more about the next series entry later today, when PlayStation hosts its dedicated Borderlands 4 State of Play. Things are kicking off at 10pm UK time, and Eurogamer will of course cover the news as and when.</p>
<p>On its release, Borderlands 4 will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">Steam and the Epic Games Store at the same time</a>). It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">introduce four new Vault Hunters</a> on its release, alongside a new horde known as the Rippers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>To celebrate its fourth anniversary, Housemarque has released a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> patch for sci-fi shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>.</p>
<p>The patch, out now, promises up to 2.5x the pixels on the more powerful console for a higher resolution experience. Presumably that's aiming for native 4K rather than the upscale solution employed on the base console, though that hasn't been specified.</p>
<p>It's unknown if the patch makes any other tweaks. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-returnals-pc-port-is-good-but-it-could-be-great">PC version of the game</a>, released in 2023, already boosts performance over PS5.</p>

<p>Returnal was released in 2021 and is generally considered one of the best and most unique games on Sony's PS5. The roguelite shooter sees protagonist Selene trapped in an endless cycle on a hostile, alien planet.</p>
<p>A year after its release, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-wins-big-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">won big at the 2022 BAFTA Game Awards</a>, winning the Best Game award and a performance award for Jane Perry.</p> <div>

<p>Following Returnal's release, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque">Housemarque was acquired by Sony</a> as part of its PlayStation Studios first-party operation.</p>
<p>At Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play in February</a>, the developer revealed its next project: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returnal-studio-heads-to-a-hostile-shape-shifting-planet-for-newly-unveiled-saros">Saros</a>.</p>
<p>It's once again set on a "hostile, shape-shifting planet" and features British actor Rahul Kohli in the lead role. PS5 Pro enhancements for the new game have been promised, so this update to Returnal bodes well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
