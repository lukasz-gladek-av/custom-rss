            <p>NetEase is reportedly pulling back on its international game investments.</p>
<p>The Chinese megacorp's backtrack commenced at the end of last year when it cut jobs and/or "paused" productions at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-infinite-head-of-designs-netease-studio-halting-work-on-first-game-as-it-searches-for-new-publisher">Jar of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">Liquid Sword</a>, but now <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">Game File</a> reports the company is "actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios" in the hope of divestiture.</p>

<p>Sources talking to Game File under the promise of anonymity claim NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams. If they can't secure a buyer, studios like Quantic Dream and Grasshopper Manufacture could face closure.</p>
<p>Other studios at risk include Anchor Point, GPTRACK50, Jackalyptic Games, Nagoshi, Pincool, Rebel Wolves, Skybox Labs, Studio Flare, T-Minus Zero Entertainment, and more.</p>
<p>NetEase declined to comment formally but told Game File: "All studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation, and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Matt reported that Marvel Rivals - which has been a huge success for publisher NetEase since its launch last year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-was-reportedly-almost-cancelled-at-one-point-because-netease-objected-to-paying-disney">reportedly almost didn't make it to release</a> as its CEO objected to paying Disney for the use of its characters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
