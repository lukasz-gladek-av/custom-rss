            <p>If you cast your minds back to last year, you may recall <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2024s-best-april-fools-day-jokes-includes-sonic-cyberpunk-elden-ring">Pocketpair releasing a trailer for a dating sim spin-off called "Pal‚ô°world! ~More Than Just Pals~"</a>. This was all part of some good ol' fashioned April Fools Day fun‚Ä¶ or was it?</p>
<p>Earlier today, the developer released another trailer for Pal‚ô°world! ~More Than Just Pals~, and I have to say, it seems to be the real deal, complete with a sales page and all.</p>

<p>"You, the protagonist, enrol as a transfer student in the prestigious Palagos Private Academy," reads the official blurb on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/">game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>"You will meet unique friends (pals) and enjoy school life through friendship and romance. It's up to you whether you stay friends with the pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them."</p>
<p>I reached out to Pocketpair community manager John "Bucky" Buckley, and he assured me that if I covered today's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> trailer I would not get egg on my face. So, here I am covering it.</p>
<p>Pal‚ô°world! ~More Than Just Pals~ doesn't have a release date as yet, although Bucky told me it won't be tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, will you be snuggling up to Pal‚ô°world! ~More Than Just Pals~ on its release?</p>

</p><p>Elsewhere in the news, Bucky previously revealed the Palworld team would have happily seen its monster-catching survival game on the OG Switch, but due to how "beefy" Palworld is, it wasn't able to find a home on Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>This may change for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-being-sued-by-nintendo-says-switch-2-port-still-possible">providing the next generation of Nintendo's consoles has the ability to handle the chonky game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A previously announced RoboCop VR title has been kiboshed after it transpired that the game wasn't officially licensed before its reveal.</p>
<p>RoboCop: Streets of Anarchy, as it was known, was a VR game based on the sci-fi film which <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/robocop-streets-of-anarchy-vr-quest-3-pc/">first made the rounds earlier this month</a>, when it appeared on developer Coffee Moth Games' website.</p>
<p>At this time, the game was said to be being created in partnership with Amazon-MGM and would promise an "original narrative and complex storylines interwoven with bombastic action".</p>

<p>However, fast forward a couple of weeks, and those promises are going to have to be left unfulfilled, as it turns out RoboCop: Streets of Anarchy wasn't actually officially licensed before its reveal.</p>
<p>An Amazon MGM representative told <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/robocop-streets-of-anarchy-not-officially-licenced/">UploadVR</a> the company never actually entered into any agreement with Coffee Moth Games. "Furthermore, Amazon MGM advised that RoboCop isn't officially licensed with that studio, and the official website page for Streets of Anarchy has since been removed," UploadVR continued.</p>
<p>The publication had previously been in contact with Coffee Moth Games, and a representative from the studio revealed they're actually an outsourcing company with no direct relationship to Amazon MGM. However, "the company responsible for contracting the rights from Amazon MGM contacted us for the game's development," the representative said.</p> <div>

As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-smashes-crowdfunding-goal-in-less-than-a-day">hugely successful crowdfunding campaign</a> nears its conclusion, Ukrainian developer Frogwares has announced a fresh bit of business for its Lovecraft-inspired open-world detective series: the original game is being remastered in Unreal Engine 5.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares' first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> instalment released in 2019, telling the story of private investigator Charles Reed as he travelled to the flooded city of Oakmont, Massachusetts, in search of a way to quell his hellish visions. As you might expect, cosmic horrors ensued.
</p>
<p>
Six years on and Frogwares' newly announced The Sinking City remaster will take the Unreal Engine 4 original and shift it to Unreal Engine 5, promising an "upgraded visual experience alongside some requested quality-of-life features". It will, for instance, be fully relit in the new engine, with locations gaining "additional levels of detail and objects". There's also a new Photo Mode, 4K textures, improved reflections, and support for DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling.

And that's not all; fans are being invited to lend their vocal talents to the remaster by <a href="https://tally.so/r/wQOPMY">submitting a voice recording saying "yes"</a> in whatever manner they choose. 100 randomly selected entries will be transformed into a chanting choir - one with a particular fondness for Yog-Sothoth - and will see their names featured in the credits.
</p>
<p>
As for The Sinking City 2, it's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">crowdfunding campaign</a> is set to draw to a close this Friday, 4th April. At the time of writing, it's sailed past its original ¬£83K pledge target, raising over ¬£347K. Frogwares has said the survival horror sequel will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">shift away from the investigation focus of its predecessor</a>, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around.
