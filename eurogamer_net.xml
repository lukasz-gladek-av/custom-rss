            <p>Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>The DLC will make its debut later this month, on 15th July, via Steam. Ark: Aquatica will submerge players under the waters, tasking them with "new survival mechanics, extreme environmental hazards, a huge explorable map area, and unique gameplay elements".</p>
<p>It will additionally introduce 21 new tameable creatures, as well as 74 new Engrams (including 7 tek Engrams), and "underwater survival thanks to things like air pockets and propulsion vehicles". </p>
<p>Perhaps feeling a sense of 'once bitten, twice shy' due to those AI slop accusations from earlier this year, the developer has released a really very, <em>very</em> brief release date teaser for the upcoming expansion, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Snail Games and Ark: Aquatica made headlines back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">when a trailer released during GDC was clearly AI-generated</a>.</p>
<p>The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured things like a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team. "They took our assets and then ran them through an AI to animate them. That was marketing," lead game designer Matt Kohl said in March.</p>
<p>At this time, Kohl stated: "There has been no AI use in development of Aquatica."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-accusations-of-ai-slop-ark-aquaticas-release-date-trailer-is-playing-it-very-safe]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo is ending its Switch Game Voucher service in January next year, the company announced today.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers, for those unaware, are a special offer for Nintendo Switch Online members, which can be purchased in a set of two, and are used to save on games.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">members can purchase two vouchers for £84.00</a>, and redeem them against Switch games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which retail individually for £59.99 each. Buying these games on their own would come to £119.98, but if vouchers were used to make these purchases, users would save £35.98. (Vouchers can not be used for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> titles.)</p>
<p>However, the popular service is set to end next year, on 30th January, and after this time, vouchers will no longer be available to purchase. Any vouchers purchased prior to 30th January 2026 will remain valid for 12 months, and Nintendo has said Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p>
<p>Nintendo has not said if it will introduce a similar offer for Switch 2 games down the line. You can find more information on Switch vouchers, and the end of the service, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NintendoSwitchOnline|NULL|NSOGameVoucherDiscountinuationAN|m_id_SnUV8HHzNg|1560656">via Nintendo</a>. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many are disappointed to hear of Nintendo's decision to end its Switch Game Voucher service. "Well this is sad," <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1943222381528395877/quotes">reads one of many social media posts</a> following today's announcement.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>After January 30th, 2026, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch</a> Game Vouchers will no longer be sold. Any Game Vouchers bought will remain valid for 12 months after purchase. Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p><p>More info: <a href="https://t.co/IKXcmMwWW0">https://t.co/IKXcmMwWW0</a></p></div>— Nintendo UK (@NintendoUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1943222381528395877?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

            <p>The infamous stapler used by GameStop that ruined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch day for some customers has now been put up for auction.</p>
<p>As we reported previously, one retail store in New York was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-ends-in-disappointment-for-some-as-major-retailer-accidentally-staples-receipts-into-consoles-screen">stapling customers' receipts to the console's packaging</a>, damaging screens in the process.</p>
<p>Now - in an offer of goodwill, but also something of a publicity stunt - GameStop has put the stapler up for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731">auction on eBay</a>, with proceeds benefitting Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a charity founded over 40 years ago, and has raised over $9bn for 170 children's hospitals.</p>

<p>The stapler is being offered alongside a Switch 2 console and a certificate of authenticity for the bundle.</p>
<p>Reads the certificate: "The black stapler used by a GameStop associate who, in a moment of launch night excitement and misjudged enthusiasm, stapled a receipt directly to a customer's new Nintendo Switch 2 box - puncturing both cardboard and screen in one swift motion. Features authentic field-use wear throughout and retired immediately from service, the stapler now stands as a retail legend born from a half-second decision."</p>
<p>The included console is also the first to be stapled, though GameStop assures the screen has been repaired. It will arrive in the original, stapled packaging, and also include the actual staple "carefully extracted and preserved".</p>
<p>As per eBay, the item is in "used" condition: "The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended." At the time of writing, the auction stands at almost $109K, with another six days until it ends.</p>
<p>Following the launch day incident, GameStop stated staplers "have been confiscated" and that their use was "isolated to one store".</p>

<p>Despite this stapling incident, the Switch 2 launch was a success for Nintendo. With 3.5m units sold worldwide in its first four days on sale, it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware ever</a>.</p>
<p>And if children are unable to afford a Switch 2, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-president-says-children-should-engage-with-its-characters-elsewhere-if-they-cant-afford-a-switch-2">plenty of other ways for them to engage with Nintendo characters</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-ruining-stapler-now-up-for-online-charity-auction-by-gamestop]]></content:encoded>
