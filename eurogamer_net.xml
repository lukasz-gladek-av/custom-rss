            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Following the casting news for Nintendo's upcoming Legend of Zelda film, Google has added a sweet little Easter egg.</p>
<p>The Easter egg appears, at least on mobile, when you search for the Link and Zelda actors. That's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason respectively</a>. Typing in those actors' names into your search bar will throw up all the expected bits and pieces you would expect - their wikipedia pages, social media accounts, a selection of images and so forth - but also a little nod to their latest castings.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to discover the Easter egg for yourself, please head elsewhere now to avoid it being spoiled.</strong></p>

<p>Right, to the Easter egg. If you search for Zelda actress Bragason, a little note now appears at the top of the page which reads: "Well excuse me, Princess." A little female elf emoji also shows.</p>
<p>This is a nod to Link's catchphrase in the animated Legend of Zelda series, where in a change from the game's the hero actually talks. This expression has become a bit of a meme, often used to respond to criticism (Link often said it to Zelda when she was pointing out some kind of flaw).</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Excuse me, Princess!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPxY8lpYAUM?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Excuse me, Princess!</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPxY8lpYAUM?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FPxY8lpYAUM?autoplay=1" title="Excuse me, Princess!">

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Excuse me, Princess! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPxY8lpYAUM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Meanwhile, when you search for Link actor Evan Ainsworth, you will notice that rather than a fully coherent bit of dialogue a la 'Well excuse me, Princess', you will instead see a message that reads: "KYAAAA! HYAAAAA!" A little male elf emoji sits next to this. This is clearly meant to represent the noises of exertion Link makes as he slashes his way through the various foes and dungeons in Hyrule (or, Termina/Koholint/etc).</p>
<p>Of course, Link in the game's famously does not speak, and some titles in the series have given a reason for his muteness. In Legend of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, for example, Link can read Zelda's diary when making his way through Hyrule Castle. In her writings, the princess said she had slowly managed to get Link to open up to her, but he "feels it necessary to stay strong and to silently bear any burden". This "has caused him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings", Zelda writes.</p>
<p>"I always believed him to be simply a gifted person who had never faced a day of hardship. How wrong I was..." the Breath of the Wild diary reads. "Everyone has struggles that go unseen by the world... I was so absorbed with my own problems, I failed to see his. I wish to talk with him more and to see what lies beneath those calm waters, to hear him speak freely and openly... And perhaps I, too, will be able to bare my soul to him and share the demons that have plagued me all these years."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a>, Zelda can come across a journal entry written by Impa's brother, Lueburry. Here, Lueburry explains that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-famously-mute-link-almost-spoke-in-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Link was "one of the kids" who had been "stolen away" by the strange rifts that had opened up across Hyrule</a>, setting in motion much of the game. According to this entry, "all of the kids taken by the rifts" had lost something, and in Link's case, this was his ability to speak.</p>

<p>It therefore makes sense that Google's nod to Evan Ainsworth's new role isn't a full blown bit of dialogue. I now just wonder how the film's writers will handle this same particular obstacleâ€¦</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has inserted a stub about its wider business statistics and annual fiscal performance in the description of a recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> update trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer, which showcases the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-will-get-third-person-mode-in-free-update-ahead-of-new-film">free third-person update coming to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> ahead of the launch of the upcoming films. Slapped into the video description is a section titled "About Ubisoft", which goes on to note various IPs and the Ubisoft Plus subscription service.</p>
<p>This is an odd thing to find in a video description for a game update, especially on a consumer-facing video. Typically, this sort of info stub is written directly for those on dedicated business pages, investor information blogs, and the like.</p>

<p>The full section reads as follows: "Ubisoft is a creator of worlds, committed to enriching playersâ€™ lives with original and memorable entertainment experiences. Ubisoftâ€™s global teams create and develop a deep and diverse portfolio of games, featuring brands such as Assassinâ€™s CreedÂ®, BrawlhallaÂ®, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>Â®, Far CryÂ®, Tom Clancyâ€™s Ghost ReconÂ®, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/just-dance">Just Dance</a>Â®, RabbidsÂ®, Tom Clancyâ€™s Rainbow SixÂ®, The CrewÂ® and Tom Clancyâ€™s The DivisionÂ®.</p>
<p>"With a Ubisoft+ subscription, players can access new releases, premium editions and extra content on Day One on PC, console and cloud. For the 2024-25 fiscal year, Ubisoft generated net bookings of â‚¬1.85 billion. To learn more, please visit: <a href="http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/">www.ubisoftgroup.com</a>."</p>
<p>That being said, now's the time for Ubisoft to start promoting its business acumen. The company took on a substantial amount of investment from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">to form a new business housing its most popular IPs</a>, following a low period for the French industry giant. This new business <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">recently revealed Charlie Guillemot as its head</a>, son of Ubisoft co-founder Yves Guillemot.</p>
<p>Statements from Ubisoft in recent days have also raised some eyebrows. The company suggested it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suggests-to-shareholders-a-new-ghost-recon-game-is-on-the-way-even-though-theres-been-no-public-announcement-yet"> working on a new Ghost Recon game to shareholders</a>, though no public announcement for any such game has been made yet. Ubisoft also stated it believes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reckons-microtransactions-help-make-games-more-fun-but-still-wants-to-ensure-they-respect-the-player-experience">microtransactions make games "more fun" in a recent financial report</a>.</p>
<p>All the while, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-moving-some-of-our-biggest-productions-into-2026-and-2027-after-positive-impact-of-assassins-creed-shadows-delay">Ubisoft has moved some of its bigger projects to 2026 and 2027</a> following the boons granted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadow's</a> delay. So the company is seemingly steering its way towards greener pastures than it found itself in over the past few years.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/for-some-bizarre-reason-ubisoft-has-planted-company-fiscal-info-a-trailer-for-its-new-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> actor Charlie Cox has vowed to play the game after all the praise he's received, despite only spending four hours in the recording booth and knowing very little about it.</p>
<p>The actor, known for his roles in Daredevil and Stardust, voices Gustave in Sandfall Interactive's well-praised RPG. But Cox hasn't played a game since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>"I remember being in the studio and thinking, 'this is beautiful, the visuals are extraordinary'," Cox said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHK8HD2scfY">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon</a> in New Orleans. "They've come a long way since Mario 64, which is probably the last computer game I played."</p>

<p>Previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">Cox revealed he recorded most of his lines for the game in a single four hour session</a> and now feels "like a total fraud". He reiterated this point at GalaxyCon after being confused by a fan question, as he's unfamiliar with the full game.</p>
<p>"I wanna play the game," he said. "I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game."</p>
<p>When the fan told him he did a fantastic job, he replied: "People keep telling me that and I feel like a fraud because I just did the voice."</p>

            <p>The voice actors for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Toads and Peach have been announced, following the surprise recasting of Samantha Kelly last month.</p>
<p>Back in June, Kelly - who had voiced Toad and Princess Peach for 18 years - revealed she would no longer be providing their vocals for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> era. This came as a surprise to Kelly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-voice-actor-confirms-shes-been-replaced-after-18-years-in-the-role">who was only informed by Nintendo when Mario Kart World released without her name attached to the project</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them," Kelly said at the time. "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I'm sad that it's over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever."</p>
<p>Now, Mario Kart World's Toads and Peach's new voice actors have been revealed, and they are played by Paul Castro Jr. and Courtney Lin respectively. Castro Jr.has also lent his vocals to the likes of NEO: The World Ends with You, while Lin's previous credits include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>.</p>

<p>Sharing the news, <a href="https://x.com/PaulCastroJr/status/1947503212095017462">Castro Jr. called the role of Mario Kart World's Toads a "childhood dream"</a>, adding he "can't thank Nintendo enough" for the opportunity. The VA added in a subsequent post that he voices the Toads out and about in the world, rather than the playable Toad. "The 'playable' Toad is another VA who I'm sure will announce themselves at some point presumably," Castro Jr. explained.</p>
<p>Lin, meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/thecourtneylin/status/1947399822946013624">said she was "eternally grateful" to Nintendo for "trusting me to help carry the legacy of this icon"</a>. Lin also voiced Baby Peach in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"These characters are so much bigger than ourselves. I am so honoured and honestly can still hardly believe it. I have so much respect for all of the Peaches that came before me, especially the one I grew up with," Lin continued. "I will do my best with every opportunity I am given, and I hope you all have been enjoying the game. Wahooo!! Sweet."</p>
