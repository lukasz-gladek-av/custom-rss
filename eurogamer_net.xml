            <p>
Arcane fans have a five-minute animated treat to enjoy today, in the shape of a new story cinematic released by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> maker Riot Games. 
</p>
<p>
The video is primarily designed to showcase Noxus, the setting for League of Legends' new season which begins tomorrow, and the home of prominent character Mel Medarda.
</p>
<p>
But the video is simultaneously also a continuation of Mel's storyline from Arcane itself, and seems to set up what we may see next in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-cinematic-universe-to-expand-with-three-more-league-of-legends-animated-series">Arcane's upcoming Noxus-based continuation</a>. And if you need further reason to watch, the cinematic was created in partnership with Fortiche, the talented French animation house behind Arcane. Here it is:

<p>
First off, we can tell this is absolutely set after Arcane's second season due to Mel's new golden tattoos she acquires during its storyline. 
</p>
<p>
Here, we also get a proper look at LeBlanc, leader of the Black Rose group, who popped up within Arcane's second season but stayed largely disguised. She's seen here chatting with Vladimir, another League of Legends champion, about some unscrupulous-sounding plans for the Noxian empire.
</p><p>Following the conclusion of Arcane, showrunner Christian Linke confirmed the series would be followed by three additional shows featuring other locations within the League of Legends world. The first, set in Noxus, began production a year ago - and today's cinematic almost feels like a first trailer for that. Other series will then feature the regions of Demacia and Ionia.
</p>
<p>"We're really going wide, we're looking at every region and we really now have the ability to build a slate to tell many more stories - and continue some of them," Linke said previously.</p>
<p>If you haven't watched Arcane yet, it remains one of the best video game adaptations of all time and requires zero prior knowledge regarding League of Legends itself. Its first season is flawless, while its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">second was marred slightly from pacing issues due it cramming so many story threads in</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-film-gets-positive-update-more-than-10-years-after-its-director-was-first-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>10 years after he was first attached to the project, It and The Flash director Andr√©s Muschietti says he still has plans for Sony's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> film adaptation.</p>
<p>The Shadow of the Colossus film has been, it is fair to say, a long time coming. We first got wind of an adaptation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-in-works">all the way back in 2009</a>, when it was suggested that creator Fumito Ueda would be involved in some capacity. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-developing-shadow-of-the-colossus-movie">Chronicle director Josh Trank then joined the project in 2012</a>, but this still didn't seem to kick the film into any sort of gear. The following year, Sony then hired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-hires-hanna-writer-for-shadow-of-the-colossus-film">Hanna writer Seth Lochhead to pen the script for the adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, it was then revealed Trank had left the project to head to a galaxy far, far away instead (nothing sinister, just Star Wars). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-now-helmed-by-mama-director">Muschietti was announced to be taking over the reins from Trank</a>. But, like I said, that was in 2014. So, it has been over a decade since Muschietti was first brought on to direct the still non-existent Shadow of the Colossus film.</p>

</figure>
<p>And yet there is still hope, despite a very long period of absolutely no news whatsoever. Muschietti has now said he still has plans for the adaptation, and there is a script. In a conversation with programme <a href="https://youtu.be/Tugk5mzMHqM?t=2670">"La Baulera del Coso"</a> on Radio TU, Muschietti assured listeners the film was not "an abandoned project by any means" (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-is-alive-and-has-a-script/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"I'm not a big gamer, but Shadow of the Colossus seems to me a masterpiece and I played it several times," Muschietti said. "The film has been in development for 10 years and now the possibility of making it is opening up."</p>
<p>Muschietti stated he likes the project's script "very much", but admitted there were still a number of hurdles that needed to be sorted before the film could really get going. Namely, the financial side of things.</p>
<p>"Shadow of the Colossus is a cult game, but to make a good film, there is a studio that puts the numbers and says how much it is worth to give the director $200m, $150m, or $100m," he said. "There are different versions of the film, and obviously, I want them to give me $200m, but this is another factor to take into account."</p>
<p>So, I guess with this update, it is now a case of once again waiting to see if Muschietti gets the funds he hopes for, and then perhaps the Shadow of the Colossus adaptation will finally begin filming.</p>
<p>Shadow of the Colossus is not the only PlayStation IP currently slated for a film release. Just yesterday, the company announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">adaptations of both Helldivers 2 and Horizon Zero Dawn</a>. Meanwhile, its Until Dawn film is set to release this April, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-film-wont-feature-the-same-characters-or-even-the-same-story-as-the-game-its-based-on">new cast of characters taking center stage in a brand new story</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In the UK today, McDonalds is finally launching its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> themed Happy Meals.</p>
<p>Though available already in other regions prior to the film's release in December, in the UK the meals will be available from today until 18th February.</p>
<p>The included toy also differs. In the US the meals include a plastic character figure in a rolling wheel, while in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHenBg5IGyg">UK it's fabric balls with character faces</a>.</p>

<p>Those characters are Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Shadow, as well as (<em>slight </em>spoiler!) Super Sonic and Super Shadow.</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/mcdonald-s-plastic-toys-happy-meal-b1924440.html">McDonalds is phasing out plastic toys</a> by the end of 2025 to focus on eco-friendly toys made from renewable and recycled materials.</p>

</span></p><p>Of course, this is far from the first time McDonalds has featured Sonic-themed toys in its Happy Meals.</p>
<p>In 1995 a promotion was launched to celebrate Mega Drive game Sonic the Hedgehog 3 - I distinctly remember never receiving a Sonic toy and instead repeatedly getting a terrible Tails that wouldn't fly.</p>
<p>Other collaborations include mini handheld games in the 00s made by Fisher-Price, as well as a set of toys in conjunction with the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a> film.</p>
<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film has been a huge success for Sega over the Christmas period. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-film-franchise-surpasses-1bn-in-global-box-office-revenue">film franchise has now surpassed $1bn at the global box office</a>.</p>
<p>"Sega and Paramount more closely align game and film worlds for an authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
