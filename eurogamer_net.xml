We <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-season-2-drops-in-2025-but-firm-release-details-price-and-games-all-still-to-be-finalised">already knew it was coming</a>, but Playdate - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">cute boutique handheld console with the crank</a> - has just announced its second second of games, and one of those is a brand-new project from the massively acclaimed studio behind FTL and Into the Breach.
</p>
<p>
As announced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4faUwfDw5o">during Playdate's latest showcase</a>, FTL developer Subset Games' <a href="https://play.date/games/fulcrum-defender/">Fulcrum Defender</a> is "totally different" to the studio's earlier titles, and sees players attempting to survive for as long as possible while holding back wave after wave of incoming enemies. Aiming utilises the crank as foes approach from all sides on the radar-like screen, with attack patterns growing more complex over time. As things progress, upgrades such as new weapons can be unlocked, with the key to survival being a "smart build and good aim".
</p>
<p>
"I wanted to make a replayable experience that starts off slow and relaxing, but gradually ramps up until it becomes frantic chaos," primary developer Jay Ma explained of Fulcrum Defender in today's Playdate announcement. "Originally I did not plan on finishing this game, I was making it as a form of self-therapy. I have been struggling with Long COVID... and I wanted to prove to myself that I could still make games in my current state."

<p>
Fulcrum Defender is one of 12 new games coming to Playdate as part of Season Two, with three more having so far been revealed in detail. There's developer Pixel Ghost's <a href="https://play.date/games/shadowgate-pd/">Shadowgate PD</a>, for instance, which reimagines the classic point-and-click adventure series with new music, art, and features. It follows players - in the role of The Seed of Prophecy - as they travel deep into the titular living castle in a bid to defeat the evil Warlock Lord who resides there.
</p>
<p>
That's alongside <a href="https://play.date/games/taria-and-como/">Taria &amp; Como</a>, a physics-based puzzle platformer built around swinging rather than jumping. Developed by Popseed Studio Inc and JuVee Productions, it charts the adventures of Taria, a young girl with a prosthetic leg, who sets out to rescue her sister Como in a world that constantly underestimates her.
</p>
<p>
And finally for the full reveals, there's <a href="https://play.date/games/dig-dig-dino/">Dig! Dig! Dino!</a>, from Dom 2D (Flinthook) &amp; Fáyer (Arco). This one casts players as a crew of palaeontologists in a game about digging for dinosaurs bones, analysing strange artefacts, and uncovering long-buried secrets. "Sell off coins and treasure to build an arsenal of digging tools," explains its announcement, "then upgrade them to go deeper and find even more bones and loot!"
</p>
<p>
Playdate's second season <a href="http://play.date/games">costs $39 USD</a> and will see two of its 12 included games release each week between 29th May and 3rd July. There's also a tease for a "must-see surprise" that'll be "something a little different". Season Two's remaining eight games will be properly revealed at a later date, but their titles and developers have been announced as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Chance's Lucky Escape - Developed by Goloso Games (Spike II: The Great Emu War) and Julia</li>
<li>Minamata (The Crimson Diamond)</li>
<li>Otto's Galactic Groove - Developed by Team Otto (Skwish)</li>
<li>Catchadiablos - Developed by Amano Games (Pullfrog Deluxe)</li>
<li>The Whiteout - Developed by Scenic Route Software (Post Hero, Generations)</li>
<li>Black Hole Havoc - Developed by Cosmic Bros (Jolly Chimp Champ)</li>
<li>Wheelsprung - Developed by Nino van Hooff (Gravity Express) and Julie Bjørnskov (Escape the Arcade)</li>
<li>Tiny Turnip - Developed by Luke Sanderson (Paper Pilot)</li>
<li>Long Puppy - Developed by Indiana-Jonas (Surmount)</li>
<li>▀▄▀▄▀▄ - Developed by Dustin Mierau (Playmaker, Path, Napster)</li>
</ul>
<p>
And if you haven't yet picked up a Playdate, they're now <a href="http://shop.play.date/">readily available on creator Panic Inc's store</a> for $229 USD, with refurbished units costing $179. A new cover in the same shade of yellow as the Playdate has also been released for $34 - just be aware those prices don't include shipping or taxes, which can be pretty substantial outside the US.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-sued-for-allegedly-selling-charli-xcx-dance-without-permission-and-its-like-the-last-five-years-never-happened<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Back when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> was getting properly big, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-princes-carlton-sues-fortnite-for-copying-his-legendary-dance">Carlton from the Fresh Prince famously tried to sue Epic Games</a> for the use of his dance in the game. (You could also buy the Carlton dance in Destiny, I remember, which I absolutely did, but I suppose Fortnite had just become the biggest game on the planet at the time.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Carlton - real name Alfonso Ribeiro - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-dance-litigation-crumbles-as-alfonso-ribeiro-refused-carlton-dance-copyright">was ultimately unsuccessful, as were a handful of other similar cases</a>. But whether because of the bad publicity or actual legal concerns, Fortnite pretty quickly cleaned up its act. Today it's home to countless dance emotes, music tracks and other bits and pieces, all agreed legally and above board.
</p>
<p>
But now, six years on from Carlton vs Fortnite, we have the maker of the Charli XCX Apple dance vs Roblox. The former has alleged that the latter sold their dance without permission, raking in roughly $123k (£93k) in sales. Has no one learned anything over the past half decade?
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/559582/charli-xcx-apple-dance-roblox-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, Apple dance creator and copyright holder Kelly Heyer began legal action this week. Heyer originally posted the dance on TikTok last summer, and it was correctly licensed by Fortnite and added to that game last December. 
</p>
<p>
Roblox, according to Heyer, added the emote last August after contacting her to gain permission, but before the permission was actually granted. 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox moved forward using Kelley's IP without a signed agreement," Heyer's attorney Miki Anzai said. "Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement."
</p>
<p>
Charli XCX herself, by the way, does not seem to be getting involved. The artist has used the dance on tour, but was not part of its creation. 
</p>
<p>
"As the Apple Dance emote comprises solely of the Apple Dance choreography, completely separate and distinct from the Charli XCX song, the sole 'artist' for purposes of the emote is Ms. Heyer," the TikTok creator's lawsuit reads.
</p>
<p>
Responding to the lawsuit, a Roblox spokesperson said the game took "the protection of intellectual property very seriously and is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of independent developers and creators to brands and artists both on and off the platform". 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox is confident in its position and the propriety of its dealings in this matter and looks forward to responding in court."
</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">parents who were "not comfortable" about their children's safety shouldn't let them play Roblox</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
