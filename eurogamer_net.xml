            <p>Switch 2 editions of both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a> will include a number of new features, including achievements.</p>
<p>Both games are getting Switch 2 editions on the console's release, which will boast things like improved visuals and loading times, as well as a second save slot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on the Nintendo Switch Online app (which is being rebranded Nintendo Switch app later next month), users will be able to access Zelda Notes. Zelda Notes is a "new feature that can help you get even more out of your adventures in Hyrule", and is "designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience".</p>

<p>Zelda Notes looks pretty nifty, I have to say. It will include things like a voiced navigation guide, all-new voice memories which were not in the original games (with Breath of the Wild having Zelda's memos, and Rauru also confirmed to be chirping up in Tears of the Kingdom), and autobuild sharing in Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the My Play Data section will keep track of achievement-like medals, which players can earn for doing things such as traveling a great distance across Hyrule, defeating enemies, scooping up those precious rupees, and so on and so forth. Medal names included things like "Monster's Bane", "Treasure Hunter", and "Citizen of Hyrule".</p>
<p>You can then compare your various achievements with others via the Global Play Data section. The Achievements section here has headers such as "Locations Visited" and "Quests and Adventures Cleared".</p>
<p>You can check out the full video breaking down the Switch 2 editions of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom below. I now wonder if this will open up the door for more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> to get achievements. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed the battery life for its upcoming console, the Switch 2.</p>
<p>After a rather choc full Direct yesterday, which gave us a look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-first-dual-mouse-mode-game-is-wheelchair-basketball-drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">Mario Kart World</a>, a few more little titbits of information have started making the rounds. This includes the console's all important battery life.</p>

<p>As shared on a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">separate spec sheet for Switch 2</a>, Nintendo's next console will house a Lithium ion battery, with a battery capacity of 5220 mAh. Meanwhile, its battery life is "Approx. 2 - 6.5 hours". Nintendo notes this is just an "estimate" life span, and adds "the battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions".</p>
<p>While Nintendo itself doesn't go into specifics about which games it is referring to here, it is fair to assume that playing a smaller indie game on a pleasant spring afternoon with a mild breeze blowing will see the console lasting longer in its handheld mode than if you were having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">a full blown battle in Elden Ring</a> during a 40°C heatwave.</p>
<p>Charging time for the console, meanwhile, is approximately three hours while in sleep mode.</p>
<p>To compare the upcoming Switch 2's battery life to other Switch devices, here's what <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-Long-Does-the-Battery-Charge-Last-1630015.html#:~:text=Once%20fully%20charged%2C%20the%20battery,approximately%204.5%20to%209%20hours.">Nintendo's support page states</a>:</p>
<p>Once fully charged, the battery duration for the console varies depending on model and on the software application and functions being used.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Nintendo Switch - OLED Model with a serial number that starts with "XT", the battery life is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch consoles with a serial number that starts with "XK", the battery life is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch consoles with a serial number that starts with "XA", the battery life is approximately 2.5 to 6.5 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch Lite, the battery life is approximately 3 to 7 hours.</li>
</ul>
