            <p>It's Friday, 12th September and we're back with another day of video games goings-on. It'll all be sucked in here, through the flexi-nozzle vacuum of the liveblog, where we can ponder what it all means. What does it all mean?</p>
<p>And note: we will be doing a separate liveblog later to cover today's Nintendo Direct, which starts at 2pm UK time and runs for an hour. This blog will be superseded by that one.</p>
<p>Today's coffee question: What have you played this year that surprised you? I'll start; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>. It was released last year in February and reviewed well but sunk like a stone in the ocean amidst everything else going on. It's on subscription services at the moment I believe, and it's well worth a look. </p>
