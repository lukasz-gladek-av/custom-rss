            <p>Sega is launching a new store in Tokyo, Japan: Sega Store Tokyo.</p>
<p>Sega didn't share any specifics when it announced the news on social media, but the new store is expected to open in Shibuya's Parco department complex, near the official Capcom store, a Pok√©mon Center, and Nintendo Tokyo, too.</p>

<p>The accompanying 18-second teaser doesn't give much away, sadly, but Sega's transmedia boss Justin Scarpone told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-unveils-plans-for-tokyo-flagship-store-alongside-nintendo/">VGC</a> last year that it was time to put the Sega brand - and not just Sonic - "in front of consumers".</p>

<p>"Our portfolio is very broad, but the common thread is the Sega brand," Scaprone said at the time. "Sega already has a surprising amount of fandom as a brand, and we need to look after those fans and offer new experiences to them, while putting the stamp of Sega on it more proudly.</p>
<p>"It's really exciting, and we need to do a lot more of that, because Sega is a consumer brand that is surprisingly not in front of consumers enough. Sonic is, but Sega isn't."</p>
<p>A second store is also expected to open in Shanghai, but as yet there's no news of an expansion into Europe or America.</p>
<p>Alex recently caught up with Takashi Iizuka, the Sonic series producer who first worked on the franchise just two years into his career and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">stuck with the blue blur for all these years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-reveals-sega-store-tokyo-is-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> actor said he "possibly misled some people" when he teased a Red Dead Redemption-related announcement was on the way.</p>
<p>Last week, John Marston himself - or, at least, the actor who brings him to life, Rob Wiethoff - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-star-teases-he-cannot-wait-for-us-to-know-about-a-big-announcement-thats-coming-before-friday">very excited indeed about an upcoming announcement</a>, stressing that he was particularly excited as he livestreamed "this game", the original Red Dead Redemption. His tease came just days after we heard another rumour that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">Red Dead Redemption 2 may be getting a next-gen update alongside a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>, and Roger Clark - who portrays Red Dead 2's Arthur Morgan - <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934308877446660381">backed up Wiethoff's tease</a>.</p>
<p>Now, however, Wiethoff has walked back his comments, reminding fans that he "do[es] not make announcements for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>", yet still insists he has something exciting to tell us.</p>

<p>"There's one more thing I wanna say," Wiethoff told his viewers on YouTube as he introduced a livestreamed gym buddy session on YouTube. "I don't know how to say this exactly, I'll just say the one thing, uh, that I need to say, and I think all of you recognise this and know this, anyway.</p>
<p>"I do have something I'm <em>really</em> excited about. I truly am. And I think you will be, too, I really do think so. But I possibly, uh, misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now. Just please recognise - and I know that you know this - but let me remind you, I guess: I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that. I'm just reminding you. I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that. So please know that.</p>
<p>"And again, I still think that, uh, a lot of you are going to be really excited about this news. Absolutely. Also, I can't share it with you yet. And I'm so sorry," he finished. "But I truly am that excited. That's all I'm gonna say about that right now."</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, fans noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/">a main cast reunion was scheduled for the National Gaming Expo</a> in Tampa, Florida, from 8th-10th August, leading some to think this could be the "announcement" he was excited about (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-version-tease-turns-out-to-be-a-cast-reunion">Push Square</a>). The line-up for that was announced <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJIHHW6Szuw/">several weeks back</a>, though, which doesn't quite track with Wiethoff's timeline.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, the announcement has seemingly been delayed. Going by Wiethoff's original tease, we should've finally found out by yesterday, 20th June. However, when asked by a fan today, 21st June, for an update, he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lgwq77/the_announcement_is_yet_to_happen_according_to/#lightbox">replied</a>: "It's coming. Sorry for the delay. Ha! There are a lot of moving parts. We want to get this right. I think it will be clear why once we're able to say what's going on.</p>
<p>"I can assure you, I want to tell you as soon as possible. Ha! I love it. Let's goooooooo!"</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-star-says-he-possibly-misled-some-people-but-insists-exciting-news-is-still-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hypnospace Outlaw developer Jay Tholen has confirmed the highly anticipated sequel, Dreamsettler, has been cancelled following a "mutual" decision between Tholen and publisher No More Robots.</p>
<p>"This is not a joke, and I'm sorry everyone," Tholen wrote in the description of a YouTube video entitled: "Dreamsettler is canceled".</p>
<p>"I didn't want to make a video like this, but I'll cut to the chase - Dreamsettler has been cancelled," he said in the ten-minute video. "It means it's not coming out, it won't be finished. This was a mutual decision between the publisher and I. They didn't pull support or anything, and they tried what they could to keep it going, but it's just time to stop it."</p>

<p>Before going into details, however, Tholen thanks everyone who had signed up to his recently launched Patreon, saying going to the crowdfunding platform was "kind of a last-ditch effort." Refunds will be available for the most recent month's payment.</p>
<p>Tholen also said that while he wasn't currently sure "what form it'll take", he does intend to release more of what would have been in the game, which could possibly include a playable build. He also issued a passionate plea for studios to get in touch and offer work to the two developers who have been let go due to the cancellation.</p>
<p>"The very short version is: we got a budget this time, we tried to plan the game from the top down more or less, where we knew all the beats that would happen, and what expensive things we could afford to film or have made for the game, and how much money we could afford to pay a programmer for X amount of time. Because of that money [...] you have to go by this schedule, and I've never successfully made a game based on a design document."</p>
<p>He then talked about some of his favourite features of Dreamsettler, such as Oomph, a fake music sequencer, but the team "way over-scoped, things were so complicated and so fancy".</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry to everyone who's waiting for this game and expecting a big, great game," Tholen added. "This is, like, almost five years of my life. I mean, I did make [spin-off game] Slayer X, so that was a fun diversion, but this was the big one. I had so many hopes."</p>
<p>For those wondering, yes, The Chowder Man was going to return. "He recorded more music for this game than Hypnospace," Thorlen said, "and I want to do right by the musicians too, so maybe we'll figure out how to release their music and promote it.</p>
<p>"We just needed to stop this. Because of money and practical concerns, I just had to stop it. Hopefully, we can release some of it, or maybe I can write blogs - or some of the team can - and show you what we were doing because there's a lot of cool stuff there. A lot of worthwhile stuff."</p>
<p>Thorlen said he still plans to work on Slayer's next update, with hopes to get it out early next year.</p>
<p>"Maybe I've been burnt out this whole time. I don't know. I was able to do Slayer X, though I would like to do kids' stuff. Stuff for children. I don't know if it would be a video series, or an app for kids, or something. And it's not because I think this is a great market to get into, but it's because there are things I've searched for and they don't exist, and I want to make them, just for my own kids.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, everyone. This just stinks. Again, I want to emphasise the publisher did a great job, Mike and Mark did an excellent job. I think I'm a hard person to work with. On a normal team, where there wasn't some guy who needed to work a weird way, they would have finished this game, and it would have been great, but I just couldn't get it going, you know? And it's too late. Hopefully you all stick around, and don't hate my guts, and hopefully we'll talk soon."</p>
<p>We discovered Hypnospace Outlaw would be getting a sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-sequel-dreamsettlers">back in 2022</a>. Another game, Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer - a spin-off made by the fictitious Hypnospace Outlaw character, Zane - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-spin-off-slayers-x-gets-june-release-date">released in June 2023</a>.</p>
<p>We gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-review-resurrecting-a-forgotten-internet-warts-and-all">Hypnospace Outlaw a hearty Recommended</a> when it released in 2019, writing: "A witty and smitten recreation of a time gone by, which you'll forgive tedium if you share in the nostalgia."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-sequel-dreamsettler-cancelled-as-creator-issues-heartfelt-statement-maybe-ive-been-burnt-out-this-whole-time]]></content:encoded>
