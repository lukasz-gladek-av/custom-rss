            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2, the sequel to the roguelike deck-building game that spawned a genre, has been delayed. Developer Mega Crit had been aiming for an autumn 2025 release, it said, but has now realigned for March 2026.</p>
<p>We don't know the date but we do, bizarrely, know the day. Mega Crit has already, quirkily, announced that Slay the Spire 2 will be released on a Thursday. According to my calendar, which I presume is the same as yours, it means Slay the Spire 2 will be released on either the 5th, 12th, 19th or 26th March 2026. Maybe provisionally book-off all these days from work?</p>
<p>"We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear," Mega Crit wrote in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829">a Steam update</a>. "There's no single dramatic reason [for the delay]. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards."</p>
<p>Mega Crit added, in a lighthearted delay FAQ accompanying the news, that the delay wasn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>'s fault, despite appearances. "We got together as a team to determine our new release window before Silksong's date was announced," the studio said. "The timing just worked out like that, but on the bright side, everyone can keep busy playing Silksong during the wait!"</p><p>Slay the Spire 2 looks a lot like Slay the Spire 1, but upon closer inspection has some notable differences - evolutions, it's probably fairer to say. A lot of effort has gone into improving the visual presentation of the game - with what appear to be 3D models in 2D environments now - and there's also apparently a great deal more content stuffed in.</p>
<p>One major change outlined in the post is alternate acts. These allow you to choose different "a" and "b" variations of acts when you replay the game to help ease rerun repetition. Each alteration is said to have "radically" different environments, enemies, events and bosses. The two examples shared in the update were Act 1a variation Overgrowth, a lush jungle-themed alteration; and Act 1b, the Underdocks, a miry waterway.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann has discussed his decision to step away from the TV adapation of The Last of Us for the third season, stating he'd accomplished his "crazy goal" of elevating video games.
</p>
<p>
While he's now returned to full-time video game development on the forthcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us at a "very high level" to make sure it's "as deeply faithful as Season One was".
</p>
<p>
"I feel like that is the gold standard for this kind of adaptation, while enjoying all these beautiful expansions that happen naturally with the rest of the team and how they're working on Season Three," Druckmann told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/">Variety</a>. "So that is where my involvement will stay is at that very, very high level."

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Druckmann announced his decision to step back from the TV show</a> in July, though told Variety he made the decision when the writers' room for Season Three was about to commence. 
</p>
<p>
"I looked at what's in front of me, what would the next season might look like," he said, "and with all the various Last of Us things I'm working on - not just the show - with all the various games I'm working on, the biggest one that takes up most of my time is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, our next big IP for Naughty Dog and PlayStation, it felt like I could better serve all of my responsibilities if I stayed at a higher level."
</p>
<p>
This was also having achieved a goal of elevating The Last of Us beyond players of the game.
</p>
<p>
"I felt like that story could find a bigger audience for people that will never play video games," said Druckmann. "I wanted to elevate Naughty Dog, and PlayStation has been a home for me for 21 years now, and it's given me all the support to tell these wonderful stories, and I wanted to elevate video games. It was such a crazy goal, but I wanted someone to watch this show and have no idea it was based on the video game, and then be like, 'Wait, that's based on a video game?'"
</p>
<p>
Druckmann added he's learned a lot from his time on the show, "even just as far as the craft of making cinematic storytelling".
</p>
<p>
"There's so much that overlaps with my work at Naughty Dog that I felt like I took quite a bit away from that," he said. "I think I could better serve this show and other adaptations like it in the future, having learned all this stuff - but my first responsibility, my first love, is video games, and it's at Naughty Dog."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the interview, Druckmann stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-most-expansive-and-expensive-game-says-neil-druckmann">Intergalactic would be the studio's most ambitious game to date</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s forthcoming sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is the company's "most ambitious game we've ever made".</p>
<p>That's according to creator Neil Druckmann, who spoke to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/">Variety</a> ahead of the Emmys this week - for which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-wins-series-another-emmy">The Last of Us won an award</a>.</p>
<p>"I can tell you we're in the thick of it," said Druckmann on the game's development status. "We're making it, we're playing it. We're firing on all cylinders. I've said this before, but I really mean it, I'm really feeling it right now: It's the most ambitious game we've ever made. It's the most expansive game we've ever made, maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it."</p>

<p>Druckmann added he's "antsy to show it and talk about it because the trailer that we showed doesn't even scratch the surface of what this game actually is", but don't expect anything just yet.</p>
<p>While he wouldn't go into detail on gameplay, Druckmann explained it continues the studio's trajectory from Uncharted to The Last of Us, creating a realistic action game with emotional storytelling and then adding RPG elements and "wide linear layouts" - but now with sci-fi and even more ambition.</p><p>What's more, Intergalactic may also receive some form of adaptation in the future like The Last of Us. Naughty Dog has already been approached by studios based solely on the initial trailer, but Druckmann doesn't want to "put the cart in front of the horse".</p>
<p>"This needs to be a fantastic video game first, and then if that happens and we have the right partnership, those opportunities would be great," he said.</p>
<p>"But that's not why we do what we do. So there's a lot of ideas of what we could do with Intergalactic, and in some ways it's easier to expand that because it's just how that story is structured in that universe. So there's some interesting conversations happening about potential projects that could come down in the future, but our priority right now is to make Intergalactic the next big, fantastic Naughty Dog game."</p>
<p>Could a sequel to Intergalactic also be on the cards straight after its development?</p>
<p>"I'm sure if Intergalactic is successful, you will see it again," he said. "Whether that will be our next game right after that, I can't say, and I leave that door open."</p>
<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">first revealed at The Game Awards last year</a> (trailer above), with Tati Gabrielle in the lead role.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-working-on-second-game-alongside-intergalactic-neil-druckmann-confirms">Druckmann confirmed the studio has a second game in development</a> too.</p>

            <p>It's Friday, 12th September and we're back with another day of video games goings-on. It'll all be sucked in here, through the flexi-nozzle vacuum of the liveblog, where we can ponder what it all means. What does it all mean?</p>
<p>And note: we will be doing a separate liveblog later to cover today's Nintendo Direct, which starts at 2pm UK time and runs for an hour. This blog will be superseded by that one.</p>
<p>Today's coffee question: What have you played this year that surprised you? I'll start; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a>. It was released last year in February and reviewed well but sunk like a stone in the ocean amidst everything else going on. It's on subscription services at the moment I believe, and it's well worth a look. </p>
