            <p>After the reported flop of Resident Evil 7 on iPhone last year, we wondered whether Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">Resident Evil 2 Remake</a> would face a similar fate - and it seems this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>Data from mobile app tracking service Appmagic, shared by <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/resident-evil-2-struggles-to-100k-as-triple-a-flops-continue/">Mobilegamer.biz</a>, estimates that the mobile port of Capcom's remake has only just managed to pass $100k in in-app purchase earnings.</p>

</figure>
<p>Resident Evil 2 Remake's mobile port - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-2-remake-heading-to-iphone-and-mac-in-december">which was released in December</a> - allows users to play a short portion of the game for free, but to get the full experience they need to pay. During the first few weeks of its release, this was discounted to $10. According to estimates, Capcom made $95k during this discount period, meaning roughly 9500 users purchased the full game after getting to the paywall.</p>

</figure>
<p>Since 9th January - when the game was then boosted up to its full retail price of $40 (Â£31.99 here in the UK) - Capcom has made an additional $7k from the mobile release, so that's roughly 175 more users opting to pay to play.</p>
<p>This isn't the only one of Capcom's mobile ports to underwhelm, but at least Resident Evil 2 Remake has done better than Resi 7's efforts. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">report from July of last year suggested Resident Evil 7 had been bought by under 2000 people</a> in its first couple of weeks on the store, with only a scant 2.4 percent of players converting from the free opening to paid version.</p><p>As for what is next for Capcom's franchise, last year Resident Evil 7 director Koshi Nakanishi confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">the studio was developing a new series entry</a>. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said at the time. "But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The scenario for the third part of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy is now complete.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202501/30815">Famitsu</a> ahead of the PC release of Rebirth alongside game director Naoki Hamaguchi, series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the status of the next game, adding he's "very satisfied with it".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi stated development on the third game began right after Rebirth ended and is progressing without delay from the team's schedule, though it's still publicly unknown when the planned release date will be.</p>

<p>Kitase added Rebirth creative director Tetsuya Nomura was given "homework" to give the remake project a conclusion that both respected the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> and provided a new sense of satisfaction not felt in the original. This was completed by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>"I'm very satisfied with it, so I'm sure the fans will be satisfied with the final chapter," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the interview, the pair discussed the increased importance of the PC platform as player numbers increase.</p>
<p>Kitase noted how development costs are rising, so "we need to deliver [the game] to a wider market". This is in-line with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's current multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>
<p>He even joked the PC version is convenient to play in window mode to look up strategies online.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi added there's been interest from fans to add PC features to the PS5 version, specifically the option to fast-forward cutscenes, which the development team would like to include within the limits of the PS5's capabilities. He also mentioned the possibility of adding a New Game Plus mode to the forthcoming third game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-7-remake-option-to-speed-up-cutscenes-led-to-an-increase-in-players-says-director/">separate interview with Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi stated the option to speed up cutscenes in Final Fantasy 7 Remake led to an increased interest in the game.</p>
<p>"Nowadays, many people watch videos and movies at double speed. I myself have little time, so I often use the speed-up function," he said. "I think we are in an age where we should let the user decide what kind of experience they have. Rather than letting (long cutscenes) become an obstacle that prevents people playing the game, I think we should incorporate such (time-saving) functions more and more."</p>
<p>Lastly, Hamaguchi also clarified with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20250123-326211/">Automaton</a> the relationship between Cloud and Aerith. In a previous interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-game-awards-interview-aerith">Inverse</a>, Hamaguchi described their relationship as "sisterly".</p>
<p>Hamaguchi has now gone back on this comment, claiming it was a "misunderstanding". Instead, he will communicate the relationships between characters solely through game content. "No one will officially say anything about who Cloud likes," he said.</p>

            <p>Wolverine is going to be Insomniac's next big game, but despite the project being announced several years ago, the studio is still keeping a release date under wraps.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">Wolverine was first teased back in 2021</a>, during a PlayStation Showcase. At this time, the studio stated the game was still "very early in development". It also still had its Marvel's Spider-Man sequel in the works at this point, with that project ultimately releasing in 2023.</p>
<p>But, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> now out in the wild, and Insomniac previously stating it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-developer-has-no-additional-story-content-planned-for-its-web-slinging-sequel">"no additional story content planned" for its web-slinging sequel</a>, many had hoped to hear more about Wolverine. However, the studio isn't quite ready to share too much about its upcoming project just yet, although it appreciates there is plenty of "pent up excitement" around it.</p>

</figure>
<p>Our latest morsel on the game comes gollowing Insomniac co-founder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-studio-boss-ted-price-announces-retirement-from-games-industry">Ted Price's retirement announcement yesterday</a>. The Wolverine studio now has three new co-heads - Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang - and the trio sat down to chat with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/insomniac-games-ceo-ted-price-exits-ryan-schneider-chad-dezern-jen-huang-playstation-1236281913/">Variety</a> about what this means for Insomniac, and naturally the topic of Wolverine came up.</p>
<p>The studio execs would not confirm or deny a 2025 release window when questioned, but did Dezern did say this:</p>
<p>"We've announced Wolverine, and we'd love to talk more about Wolverine, but we have to be like Logan today, and remain very stoic until it's time to pop the claws down the road. As much as we're as much as we have pent up excitement, we got to hold on to it. So that's, that's about as much as we could say about our upcoming projects today."</p>

</figure>
<p>Other than that brief teaser from 2021, any official word on Wolverine has been slimmer than slim.</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">files were stolen from Insomniac Games by ransomware hackers</a>. Following this attack, people began playing - and uploading footage - of an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/people-are-posting-footage-of-marvels-wolverine-from-stolen-early-version">incomplete early development build of Wolverine</a>, which was found within the stolen files.</p>
<p>Then, in October of last year, it was revealed the game's creative director had moved across to Xbox, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-wolverine-creative-director-now-leading-xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot">joined the team working on the Perfect Dark reboot</a>, meaning Wolverine would now be led by Marcus Smith. Meanwhile, Mike Daly became Wolverine's game director, while the game's previously announced game director Camerson Christain would remain with Insomniac, but in a different role.</p>
<p>At one point, there were rumours <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-could-reportedly-launch-as-early-as-autumn-2024">Wolverine could release in 2024</a>, which clearly did not happen. More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniacs-wolverine-reportedly-due-2025-darker-than-spider-man">there was word of a 2025 release</a>, which of course could still happen, so stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Legendary video game composer Grant Kirkhope has said he has "zero hope" of seeing a new Banjo-Kazooie game.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media last night, Kirkhope went on to <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1882247865357209894">suggest</a> that any new attempt at reviving the dormant platforming franchise was doomed to failure, as "diehard fans would instantly hate it" regardless of "how good it was".
</p>
<p>
Kirkhope is famous for having scored a swathe of classic titles from the heyday of British development powerhouse Rare. He penned the scores of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/goldeneye-007-review">GoldenEye 007</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a> and Perfect Dark, as well as Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/banjo-kazooie-nuts-bolts">Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts</a>.

<p>
More recently, Kirkhope's fame has been revived with work on more modern platformers, including the distinctly Banjo-esque <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, as well as Ubisoft's Mario + Rabbids games.
</p>
<p>
"I hope that last tweet didn't come across as mean," Kirkhope <a href="https://x.com/grantkirkhope/status/1882298146971410457">added</a>, several hours later. "The Banjo fanverse is a wonderful thing, the reaction when Banjo got into Smash Bros. is something I'll remember for the rest of my life â¤ï¸"
</p>
<p>
Fans of the classic Banjo-Kazooie games have long called for a new installment from developer Rare, but to date there's been no suggestion that one is in the works. 
</p>
<p>
Rare itself is busy maintaining hit pirate live-service <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, and has the long-in-development fantasy game Everwild next on its docket.
</p>
<p>
Still, Banjo-Kazooie's popularity endures. Classic games in the franchise have been re-released over the years, including via Xbox's Rare game compilation Rare Replay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-tooie-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">as well as on Nintendo Switch Online</a>. And, as Kirkhope mentioned, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-joins-super-smash-bros-ultimate-line-up">Microsoft gave the nod for the characters to turn up in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>. Could there still be hope for Banjo and Kazooie yet?

            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind Afrofuturist metroidvania <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has teamed up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> publisher Pocketpair to release its next game.</p>
<p>Set for release in 2025, it will be a horror game but not part of the Tales of Kenzera universe.</p>
<p>Last year's Tales of Kenzera: Zau, published by EA, was the first in the series, with more games planned to continue that world. However, this next game will be a shorter and separate project.</p>

<p>"Both Surgent and Pocketpair are well-versed in taking risks. We noticed a pattern in the entertainment industry, and Pocketpair has given us the opportunity to make a horror game about it. It will be short and weird, and we think players will be interested in what we have to say," said Surgent Studios CEO Abubakar Salim.</p>
<p>"We're still in earnest conversation about further projects set in the Tales of Kenzera universe, but this will be a standalone piece: a mile marker between where we've come from and where we're going."</p>
<p>Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing.</p>
<p>"As the games industry continues to grow, more and more games find themselves struggling to get funded or greenlit," said head of Pocketpair Publishing John Buckley. "We think this is a real shame, because there are so many incredible creators and ideas out there that just need a little help to become incredible games.</p><p>"We were instantly fascinated by Abubakar's creative vision for a horror game on a topic he's uniquely qualified to explore. The ultimate goal of Pocketpair Publishing is to find creators with a genuine passion for games and enable them to create fun, new experiences for gamers all over the world."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Eurogamer was shown a prototype for a new gothic horror game called Project Uso</a>, where players take the role of a vampiric android bearing the soul of Eshu, the god of chaos.</p>
<p>However, Surgent Studios has confirmed to Eurogamer today's announcement is a separate project, while Project Uso will be the continuation of the Tales of Kenzera world.</p>
<p>As a result, details on this new small project are largely unknown. It's set to release later this year.</p> <div>

<p>Following Tales of Kenzera: Zau, staff from Surgent Studios faced redundancy as the developer sought funding for its next project.</p>
<p>"There is this idea of constantly being pushed to grow, to be bigger, to do more, to spend more," Salim previously told Eurogamer. "And within an industry that is, rightfully, so artistic in its nature, that isn't necessarily always the answer."</p>
<p>That consideration may point to the decision to work with Pocketpair on this new, smaller game.</p>
<p>Salim has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/abubakar-salim-addresses-fever-pitch-of-racism-received-after-launch-of-tales-of-kenzera-zau">received a torrent of racist abuse online</a>, in the midst of openness about the development of Tales of Kenzera.</p>
<p>"I'm happy that we've been really open with as much as we can," he said. "Whatever feedback you have, send it through. Racism isn't feedback."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
