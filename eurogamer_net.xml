            <p>
If you were previously excited about the impending arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>'s Definitive Edition release, there are now two additional reasons to be excited. Firstly, it's out very soon on the newly announced date of 14th August, and secondly, there's a nice chunky discount if you own the Anniversary edition of the game.
</p>
<p>
Dawn of War's Definitive Edition was announced back in May, amid a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-1-spruce-ups-are-coming-this-year">wave of other Warhammer 40K news bits</a>, promising a fancied-up version of the original 2004 real-time strategy game intended to be more palatable on modern day hardware.
</p>
<p>
There's 4K support, for instance, alongside upscaled textures (4x the originals, supposedly), an enhanced battlefield camera, "optimised" HUD and screen layouts for widescreen viewing, plus improvements to world lighting, units reflections, and shadows.

<p>
And it's not just the base game getting those enhancements, seeing as the Definitive Edition also includes Dawn of War's three expansions: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. That, according to developer Relic Entertainment, amounts to "four Classic Dawn of War Campaigns, nine Armies, and over 200 maps". Plus, the Definitive Edition remains compatible with "over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods".
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition will cost $29.99 USD (or your local equivalent) when it launches for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warhammer_40000_dawn_of_war_definitive_edition">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">Steam</a> on 14th August. And anyone that already owns the game's Anniversary Edition, which released back in 2006, will be able to purchased the new version with 30 percent off as a "thank-you to our loyal fans."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-warhammer40kdawnofwar-pc">gave the original version of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 8/10</a> back in the day when numbers still went above five. "It's a perfect gaming world," Eurogamer contributor Keiron Gillen wrote, "being exploited perfectly, for the first time."

            <p>Xbox's principle development lead for its graphics department has put out a LinkedIn post announcing some new job opportunities. The catch? He used a cringey AI-generated graphic to do so, drawing ire.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7349539853866344449/">Mike Matsel's weekend post </a>calls for those experienced with "device drivers, GPU performance, or related validation or engineering system experience". The attached image shows a lady typing away on a computer, with the text displayed on the back of the monitor. Brilliant.</p>
<p>This caught traction online and, as you can imagine, responses to this post are quite negative. Alexander Bertram-Powell wrote: "Appreciate this preview of the care and attention to detail that make you a leader", while Danylo S followed up with: "First layoffs, then post for hire with AI slop, wonderful work, Xbox".</p>

<p>This post came at a bad time, too. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">Xbox cut a significant chunk of its workforce across various game developers</a> such as Zenimax Online Studios, Rare, The Initiative, and more.</p>
<p>It's also been reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/microsoft-using-more-ai-internally-amid-mass-layoffs">Microsoft is pushing its remaining employees to use more AI at work in the wake of these layoffs</a>. As such, while a sizable chunk of the company has been let go, those remaining are left handling software that's largely yet to generate any provable increases in <a href="https://www.worklife.news/technology/ai-is-actually-making-workers-less-productive/">productivity</a> or <a href="https://techinnovatehub.medium.com/ai-companies-are-losing-billions-their-simple-plan-to-recover-pricier-subscriptions-becc9d9410df">income</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/head-of-xbox-graphics-department-puts-out-cringe-worthy-hiring-post-with-ai-graphics]]></content:encoded>
