            <p>Neil Druckmann is "really curious" about how viewers will react when The Last of Us season two debuts next month.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' second season is set to air in just over two weeks time, and will pick up the lives of Joel and Ellie several years after the events of season one. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">Along with awards and praise</a>, in 2023 the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">first season was reported to be the most-watched HBO Max show in Europe</a>, and as such, there are some pretty high hopes for The Last of Us' second season, mine included.</p>
<p>However, as those who have played Part 2 will know, there are some plot points that may surprise and shock viewers unfamiliar with the source material. So, is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> exec and showrunner Neil Druckmann nervous or scared about the reception, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2s-abby-actor-reveals-online-abuse-didnt-just-threaten-her-life-but-her-baby-son-too">especially given some of the volatile abuse following The Last of Us Part 2</a>? Well, no, he isn't.</p>

</figure>
<p>"When we're making it, we're just so focused on making it that I try not to think about what the reaction will be, but I'm very excited and curious to see what the reaction will be from people who are not familiar with the story and people who are familiar with the story, going over similarities and differences," Druckmann told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the">GameInformer</a>.</p>
<p>"I loved that conversation over season one, and I'm very much looking forward to it across season two."</p>
<p>During the same interview, Druckmann said he "used to be more concerned with fan reaction", adding he had "experienced the worst of it when [Naughty Dog] had the leaks and Covid hit with the second game", but has now "stopped caring" about all that.</p>
<p>"I've always operated under that, 'I'm not going to be worried about what the fan reaction is going to be. I don't have any control over that so I'm not going to be worried about it'.</p>
<p>"What I do have control over is the crafting of the thing that's in front of me and leading a team to do that. So I want to make sure that we make something we're extremely proud of, that we're very thoughtful in making. And then we put it out into the world and the reaction is not up to us. That's up to our fans and how they react."</p>
<p>As to <em>that</em> particular moment that may provoke reactions (won't spoil it here), well Druckmann refrained from commenting on whether or not it will feature in the second season. He dodged the Ellie-phant in the room, if you will. </p>
<p>"I'm not confirming or denying anything," Druckmann said.</p>

<p>The second season of The Last of Us will kick off next month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length. Spores have also been confirmed for The Last of Us' second season, with the showrunners <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-promises-viewers-a-different-evolution-of-infection-plus-spores-make-a-return">promising viewers "a different evolution" of infection</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the showrunners discussed the introduction of new character Abby (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-twos-abby-kaitlyn-dever-wants-to-do-this-character-justice-and-make-the-fans-proud">played in the show by Kaitlyn Dever</a>), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-2-showrunners-are-changing-the-way-abby-is-introduced">why it will be different from The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>So, it turns out that I've been pronouncing Balatro wrong all this time, and now feel like a total spade. I really don't know how to <em>deal</em> with this revelation, it's left me rather <em>flush</em>-ed. </p>
<p>I have been saying B-<strong>LAH</strong>-tro, but that's not exactly how the deckbuilder's anonymous developer pronounces it. According to Naman Budhwar - that is to say, the head of video marketing at Balatro publisher Playstack - LocalThunk puts the emphasis on the 'Bah' in Balatro.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-to-say-balatro">GameFile's Stephen Totilo</a>, Budhwar said LocalThunk pronounces the name of his roguelike deckbuilder thus: "<strong>BAH</strong>-luh-trow."</p>
<p>So, my almost throw away effort on the B is not what its maker calls the game. Whoops!</p>
<p>Not that it sounds like LocalThunk will really mind my poor pronunciation, though. Budhwar said it was kind of like "a 'gif/jif' situation", and people can just say Balatro the way that feels right for them  (for the record, I say gif with a hard G).</p>
<p>"He doesnâ€™t really mind how people say it," Budhwar said of LocalThunk, to which Totilo jokingly asked if pronouncing it "<strong>BAY</strong>-la-tro" would still fly.</p>
<p>"Sure, you can say BAY-la-tro, yeah," Budhwar replied, but I am not sure that will ever stick. To paraphrase Regina George, stop trying to make BAY-la-tro happen.</p>
<p>I am curious, what do you call it?</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-developer-responds-to-ai-art-drama-stating-it-does-real-harm-to-artists-of-all-kinds">Balatro's LocalThunk shared his thoughts on the AI art debate</a>, stating "I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds". Many believed both LocalThunk and Playstack supported AI art.</p>
<p>Also this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">Balatro developer successfully appealed PEGI's decision to classify the game as PEGI 18</a> due to its poker theme.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A voice actor from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> has been recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA actors' union strike, causing others to come out in support.</p>
<p>John Patneaude was the voice of Kinich in the free-to-play adventure from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a>, but in a statement shared on social media they revealed they have been recast due to the strike over AI protections.</p>
<p>"I've been withholding voice-over services during the SAG-AFTRA Interactive Strike because Hoyo/Cognosphere wouldn't offer AI protections in the form of a SAG Interim Agreement," they said. "They'd kept my character's dialogue silent for months, all the while I had made the difficult decision to continue not going in until an interim agreement was signed and this ultimately was why I was recast."</p>

<p>They continued: "Now obviously, a recast is not what I wanted. I'd hoped that any progress behind the scenes would be made and I could come back safely, or that if recast auditions went out my colleagues wouldn't read for them. Unfortunately, I was wrong."</p>
<p>Patneaude described Genshin Impact as a "comfort game during the early parts of the pandemic" and called the role a "dream".</p>
<p>"I would and can return if Hoyo invites me back and signs an interim," they concluded. "I stand by my choices regardless of the outcome. Also, the strike is still ongoing - please don't believe disinformation on the internet."</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">actors' union stated the strike would continue due to "alarming loopholes" allowing for "AI abuse"</a>. Negotiators on behalf of the bargaining video game companies, meanwhile, stated "meaningful progress" had been made.</p>
<p>Following Patneaude's recasting, other voice actors from Genshin Impact have come out in support.</p>
<p>Paimon voice actor Corina Boettger has been particularly vocal, <a href="https://x.com/thebirdzulu/status/1904948378838167802">stating on social media</a>: "There is a HUGE difference when you take the role of an actor who is striking for AI protections. You are no castmate of mine."</p>
<p>Replying to a response asking what to do in Hoyo's shoes, Boettger said: "I would sign the SAG interim agreement so that all my actors can have AI protections and then they could come back right away to voice these characters with no gap."</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/khoidaooo/status/1904969482675884332">Albedo actor Khoi Dao</a> said: "Any video game can bring back their FULL voice cast IMMEDIATELY during the strike, once they agree to enforceable AI protections via a SAG interim agreement, and the game CAN still keep its non-union actors after doing so.</p>
<p>"This is not a union actor vs non-union actor conflict. The goal of the strike is to ensure that this craft isn't lost to AI. We've got a common goal, which is why so many NU actors are holding the line alongside their U cast mates, despite having no obligation to do so."</p>
<p>The news follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">similar situation with HoYoVerse's other game, Zenless Zone Zero</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, both Emeri Chase and Nicholas Thurkettle were recast due to the ongoing strike, and only found out once the game's latest patch went live.</p>
<p>Recording studio Sound Cadence Studios responded to the news at the time, stating: "Every contract at our studio features explicit AI protections, regardless of union status. Much of our staff are actors themselves, and could not in good conscience offer other performers work we would not be willing to take."</p>
<p>It added: "We respect the decisions of all actors in navigating the ongoing strike, and fully support SAG-AFTRA in its AI negotiations."</p>
<p>HoYoVerse itself is yet to publicly comment. Eurogamer has contacted the company for a statement.</p>

<p>What can we expect? Will those rumoured Zelda remakes make an appearance? Will we see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> as a cross-gen game? Or, dare I say it, Silksong?</p>
