            <p>
EA is shutting down The Sims Mobile after seven years, with servers going offline - and all content becoming unplayable - on 20th January next year.
</p>
<p>
The Sims Mobile launched for iOS and Android in 2017, delivering a free-to-play Sims-style experience broadly similar to that of the main series. In January this year, however, EA announced there would be no more new content updates or events for The Sims Mobile, and the publisher has now confirmed the game's imminent closure, sharing a detailed timeline for its shutdown.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update">detailed on EA's website</a>, The Sims Mobile is being delisted from the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store today, 21st October, at 1.30pm UTC. This follows the release of a final update earlier this week giving unlimited energy to all players (energy was previously earnable or available for purchase with real money). A schedule of events, as listed below, will remain available to players until servers shut down at 1.59pm UTC on 20th January 2026, after which The Sims Mobile will be unplayable. Additionally, all Build Mode and Create A Sim content will be unlocked for all players from 6th January.

EA notes it's no longer possible to purchase packs or spend real money within The Sims Mobile, but existing SimCash, Simoleons, and Tickets can be used until 20th January next year. Unspent currency is not eligible for a refund.
</p>
<p>
"On behalf of the entire Sims Mobile team," the publisher's announcement concludes, "thank you for sharing this amazing journey with us. We hope you enjoy the final update and that these final months allow everyone to finish projects, make memories, and celebrate their Sims."
</p><p>
While EA hasn't given a reason for The Sims Mobile's shutdown, it's likely in order to clear the way for its new mobile game, currently being referred to as The Sims Labs: Town Stories. Early footage from Town Stories leaked during playtests last year, when it was still being referred to as Project Rene. Further playtest footage - this time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-minutes-of-eas-new-the-sims-game-concept-leak-online">under the moniker City Life Game With Friends</a>, and described as "small parts of a larger game concept" - surfaced in April, and it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.sims.mobile.town.building&amp;hl=en_GB">recently reemerged</a> on Android as The Sims Labs: Town Stories.
</p>
<p>
Project Rene was initially announced in 2022, when it was described as a "next generation Sims game and creative platform". However, EA's plans had seemingly shifted dramatically by September last year, when it revealed it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">no longer be pursuing a direct Sims 4 "replacement"</a> - ie. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> - and was instead focusing on a new approach that would allow players to keep their progress between titles and have an "ongoing experience". Needless to say, Town Stories, with its apparent endless reward-incentivised to-do lists and front-and-centre currency focus, was not what fans were clamouring for.
</p>
<p>
For the time being, the series' main focus remains on The Sim 4, which continues to receive major updates and expansions, despite now being a decade old. Its most recent expansion, the getaway themed Adventure Awaits, launched earlier this month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-adventure-awaits-expansion-is-exactly-the-kind-of-getaway-ive-been-looking-for">is a good 'un</a>.

            <p>Part three of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy will be more "concise", said director Naoki Hamaguchi, as fan feedback from Rebirth has been taken into account.</p>
<p>Rebirth, the second part of the trilogy, shifted to an open world filled with minigames, but some players criticised story sections for being too drawn out.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-bgs/">Screen Rant</a>, Hamaguchi disagreed but is still taking on such feedback while developing the next game.</p>

<p>"Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">FF7 Rebirth</a>, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary," he said. "I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly."</p>
<p>He added: "As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise."</p>
<p>Rebirth did, however, introduce some great minigames like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-queens-blood-is-the-best-card-game-of-the-year">card game Queen's Blood</a>. Hopefully being more "concise" with storytelling will still leave space for innovation and amusing side activities.</p>
<p>What's more, in a previous interview <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-part-three-will-have-some-sort-of-fresh-gameplay-experience-but-its-a-big-secret-for-now">Hamaguchi stated the third game will have some form of new gameplay experience</a>, though it remains under wraps.</p>
<p>"But moving forward to the third game in the series," he said, "obviously I can't say exactly what it is, but I don't want to deliver just exactly the same style of gameplay experience as we had with Rebirth again. We're going to evolve it and change it again to give another different and fresh take on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> gameplay. Again, that will be revealed in the not too distant future. I can say we're working on it and we're trying to change that because we've actually got a build up and running in the development team right now where you can experience that new style of gameplay."</p><p>It certainly seems, then, that part three will be a step on from Rebirth, not only adding something fresh beyond simply wrapping up the story, but taking fan feedback into account too. Let's just hope the convoluted narrative of the Remake trilogy concludes comprehensively.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hamaguchi previously said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory">multiplatform approach for the trilogy won't impact development "whatsoever"</a>, now that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">and will be followed by subsequent games</a>.</p>

            <p>Blockbuster games with outsized budgets and big spectacle are "not really sustainable in terms of the cost of development", said former God of War exec Meghan Morgan Juinio, adding games need to be "fun first".</p>
<p>Juinio recently left her position as director of product development at Sony's Santa Monica Studios, where she worked on the God of War series. She discussed the current state of blockbuster game development with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/god-of-war-producer-says-the-blockbuster-games-industry-needs-to-steer-away-from-spectacle-and-focus-on-what-matters-if-its-not-fun-its-not-worth-the-investment/">PC Gamer</a> at Gamescom Asia.</p>
<p>"I think it's already not really sustainable in terms of the cost of development," she said. "There's been a ton of layoffs, and a lot of that is focused on the West Coast of the US, and it's clearly because the minimum costs are so high. Development costs will necessitate that the big publishers create [new] pathways."</p>

<p>While big budget games like God of War won't be going away, Juinio believes larger publishers will look to AA or single A games for inspiration.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, successful games should be fun to play, rather than focusing on flashy graphics and presentation.</p>
<p>"I think what it comes back to," said Juinio, "is just make something fun. Just make something awesome, and that will achieve what you need it to achieve."</p>
<p>She continued: "My opinion is that it has to be fun first. It can look the most beautiful, the best soundtrack in the world, it can be winning all the BAFTAs for audio and all this, but if it's not fun it's not worth the investment, whether that's $2m or $500m.</p><p>"And I think that's where the biggest publishers can return: how do we go back to building solid games that are really fun to play. Maybe they aren't 40 hours long, and maybe they aren't the most cutting edge - but that doesn't matter if the core experience is really fun."</p>
<p>This year, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Peak have proven that games from smaller teams with smaller budgets can still make a huge impact. Juinio acknowledged, however, there remains an increasing problem of access and game discovery when there are simply so many games being released.</p>
<p>For Sony specifically, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-ok-to-make-a-small-game-says-astro-bot-director-on-its-aa-level-success">Astro Bot is perhaps a key example of critical, award-winning success based on smart AA-sized ambition</a>.</p>
<p>"It's OK to make a small game," said its director Nicolas Doucet during a talk at this year's GDC.</p>
<p>"In order to exist in this very busy world, I think it's sometimes better to settle for a good spot in the second week rather than a bad spot in the first week," he continued. "A lot of choices we made with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> could be labelled as AA... like the size of the team, the size of the game, there's no voice, it's not open world, but that doesn't really matter. We could still make something that gets people really happy."</p>

            <p>It turns out that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> may be messing with the aim of PC users playing on mouse and keyboard. Thankfully, by adjusting a few settings, you should be able to improve your ability to hit your shots in EA's massive military shooter.</p>
<p>This process was first widely <a href="https://x.com/TorbisXD/status/1979494906830696780">publicised by Battlefield 6 content creator TorbisXD on X</a>, who messed around in the settings to discover three options that were impacting his ability to hit shots while aiming down sights.</p>
<p>Here's the fix. First, go to your Mouse and Keyboard settings, then go to the Controls sub settings menu at the top under the Infantry section. Once there, turn Uniform Infantry Aiming off for now, as this'll allow you to alter several other aiming settings linked to it.</p>

<p>With Uniform Infantry Aiming turned off, scroll down to the Zoom section of the Controls menu and you'll see an option called Zoom Transition Sensitivity Smoothing. Turn this off. Then, re-enable Uniform Infantry Aiming. For the final step, you'll see an option called Zoom Sensitivity coefficient right below Uniform Infantry Aiming - turn this to zero.</p><p>Okay, so what are all these tweaks to settings actually doing? Well, Uniform Infantry Aiming keeps your aiming sensitivity the same regardless of what you're doing - whether aiming down your sights or shooting from the hip. It's very useful, which is why it's been left on. However, Zoom Transition Sensitivity Smoothing attempts to add additional sensitivity to your aim when aiming-down-sights.</p>
<p>In layperson's terms, with default settings enabled, your aiming sensitivity was sped up whenever you aimed down your sights. With these changes to the settings, your ADS speed should be uniform across the board, which should feel a tad more natural.</p>
<p>It turns out a lot of people are having a grand time with Battlefield 6. According to an official statement by EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">over seven million players bought and played the game in the week following its official launch</a>. This popularity came in spite of a few bugs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">some even throwing off player's aim in extended firefights</a>, though many of these have been fixed in short order.</p>
