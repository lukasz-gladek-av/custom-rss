            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is celebrating its ninth anniversary with two new collaborations: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> and The Witcher.</p>
<p>Springtrap, the FNAF villain, will be the game's next Killer, joining as part of the next anniversary chapter. This marks the first time the character has been playable in a game.</p>
<p>Further details on the Killer's moveset will be revealed in a forthcoming livestream, but a Springtrap Legendary Outfit will be released to match the Yellow Rabbit version of the character seen in the Blumhouse film adaptation - actor Matthew Lillard has lent his likeness and voice for this outfit.</p>

<p>And then there's The Witcher, which will arrive in Dead by Daylight as a series of outfits inspired by the game's iconic cast.</p>
<p>Survivor Vittorio Toscano will receive Geralt's Legendary Outfit, with other outfits coming based on Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. It will be available from 3rd June.</p>
<p>"Our favourite of the Collection is of course Geralt’s Legendary Outfit for Vittorio Toscano," said Dead by Daylight product director, Rose Li. "Not only will it let players essentially take on the exact look of The White Wolf, but we've also added some really nice details as part of this Outfit. Geralt will have unique lobby animations, and best of all, brand-new voice lines recorded for our game by the original voice actor, Doug Cockle."</p>
<p>The news was announced at the Dead by Daylight anniversary celebration at PAX East, where Behaviour reiterated its commitment to making quality of life improvements. Previously, the studio stated it would be postponing several updates by three weeks to focus on bug fixes and address community feedback.</p>
<p>Later this year, the studio will allow players to add more spectators to custom matches and play matches while queueing for events; will rebalance how map and key items work; new anti-cheat measures are on the way; and steps will be taken to reduce camping, slugging, and tunneling.</p>
<p>Lastly, a new chapter will be on the way in 2026 created by the studio in conjunction with the community. In Choose Your Own Adventure style, the original chapter will feature a new Killer and Survivor with features voted on by players.</p>
<p>Back in April, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-the-board-games-next-expansion-lets-you-adjust-the-difficulty-to-frightening-proportions">new expansion for the Dead by Daylight board game was announced</a>, introducing new Killers and Survivors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> last year. Following its announcement, the developer confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">Hangar 13 said Mafia: The Old Country would be a "focused, linear" experience</a>, retailing at £45 for those of us in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has pushed back on the suggestion that AI-generated images have been used in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.
</p>
<p>
The statement comes after eagle-eyed viewers watching the game's recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWjkbAQOGY8">Nintendo Treehouse livestream</a> noticed in-game billboards by the sides of the racetrack that featured artwork similar in appearance to that made by generative AI.
</p>
<p>
"AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World," a Nintendo spokesperson told Eurogamer.

<p>
The images in question include artwork of a bridge, used on a billboard in a city area. It includes wonky lines and oddly-placed elements reminscent of an AI-generated image.
</p>
<p>
A second billboard next to this one features a work-in-progress skyscraper, with strangely-orientated floors and pathways, again similar to an image created using AI generation. 
</p>

<p>
A third billboard features an image of an oddly-shaped car with unusually large windows that, once again, looks similar to something created by generative AI.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that the version of Mario Kart World shown during the Nintendo Treehouse livestream was likely not the final version of the game, and it is normal for placeholder visuals to be present while a game is still in development.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see if these pieces of artwork make it into the game's launch version.
</p>
<p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s key launch title will arrive on 5th June, alongside Nintendo's new console. I played an hour of the game last month, and came away hugely impressed. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World reinvents the series, and feels like Switch 2's killer app</a>," I wrote.
