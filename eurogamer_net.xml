            <p>Sony Santa Monica, the studio behind the God of War series, is working on a new game, but reportedly it won't be a new IP though "it might feel like one".</p>
<p>There's been plenty of speculation around what the studio may be working on next, in particular game director Cory Barlog. He was responsible for the God of War reboot in 2018, but on its sequel he was producer.</p>
<p>Now, Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier has addressed the speculation on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">ResetEra</a>, calling Barlog's game "Sony Santa Monica's next big thing" and that "it was going well" at least a couple of months ago.</p>

<p>In a later response, Schreier added it won't be a new IP and it certainly won't be a sci-fi game.</p>
<p>"I'll put it this way: it’s not a new IP but it might feel like one," Schreier said. "Maybe that's why people are confused. Please don't ask me more questions about this - if I wind up reporting more information at any point in the future it'll be in an article, not on a forum. And that the sci-fi stuff (that people have apparently believed for years now?) is nonsense."</p>
<p>Rumours swirled in August last year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monica-is-making-its-first-new-ip-in-over-20-years">Sony Santa Monica was developing its first new IP in over 20 years</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear if the studio has multiple projects, or if indeed its next game will be part of an existing franchise. The obvious conclusion is a new game in the God of War series, likely with a new direction.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-santa-monicas-next-game-is-reportedly-not-a-new-ip-but-it-might-feel-like-one]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Octopath Traveller co-developer Acquire is working on three new original games, in a new deal with Middle Eastern publisher Red Dunes Games.</p>
<p>Acquire (owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>) is best known for the likes of Tenchu and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a>, as well as supporting Nintendo's RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> and co-developing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Octopath Traveller games.</p>
<p>The three original games in development will be shown at this year's Tokyo Game Show in September, as reported by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2025/07/14/tenchu-studio-acquire-and-red-dunes-games-unveil-global-co-dev-deal/">Forbes</a>, and will be released on PC and major consoles. The three games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Tremor (featuring "city-shaking kaiju battles")</li>
<li>Project Umbra ("dark fantasy hunts")</li>
<li>Project Shadowcar ("a shadowy espionage thriller")</li>
</ul>

<p>"As Acquire, a studio that has long valued originality from Japan in game development, we are thrilled to have found a wonderful partner in Red Dunes Games and embark on a bold new global challenge together," said CEO Takuma Endo.</p>
<p>"We've always believed in the power of originality. Now, with Red Dunes, we're building something truly international."</p>
<p>Red Dunes Games, based in Abu Dhabi, has until now focused on indie games, but is looking to expand its global footprint.</p>
<p>"Acquire is a legendary studio with a deep creative legacy, and we are honoured to work with them to build the next wave of original games," said Sultan Darmaki, CEO and creative director. "This partnership is a reflection of our belief that the future of gaming lies in global collaboration, where stories cross borders, and innovation knows no region."</p>
<p>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership released last year. "A relatively minor instalment, but in a series this magical, that's still good news," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">our review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/octopath-traveller-co-developer-working-on-three-new-original-games-coming-to-tokyo-game-show]]></content:encoded>
