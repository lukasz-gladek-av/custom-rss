            <p>Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild has reportedly been cancelled following layoffs at Xbox.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft began making layoffs across its gaming division today</a>, with staff at the likes of King and Zenimax reportedly affected. It now appears that Everwild is another casualty of these reductions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-xbox-layoffs-hit-rare/">VGC</a> initially shared news of Everwild's alleged cancellation, and Eurogamer sources have since corroborated these reports. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyeysnjmk24">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has additionally been told of the game's cancellation, citing those familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Everwild was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a>. At this time, Everwild was said to be the next "large" game from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>.</p>
<p>Everwild then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">surfaced again in 2020</a>, with a trailer showing groups of Eternals - beings with the gift "to sense and feel how magic flows through nature and connects every living thing" -  working together to heal a deer-like creature, and discovering a stag mural in some old ruins. </p>
<p>Since then, very little has been shared about Rare's game, although in February of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-rares-everwild-is-still-in-development-and-xbox-is-committed-to-giving-the-team-the-time-it-needs">Xbox head Phil Spencer assured the community the Everwild team was making progress</a>. "I was recently out at Rare. It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making," Spencer said at the time. "It has been [a while]. And we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Xbox for comment on Everwild's reported cancellation, and will update when we know more.</p></div>
