<p>As for the price, it'll cost  £74.99 / $84.99 / €84.99 / ¥12,480. That's the same as the existing The Last of Us, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> limited edition controllers.</p>
<p>Here's a close-up of the controller in all its glory:</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Back in April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony raised the price of its PS5 console</a> across the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, due to the "backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates". The PS5 controller was not affected.</p>
<p>As for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, I recently got to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-death-stranding-2-preview-how-a-big-dollop-of-metal-gear-is-expanding-kojimas-bizarre-epic">play 30 hours of the game for preview at Kojima Productions</a>. Though not the biggest fan of the original, I came away hugely impressed by the improvements made in this sequel.</p>
<p>"Death Stranding 2 is clearly a labour of love, filled with carefully balanced gameplay systems, exceptional visuals, and extraneous details and secret scenes (Dollman certainly likes his music), all wrapped up in Kojima's irrepressible sense of cool," reads the preview.</p>
<p>"Like the studio he works from, the game is a gateway into his post-pandemic mind as, now in his 60s, he contemplates life, death, family, human connection, future legacy, and - most important of all - which musician he'll be listening to next. In that sense it, so far, feels like the most Kojima-game yet, a culmination of all his prior achievements."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-wont-make-it-himself">Kojima also stated he has a concept for a possible further sequel</a>, but doesn't plan to make it himself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Valve has released a new update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, adding weekly missions along with a number of other changes.</p>
<p>The weekly missions can be found via the main or play menu, with the developer adding each weekly mission will expire after seven days (makes sense). Players will be rewarded with XP for completing these missions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Counter-Strike 2 team has done a fair bit of rework with the game's maps. It has removed the following community maps from all game modes as part of this update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basalt</li>
<li>Edin</li>
<li>Palais</li>
<li>Whistle</li>
</ul>
<p>It has also added three community maps to its Competitive, Casual, and Deathmatch modes. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jura</li>
<li>Grail</li>
<li>Agency</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, two maps have been added to Wingman mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dogtown</li>
<li>Brewery</li>
</ul>
<p>Sticking with maps, the team has also rejigged the game's Casual and Deathmatch map groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defusal Group Alpha: Dust 2, Mirage, Inferno, Vertigo.</li>
<li>Defusal Group Delta: Train, Anubis, Ancient, Overpass, Nuke.</li>
<li>Community Map Group: Jura, Grail, Agency.</li>
<li>Hostage Group: Office, Italy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last year, Will Judd asked the question: If Counter-Strike is so good, why did it take 24 years to make Counter-Strike 2?</p>
<p>"Counter-Strike 2 <em>is </em>Counter-Strike. The formula hasn't really changed since the 1999 original - terrorists and counter-terrorists sparring to eliminate the other side or plant/defuse a bomb at one of two designated locations - but Valve's 2023 release runs better on modern hardware than 2012's Global Offensive and offers sparingly more gameplay possibilities too," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-review-despite-everything-its-still-you">Eurogamer's Counter-Strike 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally though, the core combination of tactical, round-based 5v5 competition and satisfyingly difficult shooting mechanics remain as enrapturing and enraging as ever."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo expects to sell another 4.5m units of its aging original Switch this year, despite the impending launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. 
</p>
<p>
While the older console's momentum continues to slow, this forecast would see Switch - now at 152.12m sold - reach 156.62m, overtaking Nintendo DS as the company's best-selling hardware of all time.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo DS tapped out at 154.02m units sold across its long life, more than the Wii (101m) and even the combined totals of Game Boy and Game Boy Color (118m). But there's still one further hurdle to pass.

<p>
Sony has historically never released an exact figure for lifetime PS2 sales, though has quoted an estimate of 160m sold. Can Nintendo get to that figure with Switch 1? After this financial year, ending 31st March 2026, it's predicting it will be just 3.38m away. 
</p>
<p>
In the grand scheme of things, this does not seem too big a gap to close. But it remains to be seen how the launch of Switch 2 will further impact sales of Switch 1, and whether Nintendo can keep its older console selling. 
</p>
<p>
As for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo says it expects Switch 2 will outsell its predecessor</a> through its first year on sale and shift 15m units - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">demand is expected to exceed expectations</a>, aside from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">ever-changing impact of US tariffs</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has released a statement regarding changes to its monster catching survival game which were made due to its ongoing Pokémon lawsuit.</p>
<p>Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> towards the end of last year. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular. Then, as part of a winter update, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Here's our Zoe with some thoughts on Palworld.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZl10Mlc7I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232">social media platform X earlier today</a>, Pocketpair expressed its disappointment that such actions were required back then, before stating it was now having to make "yet another compromise" due to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>This 'compromise' arrives with Patch v0.5.5. "From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals," the Palworld team wrote. "Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide."</p>
<p>The developer said it understood this would be "disappointing for many", just as it is for the Palworld team. However, it said the changes are "necessary in order to prevent further disruptions" to the game's development, and it remains "committed... to delivering exciting new content" for players.</p>
<p>Pocketpair said it disputes the claims made against it, and still "[asserts] the invalidity of the patents in question".</p>

</figure>
<p>Ever since Palworld was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a>. In fact, Palworld was dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release last year, and soon after its debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Pocketpair responded to Nintendo's legal action by asserting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-lawyers-state-existence-of-titanfall-2-ark-and-even-the-legend-of-zelda-invalidates-nintendos-patents">the patents The Pokémon Company believes Pocketpair has contravened are invalid due to other games that came before it</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, Tomb Raider, and even Nintendo's own Legend of Zelda series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
