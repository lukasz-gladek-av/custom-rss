</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It is fair to say God of War creator David Jaffe is less than enamoured with the series' newest entry, 2D side-scroller Sons of Sparta.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced during last week's PlayStation State of Play, coming from Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Santa Monica Studio. It's a canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>
<p>At the same time it was announced, Sons of Sparta released on PS5 consoles. And, well, Jaffe is not impressed.</p>
<p>During a nine minute YouTube video, Jaffe quickly laid into the series' latest offering. "This is the kind of game I have always wanted in terms of 2.5D God of War… but this to me is not what I was talking about," Jaffe begins, before stating in no uncertain terms: "I don't like it, I don't recommend it."</p>
<p>That was fairly gentle, though, compared to the rest of the video, where Jaffe calls Sons of Sparta "crap", "dumb" and even "stupid".</p>
<p>"What the f**k are they thinking," Jaffe expressed. While the original God of War director did say the gameplay in Sons of Sparta is "fine" and "servicable", he still can't wrap his head around why the game is "in existence" at all.</p><p>"I don't understand, I don't understand," Jaffe said with his face in his hand, reflecting on a conversation he had had with a former Sony Santa Monica developer about the scene in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> where Atreus and Angrboda chat while riding along together. Allegedly, the developer told Jaffe Sony Santa Monica is "these days driven primarily by story", which Jaffe seemed less than enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>"In Sons of Sparta, what I played – which was only about an hour of it, and I'll never go back to it – it's just like 'get over yourselves, man,” the God of War creator said. "They just kept stopping over and over and having the characters just talk and talk and talk. And the voice acting's not very good, the story - at least what I played… maybe it gets really good… - [but] who the f**k wants to play [Sons of Sparta]. This is not God of War."</p>
<p>He continued: "I want you to think about this for a minute, and the choice this team had… the idea of saying 'hey, we want a 2.5D metroidvania God of War game'. Most gamers would say 'oh my god, yes please'. [But] the idea of 'aaand, we don't want it to be the Kratos that you know and love from either 2018's God of War, or the Greek trilogy God of War. F**k it, that character's boring, no one likes that Kratos, that we've built billions of dollars franchises on. Let's make him just some generic f**king kid'... it makes no f**king sense."</p>
<p>Jaffe then said Sons of Sparta's origin story for Kratos as a "dumb idea", and suggested fans would have rather played a game like the much bloodier and violent Metroidvania title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. This, Jaffe said, has the "tone" of the earlier God of Wars. "I'm pretty sure when people said they wanted a 2D God of War, they meant [like Blasphemous]", not Sons of Sparta. "Who the f**k greenlit this? Who thought this was what the audience wants?"</p><p>Meanwhile, if that wasn't enough, Jaffe also laid into Sons of Sparta's production quality. "Compared to what we got just this last year," he said, "if you look at the gameplay variety and just the joy of playing a game like Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, if you look at the art and level of detail and just genuine interesting scenarios at a moment-to-moment gameplay level of Neon Inferno – which also came out towards the end of last year, which is just an excellent shooter by the way, I highly recommend it - if you of course look at the production value of the 2D Shinobi, I mean look at that thing.</p>
<p>"People want this production value, and they want this vibe, and they want it to be classic Kratos."</p>
<p>Jaffe suggested that if you "pulled God of War" out of Sons of Sparta, and instead said "hey, we are making a game about this kid", people wouldn't be interested. "I want to know who at Sony thought this was what people wanted," he said. "By the way, I don't need the big budgets. I would have loved bigger production value, smoother animations, this, that, and the other, but I don’t need that, right? If the gameplay was interesting, if it was violent, if it had personality, if you opened immediately and the players were like 'oh my God, I've never thought of that kind of mechanic in a game like this', or 'this is so fun to do', you could make it super inexpensive like this seems to be. I can't imagine this cost that much money to make.</p>
<p>"But why would you even put this out? All it does is leave a bad taste in God of War fans' mouths, in my assumption."</p>
<p>Jaffe said this whole thing "shows such a collapse of the great executive work that Sony in the past has done", and "the fact that they would think this is what people want from God of War… I just don't know what to f**king tell you".</p>
<p>You can check out Jaffe's increasingly - erm - impassioned speech in full below.</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade (which will hopefully not receive the same reception from Jaffe on its release). However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

            <p>Like it or not, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> was a hit. Developer Shift Up (and PS5/PC publisher Sony) has been trying to avoid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up">all sorts of drama</a> since its release, but with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/as-stellar-blade-reaches-3-million-sales-shift-up-ceo-rewards-all-300-employees-with-a-switch-2/">over 3m copies sold</a> overall by mid-2025, it's safe to say the action-adventure game found an audience.</p>
<p>Shortly before its PC release last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">Shift Up confirmed the game would get a sequel</a>, and that plans were already underway. Now, thanks to the Q&amp;A section in <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">the company's last financial report</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-sounds-like-stellar-blade-may-launch-on-xbox-and-nintendo-switch-2-this-year">IGN</a>), we've gotten confirmation that the powers that be are looking at expanding to platforms beyond PS5 and PC... which essentially means current-gen Xbox consoles and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are in their sights.</p>
<p>The Korean studio has once again described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> as a "steady, long-tail IP" which will be capitalised on in the coming years. Since the sequel is (predictably) a way off, we don't find the news of tentative Xbox and Switch 2 ports particularly shocking. Again, this doesn't mean they're 100 percent happening, but the move makes sense and is definitely on the table. "This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up added, before explicitly mentioning advances on that front will happen as soon as later this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the developer is also working on <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-spirits">Project Spirits</a>, an all-new "flagship title" which will be published by Level Infinite and is targeting consoles, PC, and mobile. Whether the new versions of Stellar Blade would be self-published is up in the air too, but if I had to bet, I'm not expecting Sony to be involved after helping out with the PS5 and PC launches.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shiftup-ceo-receives-presidential-commendation-for-stellar-blade-and-nikke">Shift Up's CEO received</a> "a presidential commendation for boosting the South Korean games industry" following the game's exceptional financial performance and its impact on making the Korean games industry another heavyweight to watch out for in the AAA space, with Neowiz and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">Lies of P</a> also adding to that conversation.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is one of those multiplayer games that continue to thrive without making much noise outside their core communities. In fact, last year brought a number of substantial changes to the game through the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-x-update-detailed-as-game-goes-free-to-play">Rainbow Six Siege X update</a>. Shame about those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-still-struggling-after-ubisoft-was-forced-to-briefly-intentionally-shut-it-down-following-third-party-hack">massive attacks from hackers</a> though.</p>
<p>In any case, a new year brings new opportunities, and this next content drop had probably been brewing for a long while. The rumours were true: Solid Snake as seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> is coming to the game on 3rd March. Yep, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-mgs4-from-the-ps3-with-august-release-date-sony-state-of-play">Konami has gone beast mode</a> and is even doing a huge collaboration now with a publisher that was a major competitor years ago.</p> <figure>

<p>The reveal trailer is self-explanatory: Sam Fisher (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> series) and Solid Snake in the same game? Working together? Time-travel back to the mid-2000s with this trailer and you'd blow the gaming industry's collective mind. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-ification of every franchise big enough is real, but if that's the future of entertainment, we might as well enjoy team-ups that always were destined to happen.</p>
<p>Fisher joined Rainbow Six Siege a few years back, when it was starting to embrace the potential of crossovers with other IPs. Of course, it's far more shocking when those big collabs happen with different publishers, and even more special when we're talking about stealth game legends. And if you were thinking Solid Snake is just a skin or a lazy operator design, you'd be wrong:</p><figure>

<p>As thoroughly described by <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7wYca8Fw674NP93tZe9uDe/solid-snake-joins-rainbow-six-siege-in-operation-silent-hunt">the blog post on Operation Silent Hunt</a>, "Solid Snake excels at tracking down Defender positions and scavenging supplies on the battlefield to adapt to any situation" thanks to the familiar Soliton Radar MKIII gadget and an "On-Site Procurement ability." The battle pass for this season instantly unlocks Snake and includes cosmetics for other operators, like the Psycho Mantis outfit for Smoke. Later, a mystery new mode will be added alongside more MGS outfits and the long-awaited team-up with Sam Fisher, which is a limited-time mode of sorts.</p>
<p>Beyond the fan excitement surrounding Snake's arrival to R6 Siege, it's safe to say this new addition to the roster will shake the meta up in big ways, as the stealth legend is a master of controlling movement in the battlefield and can carry more secondary gadgets. Can he be a lore-friendly <em>and</em> balanced operator? Let's hope so.</p>
