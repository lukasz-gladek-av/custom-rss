            <p>Motorsport Games is pulling all NASCAR games from sale at the end of the year, including the NASCARRivals, NASCARHeat, and NASCARignition franchises.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, Motorsport informed players that from 31st December 2024, "all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts", although they "will remain available to play after this time".</p>
<p>The decision comes after Motorsport Games sold the NASCAR license to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/iracing">iRacing</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>"Following the release of 1.0.1, we are now ready to proceed with the 1.0.2 patch," GSC Game World explained in the patch notes. "This update includes bug fixes for six missions, along with additional error corrections."</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455844537830474746">full list of fixes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue when the second wave of monolith soldiers would not spawn during the On the Edge mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue when Ritcher could be found dead during the A Minor Incident mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was a player could get stuck after installing the fuse in the Wild Island area if they got the Emitter from Faust's Cell first during the Just Like the Good Old Days mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>The fixed issue was when a player could not successfully complete the All That is Left mission while exploring the Chemical Plant region.</li>
<li>Fixed issue when quest enemies could spawn in unreachable areas for a player during the “Down Below” mission, blocking further progression.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when Scar could be missing during the Visions of Truth mission.</li>
<li>A few more EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION errors are fixed.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Thanks again for your support. We will continue working on future updates, reading your comments and feedback, and fixing 'anomalies' if they occur," the team concluded.</p>
<p>"If you detect any - report them to our <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.stalker2.com%2Fhc%0A">Technical Support Hub</a>. That will help us investigate your particular case and implement fixes faster."</p>
<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl has, of course, got off to an impressive start despite its technical issues. Earlier this week, GSC Game World revealed the shooter has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">already sold 1m copies</a> - and that figure doesn't including all those players exploring The Zone via Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Re-Logic has confirmed there's "no way" we'll see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> 1.4.5 released this year.</p>
<p>In a lengthy update on the official <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-state-of-the-game-november-2024.139594/">forums</a>, Ted "Loki" Murphy said that whilst the team was approaching the end of their respective to-do lists, end-of-year releases are "fraught with peril" due to review cycles and people going on early leave for the holiday. Consequently, he will not "force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch".</p>

<p>"The work on the final lists from each dev team member is nearing its conclusion, which is a great measure of progress," wrote Murphy. "That said, we are pretty certain that there is no way that we will see Terraria 1.4.5 release this year.</p><p>"To make a long story short, end-of-year releases (especially if you are trying to sync launch across PC-Mobile-Console AND do so globally at the same time) are fraught with peril due to review cycles, people leaving early for the holidays, etc. The hope was that we would be able to get things in ahead of that end of year mess, but that isn't looking to be the case.</p>
<p>"We are also not going to force anyone on our team or anyone else's team to crunch for what would be an arbitrary deadline," Murphy added. "So, that said, the next Terraria update is moving along into 2025."</p>
<p>After acknowledging that the news "will not be welcome for many", Murphy added that Re-Logic "remain[s] committed to being a quality-first studio, so we will take the time necessary for each update to feel 'just right'... and we think that once the update is out, everyone will appreciate that time and care".</p>
<p>"Apologies for this one taking so long for sure, but it will be well worth it," he added.</p>
<p>We recently learned that Terraria will be linking up with open world pocket monster survival game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">Palworld for the latter's first big brand crossover</a>. Exactly what this will entail remains to be seen, but artwork posted to social media earlier this week shows characters from the two games interacting ahead of the crossover happening at some point in 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
