        <p>By analysing the hacker's digital footprint, the Japanese megacorp was able to hunt them down.</p>

            <p>Nintendo reportedly hunted down an alleged Switch pirate by tracking their reddit posts.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, after putting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-gets-more-than-three-years-in-jail">Switch pirate Gary Bowser behind bars</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">targeting emulator software Yuzu</a>, Nintendo resumed its fight against the modded console business with new lawsuits, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-war-against-switch-piracy-ramps-up-with-two-fresh-cases">including one against James "Archbox" Williams</a>, who was the main moderator behind r/SwitchPirates.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-nintendo-found-archbox-switch">Game File</a>, it seems Williams was located after Nintendo commissioned a law firm to investigate "freeshops" or online repositories for pirated Switch games.</p>

<p>By analysing Williams' past posts online - including one from reddit user "archbox" in 2015 that was very complementary about Midwestern University's optometry clinic - the firm helped the Japanese company "succeed in linking Archbox with at least two Nintendo accounts for an individual named James Williams".</p>
<p>And because Williams seemingly used the same email address to get repairs for their Nintendo Switch, staff at Nintendo's Product Lifecycle Management group was able to find his shipping address.</p>
<p>Once it had acquired Williams' address, Nintendo sent a cease and desist, after which Williams initially agreed to "comply and cooperate" with Nintendo's demands. However, Williams then went dark and failed to show up at court, defaulting judgement in favour of Nintendo.</p>
<p>ICYMI, last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">Nintendo filed a new lawsuit against a streamer who broadcast 10 pirated games ahead of their release</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>.</p>
<p>When Nintendo moved to shutdown streamer Jesse Keighin's streams via copyright notices on YouTube, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and other streaming platforms, he reportedly told them he "could do this all day" and had "a thousand burner accounts".</p>
<p>Nintendo further alleges that as well as broadcasting unreleased games, he also instructed others on how to obtain pirated games via "circumvention devices" Nintendo calls "trafficking".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to reports about its upcoming Animus Hub.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Eurogamer reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards">leaked Assassin's Creed Shadows images have surfaced</a> showing a selection of free battle pass rewards for Ubisoft's upcoming blockbuster. Assassin's Creed has never offered a battle pass before, and there were no official details on how this will work.</p>

<p>In a message posted on social media, Ubisoft called the rumours "inaccurate", saying it wanted to "clarify" issues after it learned "inaccurate rumours have been circulating online regarding the upcoming Animus Hub (ex-codename Infinity)".</p>
<p>The post adds "all the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free, there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass featured in the Animus Hub, and players will have access to regular content [and] missions at no extra cost".</p>
<p>The post ended on promising to "unveil more details about it closer to the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows".</p>
<p>As our report yesterday intimated, there's nothing specified in the rumours that hasn't been done in an Assassin's Creed game before. But interestingly, nothing in Ubisoft's new statement contradicts our report from yesterday, either.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> is officially 20 years old this weekend, and to mark the occasion Valve has released a special anniversary update, bundling in a brand-new documentary, commentary, the previously separate Episodes 1 &amp; 2, and more. Oh, and the game's free to keep over the next few days.
</p>
<p>
Valve's seminal shooter sequel, which charts the continuing adventures of bespectacled scientist Gordon Freeman and his deeply erotic love affair with a prising tool, released into the world on 16th November, 2004. It was immediately heralded as a classic of the genre, and Valve has done everything in its power not to release a numbered sequel since.
</p>
<p>
But now, 20 years on, Valve is in a celebratory mood, and - much as it did when the original Half-Life <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-gets-25th-anniversary-update-with-restored-content-new-maps-and-more">reached the big two-five last year</a> - it's released a special anniversary update introducing bonus material, previously separate bits of DLC, and a whole range of tweaks.

<figcaption>Or you can watch the Half-Life 2 documentary right here.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
There is, for starters, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">new documentary</a> created by Secret Tape. "It's about a lot more than just the making of a game," explains Valve in its announcement. "Running out of money. Getting hacked, and an early version being leaked online. Being sued by our publisher. Trying to build Steam. It's all in there!" It's also unearthed a number of old presentations from across Half-Life 2's development, which it's <a href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th">shoved on its anniversary website</a>.
</p><p>
Additionally, Valve has recorded a brand-new Half-Life 2 commentary for its latest update, and it's also permanently bundled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2-episode-one">Half-Life 2: Episode One</a>, Episode Two, and Lost Coast - all previously available separately - together with the base game. That's alongside the addition of integrated Steam Workshop support, meaning everyone can browse and download player-created content from directly within the game.
</p>
<p>
But that's still not the end of it. Valve says every map has been looked over by its level designers to "fix longstanding bugs, restore content and features lost to time, and improve the quality of a few things like lightmap resolution and fog". It's also added new graphics settings meaning players can now choose between the original launch day blood and fire effects or those introduced in Half-Life 2's later episodes; it's updated gamepad controls and aim assistance, and it's also possible to play with only the highest detail models in High Quality mode. Full patch notes, if you're curious, can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/5914976662778213744?l=english">found in Valve's announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>
All the above is now available as part of Half-Life 2's free 20th anniversary update on Steam. And if you don't already own a copy of Half-Life 2, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">free to download and keep on Valve's platform</a>, provided you pick it up before Monday, 18th November at 6pm in the UK.
