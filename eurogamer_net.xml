The slow swell of Nintendo Switch Online's N64 library continues with a brand-new addition for Expansion Pack subscribers: developer Rare's much-loved 1996 fighter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killer-instinct-gold">Killer Instinct Gold</a> is available now in the west, with Japan getting something else entirely.
</p>
<p>
Rare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killer-instinct">Killer Instinct</a> series - something of a response to the hugely popular (and considerably more violent) Mortal Kombat games - debuted in arcades back in 1994, with the series making its home console debut on SNES  later that year. A sequel, Killer Instinct 2, hit arcades in 1996, and it's this version that later made its way to the N64 under the name Killer Instinct Gold.
</p>
<p>
Killer Instinct Gold offered a bit of a glow-up compared to its console predecessor, replacing the previously 2D backdrops with new-fangled 3D. The pre-rendered characters, though, remained staunchly two dimensional across its 11-strong roster of new and returning fighters, which included the likes of Sabrewulf, Riptor, Galcius, and Spinal. Gold was warmly received at the time, but would mark the start of over a decade-and-a-half of dormancy for the series, which didn't return until 2013's Killer Instinct reboot on Xbox.

<p>
Anyone looking to relive the halcyon days of 1996 now have the option to do so on Switch, as long as they've got themselves a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription. Things are a little different for members in Japan, however, where the service's latest N64 addition is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ridge-racer-64">Ridge Racer 64</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ridge-racer-64-is-finally-playable-again-after-its-n64-debut-25-years-ago">arrived in the west back in January this year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Killer Instinct Gold and the rest of Nintendo's Switch Online classic games catalogue will also be available to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> owners with an Expansion Pack subscription <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">when the console arrives on 5th June</a>. In addition to the already available NES, SNES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, N64, and Sega Mega Drive titles, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">Switch 2 also brings access to a range of GameCube classics</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, Soul Calibur 2, and F-Zero GX are all currently confirmed for launch day.

            <p>
Bungie has admitted that an external artist's work has been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent. 
</p>
<p>
The issue came to light yesterday following recent playable alpha tests of Marathon, from which an artist recognised their designs had been used.
</p>
<p>
"The Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017," artist <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">Fern Hook wrote on social media</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language i have refined for the last decade, but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution."

<p>
Responding via its less-visible <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">Marathon Dev Team social media account</a>, Bungie wrote that it had "immediately investigated" Hook's claim and found that, yes, a former artist at the company had swiped the designs.
</p>
<p>
"This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred," Bungie wrote. "We take matters like this very seriously. We have reached out to 
[Hook]  to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.
</p>
<p>
"As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission," Bungie continued, stating - if it needed to be said - that the developer does not endorse plagiarism. 
</p>
<p>
"To prevent similar issues in the future, we are conducting a thorough review of our in-game assets, specifically those done by the former Bungie artist, and implementing stricter checks to document all artist contributions," the publisher concluded.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Bungie has faced claims of using artists' work without permission - with multiple instances coming to light regarding designs for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.

"I don't have the resources nor the energy to spare to pursue this legally but I have lost count of the number of times a major company has deemed it easier to pay a designer to imitate or steal my work than to write me an email," Hook concluded.
</p>
<p>
"In 10 years I have never made a consistent income from this work and I am tired of designers from huge companies moodboarding and parasitising my designs while I struggle to make a living."
</p>
<p>
Bungie's Marathon reboot is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 23rd September. We recently got a solid look at the upcoming sci-fi shooter - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">here's everything about Marathon you need to know</a>.
