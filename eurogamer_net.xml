<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s Light and Darkness Saga is poised to wrap up yet again this week, as part of a "final epilogue" developer Bungie is calling Heresy.  Notably, though, the studio has warned it won't be an all-singing, all-dancing finale - or an all-talking one, at least - given the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike means it's releasing with some of its voice lines missing.
</p>
<p>
Video game performers within the US actors union SAG-AFTRA (Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">voted to go on strike last July</a>, after negotiations with major game companies over the use of AI failed to result in a deal. And with the strike still ongoing, Bungie has confirmed "certain voice lines" in its Heresy update won't be voiced.
</p>
<p>
"With this being our final epilogue entry for the Light and Darkness Saga, our teams have been taking great care to deliver delightful narrative beats and story content for players to enjoy," it <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25">wrote in a blog post</a> shared on its website. "Due to the on-going SAG-AFTRA strike, you may notice certain voice lines being silent in-game."
</p>
<figure></figure>
<p>
To ensure narrative content can still be followed by players, Bungie says it's enabled subtitles in the Heresy update by default. All activities with missing voice lines will feature a warning beforehand, and the studio points players toward Destiny 2's subtitle customisation and accessibility options so they can "prepare for introductory sequences impacted by this change."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear if Bungie intends to patch in Heresy's missing voice lines at a later date if an agreement is reached with SAG-AFTRA.
</p>
<p>
Back in January, SAG-AFTRA confirmed over 130 games had signed to its Interim Interactive Media Agreement, giving companies "access to [its] members under fair and equitable conditions." However, as voice actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer at the time</a>, there were still hold-outs. "There are a couple of entities who want to protect their potential profits in the future and leave lots of doors open," she explained, "and those doors could potentially hurt us a lot."

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> has said it will offer a full refund to players with tickets to a major in-person event later this month in Los Angeles, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-tells-staff-impacted-by-la-wildfires-that-what-matters-most-is-taking-care-of-yourselves-and-each-other">the city's devastating wildfires</a>, should they no longer be unable or wish to go. 
</p>
<p>
Players who have paid for the event's $30 entry fee have the option to refund their ticket via in-app support at any time up until the event on 23rd February, Niantic has said. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles is otherwise set to continue as planned, with an in-person experience at the Rose Bowl Stadium and Brookside Golf Course in Pasadena, and citywide gameplay across Los Angeles and Orange County. 
</p>
<p>
"Our team has been watching the situation in Los Angeles, prioritising the safety and well-being of Pasadena, the greater Los Angeles area, and our Pokémon Go community," Niantic said in a statement. 
</p>
<p>
"In partnership with the Rose Bowl Operating Company and local authorities, we have made the decision to continue holding the in Pokémon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles experience."
</p>
<p>
The event is set to feature a major in-person meet-up and sneak peek at gameplay set to debut globally when Pokémon Go Tour: Unova rolls out worldwide on the weekend of 1st and 2nd March. This includes the debut of Black Kyurem and White Kyurem, and the Shiny version of Mythical creature Meloetta.
</p><p>
This year's wildfires in the Los Angeles area have claimed the lives of at least 27 people and destroyed more than 18,000 structures, leaving whole neighbourhoods ruined. Numerous <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-donation-to-los-angeles-wildfire-relief">video game and entertainment companies have donated to relief efforts</a> over the past month.
</p>
<p>
Treyarch co-founder Peter Akemann - who more recently served as president of Skydance Interactive - has pleaded guilty to flying the drone that crashed into, and grounded, a firefighting plane assisting in the efforts to control the wildfires. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treyarch-co-founder-pleads-guilty-to-flying-drone-that-crashed-into-firefighting-plane-during-la-wildfires">He now faces up to a year in prison</a>.
