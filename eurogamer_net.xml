            <p>A former boss of Amazon Games has detailed why the company couldn't compete with Valve's Steam platform for PC sales.</p>
<p>Ethan Evans was VP of Prime Gaming at Amazon until September 2020, and in a recent post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ethanevansvp_as-vp-of-prime-gaming-at-amazon-we-failed-activity-7295834479036702720-cDmX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAVvKbEB4BSwtr1FhSqcqk72HAWxOtwQlK0">LinkedIn</a> he detailed how Amazon "failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam".</p>
<p>"We were at least 250 times bigger, and we tried everything," he wrote. "But ultimately, Goliath lost."</p>

<p>Amazon tried three times to enter the "online-game-store market", said Evans. The first was by acquiring the small PC games store Reflexive Entertainment and trying to scale it, but this "went nowhere".</p>
<p>The second, after Amazon bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, was to create its own PC games store and utilise the Twitch audience for sales. "Our assumption was that gamers would naturally buy from us because they were already using Twitch," said Evans. "Wrong."</p>
<p>The third effort from Amazon was its Luna streaming service, which competed with Google's own ill-fated Stadia - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stadia-is-shutting-down-in-january">shut down in January 2023</a>. Luna remains live, but Evans admitted neither Amazon nor Google's efforts "gained significant traction". "The whole time, Steam dominated despite being a relatively small company (compared to Amazon and Google)," he said.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? "The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam," said Evans. "It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well."</p>
<p>He continued: "At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.</p>
<p>"We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so. And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either.</p>
<p>"Just because you are big enough to build something doesn't mean people will use it."</p>
<p>Amazon still has its Prime Gaming subscription, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-another-20-games-in-february-including-one-for-xbox">this month includes BioShock 2 Remastered and Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>And after publishing multiple MMORPGs, Amazon Games' next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">King of Meat from ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers</a>.</p>
<p>Steam, meanwhile, has just seen its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-lands-series-second-biggest-start-on-steam">concurrent player numbers peak once again</a> this month, hitting 39.92 million online users.</p>
<p>Steam's other big competitor, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-has-more-pc-players-than-ever-295-million-in-fact">Epic Games Store, also now has more players than ever</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bossa Games, the London-based company behind indie hits <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/surgeon-simulator">Surgeon Simulator</a> and I Am Bread, has announced a second wave of job losses - just a year after it previously shed a third of its staff.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/">statement posted to LinkedIn</a>, company co-founder Henrique Olifers said Bossa had been forced to make "the painful decision to scale back" its size once more.
</p>
<p>
The company will now focus all its efforts on getting its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">open-world airship adventure Lost Skies</a> out the door, before "reshap[ing] into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how many staff have been impacted by these latest layoffs, though Olifers wrote that the changes meant the studio would be "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time".
</p>
<p>
"We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back or teams," Olifers continued, "but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour."
</p>
<p>
The co-CEO blamed the action on a "fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams", though did not elaborate further how Bossa had been affected in particular.
</p>
<p>
At the start of 2024, Bossa was thought to employ around 60 people, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-studios-lets-go-a-third-of-its-staff">layoffs saw 19 jobs lost which Olifers blamed on a "perfect storm of events"</a> at the time: higher development costs, funding delays, and a tougher market for indie games.
</p>
<p>
It's been four years since Bossa last shipped a game - I Am Fish. It remains best known for Surgeon Simulator, which it launched in 2013 and followed up with various other versions for smartphones, Switch and VR.
</p>
<p>
Bossa had previously received funding from NetEase, the Chinese giant that is currently pulling back from many of its gaming studio investments across the globe. 
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tinybuild-acquires-bossa-studios-ips-for-3m">Bossa sold the rights to I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator</a> to US indie publisher TinyBuild, generating a reported $3m.
