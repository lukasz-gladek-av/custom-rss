            <p><strong>UPDATE 6.46pm</strong>: In a statement to Eurogamer, Epic Games' senior communications manager, Brian Sharon, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place."</blockquote>
<p>Original story follows.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Horses developer Santa Ragione has responded to comments from an Epic Games Store executive claiming he "made provably incorrect statements about the game's content".</p>
<p>Posting the statement online over the weekend, Santa Ragione refuted claims that Epic Games Store "love" the studio, alleging the storefront had "ghosted" it when it withdrew support for its controversial horror game at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Santa Ragione's Horses was, of course, the subject of multiple headlines ahead of its release as Steam <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">refused to distribute the game</a>. Then, just before its release, it was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">banned from the Epic storefront</a>. This all put the studio into jeopardy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">with founder Pietro Righi Riva telling Eurogamer it could face closure if Horses didn't sell well</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">Santa Ragione claimed that it had received notification from Epic 24 hours before Horses' release</a>, explaining it would no longer distribute the game after its "review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines". Epic's email specifically referenced its policies around "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content", saying Horses contravenes guidelines prohibiting content that "promotes abuse and animal abuse", and "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour or [that is] not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated".</p>
<p>On this latter point, Epic said it had filled out an IARC Questionnaire based on the content it reviewed, receiving an Adult Only (AO) rating - a rating category it does not distribute on its storefront.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, however, Epic VP Steve Allison told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game">Game File</a> in an interview, "We love [Santa Ragione] [... but the studio's] answers were just different than... some of the moderators' were after they played through the game".</p>
<p>"Our time on this topic was limited, but it seems news of the Steam ban triggered an Epic review of the rating, which is usually produced via a self-reported submission to a ratings coalition," Game File's Stephen Totilo later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me7ljfxjes2i">clarified</a> on social media.</p>

<p>"The fact that the game does not deserve an AO rating is apparent from the widely available full walkthroughs on YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, as well as from its distribution on the Humble Store," the studio added.</p>

            <p>The creator of the Rayman series has once again teased that a remake of the original Rayman game is on the way.</p>
<p>In an interview with RetroGamer and spotted by the Rayman Merchandise fan account, Michel Ancel teased that while he "do[esn't] remember" the specifics, the remake "will be in HD and I think Ubisoft is adding a few more checkpoints and things like that just to make it a bit less frustrating".</p>

<p>"I think Rayman is still a fun game, and there's a lot of content," Michel told <a href="https://retrogamesofficial.com/">RetroGamer</a>. "The pacing is a bit slow because you have a big character on the screen. It also has pixel-precise gameplay, so it's not always easy, but it's interesting that the constraints of yesterday make it still feel original today.</p><p>"Even though it's complex, I think there's a kind of remake planned," he added. "I think it's a nice move, because [the lack of savepoints is] the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps now one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">second only to the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>, the unannounced Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-unannounced-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-popped-up-on-the-australian-ratings-board">even popped up on the Australian Classification Board</a>. The Australian government has rated it a 'G' - the equivalent to the UK's 'U' - for its "very mild impact" violence. It's reportedly coming to both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch, with Atari listed as both the developer and publisher.</p>
<p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, towards the end of last year, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-series-returns-to-life-on-its-30th-anniversary-but-dont-expect-a-new-game-soon">and provided a little teaser of what's to come</a>. In a video posted on the official Rayman X account, which had been dormant for years prior to the announcement, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>It's now unclear, however, if those plans have been scuppered by Ubisoft's "reset" in which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a>, including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. The news wiped<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years"> over a third off its share price</a>.</p>
