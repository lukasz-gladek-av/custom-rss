            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> received both its Season One update yesterday, as well as the Redsec battle royale mode in a massive content update for the popular military FPS. Not everyone is happy though.</p>
<p>While many are having a good time with the update, others are dejected due to the influx of microtransactions, relatively colourful cosmetics, and weekly battle pass challenges that can push players towards the battle royale mode they may not be interested in. It seems like Battlefield 6, which has largely been sailing smoothly since launch, has hit turbulent weather.</p>
<p>Starting with the battle pass, you progress through it via BP points, which are earned <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oio6d7/dear_dice_if_i_wanted_to_play_a_terrible/">through the completion of weekly challenges</a> as well as XP gained through playing. These points unlock tiers of the battle pass, filled with cosmetics, boosts, and currency rewards.</p>

<p>These challenges previously could be completed in any mode for the most part, aside from a few specific challenges for certain unlockables. However these battle pass challenges can force players to jump into the battle royale. They can be rerolled, but if you reroll and land on battle royale challenges, you're stuck with them.</p>
<p>These cosmetics are <em>largely</em> thematic with the military aesthetic of Battlefield 6, such as various digital camouflages. However these have rubbed some players the wrong way, especially, those that found the authentic look of the classes at launch appealing.</p>
<p>The battle pass also isn't simply offered in a free and paid form. Players can buy separate bundles that provide different rewards. There's the Season One Starter pack, the Season One Advanced Pack, the Rogue Ops pack, and the Season One Pro Pack. Then there are the skins added to the in-game store itself, which must be bought with Battlefield coins.</p><p>It's a sharp turn away from the more pure FPS experience people have been playing in droves this month, and what seemed to tempt people to the game as they tire of the uber-capitalist trudge that Call of Duty has become.</p>
