            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' release finally almost upon us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">after multiple delays</a>, Ubisoft is rattling through its remaining announcements - with its latest update detailing the various enhancements <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> owners can take advantage of come launch on 20th March.
</p>
<p>
As per a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/06/assassins-creed-shadows-20-minutes-of-new-castle-gameplay-launches-march-20/">post on the PlayStation Blog</a> (hence the absence of details relating to the Xbox version), Assassin's Creed Shadows features a choice of three different graphics modes - Performance, Fidelity, and Balanced - and can played at up to 2160p and 60 FPS on both PS5 and PS5 Pro when Performance mode is selected.
</p>
<p>
In all cases, ray tracing is supported, but your machine and selected mode will determine exactly what kind of raytracing you can expect. PlayStation 5's Performance mode, for instance, features "selective" ray tracing, which Ubisoft defines as computing "global illumination for diffuse lighting in the Hideout portion of the game".

<p>
Standard raytracing, meanwhile - applied in Fidelity or Balanced modes on PS5 and Performance mode on PS5 Pro - is "used to compute global illumination for diffuse lighting throughout the game world". And that just leaves PS5 Pro's "extended" ray tracing, which computes "global illumination for diffuse lighting and reflective surfaces throughout the game world" when applied in either Fidelity or Balanced modes.
</p>
<p>
The full breakdown of supported resolutions, frame rates, and ray tracing options per console and mode is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PS5 – Performance Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 60 FPS, Selective Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 – Fidelity Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 30 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 – Balanced Mode (requires 120/240hz display and HDMI 2.1)</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 40 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Performance Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 60 FPS, Standard Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Fidelity Mode</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 30 FPS, Extended Ray Tracing</li>
<li>PS5 Pro – Balanced Mode (requires 120/240hz display and HDMI 2.1)</li>
<li>2160p upscaled, 40 FPS, Extended Ray Tracing</li>
</ul>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">left a positive impression on Eurogamer's Katharine Castle</a> earlier this year - launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 20th March. But if you're looking for a more granular release breakdown, Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-global-launch-times-detailed-pre-load-live-now-on-xbox">detailed its global launch times</a> too.

            <p>If you were one of the many Eurogamer readers who lamented the fact that Sorry We're Closed didn't release on consoles as well as PC, well I'm pleased to say I have good news.</p>
<p>Developer à la mode games' eccentric story-driven survival horror game about demons, angels and what happens when both sides collide is now available across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>You can check out the console launch trailer below.</p>

<p>Along with its console debut, the Sorry We're Closed team has also added some new features to the game, including New Game+ and gyro controls for those playing on Switch or PlayStation.</p>
<p>Here are all the new features coming to Sorry We're Closed, which are available for both PC and consoles today:</p>
<ul>
<li>The demon world is now more accessible than ever with rebalanced combat areas, improved controller sensitivity, aim assist options and new difficulty modes.</li>
<li>Restart the adventure in New Game+ to keep your upgrades and collectables as you explore alternate story paths.</li>
<li>Race against the clock to improve your combat level scores in Time Attack mode.</li>
<li>Motion-controlled aiming, including gyroscope support on Nintendo Switch and motion sensor aiming on PlayStation, for even greater precision.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, that's not all. As well as a console release, the developer has also teamed up with publisher Serenity Forge to reveal a premium physical edition of Sorry We're Closed for both PS5 and Nintendo Switch, which is slated for later this year.</p>
<p>Along with a copy of the game, this edition will also include a holographic sticker sheet (featuring Mimi the rat!), a soundtrack download card of the OST, and a design booklet (including character profiles, art and insight of the game).</p>
<p>The digital game is retailing for $24.99 (I am double checking UK pricing) across platforms. You can find <a href="https://linktr.ee/sorrywe.reclosed">links to purchase Sorry We're Closed here</a>.</p>
<p>That aforementioned physical edition, meanwhile, <a href="https://store.serenityforge.com/products/sorry-we-re-closed-premium-edition">can be preordered here for $44.99</a>.</p>

<p>Our Katharine was rather enamored with Sorry We're Closed on its PC release last year.</p>
<p>"Bold, raw and effortlessly stylish, Sorry We're Closed uses the building blocks of survival horror to tell a compelling and hard-hitting love story to brilliant effect," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-were-closed-review">Eurogamer's Sorry We're Closed review</a>, which comes with a rather impressive four stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
