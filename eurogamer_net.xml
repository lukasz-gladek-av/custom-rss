            <p>
Sirens of the Deep, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s latest animated The Witcher movie - which is perhaps most notable for the fact it'll see Doug Cockle reprising his video game role as the gravelly voiced Geralt of Rivia - now has a release date, and is streaming from 11th February.
</p>
<p>
Sirens of the Deep is based on The Witcher author Andrzej Sapkowski's short story A Little Sacrifice, and begins with Geralt investigating a series of attacks in a seaside village. One thing leads to another, however, and everybody's favourite white-haired grump soon finds himself drawn into a centuries-old conflict between humans and merpeople.
</p>
<p>
"He must count on friends â€” old and new," Netflix teases in its announcement, "to solve the mystery before the hostilities between the two kingdoms escalate into all-out war."

<p>
Geralt will be joined by Anya Chalotra and Joey Batey, reprising their live-action TV series roles of Yennefer and Jaskier respectively, and the whole thing is being directed by Kang Hei Chul - who helmed Netflix's previous animated Witcher movie, 2021's surprisingly decent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/our-best-look-yet-at-the-witchers-animated-prequel">Nightmare of the Wolf</a>. And if that's whet your appetite, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYzqa1CDTik">new two-minute trailer</a> to view.

As for what's next for Netflix's The Witcher, that'll be season four of the streaming service's divisive live-action adaptation, which sees Liam Hemsworth taking over the role of Geralt of Rivia following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Henry Cavill's departure</a> in 2022. But if it's more Cockle you want, he'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-of-town-that-was-definitely-doug-cockles-white-haired-monster-hunter-in-the-witcher-4s-reveal-trailer">be back</a> in CD Projekt's recently unveiled next Witcher game - although not as the protagonist, given <a href="hhttps://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Ciri is officially the focus this time around</a>.
