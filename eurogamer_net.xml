        <p>Quite the gamble, but here's why it's happening.</p>

            <p>Betting sponsorships are being introduced into tier one Valorant and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> esports, Riot Games has revealed.</p>
<p>This announcement <a href="https://x.com/riotgames/status/1938282007148253261">came in the form of a lengthy post by John Needham</a>, head of publishing and esports at Riot Games. In it, Needham justifies the inclusion of sports betting as part of the company's desire to build "a sustainable ecosystem" for its games.</p>
<p>Needham said this is something professional teams "have been asking us to consider for years". Gambling sponsors will be permitted across the Americas and EMEA regions, with no stated plans to permit these sorts of sponsorships among other regions around the world.</p>

<p>Needham goes on to explain: "We know sports betting isn't for everyone, and that some fans have strong feelings about it, and we respect that. However, the reality is that betting activity already exists around our sports and will continue whether we engage with it or not."</p>
<p>He continued: "Historically, this has been a restricted sponsorship category, and Riot has not engaged with betting companies. Teams have asked us to reconsider our stance, and after years of analysis to ensure we got it right, we agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams."</p>
<p>Needham goes on to explain that, according to sports technology company Sportradar, total betting turnover in just League of Legends esports exceeded $10.7bn, with 70 percent of those bets taking place on unregulated sites via unlicensed bookmakers. As such, it is Riot's position from here on out that if betting is going to happen, it may as well happen under its watch.</p>
<p>Needham also established three "guardrails" for its new sports betting partnership program. These include opening up sponsorship opportunities with betting brands to generate revenue, supporting the development of regulations and education programs around esports betting, and strengthening competitive integrity around Riot's esports events.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that recently the tier two Valorant scene was in the midst of a serious competitive integrity scandal, as Sean Gares, general manager of esports team Shopify Rebels, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-hHuBN27Nk&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=seangares">released a video exposing </a>the prevalence of match-fixing and the intentional throwing of games.</p>
<p>In the post Needham then stated Riot would be vetting all betting partners, mandate team integrity checks, and that it would use the proceeds of these betting partnerships to maintain its tier two competitive scene. That tier two scene being an aspect of the wider Riot esports space that has struggled immensely with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23619393/disguised-toast-twitch-streamer-valorant-dsg">financial stability</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Needham assured the public that no Riot-owned broadcasts would feature advertisements for betting companies. A nice stance, though it's worth noting that <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-casters-viewership-results-worlds-2024">according to a report by esports charts</a>, 40 percent of English speaking viewership for Worlds (the biggest annual event for League of Legends) come from co-streams. These aren't Riot-owned, and judging by Needham's statement won't be barred from taking betting sponsorships.</p>
<figure>

<p>Okay, so why is this happening? Well, as you may or may not know, esports has largely been a hole in which you burn money in. It has historically struggled with generating profit. It has long been true that esports has been sold as a way to reach a younger audience to plenty of massive companies, many of them have since pulled back from the industry <a href="https://digiday.com/media/how-the-worlds-most-ambitious-esports-league-shrank-to-nothing-an-oral-history-of-the-overwatch-league/">following the collapse of the Overwatch League</a>.</p>
<p>Add on top of this an increase in expansion and investment during Covid when interest in gaming was incredibly high. This growth did not continue as expected, leading to a real financial crisis for the esports sector <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2024/03/esports-layoff-tracker-2024">with layoffs hitting the sector in the years </a>following. If you've been paying attention to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">ongoing game development layoffs these past years</a>, it's a similar thing.</p>
<p>But it's actually worse. The problem is that throughout all these years esports teams have either failed to, or ignored the need to, use the money they had to create a stable income revenue. If you release a game, you can sell the game itself or microtransactions. If you own an esports team, you sell… T-shirts? All the games are streamed online for free, you don't have the equivalent of a football stadium. It's dire.</p>
<p>As such esports teams have essentially spent the last few years hopping from one wallet to another, looking for capital to stay afloat. With the speculative investors walking out the door, they've turned to the Saudi Arabian government and its Esports World Cup in recent years. Saudi Arabia, a country with <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/">an ongoing history of human rights abuses</a>, also happens to have a lot of money, and is keen on spending it on PR to make the country look appealing. This is called Sportswashing: it's prevalent in football, F1, and yes, video games.</p>
<p>But even this isn't sustainable. Saudi Arabia could twist the money faucet off any time it wants to, and given the country will be <a href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/inaugural-olympic-esports-games-to-be-held-in-riyadh-in-2027-road-to-the-games-to-start-this-year">hosting the video game olympics starting in 2027</a>, maybe the need to throw away so much money will lessen.</p>
<p>So esports teams need another source of income: gambling. As you can see yourself in Needham's statement, it repeatedly mentions the push from the teams themselves to implement betting sponsors into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ultimately, regardless of all the guardrails Riot Games may implement, it's a bummer. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gambling-related-harms-evidence-review/gambling-related-harms-evidence-review-summary--2">Sports betting is addictive</a>. It has and will ruin lives. A UK government report cites two quantitative studies that found deaths from suicide were "significantly higher among adults with gambling disorder or problems compared to the general adult population."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-opens-the-door-to-betting-sponsorships-in-professional-league-of-legends-and-valorant]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Mario Smash Football, also known as Super Mario Strikers outside of Europe, is the next GameCube classic making its way to Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>Mario Smash Football was originally released back in 2005 for the GameCube. Now, in a little under a week's time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> owners who are also Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack members will be able to get back on the pitch with Mario and co, as Mario Smash Football joins the service on 3rd July.</p>

<p>"Matches unfold with white-hot speed, intensity, and familiar items, like shells and mushrooms, to give you a boost in crushing your opponent," reads the official blurb. "But the real key to winning is the Super Strike, a powerful shot that can net you two points at once! Jump right in with simple controls, hone your techniques, and hit the pitch with Mario and his friends!"</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for it all in the video above (it's the US version, because Nintendo UK has not uploaded its own one yet).</p>
<p>Mario Smash Football is joining the likes of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">GameCube's Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2 and F-Zero GX</a>, which all arrived on Switch Online with the Switch 2's release. Personally, I have enjoyed pootling about the waters with Link once again.</p>
<p>If you are also enjoying the Switch 2's GameCube offerings, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-has-a-secret-gamecube-startup-sound">Nintendo has tucked away a little Easter egg you may have missed</a>…</p>
