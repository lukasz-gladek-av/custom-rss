            <p>Harrison Ford has praised Troy Baker's depiction of his iconic whip-toting archaeologist in Xbox's recent release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>Ford was interviewed by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f">Wall Street Journal</a>, and discussed the suggestion someone might use AI to replicate his likeness in the future. Notably, his last appearance in the Indiana Jones film series includes a digitalised de-aged likeness of himself, seen through flashbacks.</p>
<p>"You don't need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent," said Ford, before referring to Baker's performance as the iconic Indy.  "He did a brilliant job, and it didn't take AI to do it."</p>

</figure>
<p>Indeed, Ford isn't concerned with AI. "My plan is to keep working behind that face till I don't care what happens anymore. I'm selling that piece by piece while I'm alive," he said. "I've been compensated. You don't need to worry about me."</p>
<p>AI has been a major talking point for video game actors, and a key hold-up in negotiations between actors' union SAG-AFTRA and the video game industry as a strike continues.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke to celebrated video game actor Jennifer Hale</a> about the strikes, with Hale describing AI as "an existential issue for all of us".</p>
<p>"We need to be able to control when our voice is used," she said. "I don't want my voice used on a project that I would never support or that I didn't say yes to. We need to be compensated for when our voice is used, because we are paid for our exposure as much as for our time."</p>
<p>If anything, Baker's performance as Indiana Jones proves AI isn't necessary to replicate an iconic character - talent is enough.</p>
<p>Baker has been widely praised for his performance in the game, which begins with a recreation of the prologue from Raiders of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>.</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones, The Great Circle is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">five star review of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. It went on to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">Eurogamer's Game of 2024</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's now been seven years since the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> first arrived on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, during which time work has progressed steadily on this sequel, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delayed-to-2025">originally set to arrive in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Next up for the game will be a series of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-post-launch-roadmap-bringing-barbers-horse-riding-and-more">post-launch updates adding content such as a barbers, and horse racing</a>.

"This gorgeous medieval RPG continues to be just as divisive, prickly and abrasive as its predecessor," we wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">Eurogamer's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review</a>, awarding it three stars.

            <p>Capcom is shutting down its online multiplayer game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-reverse">Resident Evil Re:Verse</a>.</p>

<p>Then, on 29th June 2025 23:59 PDT (that's 30th June 8:59 BST), the service will fully shut down.</p>

<p>"Resident Evil Re:Verse was developed in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Resident Evil series, and your overwhelming support for the game has far exceeded our expectations since the time of its release," reads a <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/reverse/us/topic/topic_250206.html">statement from Capcom</a>.</p>
<p>"Now that we've reached a new turning point for the series, we feel that Resident Evil Re:Verse has served its original, celebratory purpose admirably.</p>
<p>"We are incredibly grateful for your warm support for Resident Evil Re:Verse, and we deeply apologise for bringing you this disappointing news."</p>
<p>Any RP Boosters or content unlocked in the game's Premium Pass will be available from now until servers are shut off.</p>
<p>Though originally intended to release alongside Resident Evil Village, Re:Verse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-reverse-resurfaces">delayed multiple times</a> before eventually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-reverse-has-a-new-october-release-date">releasing in October 2022</a> with Village's Winters Expansion DLC - that was 17 months after Village.</p>
<p>That means Re:Verse has lasted just over two years.</p>
<p>The game was a six-player deathmatch competitive multiplayer mode featuring various characters from across the Resident Evil universe.</p>
<p>Village was followed by the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>, which is now the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-now-the-fastest-selling-resident-evil-game-in-history">fastest-selling game in the series</a>.</p>
<p>As for the next new game in the series, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> director Koshi Nakanishi stated last July a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">fresh installment is in development</a>. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said. "But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
