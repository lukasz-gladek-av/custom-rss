        <p>Amid claims teams learned projects were canned "at the same time as everyone else".</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend Studio says it "still plans on creating cool shit", following Sony's decision to cancel its unannounced live-service game - amid claims Bend and the similarly affected Bluepoint only found out about the cancellations "at the same time as everyone else".
</p>
<p>
Word that Sony had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled two more first-party live service games</a> - this time in development at its Bend and Bluepoint studios - emerged via by Bloomberg last week. Sony, of course, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">plans to invest heavily in live service titles</a> back in 2022, under the watch of then-PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, but the company has cancelled numerous live service games - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">co-op Spider-man from developer Insomniac</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">The Last of Us multiplayer game</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">Twisted Metal project at Firesprite</a> - since Ryan's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">departure last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the latest casualties of Sony's apparent strategic rethink, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claimed Bluepoint had been developing an unannounced live service God of War game. And while no details of Bend's canned project were shared, the studio previously said it was working on a new IP which would include multiplayer and "[build] upon the open-world systems of Days Gone". It's unclear, however, if this is the same game that's now been axed.

<p>
Regardless, Bend has now broken its silence, thanking fans for their support and offering assurances it's not done yet. "I'll keep this short," Bend community manager Kevin McAllister wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623">message shared on social media</a>. "Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool shit."
</p><p>
As to what's next for Bluepoint and Bend, that remains uncertain. According to journalist Jeff Grubb in his latest Game Mess Mornings video show (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bluepoint-and-bend-staff-learned-their-live-service-ps5-games-were-cancelled-at-the-same-time-as-everyone-else/">VGC</a>), both teams have had little time to process the news. "The two studios found out at the same time as everyone else," Grubb told listeners, "so people will be going into work today wondering, 'Hey, okay, what are we doing next?'. And what they're going to have to do next, very likely, is pitch something to Sony, and the landscape of that has changed pretty drastically.”
</p>
<p>
"A couple of years ago," he continued, "you'd bring to PlayStation your pitch, that is: 'It's a live service game, we know you want to hear that'... And now they have to go back to the drawing board, and come up with a pitch that PlayStation wants to hear, when no one really knows what they want to hear, and so it's a rough situation."
</p>
<p>
Following last week's cancellations, Sony told Bloomberg "neither of the two affected PlayStation studios will be shut down", adding that the "highly accomplished teams" would be "working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects".
</p>
<p>
Sony's continuing shift away from live service titles follows the high-profile failure of last year's Concord, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after its launch</a> amid low player numbers. Back in 2023 it was reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">company was "uncomfortable"</a> about former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's decision to focus heavily on live service games.

            <p>Concept art for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film has been released, revealing cut content and a look at secret characters from the post-credits scene.</p>
<p>The images are from Chinese designers at Tian He Yan Studio, shared earlier today on <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5124957166633153">Weibo</a> (some <strong>film spoilers ahead</strong>!).</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the images have been released a day before the film becomes available digitally, just a month after its release in cinemas.</p>

<p>"This time we are mainly responsible for the drawing of some keyframes and some character modeling," reads the post from Tian He Yan Studio. "The keyframe concept map helps to establish the tone style of the film, and can also assist in guiding the work of visual effects."</p>
<p>Most of the images depict key events from the film. There's Shadow and Maria meeting, Eggman watching a telenovela, Super Sonic and Super Shadow battling in space, and that adorable Chao Garden restaurant scene.</p>
<p>But there's more. Knuckles and Tails are seen riding a motorbike through the streets of London chased by a giant ball of debris, like something out of the Katamari games, in what I presume was a cut action sequence. Another image shows the three Sonic heroes in flight as they escape some sort of sand explosion, with Knuckles covered in scorpions.</p>

<p>Two images are most interesting of all, though, showing both Amy Rose and Metal Sonic. Both of these characters are teased in the film's post-credit scene - it's unclear from this artwork if they were originally intended for this film instead, or if this artwork was created solely for their reveals.</p><p>Either way, this could be an indication of what to expect in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">confirmed film sequel Sonic 4</a>. Amy, for instance, is seen standing over Sonic just as she does in her reveal, though there's a large destroyed robot that's not the Metal Sonic we see in Sonic 3. What's going on in the background?</p>

<p>The other image shows Metal Sonic alongside Eggman wearing some sort of elaborate emperor garb, a cyberpunk-esque metropolis in the background. This was certainly not part of Sonic 3, with fans suggesting it could be some sort of bad future. If true, it would line up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-next-for-the-sonic-films-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-post-credits-scene">theories the next film will be inspired by the time-travelling Sonic CD</a>.</p>

            <p>TeamKill Media is resisting calls to release its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a>-like Code Violet on PC as it doesn't want anyone modding "vulgar versions" of its characters.</p>
<p>Addressing players on social media, the team said it held its voice actresses and actors "with high regard" and "making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make".</p>

<p>Code Violet is expected to release in July 2025, exclusively on PS5.</p>
<p>TeamKill's statement is reminiscent of Koei Tecmo's position, which recently revealed it had taken "strict action" against thousands of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/koei-tecmos-protective-about-its-dead-or-alive-ip-because-the-characters-are-like-daughters">provocative Dead or Alive fanart images because the characters are "like daughters" to their creators</a>.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo's legal affairs lead, Tomotoshi Nishimura, recently addressed a copyright conference in which he revealed that whilst the company was pragmatic and even supportive of "<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/otaku">otaku</a>" fan culture, it had no choice but to issue copyright strikes against amateur images that are created for, uh, "adult purposes".</p>
<p>Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-asks-pc-players-to-avoid-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods">also recently asked PC players not to install any "offensive or inappropriate" mods</a> once the game is released.</p>
<p>Conversely, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian Studios <em>loves</em> mods. After recently revealing over 100m mods have been downloaded, it gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">Baldur's Gate 3's Withers a pair of "big naturals"</a>...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
