It's been a busy couple of week in Nintendo presentation land. First we had that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">third-party-focused partner showcase</a>, then it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-indie-world-showcase-heres-everything-announced">turn of the indies</a>, leaving everyone to speculate that a proper Direct showcase much <em>surely</em> be on the way. And, well, here we are, sort of. Today's 45-minute Direct is apparently focused exclusively on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s upcoming Kirby Air Riders - and if that appeals, here's where you'll be able to watch it unfold.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Kirby Air Riders Direct officially gets underway today, 19th August, at 2pm BST. That's 3pm CEST for our European chums, and 6am PDT/9am EDT/7am MDT/8am CDT for anyone over in the US. And, yes, you did read that right earlier; Nintendo has confirmed we're in for a full 45 minutes focused entirely on Kirby Air Riders - which seems like a lot considering it managed to squeeze its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct into less than 18 minutes.

<p>
As you might expect, today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn5c4RkoYAc">Kirby Air Riders Direct airs on YouTube</a> and promises an "in-depth look" at the game, as presented by its director, the legendary Masahiro Sakurai - who also created its underrated 2003 predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, alongside the considerably more fondly remembered Smash Bros. series.
</p>
<p>

And if you need a reminder, all we've seen of Kirby Air Riders so far is its announcement trailer from back in April, which you can watch below while we await today's full Direct reveal.

        <p>UFC 5, The Plucky Squire, and FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch among the best games leaving in a month.</p>

            <p>The games set to leave PlayStation Plus Extra in September have been revealed. The eight titles include some very good games, so you might want to make some time before 16th September to get them played.</p>
<p>As these games are part of the Game Catalogue and not the monthly games that you claim as part of PS Plus Essential, these games will no longer be playable from 16th September even if they are in your library.</p>
<p>Leaving PS Plus Extra on 16th September:</p>
<ul>
<li>UFC 5 (PS5)</li>
<li>The Plucky Squire (PS5)</li>
<li>Night in the Woods (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Road 96 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Pistol Whip (PSVR2)</li>
<li>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir (PS4)</li>
<li>FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Dragon's Crown Pro (PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the bunch, I'd certainly recommend FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch, especially if you are partial to a Metroidvania. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pistol-whip">Pistol Whip</a> is superb if you have PS VR2, and the Plucky Squire is definitely worth a look even though it didn't quite live up to pre-launch expectations. Night in the Woods is also excellent.</p><p>In fact, why stop there... Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir and Dragon's Crown Pro are also very good games. So, really, what I'm saying is, don't rush to play UFC 5 (which is fine, but just more UFC) or Road 96 (didn't enjoy the writing on this, unfortunately), but all the others are worth your time.</p>

            <p>Gears of War creator Cliff 'CliffyB' Bleszinski is "thrilled" more people will be able to experience the original game when it arrives on PlayStation.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is set to be released later this month, on 26th August, across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. It's a revamped edition of the original Gears of War, which first debuted on Xbox almost 20 years ago (yes, it has really been that long). </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">upcoming souped up version will come complete with faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity"</a>, and while he hasn't had a hand in it personally, Bleszinski is delighted that soon those on PlayStation will finally be able to experience the first Gears of War game for themselves.</p>

<p>"It doesn't feel strange," Bleszinski told Eurogamer when asked if it will be odd seeing the once Xbox exclusive popping up on Sony's newest consoles. "I'm thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on."</p><p>The series creator added he is "asked nearly every day on social media" to return to Gears of War. "And I'm like 'uh, I've said it a thousand times I'm open to consult on any of it'," Bleszinski said, before closing:</p>

<p>"Crickets. On to the next!"</p>
<p>Along with his legacy in video games, Bleszinski is also a Broadway producer, restaurant owner and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-creator-cliffyb-says-series-needs-a-god-of-war-style-reboot">comic book creator</a>.</p>
<p>As for Gears of War, in addition to this month's Reloaded release there's also a new series entry in the works. It's known as Gears of War: E-Day, and will be a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>.</p>
<p>Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day. "We are so back," a post announcing their inclusion teased.</p>
