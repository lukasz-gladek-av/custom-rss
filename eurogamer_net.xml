<p>Korean site <a href="https://www.playforum.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=503136">PlayForum</a> has reported developer Shift Up has received a dev kit for Nintendo's new console and has begun initial development work.</p>
<p>The news follows the release last week of Stellar Blade on PC, which has already proven a huge success for the studio - it managed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">record numbers for a PlayStation-published single player game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-proves-theres-appetite-for-playstation-5-games-on-pc-as-it-blasts-past-one-million-sales-in-three-days">sold over a million copies within three days</a> of its release.</p>

<p>According to PlayForum (via machine translation), Shift Up is working on platform-specific optimisation to reflect the Switch 2's lower power compared to Sony's console (and PC).</p>
<p>Indeed, Stellar Blade was one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">first games optimised for Sony's more powerful PS5 Pro console</a> and has been praised for its performance.</p>
<p>PlayForum also stated the Switch 2 version plays into Shift Up's multiplatform strategy, expanding beyond a single-platform hit.</p>
<p>Beyond Stellar Blade, the studio has its Goddess of Victory: Nikke game, plus its newly announced flagship Project Spirits.</p>
<p>A sequel to Stellar Blade is also in development and has been set to a 2027 release in a recent investor presentation from the studio.</p>
<p>Director Hyung-tae Kim stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-better-story-than-stellar-blade">Stellar Blade 2 will address the lack of narrative in the original game</a>, which had its total number of cutscenes cut due to cost-saving measures. This included details on why main character Eve changes clothes so much.</p>
<p>"In the early stages of development, we planned to include detailed settings such as the reason the main character changes clothes in the story. However, as production progressed, the cost of producing cutscenes became too much," he said. "And eventually, for the sake of efficiency, we had no choice but to reduce cutscenes that supplemented the world view or character narratives outside of the main plot. That's how we were barely able to complete the game."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gearbox's Randy Pitchford is "stoked" about Borderlands 4's price point, promising plenty of "awesome" DLC to come after the game's release.</p>
<p>There has been much discussion about how much Borderlands 4 will cost, even before the price was announced. It all kicked off when Pitchford made comments earlier in the year, saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">if you were a "real fan" you would find a way to make a potentially more expensive purchase</a>.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this comment was met with backlash, so the Gearbox exec then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">attempted to justify his comments with a video</a> shared on social media. Here, he admitted he did not know how much Borderlands 4 would cost. </p>
<p>Fast forward to earlier this week, when it was announced the Borderlands 4 standard edition will in fact retail for £59.99 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic</a>, or <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnMAk">£69.99 for the same version on Xbox Series X/S</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAgD0j">PS5</a>. In the US, it's $70.</p>
<p>After the price reveal, Pitchford took to social media to talk about how "stoked" he is about it all. He added the team has "a TON" of "awesome" DLC planned for Borderlands 4. This will be a mix of free and paid for content.</p>
<p>"Just as we aimed to outdo everything we've done before with the main game, we're pulling out all the stops on our end game and our post launch commitment for Borderlands 4," he wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935092460536950936">subsequent social media post</a>, adding the team is "just getting started, baby!"</p>
<p>In Pitchford's words: "We're not holding anything back!" (though, Gearbox does need to "land" the game itself first).</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has received a fresh update for those playing in early access, as the studio finally approaches the final phase of development ahead of a full release.</p>
<p>Supergiant's sequel has been in early access for over a year, with its full release highly anticipated after both the success of the original game and positive praise for Hades 2. While many had expected an announcement as part of Summer Game Fest season (or the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s release), alas that time has come to pass.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for the full release, but at least Hades 2 is approaching its final form. "We're heading into the final phase of Hades 2 development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches," reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512959549469100056">blog post from the developer</a>. "Please note we do not yet have a v1.0 launch date, though we'll share more as soon as we can."</p>

<p>It continues: "As we wind down our Early Access phase, our goal remains ensuring we've created our biggest, most replayable, most feature-rich game yet, and - most importantly - a worthy successor to the original Hades.</p>
<p>"We have a big game to wrap up! While we can't yet say when our v1.0 launch will be, we're very excited to be getting close, and to share the complete experience with you. This also means some of the most important work on Hades 2 is still to come, so may moonlight guide us! And to all our Early Access players, thank you for being here, and sharing your impressions of The Unseen Update with us."</p>
<p>As for The Unseen Update, it adds Hidden Aspects to the Nocturnal Arms, giving each weapon an all-new fighting style to unlock; new "stronger-than-ever" Guardians to beat; expanded magicks with Godsent Hexes; fresh optional story events to strengthen bonds with characters; and revamped Umbral Flames for a "snappier fighting style".</p>
<p>The update is available for free for those who have purchased the game in early access.</p>
<p>To finish Hades 2's development, Supergiant is adding: a true ending to conclude Melinoë's story, Achievements, and final touches of polish. Hopefully that means a launch date won't be too far off.</p>
<p>At the moment the game is only available in early access on Steam, but its full launch will include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">release on Switch and Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive</a>, as confirmed by Supergiant in April.</p>
<p>The original Hades was first released on PC and Switch in full, before arriving on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and later iOS (via Netflix).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-says-grounded-2-wont-have-lan-multiplayer-either-and-its-a-huge-shame<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Grounded 2 won't have local multiplayer support, just as there wasn't - and still isn't - LAN support in the current Grounded game. "We can confirm that Grounded 2 will be consistent with the prior game and does not support LAN multiplayer," a spokesperson from Obsidian told Eurogamer. I asked for an explanation why but was told Obsidian had nothing further to share.</p>
<p>It's a shame. The sequel presents Obsidian with an opportunity to revisit areas of the teens-shrunk-in-a-backyard co-op game that could use revision, and LAN multiplayer is one of these, trivial though it might seem.</p>
<p>Currently, in order to play Grounded with someone in the same room or house as you - and it sounds like this will be the case for the sequel - you need to connect via the internet first. In other words, you need to send a signal out of your house so it can be sent back to your house to connect to the other person's machine. The result? Latency, or lag as it's more commonly called, which causes a delayed response in the game and rubber-banding - a term used to describe characters or creatures which fast-forward suddenly to different places in the game.</p>

<p>Lag is not only annoying to play with but in Grounded's case, deadly. Back at launch, in 2020, I spent a couple of days writing guides about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-spiders-wolf-spiders-orb-weavers-7041">how to kill the spiders in Grounded</a>, because they're a menace, patrolling large areas of the back garden and attacking with speed and aggression if they catch you with eyesight of them. The wolf spiders in particular were ferocious. It was possible to defeat them if you learnt their attack patterns and had precise parry timing, but it was still hard to do.</p>
<p>However, confident I could deal with the spiders, I encouraged my partner to play the game with me, both of us playing on different machines in the same room. But I couldn't beat the spiders; the lag introduced by connecting via the internet meant I couldn't reliably perform the parry timings I'd learned. If I hosted the game, that changed, but one of us always suffered high latency as a result.</p>
<p>I couldn't understand why there was no LAN support in the game, given gaming's long history with LAN multiplayer: local networks were the preferred way to play together before broadband and stable internet connections came in. Plenty of other games - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> for example - offer LAN multiplayer as standard. So I went online to see if I was the only person having the problem. I was not.</p>

<p>"How difficult would it REALLY be for the devs to enable LAN support on multiplayer?" one poster <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GroundedGame/comments/yz3osb/how_difficult_would_it_really_be_for_the_devs_to/">on Reddit asked in 2022</a>, two years after the game's release. "The rubber banding is so bad it makes me not want to play on very decent internet connections..."</p>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/128939-multiplayer-lan-latency-problem/">on the Obsidian forum</a>, again in 2022, a reply to a similar thread read: "This has been an issue from day one. I have posted about it here and on other forums. I have not ever seen the developers mention anything about fixes or work arounds for players attempting to plan LAN or from the same internet connection. It's pretty sad really. In my household we have 5 copies of this game, and we are unable to play it together because of the lag and terrible performance when trying to do so, from the same internet connection."</p>
<p>A lack of LAN support in Grounded is a prevalent enough problem for me and others that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/groundeds-inch-high-garden-survival-is-getting-a-sequel-and-its-out-very-soon">when Grounded 2 was announced a couple of weeks ago</a>, the main thing I was looking for was confirmation of LAN multiplayer support. But of course it never came, despite, again, Obsidian and Xbox underlining the game's focus on co-operative multiplayer.</p>
<p>My worry reading Obsidian's response to Eurogamer, about there being no LAN support in Grounded 2, is this has become the company's stance on the matter - that Grounded 1 and 2 will simply never have LAN support. But why? Is there a fundamental issue with the game's code that prevents LAN play, or is it something to do with Microsoft requiring an Xbox Live sign-in for security and validation reasons? Perhaps it's just a way to push Xbox Live. Even if it's all of those things, I still can't see why LAN support should be an impossibility. It would help if Obisidian would explain.</p>
<p>As it stands, this is disappointing and a missed opportunity. I enjoyed Grounded and I'm excited by the sequel, but I'm put off at the prospect of high latency ruining my co-operative experience again.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 releases 29th July on Steam Early Access and the Xbox Game Preview program.</p>

<p>This update, known as version 1.1.1, also addresses an issue in which items were no longer able to be used, and an issue where players would on occasion slip through the wall before the finish line of DK Spaceport.</p>
