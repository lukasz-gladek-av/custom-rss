            <p>For reasons totally unrelated to the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has given its team a "special holiday" today, 28th February.</p>
<p>In a memo, staff were advised that as many employees hinted that they may be too unwell to work today, management had decided to give the team the day off as a "special holiday".</p>

<p>"On 28th February, we received a series of puzzling reports from many employees that they might feel unwell the next day, so we decided to institute a special holiday for the company," the memo said (as translated by Google).</p>
<p>It then confirmed a special day's holiday has been awarded to <em>most</em> departments - it's unclear what teams won't be eligible - and stressed to players that the time off would not impact Palworld or Craftopia, with scheduled updates progressing as planned (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/">Automaton</a>).</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds currently boasts an all-time player peak of 987,482</a>, although it seems likely it will smash past this number over the weekend. This makes Wilds one of the most-played games on Steam, surpassing peak player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p>
<p>In comparison, Monster Hunter World has an all-time player peak of 334,684, meaning Wilds has almost tripled the former's peak player numbers in less than a day.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt awarded it 4/5, saying: "Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades.</p>
<p>"And if it continues Monster Hunter's legacy of generous post-launch support - where the series has traditionally felt the freest to get daft and indulge in its more sadistic tendencies - it'll be fascinating to see how this beautiful new baseline for the series develops."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> looks set to be a smash hit for Capcom, with the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">hitting nearly a million concurrent players on Steam overnight</a>, but the response to the game so far from those played is not all positive, according to Steam user reviews. 
</p>
<p>
On Steam, Monster Hunter Wilds currently sits with a Mixed rating, with  many responses criticising the game's technical performance. 
</p>
<p>
This morning, <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292">Capcom issued a social media post</a> seemingly in response to these early complaints, and said that anyone "experiencing any issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam"  should try updating their graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode and then readjusting their settings. The company also linked to a more detailed <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/047">Capcom support blog</a> with further tips.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hunters! If you're experiencing any initial issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam, please try updating your graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode, and then readjust your settings.</p><p>Thank you all for your patience and support!</p><p>More details:<a href="https://t.co/v6g7UwFXpj">https://t.co/v6g7UwFXpj</a></p></div>â€” Monster Hunter Status (@MHStatusUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
For now, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340">Steam user reviews</a> are awash with complaints regarding the game's performance.
</p>
<p>
"This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimisation I've ever seen," wrote one fan who has already clocked up five hours of playtime. "I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point."
</p>
<p>
"I have been a fan since MH3U," wrote another player. "I have 1000s of hours in MH across all of the games. My beefy rig with a 3080 super and decent CPU can't run this game at an acceptable frame rate."

<p>
"Runs even worse than the beta," wrote a third. "For reference, I could run the beta at a comfortable 60-70 FPS on High, usually higher than that. Now I'm running at less than 50 on Medium with noticeable dips. If I can run KCD2 and Cyberpunk on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this."
</p>
<p>
Still, the game's performance issues at launch don't seem to be putting too many people off from continuing. Currently, 940,000 people are playing Monster Hunter Wilds via Steam - just down from its overnight peak of 987,000. 
</p>
<p>
Digital Foundry will be weighing in with its verdict on Monster Hunter Wilds on PC shortly.
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>, our Matt called it "the most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter yet, even if its attempts to balance the old and new don't always quite coalesce in its ongoing quest to please all audiences".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA has released the source code for classic strategy games in the Command &amp; Conquer series along with Steam Workshop support, opening the game to modders.</p>
<p>The games in question are Command &amp; Conquer (aka, Tiberian Dawn), C&amp;C Red Alert, C&amp;C Renegade, and C&amp;C Generals + Zero Hour, all released under the General Public Licence.</p>
<p>In short, this will continue to preserve the legacy of the games and make it easier for modders to continue creating content.</p>

<p>The news follows the launch of Command &amp; Conquer Ultimate Collection on Steam last year, after which EA commissioned modder Luke "CCHyper" Feenan to research improvements to the games - as detailed in a new reddit post.</p>
<p>In addition to opening the source code, which allows existing C&amp;C communities to continue supporting their work, Steam Workshop support has been added for more games in the series.</p>
<p>All Mission Editor and World Builder tools have been updated, meaning maps can be published directly to the Steam Workshop. In addition, a C&amp;C Modding Support pack has been released, which contains the source Xml, Schema, Script, Shader and Map files for all the games that use the SAGE engine - a long-requested wish from the community.</p>
<p>Lastly, EA has updated its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/command-and-conquer/modding-faq?isLocalized=true">Command &amp; Conquer Franchise Modding Guidelines</a> to reflect this initiative.</p>

            <p>
There's a temporary truce in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s Galactic War, after a game-breaking bug introduced during maintenance.
</p>
<p>
The issue sprung up yesterday, after Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead issued an update to the game's backend. The problem saw planet liberation rates skyrocket - which is a good thing... until it isn't.
</p>
<p>
"While we know this is fun, we also know that it is breaking the Galactic War mechanic itself," Arrowhead wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1895176702252458384">post on social media</a>. "In short, this is harming the game experience and will have detrimental effects on the war mechanic in the future."

<p>
While players' sudden tide of victory will not be turned back, Arrowhead has frozen the Galactic War so no further damage to the game's balance is done.
</p>
<p>
"We have made the decision to pause the Galactic War temporarily until this is fixed," Arrowhead continued. "We're already starting the process, but we do not yet have an ETA for this fix."
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Helldivers 2 will remain fully playable, but victories will not contribute to the wider goal of liberating planets within the war. 
</p>
<p>
"This is our mistake and we own it," Arrowhead concluded. "We are not going to revert any of the damage done by this error, however, so your major order victory is still secure."
</p>
<p>
In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-creative-director-takes-sabbatical-promises-to-start-arrowheads-next-game-on-return">Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt announced he was taking a sabbatical</a> after working for 11 years on the series, but would return to begin develoment on the studio's next game.

<p>At the time of writing and according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 933,446 Monster Hunter Wilds players on Valve's platform. It currently has an all time player peak of 987,482, although it seems likely it will smash past this number over the weekend. This makes Wilds one of the most-played games on Steam, surpassing peak player numbers for the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and even <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>.</p>

<p>Just yesterday, Capcom gave us all a little teaser for what lies in store for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-content-update-brings-a-new-level-of-challenge-in-april">Monster Hunter Wilds' first post-launch content update</a>, which is now confirmed to be launching some time in "early April". This update will include a "new level of challenge" for players.</p>
<p>But, as for what players can expect in the here and now, well it sounds like quite a rather good ol' time. In fact, our Matt recently awarded the game four out of five stars, calling Wilds the "most exhilarating and refined Monster Hunter" to date.</p>
<p>"Wilds remains an exhilarating piece of work - so refined, so alive, so giddily, chaotically joyful when it all comes together that it feels like the ultimate culmination of everything the series has been working toward over the last two decades," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.</p>
