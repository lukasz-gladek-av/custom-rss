Game of Thrones the TV show might have farted out of existence with a dribble, but that doesn't appear to be of much concern to the beancounters; Game of Thrones: Kingsroad - the free-to-play action-RPG from South Korean developer Netmarble that's looking to reanimate the HBO series' corpse - is leaving paid early access and launching for PC and mobile on 21st May.
</p>
<p>
Game of Thrones: Kingsroad promises to take players on a "truly immersive journey" through the TV series' version of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, taking in some familiar sights - from the northern Wall's Castle Back to King's Landing, Highgarden, and beyond - as they freely roam an open world of "vivid landscapes, massive cities, backwater towns, untamed wilderness, and the uncompromising lives of the people that inhabit them."
</p>
<p>
Players start their adventure as an illegitimate child from a small noble house in the North who, following the death of their brothers, sets out to "solidify [their] political position, navigate the complex power struggles between the noble houses of Westeros, and seek out... allies" - all while preparing for the White Walkers' arrival. It's got classes (players can adopt the role of either Knight, Sellsword, or Assassin), co-op, and familiar series characters too.

<p>
Game of Thrones: Kingsroad launched into paid early access in March and it's garnered plenty of criticism on Steam since then - and not just because playing it is bringing back terrible flashbacks of show's tumble from grace. Most of the complaints - it's currently sitting at a "mixed" rating on Steam - revolve around Kingsroad's monetisation, with players lambasting its "filthy microtransactions", and calling it "greedy", a "money grab", and "like a mobile game on steroids", with talk of $20 dollar battle passes, $15 subscriptions, paid progression, and more.
</p>
<p>
Still, if you fancy doing a little wave at Jon Snow, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be available for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-e19c7c">Epic,</a> and the Windows Store when it gets its full free-to-play launch on 21st May. And if you'd prefer to play on mobile (cross-saves are supported), you can also pick it up on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232">iOS App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got">Android Google Play Store</a>. If nothing else, it's one way to pass the time waiting for George R. R. Martin to finish up The Winds of Winter.

        <p>Just connect your Disney account.</p>

            <p>
In another sign of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Disney cosying up under the covers, you can now unlock a free First Order Stormtrooper skin by linking your MyDisney account to the game. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't your Disney+ account, to be clear, and there's no need to be subscribed elsewhere. And it provides another sign-in option for Fortnite, just like when the game added Lego account sign-ins as an option previously.
</p>
<p>
The likely intended benefit of this freebie is that Fortnite itself is now being flooded by players showing off their new Stormtrooper skin, setting the vibe for the game's impending Star Wars season that's set to take over later this week and run until early June. 
</p>
<p>
The next battle pass will feature Emperor Palpatine, Poe Dameron and General Grievous, as well as Chewbacca-styled Cuddle Team Leader and a Sith/Jedi remix of Evie. There's no sign of Darth Jar Jar here, so my guess would be you'll need to stump up for him separately via the in-game shop.
</p>
<p>
As well as all that, Fortnite will be hosting an early watch party and premiere of the first two episodes of the next Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld season from 2nd May, before their arrival on Disney+. If you're a fan of Asajj Ventress from The Clone Wars and The Bad Batch, you should probably tune in. (And if you do, you'll unlock a free Asajj Ventress loading screen.)

Ubisoft has finally lifted the lid on what to expect from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' post-launch plans, which will include "regular" dollops of extra story missions, fan-requested features and a New Game Plus option. 
</p>
<p>
New story "drops" will be free, provide new allies for your base, fresh abilities and activities, and "additional backstory that will permanently impact the game", Ubisoft has said.
</p>
<p>
There will also be a focus on further fleshing out side characters, as evidenced by the first mission, due early next month, which will centre on Portuguese character Luis Frois.

<p>
Other upcoming free content includes new difficulty settings, photo mode updates (including poses), extra parkour options, plus additional Codex updates and battle pass-esque Projects. There's also mention of "special collaborations" - which sound a lot like Assassin's Creed is dipping its toe back into crossover territory. (Remember when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-assassins-creed-origins-will-get-a-chocobo-horse">Chocobo turned up in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>?)
</p>
<p>
There's less detail, for now, on Shadows' first major expansion Claws of Awaji. Ubisoft noted today that the add-on - provided free to those who pre-ordered Shadows - will be set after the game's current epilogue, and pick up both Naoe and Yasuke's ongoing stories. When will it arrive? Ubisoft isn't telling - instead saying simply it'll launch "later this year".
</p>
<p>
Other gameplay changes coming include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">slew of fan-requests that Eurogamer noted shortly after Shadows' launch</a>, including the ability to remove your headgear in cutscenes. Additional parkour options such as height-gaining back and side ejects plus a new vertical ledge jump are also on the way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows free post-launch roadmap:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early May:</strong> The Works of Luis Frois story mission, codex update, quality of life improvements</li>
<li><strong>Late May:</strong> First "special collaboration", parkour update, photo mode update</li>
<li><strong>June:</strong> Second story mission including new ally, new difficulty settings, gameplay immersion options, open world alarm system, headgear in cutscene option</li>
<li><strong>Future:</strong> New Game Plus, more story missions, additional community feedback updates, further special collaborations, codex updates, rewards and Animus content</li>
</ul>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, "even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."

</figure>
<p>A particular highlight here is the poker-themed roguelike Balatro. Released last year, Balatro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">sold 1m copies in its first month</a> and then proceeded to  scoop up numerous awards, most recently including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">BAFTA for Best Debut game</a>.</p>
<p>"A poker roguelike is such a brilliant idea you almost don't need to make it to see how clever it is. There are a few of these, and Balatro is comfortably the best I've played. It really is ingenious - and it's also ingeniously simple," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">Eurogamer's Balatro review</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we quite enjoyed the boltgun in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>, with Rick Lane stating it "earns a place in the pantheon of great video game weapons" in Eurogamer's review. However, he didn't feel the rest of the game's arsenal could quite live up to the thrill of the boltgun.</p>
<p>"If you want to make a big ol' mess with one excellent gun and several other decent ones, Boltgun satisfies this desire. A few design tweaks and a little more attention to detail would elevate it from a good shooter into a great one, but as a throwback starter course to the hotly anticipated main that is Space Marine 2, Boltgun does an acceptable job of stimulating the tastebuds," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review-a-signature-weapon-so-good-it-breaks-the-game">Eurogamer's Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun review</a>.</p>
<p>Last up, we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">Unreal Engine 5 "next-generation remake" of the original Ark game</a>. Our Matt took the souped up Ark for a whirl on its release, calling it "a striking upgrade", but one that still has some flaws.</p>
<p>"Ark has long felt like a game that came into being through sheer fluke rather than any notable design acumen on the part of Wildcard, and it's a sense only exacerbated in Ascended. There just doesn't seem to be any consistency of vision here; you get new dinosaurs and new building pieces, a photo mode, cross-platform support - but tutorials are non-existent; I'm still stuck laboriously faffing around with an awkward, unintuitive inventory system; balance is all over the place, and on it goes," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-survival-ascended-is-a-striking-upgrade-but-old-problems-set-alarm-bells-ringing">Eurogamer's Ark: Survival Ascended feature from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"Ark: Survival Ascended is just an incredibly weird beast, a remake absolutely in thrall of the shiny stuff but with minimal regard for the fundamental annoyances that have long plagued the game."</p>
<p>The above three games will be available for PS Plus subscribers until 2nd June.</p>

<p>As a reminder, with the approach of a new month, it does mean this is your last chance to get your mitts on April's PS Plus games.</p>
<p>PlayStation Plus members have until 5th May to add <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-ps-plus-games-for-april">RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory to their game library</a>.</p>
