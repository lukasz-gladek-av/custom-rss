            <p>Sega is launching a new store in Tokyo, Japan: Sega Store Tokyo.</p>
<p>Sega didn't share any specifics when it announced the news on social media, but the new store is expected to open in Shibuya's Parco department complex, near the official Capcom store, a Pok√©mon Center, and Nintendo Tokyo, too.</p>

<p>The accompanying 18-second teaser doesn't give much away, sadly, but Sega's transmedia boss Justin Scarpone told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-unveils-plans-for-tokyo-flagship-store-alongside-nintendo/">VGC</a> last year that it was time to put the Sega brand - and not just Sonic - "in front of consumers".</p>

<p>"Our portfolio is very broad, but the common thread is the Sega brand," Scaprone said at the time. "Sega already has a surprising amount of fandom as a brand, and we need to look after those fans and offer new experiences to them, while putting the stamp of Sega on it more proudly.</p>
<p>"It's really exciting, and we need to do a lot more of that, because Sega is a consumer brand that is surprisingly not in front of consumers enough. Sonic is, but Sega isn't."</p>
<p>A second store is also expected to open in Shanghai, but as yet there's no news of an expansion into Europe or America.</p>
<p>Alex recently caught up with Takashi Iizuka, the Sonic series producer who first worked on the franchise just two years into his career and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">stuck with the blue blur for all these years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-reveals-sega-store-tokyo-is-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> actor said he "possibly misled some people" when he teased a Red Dead Redemption-related announcement was on the way.</p>
<p>Last week, John Marston himself - or, at least, the actor who brings him to life, Rob Wiethoff - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-star-teases-he-cannot-wait-for-us-to-know-about-a-big-announcement-thats-coming-before-friday">very excited indeed about an upcoming announcement</a>, stressing that he was particularly excited as he livestreamed "this game", the original Red Dead Redemption. His tease came just days after we heard another rumour that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">Red Dead Redemption 2 may be getting a next-gen update alongside a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>, and Roger Clark - who portrays Red Dead 2's Arthur Morgan - <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934308877446660381">backed up Wiethoff's tease</a>.</p>
<p>Now, however, Wiethoff has walked back his comments, reminding fans that he "do[es] not make announcements for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>", yet still insists he has something exciting to tell us.</p>

<p>"There's one more thing I wanna say," Wiethoff told his viewers on YouTube as he introduced a livestreamed gym buddy session on YouTube. "I don't know how to say this exactly, I'll just say the one thing, uh, that I need to say, and I think all of you recognise this and know this, anyway.</p>
<p>"I do have something I'm <em>really</em> excited about. I truly am. And I think you will be, too, I really do think so. But I possibly, uh, misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now. Just please recognise - and I know that you know this - but let me remind you, I guess: I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that. I'm just reminding you. I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that. So please know that.</p>
<p>"And again, I still think that, uh, a lot of you are going to be really excited about this news. Absolutely. Also, I can't share it with you yet. And I'm so sorry," he finished. "But I truly am that excited. That's all I'm gonna say about that right now."</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, fans noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/">a main cast reunion was scheduled for the National Gaming Expo</a> in Tampa, Florida, from 8th-10th August, leading some to think this could be the "announcement" he was excited about (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-version-tease-turns-out-to-be-a-cast-reunion">Push Square</a>). The line-up for that was announced <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJIHHW6Szuw/">several weeks back</a>, though, which doesn't quite track with Wiethoff's timeline.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, the announcement has seemingly been delayed. Going by Wiethoff's original tease, we should've finally found out by yesterday, 20th June. However, when asked by a fan today, 21st June, for an update, he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lgwq77/the_announcement_is_yet_to_happen_according_to/#lightbox">replied</a>: "It's coming. Sorry for the delay. Ha! There are a lot of moving parts. We want to get this right. I think it will be clear why once we're able to say what's going on.</p>
<p>"I can assure you, I want to tell you as soon as possible. Ha! I love it. Let's goooooooo!"</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-star-says-he-possibly-misled-some-people-but-insists-exciting-news-is-still-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>
