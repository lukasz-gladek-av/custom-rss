            <p>Obsidian surprised us by announcing a sequel to shrunken-player backyard survival game Grounded earlier this summer. We assumed that Grounded, released in 2022 after two years in early access, had more years of live development ahead of it, which is often the case for multiplayer survival games like it. But that was never apparently the intention for Grounded.</p>
<p>Executive producer Marcus Morgan told me in an interview that Obsidian always intended Grounded to have a beginning, a middle and an end. "When we began Grounded 1, there was always this idea that there would be a close to Grounded 1," he said. "Obviously there's survival games like Ark, which are kind of ever expanding, or Minecraft, which are big platforms that are expanding. But a lot of our touch-points for Grounded 1 came from The Forest or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>. So when we were making Grounded 1, we knew there would be a beginning and a middle and an end to the game, in terms of the story we wanted to tell."</p>
<p>The unexpected success of Grounded shook these plans a little - "it took off way more than we could have ever imagined," he said - but an end to the story did eventually come, at which point the studio knew it wanted to do more but also knew it couldn't realise the ideas within the game's existing framework.</p>

<p>Mainly, Obsidian wanted to implement mounts, or "buggies" as Obsidian is now calling them - insects like ants that you can ride around on. "The reason we didn't actually have [mounts] in Grounded 1 was because the world and the space wasn't designed to actually have mounts," Morgan explained to me. To enable them, then, Obsidian moved the playing space from a confined backyard to a much larger park, while also taking the new-game opportunity to move to Unreal Engine 5 and implement other feature ideas as well.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing Grounded 2 ahead of its 29th July early access release so I'll tell you more about those new ideas and how successful, or not, they are when the embargo lifts on the same day. But to return to my point: that beginning, middle and end structure has remained - it has carried over to Grounded 2. In fact, Obsidian not only knows where it could end but where, excitingly, a third game could follow on from it.</p>
<p>While talking about the original plan for Grounded, Morgan said this: "At first it was like, 'We'll just make Grounded.' There's not the, 'Well maybe we'll have a trilogy.' Like, we hope, but that's not where we started." I pressed him on this mention of a trilogy and he said, "That was just me speaking aspirationally."</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Then he added: "I don't know whether or not it's Grounded 2 or a Grounded trilogy, but I will say we absolutely have ideas and stories and expansions and features that we would want to go for. Whether that continues to expand Grounded 2 or whether that is going to Grounded 3... I want to start with Grounded 2 because that's not even launched yet and I've got to get my mind around that. But we do have more, there's more in our hearts and souls, even beyond where we see Grounded 2 going throughout early access. We do have more that we hope people want to see and play. It's in our hearts."</p>
<p>Another surprising thing about Grounded 2's development is that it's been shared. Grounded 1 was made entirely at Obsidian, but Grounded 2 has been co-developed with Embracer-owned studio Eidos Montreal. Morgan told me Obsidian sought the partnership, being, as it was, rather busy making both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2, which are both 2025 games.</p>
<p>"We knew we wanted to make Grounded 2 and we knew we were going to need help expanding and building on that," he said, "so we actually went out, like, 'Okay, where can we go find co-development help that shares similar sensibilities and has a passion and a love for the game?' There wasn't a lot of pressure or rush for it, we just wanted to find the right partner." And Eidos was apparently it.</p>
<p>There are actually more people working on Grounded 2 at Eidos than at Obsidian, he said, but assured me that "a significant number of people" are working on the game at Obsidian, including the original Grounded team, and that the project was being led from there.</p>

<p>"I know this is gonna sound corny but sincerely it is a cooperative way of developing things," he said. We, as Obsidian, as the creators of the IP, obviously have a very strong point of view about 'what is Grounded' and what fits, what doesn't. There's some weighting on our side in the same way that when we used to make games for other folks, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> or [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2], there were the IP holders there.</p>
<p>"But Eidos has been empowered a lot and also just brings a lot to the table with regards to their ownership and filling the game, so I would say it's shared. I don't know if we really think about it as who's officially in charge? Like, if you wanted to put a stamp on it, it's Obsidian, because it's our game. But Eidos is just as much of an owner and just as much of a contributor to it. We are just one team. We might be in two different studios but we're the Grounded team. That's how we do it."</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will launch in early access on 29th July, at which point, I'll be able to share fuller thoughts on the game. Note that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-going-anywhere-if-people-still-want-to-play-it-as-grounded-2-gets-ready-to-launch-obsidian-promises-its-not-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-original-game">Grounded 1 will continue to exist even when this game comes out</a>, by the way - Obsidian is a big believer in game preservation and has no plans to sunset that older game. Content updates will stop, but maintenance will continue.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-could-grow-into-a-trilogy-and-there-are-already-ideas-that-could-fill-a-potential-grounded-3]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The return of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to iOS in the UK is "uncertain", Epic has claimed, as it's unable to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS this year, "if ever".</p>
<p>That's because the CMA, the UK's competition regulator, has "deprioritised store competition entirely", following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">lengthy legal battle between Epic and Apple</a>.</p>
<p>The CMA has today released two roadmaps for possible measures to improve competition in mobile ecosystems for both Apple and Google. However, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-cma-s-roadmap-doesn-t-open-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-to-competition-in-the-uk">Epic has claimed in a statement</a> the regulator is "choosing not to prioritise opening the mobile ecosystem to alternative app stores this year".</p>

<p>It continued: "This is a missed opportunity to introduce competition into a currently-monopolised market and unlock economic growth and consumer choice. Four years after concluding that the App Store and Google Play Store are parallel monopolies the CMA has done nothing to allow competing stores.</p>
<p>"A free market requires multiple stores competing to offer consumers the best prices and services. If you don't have competing stores, the one store that is a state-sanctioned monopoly will use its control to extract all the value from the market at the expense of all creators who cannot compete, and consumers who can't choose the best deal among competing stores."</p>
<p>In May this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite finally returned to Apple devices in the US and Europe</a> after a five-year legal battle over store competition.</p>
<p>However, following Brexit, the UK has not been included, so the return of Fortnite won't be until at least next year.</p>

<p>"The CMA also made a vague announcement about allowing developers to steer customers to payment service outside of apps, without referencing the kinds of restrictions, obstructions and junk fees that Apple introduced in Europe to make a mockery of the Digital Markets Act," Epic added.</p>
<p>"Unless Apple and Google are completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment, we can expect years of malicious compliance ahead, and no genuine restoration of market competition."</p>
<p>Epic compared this "bleak news from the United Kingdom" to the stronger pro-competition actions of other regions.</p>

            <p>It seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> could be getting a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> port.</p>
<p>During Ubisoft's latest quarterly earnings call, which was listened to by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-might-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">IGN</a>, the company's CEO Yves Guillemot commented that Assassin's Creed Shadows has "some new versions" coming, which will be available "on other machines". Given that Shadows is already available on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5, that only really leaves Nintendo's hardware under that 'other machines' banner, unless the studio exec was referring to previous generation consoles or mobile.</p>

<p>However, during the same call Ubisoft's CFO Frederick Duguet seemed to further cement this idea that Assassin's Creed Shadows may make its Nintendo debut. Responding to one investor, Duguet said: "And we also have a game that will be launched on the Switch 2."</p>
<p>Before you say, 'but Victoria, this is clearly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">which we know is headed to Switch 2 already</a> - Duguet was talking about games "beyond the announced releases". So, evidently there's at least one other Ubisoft title bound for Nintendo's latest console.</p>
<p>Couple these comments from Ubisoft's leadership with that <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-assassins-creed-shadows-has-appeared-on-the-pegi-website.1168491/">Nintendo Switch 2 PEGI rating for Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> that started making the rounds in April, and it seems an announcement of some sort is ultimately on the horizon.</p>

<p>In addition to these little Shadow nuggets, Ubisoft also recently celebrated welcoming five million players to its latest Assassin's Creed game. "Assassin's Creed Shadows delivered on its expectations, with now more than five million unique players since its launch," Guillemot wrote in Ubisoft's FY26 Q1 sales report.</p>
<p>The team elaborated further on social media, revealing that along with those five million assassins, there have been 2bn stealth kills and 38 million animals petted. Meanwhile, players have travelled 1bn kilometers since the game was released in March.</p>
<p>"And still, you paused to take in the view," <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1947688095123460139">Ubisoft wrote</a>. "Thank you for forging legends with us."</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blades-of-fire">Blades of Fire</a>, the dark fantasy action-adventure from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-dread">Metroid Dread</a> studio MercurySteam, has "underperformed" following its console and Epic Games Store-exclusive PC release in May, contributing to a €10m loss for publishing group Digital Bros. The company has blamed the game's failure on "an oversupply of new releases and increasingly selective consumers".
</p>
<p>
Blades of Fire marked MercurySteam's first new title since it collaborated with Nintendo on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-dread-review-a-sublime-return-for-a-nintendo-icon">2021's widely acclaimed Metroid Dread</a>, and it launched to generally positive reviews. Eurogamer, for instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blades-of-fire-review">called it</a> "original, lovable, and born of genuine passion, despite the near overwhelming number of problems that could have extinguished it." Other upbeat reviews followed, but that clearly hasn't been enough to tempt a sufficient number of players into Blades of Fire's world.
</p>
<p>
Digital Bros (which owns Blades of Fire publisher 505 Games) has <a href="https://digitalbros-com.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025.07.22-FY2024-2025-Trade-update_cript.pdf">announced</a> it now expects revenue for its fiscal year ending 30th June 2025 - already projected to decline year-on-year - will "contract even further". The company says it currently anticipates a loss of "at least" €10m (approximately £8.7m), which it blames directly on the "underperformance" of Blades of Fire and higher-than-expected write-offs due to "persistent market uncertainty".

<p>
"The video game market remains affected by challenging competitive dynamics, driven by an oversupply of new releases and increasingly selective consumers," Digital Bros wrote. "These conditions make it particularly difficult to successfully launch new titles and to develop reliable forecasting models capable of accurately projecting sales and volumes at launch."
</p>
<p>
This, it added, "confirms the challenges faced by most industry peers and competitors in attracting consumers to new titles, particularly when these are not backed by an established brand driving a loyal player community."
</p>
<p>
Digital Bros' announcement mirrors similar struggles from other publishers in recent years. Last September, for instance, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage studio Don't Nod blamed an "extremely competitive and selective market" for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">commercial underperformance</a> of its critically acclaimed Jusant and Banishers, while Ubisoft highlighted an industry shift toward "mega-brands and long-lasting titles" following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">considerably lower-than-expected earnings</a> in 2023.

But it's also clear 'established brands' are no guarantee of success either. Despite its strategic shift, Ubisoft was forced to admit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws had seen a "softer than expected launch" last year</a>, and the might of Batman couldn't save Warner Bros' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">performed so badly it lead to a $200m loss</a> for the company.
