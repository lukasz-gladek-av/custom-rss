<p>"One of the biggest accessibility expansions coming to Days Gone Remastered is a fully customisable High Contrast Mode," wrote Bend Studio's Kevin McAllister, with the developer stating this "pairs with our High Contrast HUD that was implemented in the original game to assist with easier navigation and visibility".</p>
<p>Players will be able to make the most of this feature from the off, with subtitles, High Contrast Mode and more options available via Days Gone Remastered's initial setup screen, which is another new addition.</p>
<p>Speaking of subtitles, the development team has added 11 colours for users to choose from. These can be mixed and matched for things like the speaker's name and the subtitle text. Subtitle backgrounds can also be changed, with Bend adding more options for users than before. "Now, you can select between default (transparent), darkened, light, and black,"  McAllister explained.</p>
<p>On the audio side of things, Bend has added UI Narration and Collectible Audio Cues for Days Gone Remastered.</p>

<p>"At Bend Studio, we strive to create experiences that leave a lasting impact on our players," McAllister closed. "The pursuit of allowing players of all abilities to share our joy of play together inspires our work every day. We hope you enjoy the definitive version of our open world epic, and we can't wait to see you hop on the Drifter bike and experience all Days Gone Remastered has to offer."</p>
<p>Those on PC who want to make the most of these new features will need to update their game to a version higher than Build ID 10034136 via Patch 1.08. The developer added that UI Narration is <em>not </em>supported for Broken Road DLC on PC.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, users will need to make sure they have a compatible controller for things such as haptic feedback and customised controls.</p>

<p>Not played Days Gone for yourself yet? Our review from 2019 complimented its "frequently gorgeous" open world, however noted the game could often be "generic" and one that "runs out of steam well before its extended play-time is over".</p>
<p>"I wasn't expecting Days Gone to add anything new to the genre, but both in terms of its systems and its story it's uninspired, which is driven home by the fact that it's endlessly, needlessly long," Malindy Hetfeld wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-gone-review-a-shallow-copy-of-many-better-open-world-action-games">Eurogamer's original Days Gone review</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm begging you, haven't we done this enough?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>OutRun is the next video game to be reportedly getting itself a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>As revealed by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/sydney-sweeney-michael-bay-outrun-video-game-universal-1236373036/">Deadline</a>, sources say Universal is planning to release a film based on Sega's arcade video game, with with Michael Bay - known for the likes of Bad Boys, The Rock ("Welcome to The Rock!") and the first five films in the Transformers film series - acting as director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Euphoria and The White Lotus actress Sydney Sweeney is attached to produce the film, with Jayson Rothwell on writing duties. Rothwell's previous credits include <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4139588/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Polar (2019)</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2347497/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Silent Night (2012)</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397753/?ref_=nmbio_mbio">Zemanovaload (2005)</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, further details are fairly thin on the ground. In the words of Deadline, "plot details are vague". Given its source material, though, we can assume that it will have something to do with racing. Perhaps, more specifically, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-of-the-best-cars">racing in a Ferrari</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Martin Robinson wrote a feature dedicated to OutRun back in 2019.</p>
<p>"I've made OutRun's journey countless times over the years, whether that's in one of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>'s virtual Hong Kong arcades, via M2's phenomenal 3DS port or more recently its Switch effort," he wrote in his snappily titled article <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outrun-is-still-the-pinnacle-of-driving-games">OutRun is still the pinnacle of driving games</a>.</p>
<p>"Such platforms can only deliver a sliver of the full experience, though - playing OutRun on the deluxe cabinet is a revelation. It's an all-body experience, a kind of funky alternative to virtual reality that plays to all of your senses."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in video game to big screen news, earlier this month a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-teaser-for-five-nights-at-freddys-movie-sequel-is-here">new teaser trailer for Five Nights at Freddy's 2 was revealed</a>. Additionally back in January, Sony announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">Horizon Zero Dawn and Helldivers 2 were both being adapted into films</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
