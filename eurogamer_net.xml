Corinne Busche, who served as game director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> since February 2022, is departing BioWare. 
</p>
<p>
Whispers of her exit began circulating online last night, and were first confirmed by journalist <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1880113210470371790">Jeff Grubb</a>. Eurogamer can also confirm Busche will depart BioWare in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands BioWare itself is otherwise unaffected by any other changes, contrary to rumour.

</figure>
<p>
Busche, working closely alongside creative director John Epler, helped oversee The Veilguard's final stretch of development from early 2022 onwards, until its final release last October. 
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard slogged through a mammoth decade-long development and several reboots before the version we finally saw launch arrived, steered by Busche.
</p>
<p>
Critically, The Veilguard has been received well, and commercially sales have been decent - but there's also been a suggestion that sales have not exceeded expectations. Still, Eurogamer understands The Veilguard's commercial performance was not a direct factor in Busche's departure. 
</p><p>
Alongside her work on The Veilguard, Busche has served as a designer and design director within publisher EA for 18 years, working on numerous entries in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> series, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> and The Sims Mobile.
</p>
<p>
Post Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">bulk of BioWare is now turning its attention fully to the next Mass Effect game</a>, which is being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">led by a separate small team of veterans</a>.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer spoke with both Busche and Epler in December for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds">our big Dragon Age: The Veilguard post-release interview</a>. "The reality was whatever we came out with, it was never going to match the Dragon Age 4 in people's minds and people's imaginations," Epler said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Trading will be added to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> later this month.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company teased the feature at the game's launch - it's been right there, "coming soon", since the app launched - but finally we have more information about which cards will be tradeable.</p>
<p>Firstly, trades can only be done between friends and only with cards of the same rarity. So no swapping one of those millions of Ponyta for a shiny Mewtwo.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company also stated that only certain cards from both the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island booster packs will be available to trade. "We are planning to continue to expand the selection of booster packs that you can trade from," it said.</p>
<p>Cards with a rarity of 1-4 diamond and 1 star can be traded. This excludes both Ex cards (generally the rarest of all) and Promo cards found in events.</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Hello! Here is a statement from the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonTCGPocket?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonTCGPocket</a> Team highlighting the details of the upcoming trade feature and new content coming to the game.</p><p>The team plans to diligently assess how trading will impact the player experience and the game once it is available. <a href="https://t.co/SVBRxIN6sP">pic.twitter.com/SVBRxIN6sP</a></p></div>— Pokémon TCG Pocket (@PokemonTCGP) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Lastly, an item will need to be consumed in order to trade, presumably to stop the feature being overused (and surely provides another monetisation opportunity).</p>
<p>"We'll continue to monitor player feedback and assess future updates to the trade feature while keeping in mind how to balance both the ease and enjoyability of collecting," The Pokémon Company said.</p>
<p>Further, the statement confirms the next booster pack will also be added this month, though no more details were given.</p>
<p>The last booster pack was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mew-headlines-next-pokemon-tcg-pocket-booster-packs">Mythical Island pack</a>, headlined by Mew, that was released in December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, there's only one story in town: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo's long-awaited unveiling of Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p>Today's video laid out the bare bones of Switch 2, and it looked exactly as expected: like a slightly-larger Switch with an extra button and mysterious optical sensors. We also got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">very brief look at a new Mario Kart</a>, which looks... like a Mario Kart game. If anything, today's video only prompted more questions.</p>
<p>What will Mario Kart 9's main new feature be? Today's gameplay snippet - while brief - offered up a couple of intriguing clues. And when will Switch 2 actually arrive? Well, between the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">proper Nintendo Direct in April</a> and the console's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">upcoming public hands-on tour</a>, we think there's a relatively narrow window. Joining me this week to discuss everything we saw - as well as what we're still waiting to hear about - are Ed Nightinale and Victoria Kennedy.</p>

            <p>Sony has cancelled two more of its once-envisioned live service Playstation projects.</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled. And now, two more live service games have been added to that list.</p>

</figure>
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">Bloomberg</a> now reveals two further live service games - one from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and one from Bluepoint - have been cancelled by PlayStation following a "recent review".</p>
<p>The company did not say whether these cancellations will lead to any layoffs, however it said neither of the two affected PlayStation studios will be shut down. "Bend and Bluepoint are highly accomplished teams who are valued members of the PlayStation Studios family, and we are working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects," a spokesperson told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a memo sent to staff stated Sony was going to do "everything" it can to "ensure there is minimal business impact" following the recent cancellations. In the meantime, PlayStation will continue making both online and single-player games.</p>
<p>As for what the impacted studios were working on, according to reporter <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e">Jason Schrier</a>, Bluepoint was developing a live service game within the God of War series.</p>
<p>Bend, meanwhile, revealed it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bend-studios-new-ip-builds-upon-the-open-world-systems-of-days-gone">working on a new IP which would include multiplayer and "[build] upon the open-world systems of Days Gone"</a> back in 2022. In March of last year, a recruitment advert was posted to the studio's website, which revealed the team was looking to secure a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bend-studios-next-project-will-be-a-aaa-live-service-game">lead project manager with "hands on game development experience in leadership roles shipping AAA live-service games"</a>.</p>

<p>Today's news that Sony has cancelled two more live service projects sees PlayStation stepping further back from those lofty plans it shared just a few years ago. While the company has had a success story in the shape of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - which released last year and quickly became a hit - others have not fared so well.</p><p>Most prominently, Sony's 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>. The game had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">in the works for eight years</a>, it had been said.</p>
<p>Numerous other live service games have been cancelled by Sony, including London Studio's co-op game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">the studio also shut down last year</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog cancelled its standalone multiplayer game set in the world of The Last of Us</a>. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was cancelled</a>. In March of last year, footage of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">cancelled co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> - titled Spider-Man: The Great Web - appeared online.</p>
<p>While some live service projects still remain in the pipeline, in 2023, it was said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">Sony was "uncomfortable"</a> about outgoing PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's pivot to games as a service.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
