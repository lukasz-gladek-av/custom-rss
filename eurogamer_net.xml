A live-action film adaptation of Call of Duty is in the works at Paramount, having signed a deal with Activision Blizzard.
</p>
<p>
Paramount - now under media company Skydance - has announced the news (thanks <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-activision-1236503796/">Deadline</a>), with CEO David Ellison a big fan of the series. Activision will be a creative partner on the film.
</p>
<p>
"As a lifelong fan of Call of Duty this is truly a dream come true," said Ellison. "From the first Allied campaigns in the original Call of Duty, through Modern Warfare and Black Ops, I've spent countless hours playing this franchise that I absolutely love. Being entrusted by Activision and players worldwide to bring this extraordinary storytelling universe to the big screen is both an honour and a responsibility that we don't take lightly."

<p>
The film will follow the studio's 2022 film Top Gun: Maverick. "We're approaching this film with the same disciplined, uncompromising commitment to excellence that guided our work on Top Gun: Maverick, ensuring it meets the exceptionally high standards this franchise and its fans deserve," continued Ellison.
</p>
<p>
"I can promise that we are resolute in our mission to deliver a cinematic experience that honours the legacy of this one-in-a-million brand - thrilling longtime fans of Call of Duty while captivating a whole new generation."
</p>
<p>
President of Activision Rob Kostich added: "Throughout its history, Call of Duty has captured our imagination with incredible action and intense stories that have brought millions of people together from around the world, and that focus on making incredible Call of Duty games remains unwavering. With Paramount, we have found a fantastic partner who we will work with to take that visceral, breathtaking action to the big screen in a defining cinematic moment. The film will honour and expand upon what has made this franchise great in the first place, and we cannot wait to get started. Our shared goal is quite simple - to create an unforgettable blockbuster movie experience that our community loves, and one that also excites and inspires new fans of the franchise."
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty is ripe for a cinematic adaptation, both for its action-packed setpieces and millions of sales.
</p>
<p>
It will follow other game adaptations in recent years, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-has-delayed-its-legend-of-zelda-film">Nintendo's multiple projects</a>, Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">The Last of Us TV show</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-live-action-film-officially-in-development">FromSoftware's massive Elden Ring</a>, classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">Sega racing game OutRun</a>, and horror games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-has-earned-itself-a-movie-adaptation-from-m3gan-and-five-nights-at-freddys-production-company-blumhouse">Phasmophobia</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloobers-the-medium-will-be-adapted-to-film-courtesy-of-it-and-annabelle-writer-producer-gary-dauberman">The Medium</a>.
