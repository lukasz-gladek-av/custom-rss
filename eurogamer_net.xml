            <p>
A TV series based on Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beyond-two-souls">Beyond: Two Souls</a> is in development, with Elliot Page's production company attached.
</p>
<p>
Despite the swathe of film and TV projects based on video games in the works right now, this one is something of a surprise. 
</p>
<p>
First released for PlayStation 3 way back in 2013, Beyond: Two Souls is another stylish but somewhat nonsensical narrative adventure by the maker of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and, later, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>.

<p>
Page starred in the game as Jodie, a girl with special powers and a mysterious connection to a ghostly presence, alongside Willem Dafoe, who plays a creepy government researcher/father figure.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, Page's time working on the project was notable for the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ellen-page-explored-legal-action-154256357.html">legal action lodged in response to Beyond: Two Souls' gratuitous shower scene</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Upon the game's launch, it was discovered that Quantic Dream had made a detailed nude model of Jodie's character for use in this scene (to the apparent surprise of Page, as the scene itself does not show any actual nudity). 
</p>
<p>
The model was quickly found  within the game's files and then spread online, prompting Page to explore the possibility of a lawsuit. Sony, the game's publisher, later sent takedown notices to websites hosting images of the character model.
</p>
<p>
"Filming the game was one of the most challenging and fulfilling acting experiences of my career," Page said in a fresh statement to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/beyond-two-souls-video-game-television-series-elliot-page-pageboy-1236267129/">Deadline</a>, which was first to report news of the game's TV adaptation. 
</p>
<p>
"The story's rich narrative and emotional depth offer us a fantastic foundation. We want to create a unique vision of the characters and their journeys that resonates with fans and newcomers."
</p>
<p>
Beyond: Two Souls writer and director David Cage said he was "absolutely thrilled to collaborate again" with Page. "I know that Elliot has all the talent and instinct to make it something really unique on TV," he added.
</p>
<p>
"Beyond has epic scope, preposterous premise and high-octane action," former editor Oli Welsh wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-two-souls-review">Eurogamer's Beyond: Two Souls review</a>. "But perhaps what David Cage and his dream need are limitations - limitations that Sony's blank cheque has singularly failed to impose on this sprawling, over-reaching game."

            <p>
Microsoft is celebrating having the best-selling game on both Xbox and PlayStation platforms over the last quarter, thanks to its new ownership of the Call of Duty franchise.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launched last October and has been a success for Microsoft, which namechecked the title during its latest financial results.
</p>
<p>
"Black Ops 6... saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in franchise history," Microsoft boss Satya Nadella boasted during a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q2">call</a> with investors.

<p>
"We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140m hours streamed this quarter," he continued.
</p>
<p>
Nadella also called out the brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and gave our first indication of how well MachineGames' globe-trotting adventure is doing.
</p>
<p>
"We saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than four million people," Nadella said.
</p>
<p>
Both of these statistics will reflect players who bought either game outright, as well as those who have played via Game Pass on both PC and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, of course, the PS5 launch of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is still to come - sometime in the first half of this year.
</p>
<p>
Revenue for Xbox's gaming and content division, which includes Game Pass, rose two percent over three months of 2024 thanks to a surge of subscribers on PC. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-sales-slump-but-game-pass-is-surging">Microsoft's wider gaming revenue was still down year-on-year overall, offset by the continued slump of Xbox hardware sales</a>.

            <p>
Microsoft has announced mixed results for its latest financial quarter, with strong growth for Game Pass offset by the continued decline in Xbox hardware sales. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, revenue for Microsoft's gaming division was down seven percent year-on-year for the three months ending 31st December 2024, with a 29 percent drop in Xbox console sales largely to blame. 
</p>
<p>
But the quarter also saw a significant boost to Game Pass, which made more money in the last three months of 2024 than in any previous quarter, and also saw a significant uptick to its subscribers on PC.

<p>
"We are focused on improving the profitability of the business, in order to position it for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and platform services," Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q2">call</a> with investors. "And we are delivering on this plan.
</p>
<p>
"All-up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30 percent, as we focus on driving fully-paid subscribers across endpoints."
</p>
<p>
It's clear that Game Pass subscriptions will have been boosted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s launch in October. The latest launch in Activision's long-running shooter franchise was the first to arrive on Game Pass on day one - provided you had PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on consoles.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Black Ops 6 saw more players in its first couple of months than any other game in the series to date, Nadella said.
</p>
<p>
Its inclusion on Game Pass also does not appear to have dented its sales, either. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was "the top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation" last quarter, Nadella said, before also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">revealing the number of people who have played the brilliant Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.
