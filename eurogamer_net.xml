            <p>
Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles available in March 2025, including promising-looking new British survival game Atomfall - well, if you're a PC or Ultimate subscriber.
</p>
<p>Also included in these latest additions are Mythwrecked, which is the Hades-esque adventure game from the team behind enjoyable indie Röki, and the Blizzard Arcade Collection - which includes a selection of retro classics such as Lost Vikings and Rock &amp; Roll Racing.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late March 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler 2 (Series X/S, now with Game Pass Standard) - 19th March</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (Console, now with Game Pass Standard) - 19th March</li>
<li>Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 25th March</li>
<li>Blizzard Arcade Collection (Console and PC) - 20th March</li>
<li>Atomfall (Cloud and Console via Game Pass Ultimate, and PC) - 27th March</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tunic, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> and Monster Sanctury meanwhile join Xbox Game Pass Core, the lowest-tier subscription formerly branded as Xbox Live Gold.
</p>
<p>
As ever, as Microsoft giveth, so it taketh away. Yet more Yakuza titles are getting the chop from the Xbox Game Pass catalogue, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-march">the previous loss of Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 6 earlier in the month</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> is also going - presumably Capcom would prefer you now play Monster Hunter World.
</p>
<p>
The full list of titles leaving Xbox Game Pass on 31st March are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MLB The Show 24 (Cloud and Console)</li>
<li>Lil Gator Game (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Open Roads (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza 0 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Kiwami (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Kiwami 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Yakuza Like a Dragon (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Lamplighter’s League (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Rise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
