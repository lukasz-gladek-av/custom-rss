            <p>Nintendo has provided a solution to an issue causing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s battery indicator to display incorrectly.</p>
<p>While some have criticised the new console for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-revealed">having a poor battery life</a>, it turns out in some instances the indicator is actually just not showing the correct percentage.</p>
<p>But, there's a fix! <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo">Nintendo has provided steps</a> "for when the battery amount displayed and the actual remaining battery use don't match". It's easy enough, but does require you to access the console's Recovery Mode.</p>

<p>The steps from Nintendo are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm you're using an adequately powerful AC adapter to charge your console (while the original Switch adapter can be used to charge a Switch 2 directly, it is not powerful enough to charge the Switch 2 when docked)</li>
<li>Confirm that your console has the latest system update</li>
<li>Power off the console</li>
<li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, press the POWER Button once to turn the system on.</li>
<li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears. Navigating to this menu should reset the battery level meter.</li>
<li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the POWER Button until it turns off.</li>
<li>Power the console back on and monitor the situation</li>
</ol>
<p>Nintendo notes further that if following these steps multiple times does not resolve the battery indicator issue, the console will need to be sent in for service.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MetroidFREAK21/status/1932218979956691244">One user on X</a> noted their battery jumped from 85 percent to 91 percent after following these steps, so it's worth double checking on your own console if the battery appears to be lower than expected.</p>
<p>For more details on the console's battery, we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-battery-life-charge-time">guide on the Switch 2 battery</a> explaining more on its life expectancy.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Nintendo revealed it has sold 3.5m Switch 2 consoles</a> in its first four days on sale, becoming the fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Towards the end of last month, the co-CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">game's negative reactions up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio</a>. These bold comments from a studio exec raised a number of eyebrows, to say the least.</p>
<p>Now, the CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">helming the publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, has shared his thoughts on these claims, stating he does not believe any of those aforementioned negative comments had been paid for.</p>
<p>When asked by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">IGN </a>about the discourse surrounding MindsEye's alleged paid-for negative reactions, IO Interactive head Hakan Abrak replied: "I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p>

<p>While the exec did not elaborate on this specific point further, he did state the MindsEye team - as many developers do - are working on patches for the game.</p>
<p>MindsEye released last night, however it has not been an especially smooth launch for the team. Many social media posts have made the rounds online showing stuttering issues, as well as a number of glitches, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorted character faces and unnaturally stretching bodies</a>.</p>
<p>Build A Rocket Boy has said a patch to address performance is in the pipeline, stating its "engineering team are working around the clock"  to implement improvements. We will keep you posted when we know more.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you were wondering why Eurogamer has not yet published a review for MindsEye, you can find out more in our aptly titled article: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-mindseye-review">Where's our MindsEye review?</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'Concerned Ape' Barone has taken a brief break from working on the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> to drop a bombshell.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter with fire at his fingertips, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458">Barone wrote</a>: "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley".</p>
<p>Outstanding. How much bigger Haunted Chocolatier will be than Stardew Valley, what will fill this vast world of hauntings and chocolate, and how players will be able to explore and interact with this world remains a sweet mystery.</p>

<p>The last major update we got for Haunted Chocolatier is from April this year, when Barone announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">no more major updates would be coming to Stardew Valley</a>. Indeed, the last year of Barone's life has assumedly been spent sitting at the grindstone, hard at work at their next game while thousands of eager fans peek through the cracks in the walls and floorboards.</p>
<p>These long periods of silence should not be a surprise, with Barone previously stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Haunted Chocolatier won't be rushed</a>, and that it was "better to have a good delayed game than a bad game on time". He's right, of course. You can only release Haunted Chocolatier once, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-has-now-sold-over-20-million-copies">given the massive community of Stardew Valley players</a>, it's likely the smart move to make sure everything is made well and with love… Just like chocolate!</p>
<p>So yeah, while making a joke or two is fun, we wish this ape the best of luck with development. It's ready when it's ready!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
