            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has received a day one patch ahead of its release tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ready across all platforms, the update "aims to improve gameplay and stability" according to the (very minimal) <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>The changes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved handling of playable characters</li>
<li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li>
<li>Text adjustments</li>
<li>Balance adjustments</li>
<li>Added character scenarios</li>
<li>Bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>No further details are provided in the notes, so I hopped into the game to check out the changes.</p>

<p>Testing a single player expedition, it would appear the balance adjustments have made it slightly easier. While enemies are still aggressive, their health seems lower and my character stats appeared to be higher.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be my skill level has increased over the review period. But even a half-arsed run got me two thirds through the first Nightlord boss, which wouldn't have happened previously, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn't take this as a sign that solo play is a viable option to complete the game. It's still very much intended to be a multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>One obvious improvement, though, is the "improved handling of playable characters", which relates to the game's parkour movement. It's now much cleaner jumping up the side of cliffs.</p>
<p>The remaining changes will need to be tested over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">30m selling game</a>. It's out tomorrow across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam). Note that crossplay between platforms is not included.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
