            <p>
Yet more evidence pointing to the existence of Ubisoft's much-rumoured but still doggedly unannounced Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake has surfaced, this time in the form of an official art book currently set to release this March.
</p>
<p>
Reports of a Black Flag remake first surfaced in 2023, when it was claimed the celebrated 2013 open-world pirate game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">getting the do-over treatment from Skull and Bones developer Ubisoft Singapore</a>. At the time, the project was said to still be "at least a few years" away from release.
</p>
<p>
Since then, evidence of the remake's existence has continued to mount, despite Ubisoft's persistent silence. Last year, for instance, actor Matt Ryan - who played Black Flag protagonist Edward Kenway - hinted the remake was close to release, only for Ubisoft to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">threaten him with legal action</a>.
</p>
<p>
Then, in December, something called Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">briefly appeared on the PEGI website</a>, rated 18 for violence, bad language, and in-game purchases. But it didn't stop there; January saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-leaks">leak of a suspiciously timed Assassin's Creed Black Flag collectible figurine</a> featuring Kenway sat on a treasure chest, seemingly corroborating earlier word from statue maker PureArts that something Black Flag-y was "going on". We've also seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-music-upload">Black Flag sea shanties officially uploaded to YouTube</a>, later blamed on "technical issues", and even a sort of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">acknowledgment-adjancet meme post</a> from Ubisoft's social media team.
</p><p>
And now, a Black Flag art book can be tossed onto the growing evidence pile. As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">spotted by IGN</a>, the tome (listed under the name Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remaster - Art Book) was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=i0e25-21&amp;ascsubtag=05aB1hBAYymJ9H38fEE0g5D">recently added to Amazon UK</a> with a recommended retail price of £39.99 - currently £29.95 - and a release date of 24th March, 2026. Titan, a company that's released numerous officially licensed Assassin's Creed art books over the years, is listed as the publisher.
</p>
<p>
Assuming the Black Flag art book is legit, its listed release would coincide with the original launch window for Ubisoft's conspicuous, and much-discussed, "unannounced game" - a title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">widely believed to be the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>. However, as part of a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset" announced in January, the company pushed the title - alongside six other unspecified games - into its next financial year, starting April 2026, to "ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met".
</p>
<p>
That shakeup also saw the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">cancellation of seven games</a> - including Ubisoft's troubled and long-in-the-works Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - alongside the closure of two studios, the restructuring of several more, and the implementation of return-to-office mandates. This week, 1,200 Ubisoft workers <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">began a three-day strike</a> in response to the company's recent moves.
