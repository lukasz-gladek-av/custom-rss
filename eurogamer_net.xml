            <p>I am quietly optimistic about FBC: Firebreak, Remedy's upcoming co-op, PvE Control spin-off. Having played a couple of hours of it, particularly towards the end of my time, as the systemic complexity began to compound, its coming together at the last minute almost feels like a strength, as I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">our big FBC: Firebreak preview</a>. But naturally at a time when live-service, multiplayer-only games - particularly ones from studios known for the purely single-player output - are hardly the most popular pitches in the world, there is plenty of scepticism out there.</p>
<p>Speaking to game director Mike Kayatta, lead designer Anssi Hyytiäinen, and PR director Thomas Puha, however, the sense was - maybe predictably - that the studio remained bullish. They gave a few reasons.</p>
<p>"For me, at least one element there in that conversation is always the predatory practices in player retention," Hyytiäinen explains. Instead of battle passes, daily objectives and the like, for instance, Firebreak has a somewhat old-school approach of a set of upgrades to your weapons and kits, and a set of unlockable perks, both earned through the main loop of playing rounds of the game, collecting resources and spending them on said unlocks.</p>

<p>As Hyytiäinen puts it, Remedy has intentionally aimed to make it something you can dip in and out of, "the session lengths are short - we're almost thinking: we don't have time to play games ourselves, what kind of game would we like to play that doesn't need to be sucking us in? You know when you lock in, you have 12 phases of stuff that has happened, that just reading through that is already your time gone for the night?"</p>
<p>Kayatta makes similar noises, describing the studio's inspiration in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> (along with many others), as a case of looking back and saying, "Wow, wasn't that game great - but also from the perspective of nostalgia, like: wasn't it great when you could kind of buy a game, and it might be supported over time, but ultimately, I can pick it up and put it down? And I can enjoy that game on my own terms, and not on the game's terms. Because it feels like so many things that tried to come for Left 4 Dead went in the opposite direction, where they're like, "Oh here's the fun gameplay - oh yeah but: battle passes and seasons!""</p>
<blockquote>"I'm not saying all those things are always evil..."</blockquote>
<p>"I'm not saying all those things are always evil," he adds, "it's not true. But ultimately, it is something that starts to try to tell you how to engage, and not just like, when you're in the game, but actually when you're out of the game, when do you come back to the game? How often do you need to play the game? Check in, do this, do that."</p>
<p>The inspiration instead, he says, "is more of a meta inspiration to say: what if we came back and we said, let's just focus on making a game that people like, and if they only play it for an hour a week and then they need to step away for six months, what if that was okay? What if it's okay that they go play other stuff? What if we built a game and a mandate - and a product, even, on the business level - around this idea that that's actually okay for a multiplayer game, and just get it in people's hands?"</p>
<p>The natural follow-on there is Remedy's decision to put Firebreak immediately onto Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. I asked Kayatta whether that helped take the pressure off a little, amongst the wider, tougher context of similar multiplayer games - most notably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">the high-profile failure and ultimately pulling from sale of Sony's Concord</a> - having some difficult launches.</p>
<p>"From a wider industry perspective, obviously, there's always the question of: is it cannibalising sales? But of course, it's not like people put things on Game Pass for free either," Kayatta says. "I wouldn't call it a safety net for us," he adds, in that "games can't just survive exclusively by trying to be available in one service or another service." Still, he notes that Game Pass and PS Plus were both "a very welcome partnership".</p>
<p>"We never used 'games-as-a-service', 'live-service' with this game, very consciously," adds PR director Thomas Puha, during a separate conversation. "The connotation of those games is, you know, it's gonna be 'battle pass' this, Call of Duty, Destiny, all these things that were so far from that."</p>
<blockquote>"[It's] a very contested market - but then everything is contested..."</blockquote>
<p>Puha adds, too, that the studio is aware it's "a very contested market - but then everything is contested. There's tons of games. It's not like there isn't a contest with single-player games, I mean we're up against, you know, Sony heavy-hitters... there's no point in trying to build something where you've got to be playing every day, because then the machinery we've got to build here is not something we could even afford - so what's the point?"</p>
<p>According to Puha, the studio's other backstop here, meanwhile, is its shift in approach towards making multiple games at once, which Remedy's been doing since 2016. "It's very much about spreading the risk," he says, "you can see it's near impossible to survive with making a single game and then hoping that it, against all odds, does phenomenally well, and you get some money out of it. Part of our business model is that we work on multiple things, and we've said we try to ship something every year."</p>
<p>The last point the team is keen to make is that FBC: Firebreak has been made with a significantly tighter budget than what you might consider some of its multiplayer competitors. "Of course, not just taking crazy risks by doing massive budgets and so on" is also a factor, as Puha puts it. "Of course we need this game to do well, but then we have realistic expectations." The team is still only around 50 developers strong, for instance - Control's team, by comparison, was in the low hundreds. "It's not like a 200-person, five-year dev cycle."</p>
<p>To Kayatta, FBC: Firebreak's director, it also just comes back to the reasons why it exists in the first place. "I think there's a lot of cynicism around multiplayer games," he says. "And I think there's double cynicism about multiplayer games that come from, traditionally, single-player studios. And obviously I feel that - I mean I'm also a gamer.</p>
<p>"But at the end of the day, one thing that is quite nice about working on this project here is that I know - because I live it every day - that this did not come from any amount of cynicism. It has just come from passion and creative people have been given a license to say, you know, what is fun? What do we just want to do? What's interesting?"</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> director Guillaume Broche has said a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> version of the game "could be interesting", though it seems there are no firm plans as of yet.</p>
<p>The game released last month across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but with Nintendo's next console arriving next month, speculation has arisen as to whether a port could be possible.</p>
<p>Speaking to French YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM">mistermv</a>, Broche discussed how the success of the game "changes everything" and the studio is considering its next steps.</p>

<p>"Well, at this point, considering the success of the game, it kind of changes everything," said Broche (machine translation, via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-switch-2-version-could-be-interesting-says-sandfall">MP1st</a>). "So clearly, it's too early to say, but we're kind of in a situation where... let's say there are a lot of opportunities showing up - way too many at once - and we're figuring out what we'll go for and what we won't. But yeah, it's definitely something that could be interesting."</p>
<p>By popular demand, the team is also looking into <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lp4swutbys2p">plushies of the game's cuddly character Esquie</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur was created by a core team of around 30 people (with extra outsourced support) and it seems its sudden success has been overwhelming. It sold<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day"> a million copies in three days</a> and, despite releasing the same week as Bethesda's Elder Scrolls: Oblivion remake, the game's publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-oblivion-surprise-release-didnt-seem-to-harm-clair-obscur-expedition-33-success-publisher-says">Kepler said this didn't seem to harm sales</a>.</p>
<p>Still, its high-end graphics make great use of Unreal Engine 5. "Overall, I think Expedition 33 is a very good-looking Unreal Engine 5 title, and it's one of the most graphically pleasing current-gen RPGs," wrote Digital Foundry in its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tech-review-ps5-pro-series-x-s">Clair Obscur tech review</a>. "Despite a few minor quibbles, it's delivering a top-notch aesthetic experience that looks consistently high quality when exploring or engaging in fights."</p>
<p>But would the game even be technically possible on Switch 2? Digital Foundry's Rich Leadbetter told me a port would be compromised, "but it is too early to say how compromised as we've seen so little of UE5 on Switch 2".</p>
<p>Earlier this week, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">in-development trailer for the game was unearthed on reddit</a>. It was originally called We Lost and featured a steampunk town and sci-fi elements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is continuing with its multiplatform strategy, despite a drop in sales of its games.</p>
<p>Its latest financial report shows a year-on-year drop in sales of its single player games, although profit was up due to the sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake which were "stronger... than initially assumed".</p>
<p>The likes of Visions of Mana, Fantasian Neo Dimension, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, among others, could not compete with previous releases <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, or the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.</p>

<p>Predictably, sales and profits of the company's MMOs have increased, notably due to the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail last summer. Further, sales and profits of mobile games have dropped "sharply" as the company has closed many of its games.</p>
<p>Indeed, it announced today the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-cancelled-but-kingdom-hearts-4-still-on-the-way">cancellation of mobile game Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, then, the digital entertainment sector has seen an 18 percent drop in sales, but 28 percent increase in operating income.</p>
<p>However, Square Enix is in the midst of a "three-year reboot for long-term growth", which began last year when CEO Takashi Kiryu announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">company was "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>, including "Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs".</p>
<p>So far, year-on-year sales of PC games have doubled - in the past year, previously console exclusives like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-pc-port-has-promise-but-too-many-problems">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-final-fantasy-16-is-highly-demanding-on-pc-and-these-are-the-best-settings">Final Fantasy 16</a> have been released on PC.</p>
<p>It seems Switch 2 will also be important for the company. Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be out this year (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">seemingly the full remake series</a>), while Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster will be out at launch. Could other games be ported over too?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-gets-first-look-at-gameplay">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD Remake</a> will be the biggest new release of the year, set for release across Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Windows, Steam). This will be followed in the next couple of years with "plans to release major titles" and "plans to release multiple titles on multiple platforms". By the third quarter of 2028, the company plans to "release major titles on a consistent basis".</p>
<p>The company also plans to release a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">mobile version of Final Fantasy 14</a>, though curiously it's listed as "for China" in this report.</p>
<p>What other "major titles" are in the pipeline? There's the expected third part of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, but outside of that could the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/official-final-fantasy-9-25th-anniversary-website-ignites-remake-hopes-once-again">rumoured Final Fantasy 9 remake</a> be a reality? A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">remake of Chrono Trigger</a>? And when will whatever Final Fantasy 17 turns out to be see the light of day?</p>
<p>Square Enix's diversifying strategy extends outside of games too. There's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-and-magic-the-gathering-crossovers-sephiroth-design-hints-at-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three">soon-to-be-released Magic: the Gathering card collection</a>, alongside various pop-up stores, concert events, and anime shows like NieR: Automata.</p>
<p>The company is also collaborating with Japanese TV network TBS on a "new IP based on transmedia expansion" - no further details have been provided.</p>
<p>As a result of all this, Square Enix is forecasting a further drop in sales for the next fiscal year, but an increase in profits. Without a major Final Fantasy release or Final Fantasy 14 expansion, it's certainly looking like a quieter year for the company.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">story for the third part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy is complete</a>. It remains without a release window.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"We wish to convey our heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the start of service," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players, we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development."</p>
<p>The company thanked those who took part in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-kingdom-hearts-game-begins-closed-betas-next-month">multiple closed beta tests</a>, before concluding: "The Kingdom Hearts series will continue.

<p>Square Enix officially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">announced Kingdom Hearts 4 back in 2022</a> for the series' 20th anniversary celebration, but little has been heard about it since.</p>
<p>Last year, series director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-will-lead-towards-a-series-conclusion-so-nomura-can-retire">Tetsuya Nomura stated the fourth game will be a reset of the story</a> but will lead towards a series conclusion as he looks to retire.</p>
<p>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link is the latest mobile game to be cancelled by Square Enix.</p>
<p>Back in February this year, the iOS version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-shuts-down-another-final-fantasy-mobile-game">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles was shut down</a> due to an ongoing bug. This followed the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-final-fantasy-mobile-game-ends-global-service-this-time-the-one-with-ariana-grande">Final Fantasy: Brave Exvius</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dissidia-final-fantasy-opera-omnia-will-shut-next-year">Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia</a>, and Final Fantasy 7 battle royale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-mobile-battle-royale-the-first-soldier-shuts-down-next-year">The First Soldier</a>, which were all shut down due to declining player numbers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
