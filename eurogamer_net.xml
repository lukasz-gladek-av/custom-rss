            <p>Floundering PvP shooter Highguard lives on, as developer Wildlight releases a new content update and assures worried fans that ominous signs like the game's website going offline are "low priority" problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">The new content update</a>, released overnight, adds an airship-featuring base to the game, a lockpick raid tool, and expands what's on sale in the Store. There's an owlbear-like mount there called a Moonbruin, and some Iron Vigil-themed outfits.</p>
<p>The patch arrives amidst growing concern that Highguard is about to shut down - an assumption that follows a bad start for the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">resulting in lay-offs at Wildlight</a>, and more recently, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the game's website suddenly going offline</a>. (It's still offline, by the way.)</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Q286nJoqI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>But Wildlight remains outwardly resolute despite these setbacks, insisting in the game's Discord overnight that the website issue is nothing sinister. "Not sure on the timeframe, but basically needs to be transferred and simplified," explained Wildlight staff member WL_Coronach (<a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2024081430674800915/photo/2">screenshotted by CharlieIntel</a>). "Low priority atm (reputational damage already done). Now we just need to focus on delivering updates and content to improve."</p>
<p>These comments follow a statement sent to Eurogamer earlier this month, regarding the layoffs, in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildguard said a "core group of developers" would remain to support Highguard</a>, and that the game wasn't about to close.</p>
<p>Highguard's had a hard time ever since closing The Game Awards in December. Despite the prominence of such an announcement and the proximity of a January release date, the game remained almost invisible until release, suggesting there were problems. Then when Highguard did finally arrive - a game with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> pedigree - it failed to convince. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">"We were turned into a joke from minute one," former Highguard developers said</a>.</p>

            <p>
Match of the Day football commentator Guy Mowbray has revealed he gave EA permission to create an AI voice clone of himself in order to assist with some of the more onerous aspects of recording commentary for EA Sports FC.
</p>
<p>
Mowbray shared the news as part of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c4g40828ngjo">BBC feature exploring how EA Sports FC's commentaries are made</a>, explaining that these days, recording or preparing for the game is a "part of my weekly routine", taking up "pretty much every week from November all the way through to the start of July."
</p>
<p>
"It takes so long because for every single facet of the game that you could think of, we have to cover every scenario," he revealed. "It is so in-depth because it has got to feel and sound real - the whole point of the game is its authenticity."
</p>
<p>
According to the report, one of the most repetitive elements of the recording process is reading out the name of every player in the game. Each name must be recorded several times, in different intonations, in order to fit within the wider commentary, and EA Sports FC features "more than 20,000 real male and female footballers". As such, EA now uses AI to replicate Mowbray's voice - with his permission - to "help" with this aspect of recording.
</p><p>
"AI has long been part of our development pipeline, from animation to gameplay systems," EA told the BBC in reference to its AI usage, "and continues to support our teams in making better, more responsive football experiences. But when it comes to commentary and content, it's always a collaboration with our talent - not a replacement."
</p>
<p>
Generative AI does, of course, remain hugely controversial given the numerous ethical concerns associated with the technology. And it's proved particularly contentious in the realm of video game voice acting. Last year, US voice actors union SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/voice-actors-relieved-to-have-the-freedom-to-work-again-says-jennifer-hale-as-sag-aftra-strike-ends">ended a lengthy strike</a> after finally securing "safety guardrails" around AI - and one of the union's key requirements was that companies pay actors on an equivalent basis for digitally replicated voices.
</p>
<p>
You can read more about how voice actors and unions have been fighting back against gaming's use of AI in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-publishers-developers-normalise-ai-tools-voice-work-ethical-unions-actors-fighting-back">Eurogamer's lengthy report from last year</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has flattened hope for a major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> overhaul by stating that the long-awaited update in development "is not Starfield 2.0".</p>
<p>This, to recap, is the update the Starfield community has been speculating about for roughly a year, ever after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-starfield-bethesda-reassures-fans-it-has-exciting-things-planned-for-2025-as-wait-continues-for-news-on-whats-next">Bethesda assured players it had "a lot of exciting things planned"</a>. This was a comment made in the silence following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">the somewhat anticlimactic release of Starfield's major Shattered Space add-on</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">the Kinda Funny podcast</a> yesterday, Howard said: "Obviously we've been working on a lot of Starfield content [...] You've seen it and I can tell everyone we're going to be talking about it really soon. We're moving into a phase where we're ready to talk about Starfield and really show that in the right way and what's coming to the game. We've been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKpjRoY9VwU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>"It is not Starfield 2.0 - I've seen some of that," Howard added. "So for expectation-setting, it's the kind of thing where if you love Starfield, we think you're going to love this. It's updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but [in a] sort of meta [way] - using outer space and things in ways that we haven't.</p>
<blockquote><em>"If Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away [...] I don't think this is going to change that fundamentally"</em></blockquote>
<p>"But look, if Starfield is something that didn't connect with you right away, or you bounced off it or found it boring in places, I don't think this is going to change that fundamentally."</p>
<p>Podcast host Greg Miller later asked Howard whether the update was imminent, to which Howard replied: "It's soonish. I don't want to spoil the day but it is coming soon." Miller also asked whether the update was a final update for the game, a sort of bow-tying closure, to which Howard said no. "No, we're doing more Starfield stuff coming up - we've been laying that out. It's something we see continuing for a while."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-review">Starfield was released in 2023 to middling reviews</a>, leading to a general sense that it wasn't the post-Skyrim and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a> homerun Bethesda had hoped to hit. But it still seems to have a healthy audience. In this interview, Howard referred to Starfield as a "Game Pass hours beast". "We have such a big audience on the game," he said.</p>

<p>Bethesda Game Studio's attention has more recently been on Fallout, following the launch of a second TV series that seemed to be received very well. I haven't finished it yet but Alex Donaldson was very positive, writing in an article that: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2 has made me excited for the future of the games - is there anything better a TV tie-in can do?</a>"</p>
<p>As far as game development goes, the majority of Bethesda Game Studios' 500-person workforce (Howard shared this number in the podcast) is concentrating on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">the sixth Elder Scrolls game</a>. (Note that BGS fairly openly uses external development partners - outsourcers - so the actual number of people working on its games is likely significantly higher). Howard referenced this new Elder Scrolls game in the podcast as well, explaining that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-majority-of-people-who-made-skyrim-are-still-here-bethesda-boss-on-why-the-elder-scrolls-6-will-be-more-like-skyrim-or-oblivion-than-starfield">The Elder Scrolls 6 marks a return to a more "classic" style of game for the studio</a> - think Skyrim or Oblivion - rather than the "creative detour" represented by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and Starfield.</p>

            <p>Do you have a sense of deja vu? Because dataminers believe they've discovered more evidence that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> could be coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> - a sentence we've already typed out here at Eurogamer in the year 2026.</p>
<p>That's right, we're back on familiar ground following the release of a massive update for Capcom's latest action-RPG this week, in which the Japanese publisher unleashed a flood of new content into the game to tide us all over until the next big DLC drop comes (which we're apparently going to hear more about in the summer). </p>
<p>As part of this big, final update, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1r8c00w/tempered_gogmazios_and_zoh_shia_sw2_version/">sleuths digging through the game</a>'s newly-updated code think that they have unearthed more evidence that the game has a Switch 2 version in the works (hat tip, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fans-uncover-strongest-evidence-yet-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">VGC</a>), in the form of a tutorial image depicting Switch 2 local multiplayer. The image was apparently hidden away in the files, and isn't supposed to be seen in any current front-end version of the game, but is nestled neatly in the update files. Uh-oh!
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This follows on from data strings found in the backend of Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 4, in which a group of Chinese dataminers believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">they found references to a Switch 2 port</a>, including information about wireless multiplayer, graphical presets, and reportedly "300 detailed parameters across four platforms: PS5, PC, Xbox Series, and Switch 2".
</p><p>The latest Wilds update, though, removed these older text strings. The lord giveth, the lord taketh away, it seems. At least we know from these earlier leaks that a potential Switch 2 version of Wilds will contain "a shadow quality preset for the Switch 2's docked 'Graphics Mode' that is higher than the PC's 'Very Low' preset" and that, in docked mode, the "'Graphics Mode' outputs at 1080p". Given the performance issues Wilds has suffered on PC to date, that's pretty impressive. If it works.</p>
<p>Right now, there's no formal word from Capcom that the game could be making the jump to Switch 2, but Capcom has long been a supporter of Nintendo's platform: we're even getting Resident Evil Requiem at launch on the handheld, and that runs on the same engine as Monster Hunter Wilds, so... stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>It'll be nice for Monster Hunter Wilds to have <em>a bit of a win</em>: since it launched in February 2025, the game suffered <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">under-performing sales with a fall-off post-launch</a>, and even contributed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">a dip in Capcom's share price</a>. Here's hoping that, with a second bite of the apple, Monster Hunter Wilds can rehabilitate its image to some degree.</p>

            <p>Bungie is uploading four tracks from the Marathon official sound track to major music streaming platforms later today, in the build-up to the game's launch on the 5th March.</p>
<p>These tracks are Rhythm of Writhing Constellations, Focused Erasures and Sub-Routine Resets, We Stole a Moon, and Code Race [Extended]. Alongside this announcement, <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2024295371095363688">a 20 second snippet of one of the songs was uploaded to X</a>.</p>
<p>The soundtrack, composed by Ryan Lott of Son Lux, has been sprinkled throughout pre-release trailers for the game. It's already garnered attention from fans, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-there-such-a-bustling-community-around-marathons-soundtrack-when-the-game-isnt-even-out-yet-one-producer-tells-us-why">who have begun making remixes of their own</a> in preparation for the full release.</p>
<p>Marathon,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too"> which is due to host a server slam public test in later February</a>, seems to be well-positioned for its launch. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">soared to the top of Steam's Top Sellers page</a> when pre-orders were made available, and it got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">a new trailer during this month's Sony State of Play</a>. Those picking it up on PlayStation will be able to unlock a selection of PlayStation charms, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-isnt-just-favouring-playstation-players-with-exclusive-cosmetics-xbox-and-steam-players-promised-bonus-loot-too">though similar cosmetics will be available on PC and Xbox</a>.</p><p>This, after a rough patch of stumbles for the game. Bungie had to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">overhaul many aspects of the gameplay</a> following the mixed reception to a previous closed play test, and visually the game came under fire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-plagiarism-scandal-resolved-satisfaction-of-artist">after it was discovered plagiarised art assets were present</a> in an earlier version of the game.</p>
<p>Are you excited for the Marathon soundtrack?</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It feels like we've heard a lot about Bethesda's mysterious, upcoming RPG, The Elder Scrolls 6, lately. The publisher has been very tight-lipped about the game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-todd-howard-and-team-have-settled-on-a-region-for-the-elder-scrolls-6">which we first started hearing about in 2018</a>, for the past eight years. We once got a title card, and that's about it. It was only recently we started learning more litle nuggets of information about the game after Bethesda's long silence on the project - whether it's how an old designer thought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-could-have-been-like-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back">it was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</a>, or how Bethesda boss man <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-todd-howard-wishes-elder-scrolls-6-development-went-a-little-faster-but-says-its-progressing-really-well">Todd Howard wishes development "went a little faster"</a>, we've heard more in the past few months than the past few years combined.</p>
<p>Not wanting to disappoint us with this relatively break-neck dripfeed of information, Bethesda director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has given a surprisingly candid interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">KindaFunny</a>. The veteran Bethesda creative gives us a few interesting tidbits, noting that he wishes the team didn't reveal the game so early - not for the first time - and that after a meandering "creative detour" in the form of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, the team is looking back to its classic formula for The Elder Scrolls 6.</p>
<p>"We do have a certain style that we like and that our fans like that we want to get better and better at," Howard said in the interview. "I think in some ways Fallout 76 and Starfield are a little bit of a creative detour from that classic Elder Scrolls, Fallout, a Skyrim or a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> or a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, Oblivion, where you're exploring a world in a certain way. And as we come back to Elder Scrolls 6 that we're doing now, we're coming back to that classic style that we've missed, that we know really really well."
</p>
<p>If you were dubious about the capabilities of the engine that powered Starfield living up to current-gen expectations, fret not: Howard also noted that Bethesda has been deep in research and development over the past few years, and the resulting Creation Engine 3 is a marked step up from the Creation Engine 2 that powered 2023's divisive space-faring RPG. The Creation Engine 3 will be the bast for "Elder Scrolls 6 and beyond." (Let's all agree nobody's to say "Fallout 5" yet.)
</p><p>Finally, if you need a bit of confidence in the team working on The Elder SCrolls 6, Howard teases "the majority of people who made Skyrim are still here," alongside a wave of new talent in the studio, too. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">The game is still a long way off,</a> though, so don't get too excited about that just yet. Even if some fans think we're going to get some sort of teaser <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">sooner, rather than later</a>.</p>
