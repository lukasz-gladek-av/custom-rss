            <p>
InZoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton, is absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> - to the point a lot of life sim fans are very excited indeed. So the good news is it now has a release date; the bad news is it's been delayed into next year to give it a "stronger foundation".
</p>
<p>
InZoi, which promises a "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will", was initially announced last year, when it was expected to launch for PC sometime in "Q4" this year. Now, however, Krafton has revised that release, confirming Inzoi will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">launching into Steam early access</a> on 28th March next year.
</p>
<p>
In a message announcing the news, InZoi director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim explained the decision to delay the game had been made after reviewing feedback and "analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests". He added the revised release will give the studio time to "improve areas that need attention" and "create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation".

<p>
"It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," Kim continued. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZoi â€” a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZoi a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible."
</p><p>
Players did, of course, get a bit of a look at InZoi back in August, when Krafton briefly released its impressively flexible character creator on Steam. During its five days of availability, the demo saw a peak of over 18K players, one of them being Eurogamer's own Jessica Orr, who shared a little of her character creating adventures right here.
</p>
<p>
"Visually, [the demo is] stunning," she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-old-brands-revitalised-ageing-classics-and-cursed-character-creators">wrote</a>. "It's a little unbelievable how good it looks, actually, even on lower graphical settings. The customisation goes deep too. It's got all the usual bells and whistles, and even a few chimes to boot, as we're treated to entire categories for things like fake nails... Personality customisation doesn't go as deep, from what I can tell in the demo, but it's nice to see inclusive gender and sexuality options there already."
</p>
<p>
InZoi is just one of several Sims-like that have surfaced in recent years. Paradox Interactive's Life by You has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">now been cancelled</a>, but that still leaves the highly anticipated Paralives, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">scheduled to launch into early access sometime next year</a>, and if you fancy something a little more lo-fi, you can also play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490/Tiny_Life/">adorably retro - but still surprisingly robust - Tiny Life</a> on Steam.

            <p>
With Dragon Age: The Veilguard's one-week anniversary now here, BioWare has released its first big patch for the well-received fantasy action-RPG; and as an added treat, the studio has tossed in some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> themed cosmetic armour to mark this year's N7 Day.
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard's first patch isn't admittedly, a particularly sexy one in terms of fixes. Its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/4453590197273100466?l=english">release notes</a> suggest an update primarily focussed on massaging away some relatively minor annoyances - but given Digital Foundry called the game's initial release an "attractive, technically solid" one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguards-pc-port-is-polished-performant-and-scales-well-beyond-console-quality">on PC</a>, and "polished [and] performant" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-dragon-age-the-veilguard-on-consoles-is-an-attractive-technically-solid-release">on consoles</a>, there didn't appear to be anything particularly egregious in need of attention.
</p>
<p>
Still, if you're an owner of an Nvidia 40-series GPU who couldn't access Dragon Age: The Veilguard's DLSS options, or were finding Harding and Taash's banter looping endlessly, then those - alongside exactly 43 additional issues - should now be remedied on PC and consoles.

<p>
Perhaps the most exciting part of the patch, then, is the inclusion of the aforementioned Mass Effect-inspired armour - a surprisingly dashing blend of practical chest plate, dinner jacket overcoat, and N7 helmet - that can be acquired via a new chest in the Lighthouse, and which you can see at the top of the page. This, of course, has been released to commemorate the return of BioWare's annual N7 Day - celebrations that have also seen a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Mass Effect TV show officially announced</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-rolling-out-cross-save-support-from-today-as-ps5-pro-enhancements-arrive">returning collaborations with No Man's Sky</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.
</p><p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/bioware/status/1854577078806429869">message shared on social media</a>, BioWare wrote, "November 7 has arrived once again, and as always, we're grateful for the opportunity to celebrate all things Mass Effect! This year is a little different, as we just launched Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a studio; so we're purposefully keeping things lighter as we celebrate the launch of the game... Although we're a little quieter this year, we couldn't be more excited for what's to come."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Robert Purchese had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">lot of good things to say about BioWare's latest Dragon Age in his five star review</a>. "From head to toe, wing to wing, The Veilguard is exquisitely realised and full of sophistication across systems and storytelling," he wrote. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic - epic in a way I think will set a high bar not only for BioWare in years to come but for role-playing games in general."
