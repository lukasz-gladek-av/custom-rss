            <p>Good news, Disney fans - it looks like Disney Music Parade -Encore- is coming to Nintendo Switches outside of Asia.</p>
<p>Initially, Disney Music Parade -Encore- only had confirmed releases in Japan (21st November) and Asia (12th December), although English language support was in place for those prepared to import it.</p>
<p>However, as spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ghz20a/disney_music_parade_encore_rated_by_esrb/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, it has just popped up on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40237/disney-music-parade-encore/">ESRB</a> website, too… even though there are currently no confirmed plans for a US release.</p>

<p>ESRB's description says Disney Music Parade -Encore- is "a rhythm game in which players match on-screen prompts in time with music. Brief clips from Disney movies will occasionally play in the background".</p>
<p>"A handful of these clips include mild instances of violence (e.g., a character hit by a flaming arrow, a character kicking another person)", but none of this is egregious enough to deter an E for everyone rating.</p>
<p>The listing also confirms that there are no interactive elements, and seemingly no in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Disney Music Parade - Encore - is a rhythm action game in which players tap to the beat of Disney songs as they ride through famous scenes from Disney animated films, including Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beauty, Moana, and Frozen.</p>
<p>The game also features Collections consisting of 150 different Music Rides depicting well-known Disney characters in a "brilliant, vibrant art style", as well as Memory Crystals that feature famous scenes from "beloved Disney animated films".</p>
<p>Disney Music Parade -Encore- is currently exclusive to Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There are currently no plans for Dragon Age: The Veilguard DLC.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">Rolling Stone</a>, which reported in an interview with creative director John Epler that "full attention [of BioWare] has shifted entirely to the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>" game.</p>

<p>Whilst Epler didn't comment directly on future content plans for the latest Dragon Age game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">IGN</a> says it believes BioWare plans to "support The Veilguard with quality-of-life improvements and a handful of smaller content updates".</p>
<p>If true, that's likely to surprise many BioWare fans familiar not just with Dragon Age, but its Mass Effect series, too. The studio has long been associated with quality DLC drops, including fan-favourite DLC expansions like Trespasser or Awakening.</p>
<p>Did you know that early on in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-an-early-mass-effect-easter-egg">Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare offers a knowing nod to Mass Effect</a>, its other beloved role-playing game series?</p>
<p>This week, Bertie sat down with Dragon Age's original creator David Gaider to hear about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">how BioWare knew some of the series' biggest plot points years ago, but kept its secrets hidden away</a>.</p>
<p>Awarding it a sterling five out of five stars in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> review, Bertie wrote: "It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it.

            <p>Earlier this week, Tom told us Nintendo Alarmo couldn't yet run Doom, but did confirm it could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-hack-cant-yet-run-doom-but-can-display-picture-of-a-cat">display a picture of a cat</a>.</p>
<p>Just three days later, however, Wii U reverse engineer GaryOderNichts has risen to the challenge and sent Alarmo rocketing into the Weird Things That Can Run Doom charts by... well, running Doom on Alarmo.</p>

<p>It's a long-running joke that iconic 90s shooter Doom is playable on almost anything, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-you-can-run-doom-in-balatro">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, a pregnancy test, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-is-now-playable-on-a-tractor">a tractor</a>, and a piece of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-piece-of-lego-can-now-play-doom">Lego</a>. It was only a matter of time for Alarmo to join the list, I guess.</p>
<p>"After my last post, it was pretty clear what everyone wanted to see on the Alarmo," GaryOderNichts quite rightly asserted.</p>
<p>"So, here it is - Doom running on the Nintendo Alarmo!"</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>As usually happens, there's a handful of caveats. Firstly, GaryOderNichts says there's currently no audio support, and to avoid the USB loader memory size restrictions, the .wad needs to be compressed and then uncompressed to external memory on boot.</p>
<p>"However, it's possible to load the shareware version of Doom entirely from USB, without modifying the Alarmo," GaryOderNichts explained.</p>
<p>And if you want to run Doom on your very own Alarmo, GaryOderNichts has <a href="https://t.co/3qBnVjIhqX">kindly shared his workings</a>. For more, including on what, exactly, is inside the Alarmo, <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">check out the blog</a>.</p>
<p>As Tom summarised for us at the time, Nintendo's leftfield launch this month of Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock, was something of a surprise. It's currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">available only to Nintendo Switch Online members</a> via the My Nintendo Store, priced £90/$99. It's expected to go on general sale from "mid-January 2025", helping fill the gap in Nintendo's launch schedule before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues">statement</a>, Twitch said that whilst it is a place "for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them", from now on, any stream that includes discussions about war, religion, or "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" needs to be labelled.</p>
<figure><div>

<p>"Twitch is a place for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them," Twitch explained.</p>
<p>"We require streams to be labelled when the focus of the stream includes discussions and debates about political or sensitive social issues such as discussions about elections, civic integrity, war or military conflict, and civil rights."</p>
<p>Examples of content that require a classification label include streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies, live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes, and livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies.</p>
<p>Also subject to further labelling are discussions about military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters, and discussing ideological or socio-political views on topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion.</p>
<p>"Discussing legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" is also subject to labels.</p>
<p>"Streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate" are not subject to labelling, however.</p>
<p>"For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote," Twitch explained. "Intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues are not required to have the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label."</p>
<p>The changes come after a trying few weeks for the livestreaming giant, which has found itself fielding accusations of islamophobia and anti-semitism.</p>
<p>"There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia," CEO Dan Clancy said in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/">complementary statement</a>. "As our community has grown, we’ve endeavoured to build Community Guidelines to prohibit these harms."</p><p>"Twitch is, and will always be, about belonging. Each day, people come together on our service to build communities around shared interests, and to express themselves authentically. For this to be possible, we work hard to ensure that our community is a safe place."</p>
<p>"Millions of streamers, with a wide variety of views and perspectives, spend time on Twitch. We recognise that some content, while allowed on our service, may be objectionable to some members of our community. The views shared by streamers on Twitch are not the views of Twitch nor are they my personal views."We’re grateful for the feedback and input from our community," Clancy concluded. "Our safety approach continues to build and evolve, as our service grows. We want to ensure that anyone can find their place on Twitch, and remain committed to ensuring that hate and harassment have no place here."</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-apologises-for-issue-preventing-account-sign-ups-in-israel-and-palestine">Twitch issued an apology for preventing new account sign-ups from Israel and Palestine due to the ongoing conflict</a>. It said sign-ups were temporarily disabled following the attacks on 7th October 2023 to "prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users". However, until recently, this verification had not been re-enabled.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has discussed the recent shock decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delay the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows until February 2025</a>, just a month before its originally intended release.
</p>
<p>
The move means Shadows will miss Assassin's Creed's typical pre-Christmas sales window, and comes amidst much <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">scrutiny of publisher Ubisoft's ongoing fortunes</a>, as well as a culture war that has erupted over Shadows' main characters.
</p>
<p>
Speaking at a BAFTA event attended by Eurogamer in London last night, Coté reflected on the reasons for delay, and the crucial importance of the game to Ubisoft at such a pivotal moment for the company and the Assassin's Creed brand.

<p>
"Players can afford to be selective, choosing only the best, and they rightfully demand excellence," Coté said. "Ubisoft's portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality. 
</p>
<p>
"Players expect more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement from the games we release, and they're not shy about letting us know when they feel we have fallen short. This environment pushes us to do better and to be better. 
</p>
<p>
"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> represents our opportunity to change that narrative, not just for Assassin's Creed, but I think for Ubisoft as a whole."
</p>
<blockquote>"In today's market, being amongst the best is just not enough anymore."</blockquote>
<p>
Shadows marks the beginning of a bold new push for the Assassin's Creed brand, and comes after a lengthy wait since the series' last fully-fledged blockbuster, 2020's Viking-fuelled Valhalla. (2023's Mirage was deliberately a smaller game, that began life as a Valhalla expansion.)
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft is priming Shadows to be the launch of a new era of Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">underpinned by a central game launcher/hub</a>, a more accessible ongoing narrative, and technological advances made possible by finally ditching the last generation of consoles. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Ubisoft's other 2024 blockbuster - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - underperformed commercially, and the company once again finds itself the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">subject of speculation on its ongoing corporate independence</a>. The stakes have never seemed higher.
</p>
<p>
"We know this game has the potential to be one of the best in the franchise's storied history, set in one of the most anticipated settings we've yet to explore," Coté said. "But we also know that in today's market, being <em>amongst</em> the best is just not enough anymore." 
</p><p>Coté reflected on the infamous 2014 launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-on-what-created-the-perfect-storm-behind-assassins-creed-unity">an ultimately too-ambitious technical leap for the series</a> set during the French Revolution. Ahead of launch, Ubisoft boasted that the game - the series' first installment for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles - would be where the "next generation started". Ultimately, Unity's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-addresses-every-known-assassins-creed-unity-glitch-and-workaround">graphical issues</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-unity-patch-removes-need-to-play-companion-app">convoluted online systems</a> wrecked first impressions, and the brand took a huge hit.
</p>
<blockquote>"We only have one shot at launching this game, and it has to exceed expectations."</blockquote>
<p>
"[Unity] was meant to be a major milestone for the series, but its reception at launch, marred by technical issues, left a deep impact on all parts of the company, from production to publishing, especially given Ubisoft's roots as a French company," Coté said. "This low point affected all of us, but it also served as a wake up call, reminding us how crucial it was to maintain the quality and integrity of the player experience from day one, a lesson that lives with us to this very day."
</p>
<p>All these years later, the spectre of Unity's launch still haunts the brand, it seems - and both Coté and Ubisoft bosses are keen to ensure it is never repeated.</p>
<p>
"After much reflection and analysis, I recommended to our top management to delay the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows," Coté continued. "Our playtests and team feedback made it clear Shadows had immense potential, but I felt we needed more time to ensure it fully meets the high expectations of our players. 
</p><p>
"We only have one shot at launching this game, and it has to exceed those expectations. Shadows is our most ambitious and complex project yet, with interconnected mechanics, narrative and technology all releasing across the largest number of platforms with the most options we've ever, ever supported. 
</p>
<p>
"Taking this extra time allows us to polish every aspect and set a new standard for the franchise, one that I hope will carry us forward for years. This decision reflects our commitment to delivering an experience worthy of our players' time and attention on day one. We believe Shadows will shine as a true showcase of Ubisoft's talent and dedication, setting a new benchmark in quality for the franchise."
</p>
<p>
Last night, Eurogamer reported on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-discusses-devastating-impact-of-shadows-diversity-and-inclusivity-backlash">Coté's lengthy and impassioned defence of Assassin's Creed Shadows' narrative choices and characters</a> - the reaction to which has involved a wave of backlash and online abuse aimed at the game's developers this year.
