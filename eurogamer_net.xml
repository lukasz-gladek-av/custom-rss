            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is finally back on iOS devices in the US and Europe, after a five-year legal battle between Epic and Apple.</p>
<p>Despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">"peace proposal" being offered by Epic</a> at the start of the month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-blocks-fortnites-return-to-iphone-in-us">Apple later blocked the return of Fortnite</a> in the US. When Epic returned to the judge of the legal case to review its Fortnite submission, the judge responded Apple is "fully capable of resolving this issue without further briefing or a hearing" and warned the official who is "personally responsible for ensuring compliance" would have to return for a hearing (thanks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661290/fortnite-ios-iphone-epic-games-back-apple-app-store">TheVerge</a>).</p>
<p>The two companies have since filed a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25949416-joint-notice/">joint notice</a> stating they have "resolved all issues".</p>

<p>As such, Fortnite has now returned to iOS devices, with Epic boss Tim Sweeney writing on social media "we back fam".</p>

<p>Though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-says-its-bringing-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-ios-in-the-uk-next-year">Fortnite had already returned to iOS devices in the European Union</a>, Apple's block of the game in the US delayed a regular update to the game, forcing all versions to be taken down.</p>
<p>Of course, the UK is no longer in the EU, meaning Fortnite is not yet available here on iOS. It's <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1794096002762244392">expected in the second half of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">Epic added a direct in-game payment option in Fortnite</a> to circumvent Apple and Google's official in-app purchase options, from which those companies take a 30 percent cut.</p>
<p>In retaliation, Apple pulled Fortnite from its App Store, sparking the five-year feud.</p>
<p>A verdict was finally reached earlier this month, when the US District Court of Northern California found Apple in "wilful violation" of the court's previous injunction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing".</p>
<p>That injunction meant Apple had to allow purchases for apps from outside websites, to which it agreed but levied a 27 percent fee. The court stated this move "strains credulity" and that Apple's goal "was to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream". The court verdict added: "In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court's Injunction."</p>
<p>Sweeney wrote on social media "Game over for the Apple Tax" and stated Fortnite would return to the iOS App store. Now, it finally has.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1924970858558128424">social media last night</a>, Sweeney said: "Thanks to everyone who supported the effort to open up mobile competition and #FreeFortnite from the very beginning. And thanks to all of the folks who initially sided with Apple then later came around to the winning side, supporting app developer rights and consumer rights."</p>
<p>Fortnite has immediately risen to the top free game on iOS in the US.</p>
<p>Epic has this week been in hot water due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-now-lets-you-chat-with-darth-vader-using-generative-ai-speech">addition of AI Darth Vader to Fortnite</a>, which was quickly used to spout bad language. A hot fix has since been issued, but actors' union <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-files-unfair-labour-practice-charge-against-fortnite-maker-epic-following-ai-generated-darth-vader-voice-lines">SAG-AFTRA has filed an unfair labour practice charge</a> in retaliation for the use of AI.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda has announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> has become the "biggest launch" in id Software's history.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1924921261253075244">shared the news on social media</a>, adding three million players had made their way into the fiery pits of hell since the game's release this month.</p>
<p>To put that into more context, Bethesda says Doom: The Dark Ages reached this number seven times faster than Doom Eternal.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1924819963623174653">According to SteamDB</a>, Doom: The Dark Ages topped sales charts for the PC storefront during the week of 13 May - 20 May 2025. It was followed by the Steam Deck in second place, while the remainder of the Steam top five for that week was rounded out by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>While this launch is no doubt an impressive achievement for all those involved in Doom: The Dark Ages' release, it is worth noting that the game was also made available to play via Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1924954084269777113">The Game Business co-founder Chris Dring</a> states that of those three million players, over two million came from Xbox according to figures from Ampere.</p>

<p>We were rather taken with Doom: The Dark Ages, with Chris Donlan calling it a "more grounded" series entry, but "one that's as brisk and playful" as ever.</p>
<p>"As a parent, the game I'm most concerned about these days is probably something like Roblox. By contrast, Doom feels like an entirely known and understood entity. Let's savour it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Eurogamer's Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>. "Here's a slice of pure gaming charisma that has come to us, unfrazzled, from a more innocent time.</p>

            <p>
Developer Shift Up has quietly announced its acclaimed sci-fi hack-and-slash adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> is getting a sequel - and it looks like it's due to arrive before the end of next year.
</p>
<p>
Shift Up shared the news as part of its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng">recent investor presentation</a>, tucking mention of a Stellar Blade sequel away on a slide highlighting its "IP expansion" plans for 2025 and 2026. The studio's free-to-play sci-fi shooter Goddess of Victory: Nikke got a mention, as did the mysterious "Project Witches", but it's Stellar Blade we're interested in here.
</p>
<p>Two key developments were listed under the Stellar Blade header: firstly, a "platform expansion", which seems likely to be a reference to the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-out-on-pc-next-month-according-to-leaked-trailer">imminent arrival on PC</a> - a release Shift Up has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">extremely high hopes for</a>. And then next to that, an unassuming second blue box tagged with the all-important word "sequel".

<p>
Shift Up's sequel announcement didn't come with any specific details, but one interesting takeaway is the timeline the studio looks to be working on. According to Shift Up's slide, Stellar Blade 2 is due to launch before 2027, strongly suggesting the developer is targeting a 2026 release - less than two years after the launch of the first game. That feels like a remarkably swift turnaround time for a fully fledged AAA sequel.

<p>
Hopefully, though, Stellar Blade 2 can live up to the standard set by its acclaimed predecessor, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">awarded four stars in Eurogamer's review</a>. "Stellar Blade has a fair bit of weirdness," Jessica Orr wrote, "but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."
</p>
<p>
PC players can pick up Stellar Blade via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3489700/Stellar_Blade/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stellar-blade-fa21c3">Epic</a> when it launches on 11th June. Additionally, a Complete Edition arrives for PC and PlayStation 5 on the same day, bundling together the base game, various cosmetics for protagonist EVE, and more. PC players should note, however, Stellar Blade is currently blocked in over 120 countries, which seems to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-release-blocked-on-steam-in-over-120-countries-surprising-even-its-developer">surprised Shift Up as much as everyone else</a>. Over the weekend, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-studio-says-it-is-closely-discussing-the-region-lock-issue-with-playstation">said it was "closely discussing the region lock issue" with Sony</a> in the hope of finding a solution before 11th June.
