If you're eager to know what's new in EA Sports FC 26, your day is almost here; EA is giving its latest football iteration the full reveal treatment later this week. And it's also unveiled this year's Ultimate Edition cover star, so you got something to look at while you wait.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, EA Sports FC 26's "full reveal" is scheduled to air this Wednesday, 16th July. Proceedings get underway at 5pm BST, so you've got approximately 47 hours at the time of writing to dig out your best hat in anticipation.  And when you're done, you'll be wanting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24">bookmark the appropriate YouTube page</a>.
</p>
<p>
EA's reveal announcement arrives alongside a <em>second</em> announcement <a href="https://x.com/EASPORTSFC/status/1944774028578684977">confirming</a> one of this year's EA Sports FC cover stars: retired Swedish footballer Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡ is EA Sports FC 26's Ultimate Edition cover star, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zlatan-ibrahimovi-accuses-ea-of-using-his-name-and-face-in-fifa-21-without-permission-ea-responds">falling out with the company</a> back in 2020 when he accused it of using his name and face without any agreement in the FIFA games.

If you were previously excited about the impending arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-war">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War</a>'s Definitive Edition release, there are now two additional reasons to be excited. Firstly, it's out very soon on the newly announced date of 14th August, and secondly, there's a nice chunky discount if you own the Anniversary edition of the game.
</p>
<p>
Dawn of War's Definitive Edition was announced back in May, amid a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-1-spruce-ups-are-coming-this-year">wave of other Warhammer 40K news bits</a>, promising a fancied-up version of the original 2004 real-time strategy game intended to be more palatable on modern day hardware.
</p>
<p>
There's 4K support, for instance, alongside upscaled textures (4x the originals, supposedly), an enhanced battlefield camera, "optimised" HUD and screen layouts for widescreen viewing, plus improvements to world lighting, units reflections, and shadows.

<p>
And it's not just the base game getting those enhancements, seeing as the Definitive Edition also includes Dawn of War's three expansions: Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. That, according to developer Relic Entertainment, amounts to "four Classic Dawn of War Campaigns, nine Armies, and over 200 maps". Plus, the Definitive Edition remains compatible with "over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods".
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition will cost $29.99 USD (or your local equivalent) when it launches for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warhammer_40000_dawn_of_war_definitive_edition">GOG</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3556750/Warhammer_40000_Dawn_of_War__Definitive_Edition/">Steam</a> on 14th August. And anyone that already owns the game's Anniversary Edition, which released back in 2006, will be able to purchased the new version with 30 percent off as a "thank-you to our loyal fans."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-warhammer40kdawnofwar-pc">gave the original version of Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 8/10</a> back in the day when numbers still went above five. "It's a perfect gaming world," Eurogamer contributor Keiron Gillen wrote, "being exploited perfectly, for the first time."
