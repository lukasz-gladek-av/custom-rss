            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has now had 3.5 million players, less than a week since its release.</p>
<p>FromSoftware shared the news in a social media post, which also confirmed duo expeditions will be added "at a later date".</p>
<p>The multiplayer spin-off to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> is ostensibly a three-player game, though it's possible to play solo too. However, it's received plenty of criticism from players hoping to play as a duo.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">FromSoftware stated it was considering adding a two-player mode post-launch</a>, with director Junya Ishizaki explaining it was "something that was overlooked during development".</p>
<p>It seems, from this latest post, that the mode is on the way. It will follow the already announced DLC releasing later this year, as well as "enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month".</p>
<p>The news suggests FromSoftware will be supporting the game with new content post-release.</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">But the Night is far from over.<br>In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>â€” ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>If you can't wait that long, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-two-player-elden-ring-nightreign-pc-mod-is-already-available">PC players can already play the game with two players thanks to a fan-made mod</a>.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign released last week and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">received two million players in its first day</a>. Initially, the game had a "Mixed" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/#app_reviews_hash">reaction on Steam</a>, but it's now recovered to "Mostly Positive". Perhaps players just needed to give it time and appreciate the game for what it is, rather than what it supposedly lacks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, FromSoftware <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-is-now-easier-for-solo-players">patched Elden Ring Nightreign to make it easier for solo players</a> - now there's a new automatic revive and an increase in runes gained. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">multiplayer remains the best way to experience the game</a>.</p>
