            <p>A Netease spokesperson has told Eurogamer that statements made by Suda 51 on its generative AI policy are not correct, and that the company continues to work with the technology.</p>
<p>The spokesperson has also pointed to an upcoming GDC talk hosted by Netease covering generative AI."The assertion that NetEase Games has closed an AI department or that we've mandated teams or studios not to use AI is not true," said a representative speaking on behalf of the publisher. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/">Elsewhere</a>, NetEase has offered a comment saying: "The situation described did not occur, and we have not published any related policies".</p>
<p>Suda 51, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-melting-faces-generative-ai-jazz-band">talking to Eurogamer as part of an interview on Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming game Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, stated the following: "They originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff, but at one point they decided not to do that any more. They folded that section and told their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all."</p>
<p>"I don't know, they never explained directly why," Suda continued. "If I had to assume, it was probably one or both of two things. A lot of gamers out there don't like AI and having it in their games. Another thing is issues with copyright infringement. That can be tricky to get around, and clear before making something. That was probably part of it too - it would be easier to get rid of it altogether. But, again, that's my assumption. No one told me directly."</p>

<p>As for Grasshopper's own involvement with generative AI, Suda 51 also stated the company had not done any research into AI, and he believes there's something in the human brain that tells them something is off when they see it.</p><p>Suda told Eurogamer: "At some point there may be this thing I've heard be called the "New Reality", but even if it does get to that point and it's really good and realistic, I feel humans have something in their brain that tells them something is off. So while I don't have a strict opinion either way on people using it in their own games, that's not the way we do it. That's one of the things that bring people to Grasshopper games - they can feel people's efforts themselves. It's something we're proud of.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> is about to turn 10 this month and I'm turning to literal dust as I type this sentence. However, that isn't stopping Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) from updating the incredibly successful life/farming sim in big ways.</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">quick update</a> on the state of his new game, Haunted Chocolatier, IGN had the opportunity to sit down with Barone to discuss Stardew Valley's past, present, and future. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">full interview</a> is long and deep, a must-read for anyone interested in the hit game, but those looking for an excuse to get back into the cozy grind of this modern indie classic are waiting for news on what's coming with the 1.7 patch, and we thankfully have two biggies to share.</p>
<p>While it's going to be a while before we get a definitive release date and full patch notes, the developer was kind enough to share a couple of nuggets of information even if he wants the update to be a "surprise" for the most part. Think of it as a big 10th birthday gift.</p>
<p>First, following fan noise, he's worked on an upgrade of sorts to the children, who will be "a little more interesting" after the patch arrives. What that entails is currently unknown, but it's not unreasonable to expect a deeper family experience on that front. Players had been saying for the longest time that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/15klpr3/is_there_any_point_to_children/">there was no point to them</a> and they mostly felt like "set dressing" when compared to other social elements in the game, so that's a victory.</p><p>A second update to families will arrive in the form of "two more marriage candidates" that he wasn't ready to reveal yet. You'll have to wait until 26th February to learn about those, and you can start placing your bets now. Will they be new characters or veterans that players have been wanting to romance for ages? Everything's possible.</p>
<p>In any case, it's nice to see Stardew Valley receiving extra love after 10 years that many indie studios would kill for. At this point, it's reminding me of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>'s endless "actually, more patches are happening" state, and you won't be hearing me complain even if the massive game sits barely touched in my Steam library.</p>
