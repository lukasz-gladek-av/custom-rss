            <p>
King of Meat, the Amazon-published dungeon creator action game, now has a release date: 7th October.
</p>
<p>
Developed by former Lionhead (Fable) and Media Molecule (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a>) developers, Glowmade's game will feature over a hundred dungeons at launch for 1-4 players to complete, filled with battles and traps. Then, players will be able to create their own dungeons and upload for the community to play.
</p>
<p>
King of Meat will be released across PC (Steam), PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, and cost £23.95 for the standard edition (or £39.95 for the deluxe edition featuring extra cosmetics).

<p>
Ahead of release, Glowmade has stressed the game is not pay-to-win, with all purchases being optional cosmetics, and doesn't include any form of random monetisation like loot boxes.
</p>
<p>
Future updates will also be free for those with the base game, though post-launch content is yet to be divulged.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, for those intrigued, a technical test will run this weekend from 23rd - 24th August on all three platforms - simply search for the game on your platform of choice.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> has brought back the secret Guy Savage mode within the remake. But it turns out this mode wasn't made by Konami alone - Platinum Games (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, Astral Chain) is responsible for the surprise action minigame.</p>
<p>The Guy Savage mode can be played by saving the game and exiting to the menu directly after the torture scene deep into the game. When you re-launch the game, the Guy Savage minigame will start. Alternatively, beat the game and the minigame will be accessible.</p>
<p>Guy Savage was originally based on a <a href="https://x.com/Arc_Hound/status/1054458915851788289">cancelled prototype for Zone of the Enders 3 / Anubis 2</a> which was snuck into the original Metal Gear Solid 3. In Delta, <em>every</em> little Easter egg and trick has been recreated. The same goes for minigames, with Snake vs Monkey coming back (with a surprise appearance from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>).</p>

<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is an incredibly faithful recreation of the original game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">Eurogamer's review states</a>: "Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is faithful, it's a church dedicated to one of gaming's best stealth games. Updates to how the game plays are subtle, and in regard to the new gameplay style, totally optional. So much is left untouched, and that's for the best. Add in some original art, some obscure modes, and let her loose."</p>

            <p>
If I had to make a list of the things in life I have absolutely no interest in, trucks would be pretty near the top. And yet, I am <em>obsessed</em> with developer SCS Software's Truck Simulator series of games. And so, following the news both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are at long last making their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, I'm here to convince you their soothing expanses of endless virtual highway might also be for you, even if you don't know your backhaul from your bill of lading.
</p>
<p>
The downside to this whole not-being-into-trucks thing is, of course, that I'm a terrible guide through the series if you're here for proper hobbyist reasons, so apologies in advance. For me, though, the appeal is not so much the allure of a Hopper Body and the promise of a lubricated Glad Hand, as it is the pure ASMR pleasures of hours spent in empty minded tranquility with naught for company but the swoosh of scenic vistas, the tick of an indicator, the quiet hum of an air-conditioned cabin, and the lulling rumble of rubber on road.
</p>
<p>
I'm being a little reductive, admittedly. Well, a lot actually. Even without delving deep into the Truck Simulator games' more specialist particulars, there's a lot to love. There's the fundamental progression system that sees you doing odd jobs in loaned trucks and then scrambling up the XP tree to unlock new missions, or stockpiling enough cash that you're able to buy your own truck, even start your own business with your own HQ. It's not necessarily a particularly flashy package, but its basic structure is sound enough that it provides an additional layer of focus to your life on the open road. Chuck in the kind of cabin customisation that lets you scatter tatty souvenirs and pizza boxes around the place (honestly, I love this kind of nonsense), occasional community events, and a multiplayer mode enabling up to eight friends to form a convoy - a wonderfully, surprisingly hilarious recipe for chaos with the right (or wrong, depending on your perspective) people - and it's brilliantly compelling, even if you don't give a truck about trailers and the like.

<figcaption>ATS and ETS 2 are coming to consoles.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frPwmR2MEVs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As for the different flavours of sim coming to Xbox and PlayStation, both - if you're not already aware - are fundamentally the same experience, just with a very obvious change of scenery between them. Personally, I'm far more partial to the big skies and breathtaking wilderness of American Truck Simulator than its European counterpart (the sheer uncanny weirdness of ETS2's deeply unconvincing UK expansion was a bit of a turn-off when I tried it a fair few years back), but your mileage - no pun intended - will almost certainly vary.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.scssoft.com/2025/08/in-case-you-missed-it-future-games-show.html">SCS' Truck Simulator console announcement</a> is almost completely devoid of specifics, so pretty much all we can say with certainty right now is that ATS and ETS 2 are on the way. I'd assume both will be pretty close to their PC counterparts (minus, perhaps, extended peripheral support and mod availability), especially after all the work SCS has done to improve controller support and upgrade the interface over time. It will, though, be interesting to see how the studio handles the games' years of paid cosmetic, truck, and map expansion DLC. A couple of free packs-ins to help consoles catch up? Starter bundles? Nothing of the sort? Time will reveal all.
</p>
<p>
So there you go; American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 are finally making their way to Xbox Series X/S and PS5. And if the thought of the open road and an endless shifting horizon stirs even the faintest twinge of latent yearning, you'd do well to lean in. You too might discover a love for a virtual four-wheeled life of adventure hitherto unknown.
