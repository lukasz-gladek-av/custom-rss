            <p>The team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> - the fan-made reimagining of Valve's Half-Life - has announced its next game.</p>
<p>It's called Rogue Point, and developer Crowbar Collective describes it as a "rogue-lite tactical co-op shooter", which will offer up a "strategic approach to high-octane combat".</p>
<p>This will all see players unlocking various weapons and cosmetics to help them on their way, as they shoot through a "dynamic campaign" (the developer promises that no two playthroughs will be the same).</p>

<p>"The CEO, the richest man in the world, is dead," Rogue Point's official blurb begins. "Cutthroat conglomerates seek to carve up his kingdom. Using the MERX app, rival businessmen can order private mercenary armies as easily as ordering takeout! Only Rogue Point, an elite, independent vigilante squad, dares to fight back."</p><p>Players will need to do what they can to eliminate the MERX, and "put an end to the corporate war" that has befallen society. This can be done with up to four others, making up a team of justice-seeking gun-slingers.</p>
<p>"We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new IP (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio)," project lead Adam Engels said today, thanking Rogue Point partner Team 17 in the process.</p>
<p>"Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of Black Mesa and having Team 17 as a partner for Rogue Point helps us focus on development and community feedback!"</p>
<p> You can check out a trailer for Rogue Point in the video above. If you are interested, you can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">wishlist Rogue Point on Steam now</a>. There is currently no release date other than a vague "2025". </p>
<p>We called Crowbar's past work a "masterful remake that improves upon a classic" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-mesa-review-a-masterful-remake-that-improves-upon-a-classic">Eurogamer's Half-Life: Black Mesa review</a>. Hopefully, Rogue Point lives up to that same standard. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 4pm UK:</strong> Well, that didn't take long. Microsoft has now confirmed Spyro Reignited Trilogy hits Xbox Game Pass tomorrow, 12th November.</p>
<p>The trilogy of titles will be available to play whether you subscribe to Game Pass Standard, Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass, across cloud, console and PC.</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 3pm UK:</strong> Stop everything - Xbox is teasing that Spyro is coming to Game Pass.</p>
<p>We don't have much to go on - Microsoft simply posted a 30-second teaser of a glittery chest and the words, "hey, uhh who left this chest here?" - but it's enough to get fans excited that the Spyro: Reignited Trilogy could be on its way to the Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>

<p>The official Sypro the Dragon X/Twitter account responded with three wide-eyes emojis and shared the message. Up until today, the account had been dormant since May.</p> <div>

<p>The good news is these kinds of teases often come ahead of an imminent release, so, hopefully, we won't have to wait long for formal confirmation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Microsoft has announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-november-line-up-announced">Xbox Game Pass line-up for the first half of November</a>, headlined by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-slug-tactics">Metal Slug Tactics</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> Remastered and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>.</p>
<p>Xbox recently reaffirmed its commitment to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reaffirms-commitment-to-bringing-great-games-to-more-people-on-more-devices">"bringing great games to more people on more devices"</a> and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Bethesda and MachineGames have released an extended look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, giving us a deeper dive into the upcoming game.</p>
<p>In the 15-minute presentation, the team offers a look at a broad spectrum of gameplay, including combat, puzzles and traversal. The part I am most looking forward to - Indy's turn as an Agent 47-like man of disguise - is also shown off, with MachineGames letting us see the archaeologist infiltrate areas dressed as a member of the clergy. </p>
<p>And yes, just like Hitman's Agent 47, you can hide bodies by picking them up and moving them out of sight of patrolling guards or whoever else you don't want happening upon your corpse wake.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives us a look at the Great Circle's Adventure Points, which are used to unlock new skills. One such skill is Lucky Hat, which allows our hero an extra chance to come back from a fatal blow. Another, Bear Hands, lets Indy do unarmed takedowns of enemies. Speaking of taking down enemies, Indy can use his gun and whip to get the upper hand, but also items he finds lying around the environment. One moment sees the archaeologist bopping his assailant on the head with a rolling pin.</p><p>On the puzzle side of things, we see Indy pouring out some wine to reveal a number hidden within a basin, and elsewhere bouncing light around a secret room with ancient mirrors. He can use his camera to search for puzzle clues, as well. </p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release across Xbox and PC next month, on 9th December. It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">arrive on PS5 next year</a>.</p>

<p>Our Ian has been hands on with the upcoming release already. "I think it's going to be something truly special and I can't wait to play more of it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">Eurogamer's hands on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preview</a>.</p><p>"It's shaping up to be a wonderful love letter to Indiana Jones, just like Rogue City was to Robocop, and anyone who counts themselves a fan of the movie trilogy (there's definitely only been three movies, don't know what you're talking about) should definitely have this on their radar."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
