            <p>
Forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/enjoy-8-inches-of-lego-shadow-the-hedgehog-this-october">eight inches of Shadow the Hedgehog</a>; forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treat-yourself-to-22-inches-of-snake-with-big-boss-metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-statue">22 inches of Solid Snake</a> (until you're alone at least), and behold the terrifying majesty of Grounded 2's 10-foot ant plushie/gaming chair hybrid, which Microsoft is currently giving away to promote its upcoming sequel.
</p>
<p>
Grounded 2 is, of course, the follow-up to Obsidian Entertainment's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-review-a-delightful-mix-of-harsh-survival-and-warm-hearted-design">well-received 2022 co-op garden survival game</a>, which cast players as inadvertently miniaturised children - very much in the style of 80s movie favourite Honey, I shrunk the Kids - then set them loose in a backyard now transformed into a perilous landscape of towering blades of grass and truck-sized spiders.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian's sequel doesn't do much to shake up the fundamental premise - you're small again, but this time in a park - but that new location should hopefully spice things up, and then there are mounts. Yup, this time you can saddle up on insects and barrel around the place, bringing us back to that giant ant. Xbox's <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1948367630902931457">giveaway</a> features a monstrous plushie version of that aforementioned mount, sprawling threateningly across your gaming room floor and equipped with a little saddle you can pop your botty on, spread-eagled and ready for more survival.

All you need do to be in with a chance of winning (as per <a href="https://rules.xboxpromotions.com/grounded2?ocid=Sweepstakes_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_7.23.1">Microsoft's T&amp;Cs</a>) is repost one <a href="https://x.com/Xbox">official Xbox</a> promotional Grounded 2 post featuring the hashtag #Grounded2Sweepstakes on X, or, if your preferred social media hellscape is Instagram, comment on an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xbox/">official Xbox</a> Grounded 2 promotional post with the phrase #Grounded2Sweepstakes. One winner will walk away with (well, awkwardly shuffle away with) that 10ft gaming ant, which Microsoft officially refers to as "gaming furniture", if you were wondering.
</p>
<p>
As for Grounded 2 itself, it launches into PC early access and Xbox Series X/S "game preview" on 29th July, and our Bertie Purchase has been having a natter with Obsidian ahead of its release. So far, Bertie's managed to glean Grounded 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidian-says-grounded-2-wont-have-lan-multiplayer-either-and-its-a-huge-shame">won't have LAN multiplayer</a>, that it might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-could-grow-into-a-trilogy-and-there-are-already-ideas-that-could-fill-a-potential-grounded-3">second part of a trilogy</a>, and even got some not entirely subtle hints we can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-grounded-2-come-to-playstation-and-switch-2-grounded-was-on-all-those-platforms-teases-obsidian-executive-producer">probably expect it on Switch 2 and PS5</a>. So thanks ants. <a href="https://youtu.be/9jtU9BbReQk">Thants</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> developers at Riot Games have confirmed that the upcoming 2v2 fighting game will have a cool feature in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heads-up-arcane-fans-vi-has-been-revealed-as-2xkos-eighth-fighter-ahead-of-its-final-beta-landing-in-september">its closed beta</a> that should allow for a wave of competitive tournaments to flourish before its full release.
</p>
<p>This feature is offline play, confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/TheNitten/status/1948130703540891659">executive producer Tom Cannon</a> on the 2XKO Discord. Now that may not sound like a big deal, but there are a few quirks and considerations that make this a bigger deal than you may assume. For one, all characters are playable offline. 
</p>
<p>That means that from the closed beta launch until the foreseeable future, new characters won't have to be arduously unlocked or grinded out in-game to play with friends or at big tournaments. This is cool for everyone, but for tournament organisers who need dozens of set-ups with all characters unlocked, it's a lifesaver.

<p>On top of that, the lack of an online connection is a massive deal for these tournaments as it lowers costs. If you rent out a venue, you often have to pay for internet access. This can be expensive for larger events in convention centres or hotels. Plus, the internet in these venues isn't always stable. In a competitive environment, having a local match fall apart due to an internet connection would be a major problem.
</p>
<p>Riot Games is essentially making this decision to lend a head to the competitive space, which even today acts as a major foundation for the genre's popularity. Be it smaller events in your local cities, or annual super-events bringing in thousands of players, the in-person experience remains central to the overall enjoyment of fighting games. 
</p>
<p>2XKO has been present at the largest of these events - Evo - in the years prior to its release. The reason being a consistent source of feedback from players of all levels of skill and a way of telling genre diehards that this new company stepping into the space understands what the core audience values. So if you're excited for 2XKO, or just want an excuse to get out of the house in September when the closed beta launches, this is certainly good news for you.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-tournaments-could-start-earlier-than-you-think-due-to-this-closed-beta-feature]]></content:encoded>
