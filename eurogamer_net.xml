            <p>Many fans rushed to scream Leon S. Kennedy had aged like fine wine when he showed up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprising-absolutely-no-one-leon-s-kennedy-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-in-new-gameplay-trailer">December 2025 trailer</a>. That's a sentiment most of us can agree with, and it appears we also have to thank Capcom's female developers for their attention to detail.</p>
<p>At least that's what Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi revealed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">during a chat with Automaton</a>: "We've spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon's visuals. Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck."</p>
<p>With Requiem's story being set around 20 years after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4</a>, Leon is now comfortably sporting an authentic dad/uncle look that makes him a true veteran who's seen too many horrors for a single lifetime. Regardless, he's back for more action alongside Grace Ashcroft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-final-preview">with the latter favouring a tenser survival horror gameplay loop</a>.</p>
<p>Leon's design wasn't locked early on, either. Nakanishi revealed it actually changed over the course of making the game: "Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone's heart throb." It sure sounds like they were thinking about the thirstiest fans during the entire process.</p><p>The employees' suggestions went beyond Leon's look as well, with Nakanishi also stating "every staff member had their own interpretation of Leon’s 30-year-long history." Considering Resident Evil's storied journey over so many entries, it comes as no surprise developers that have also grown up with the series had heated feedback for the top creatives. "After many discussions, we were able to settle on something that clicked for us. When players see this Leon in the game, hopefully they will be able to find their own interpretation of him as well," the director added.</p>
<p>Fans won't have to wait long now to spend as much time as they want with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiems-director-on-why-re9-wont-suffer-the-same-multi-protagonist-woes-as-re6-and-why-its-more-like-sushi">Leon and Grace</a>; Resident Evil Requiem will infect PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-wanted-mouse-support-in-resident-evil-requiem-on-switch-2-but-it-confused-the-gameplay">even Nintendo Switch 2</a> on 27th February, 2026.</p>

            <p>Embark Studios has confirmed that both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and the Finals have been hit by DDoS attacks, claiming they were both "extensive" and "co-ordinated".</p>
<p>These problems first started in the early hours of the morning, with reports of mass instability impacting both games. While initially some stability was brought back to the servers, this soon deteriorated again as the DDos attacks continued.</p>
<p>In an update posted on the official Arc Raiders Discord server a few hours ago, community manager Ossen wrote: "Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress - but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing."</p>

<p>This effort to resolve the connectivity problems coincided with work on a hotfix targeting unintended changes with the recent major update, which altered the fire rate of some weapons, led to some earned cosmetics going missing, and more.</p>
<p>In the last hour, Ossen updated Arc Raiders players on the DDos issue, stating: "We are noticing that servers are recovering." Whether the DDoS attacks have concluded, or Embark has resolved the issue entirely, remains unclear.</p>
<p>This attack comes only a day following<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-you-a-little-too-good-at-arc-raiders-the-new-solo-vs-squad-mode-might-be-for-you"> the release of a new solo vs squad game mode, as well as a Bird City map condition</a>. It's worth noting that even with this ongoing DDoS attack, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">SteamDB still tracks well over 100,000 players still in-game</a>.</p>
