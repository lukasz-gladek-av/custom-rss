            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>, the much-anticipated 4v4 fighting game, is headed to Evo next month. At Vegas, attendees will be able to play it for the first time, and watch a gameplay deep-dive panel in person.</p>
<p>Marvel Tokon, the upcoming four-character tag fighter from Arc System Works and Sony Interactive Entertainment, currently has six characters in this soon-to-be playable build. Attendees will be able to select from these characters to form their squad.</p>
<p>The panel itself - which is likely the most important aspect of Marvel Tokon's presence at Evo, for those keen to know more about the game - is set to take place at 8pm ET, on the 1st August. That's 5pm PT, or 1am BST/2am CEST on 2nd August. Those not at the show will be able to watch it online.</p>

            <p>Sony is getting ready to launch a PlayStation 5 system update in beta, which includes simultaneous DualSense wireless controller pairing across multiple devices (personally, hallelujah to this).</p>
<p>The PlayStation maker notes that many of its peripherals, such as the DualSense and DualSense Edge wireless controllers, are made to support devices including PC, Mac, and mobile as well as its own PS5 console. This compatibility "creates a more flexible and seamless gaming experience," PlayStation said.</p>
<p>But there's always been a bit of snag, shall we call it, when it comes to connecting a DualSense controller to more than one device. In fact, you can't do it right now, and instead have to pair the controller with a new device any time you want to use it elsewhere. It isn't the end of the world by any means, but it does take up time that we could use for other things, like starting a game straight away.</p>

<p>Thankfully, PlayStation understands the current way of doing things isn't the most streamlined, and its new beta update will allow participants to register up to four devices simultaneously which can then be switched between. "For example, you can take your controller which you use with your PS5, then seamlessly switch connection to a PC to play PC games, or connect it to a smartphone to enjoy Remote Play from your PS5. With this enhanced flexibility, you can enjoy gaming more freely across multiple devices," it explained.</p>
<p>Controllers can be paired by pressing a combination of the PS button and one of the action buttons (triangle, circle, cross, or square), which assigns a device to a chosen "slot". Once devices are registered, users can switch between them by pressing the PS button and the corresponding action button. The light bar will also light up, with the indicator's lights blinking according to the slot number.</p>
<p>Here's a table laying things out for you:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th>Slot number</th>
<th>Button used</th>
<th>Player indicator lights</th>
<th>Connected Device (Example)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slot 1</td>
<td>PS button and Triangle button</td>
<td>One light on</td>
<td>PS5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slot 2</td>
<td>PS button and Circle button</td>
<td>Two lights on</td>
<td>PS5 Pro</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slot 3</td>
<td>PS button and Cross button</td>
<td>Three lights on</td>
<td>Windows PC</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Slot 4</td>
<td>PS button and Square button</td>
<td>Four lights on</td>
<td>iPhone</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Beta access for this new feature is, for now, limited to invited participants. However, Sony will be rolling it out globally "in the coming months", so stay tuned. Personally, I am very much looking forward to it.</p>
<p>You can find full details about the simultaneous pairing update, as well as information on a new mode for games known as Power Saver, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/?sf278016696=1">via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-system-update-will-finally-add-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Obsidian surprised us by announcing a sequel to shrunken-player backyard survival game Grounded earlier this summer. We assumed that Grounded, released in 2022 after two years in early access, had more years of live development ahead of it, which is often the case for multiplayer survival games like it. But that was never apparently the intention for Grounded.</p>
<p>Executive producer Marcus Morgan told me in an interview that Obsidian always intended Grounded to have a beginning, a middle and an end. "When we began Grounded 1, there was always this idea that there would be a close to Grounded 1," he said. "Obviously there's survival games like Ark, which are kind of ever expanding, or Minecraft, which are big platforms that are expanding. But a lot of our touch-points for Grounded 1 came from The Forest or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>. So when we were making Grounded 1, we knew there would be a beginning and a middle and an end to the game, in terms of the story we wanted to tell."</p>
<p>The unexpected success of Grounded shook these plans a little - "it took off way more than we could have ever imagined," he said - but an end to the story did eventually come, at which point the studio knew it wanted to do more but also knew it couldn't realise the ideas within the game's existing framework.</p>

<p>Mainly, Obsidian wanted to implement mounts, or "buggies" as Obsidian is now calling them - insects like ants that you can ride around on. "The reason we didn't actually have [mounts] in Grounded 1 was because the world and the space wasn't designed to actually have mounts," Morgan explained to me. To enable them, then, Obsidian moved the playing space from a confined backyard to a much larger park, while also taking the new-game opportunity to move to Unreal Engine 5 and implement other feature ideas as well.</p>
<p>I'm currently playing Grounded 2 ahead of its 29th July early access release so I'll tell you more about those new ideas and how successful, or not, they are when the embargo lifts on the same day. But to return to my point: that beginning, middle and end structure has remained - it has carried over to Grounded 2. In fact, Obsidian not only knows where it could end but where, excitingly, a third game could follow on from it.</p>
<p>While talking about the original plan for Grounded, Morgan said this: "At first it was like, 'We'll just make Grounded.' There's not the, 'Well maybe we'll have a trilogy.' Like, we hope, but that's not where we started." I pressed him on this mention of a trilogy and he said, "That was just me speaking aspirationally."</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Then he added: "I don't know whether or not it's Grounded 2 or a Grounded trilogy, but I will say we absolutely have ideas and stories and expansions and features that we would want to go for. Whether that continues to expand Grounded 2 or whether that is going to Grounded 3... I want to start with Grounded 2 because that's not even launched yet and I've got to get my mind around that. But we do have more, there's more in our hearts and souls, even beyond where we see Grounded 2 going throughout early access. We do have more that we hope people want to see and play. It's in our hearts."</p>
<p>Another surprising thing about Grounded 2's development is that it's been shared. Grounded 1 was made entirely at Obsidian, but Grounded 2 has been co-developed with Embracer-owned studio Eidos Montreal. Morgan told me Obsidian sought the partnership, being, as it was, rather busy making both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2, which are both 2025 games.</p>
<p>"We knew we wanted to make Grounded 2 and we knew we were going to need help expanding and building on that," he said, "so we actually went out, like, 'Okay, where can we go find co-development help that shares similar sensibilities and has a passion and a love for the game?' There wasn't a lot of pressure or rush for it, we just wanted to find the right partner." And Eidos was apparently it.</p>
<p>There are actually more people working on Grounded 2 at Eidos than at Obsidian, he said, but assured me that "a significant number of people" are working on the game at Obsidian, including the original Grounded team, and that the project was being led from there.</p>

<p>"I know this is gonna sound corny but sincerely it is a cooperative way of developing things," he said. We, as Obsidian, as the creators of the IP, obviously have a very strong point of view about 'what is Grounded' and what fits, what doesn't. There's some weighting on our side in the same way that when we used to make games for other folks, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> or [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> 2], there were the IP holders there.</p>
<p>"But Eidos has been empowered a lot and also just brings a lot to the table with regards to their ownership and filling the game, so I would say it's shared. I don't know if we really think about it as who's officially in charge? Like, if you wanted to put a stamp on it, it's Obsidian, because it's our game. But Eidos is just as much of an owner and just as much of a contributor to it. We are just one team. We might be in two different studios but we're the Grounded team. That's how we do it."</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will launch in early access on 29th July, at which point, I'll be able to share fuller thoughts on the game. Note that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-going-anywhere-if-people-still-want-to-play-it-as-grounded-2-gets-ready-to-launch-obsidian-promises-its-not-the-end-of-the-road-for-the-original-game">Grounded 1 will continue to exist even when this game comes out</a>, by the way - Obsidian is a big believer in game preservation and has no plans to sunset that older game. Content updates will stop, but maintenance will continue.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-could-grow-into-a-trilogy-and-there-are-already-ideas-that-could-fill-a-potential-grounded-3]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The return of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> to iOS in the UK is "uncertain", Epic has claimed, as it's unable to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS this year, "if ever".</p>
<p>That's because the CMA, the UK's competition regulator, has "deprioritised store competition entirely", following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">lengthy legal battle between Epic and Apple</a>.</p>
<p>The CMA has today released two roadmaps for possible measures to improve competition in mobile ecosystems for both Apple and Google. However, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-cma-s-roadmap-doesn-t-open-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-to-competition-in-the-uk">Epic has claimed in a statement</a> the regulator is "choosing not to prioritise opening the mobile ecosystem to alternative app stores this year".</p>

<p>It continued: "This is a missed opportunity to introduce competition into a currently-monopolised market and unlock economic growth and consumer choice. Four years after concluding that the App Store and Google Play Store are parallel monopolies the CMA has done nothing to allow competing stores.</p>
<p>"A free market requires multiple stores competing to offer consumers the best prices and services. If you don't have competing stores, the one store that is a state-sanctioned monopoly will use its control to extract all the value from the market at the expense of all creators who cannot compete, and consumers who can't choose the best deal among competing stores."</p>
<p>In May this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite finally returned to Apple devices in the US and Europe</a> after a five-year legal battle over store competition.</p>
<p>However, following Brexit, the UK has not been included, so the return of Fortnite won't be until at least next year.</p>

<p>"The CMA also made a vague announcement about allowing developers to steer customers to payment service outside of apps, without referencing the kinds of restrictions, obstructions and junk fees that Apple introduced in Europe to make a mockery of the Digital Markets Act," Epic added.</p>
<p>"Unless Apple and Google are completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment, we can expect years of malicious compliance ahead, and no genuine restoration of market competition."</p>
<p>Epic compared this "bleak news from the United Kingdom" to the stronger pro-competition actions of other regions.</p>
<p>"We hope the CMA will use its consultation process to re-examine these weak roadmap decisions and bring the benefits of genuine app store and payments competition to British consumers," it said.</p>
