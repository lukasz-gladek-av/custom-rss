            <p>
Today is clearly the day Atari and Namco have sealed their reunion with pursed lips and probing tongues. Following the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pac-man-dig-dug-and-other-retro-favourites-get-the-interactive-museum-treatment-in-atari-50s-new-namco-dlc">new Namco-themed expansion for the excellent Atari 50 interactive museum thing</a>, the pair (along with third wheel Plaion) have cuddled up to unveil an <em>extremely</em> yellow Pac-Man edition of the Atari 2600+.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ataris-bringing-its-classic-2600-console-back-as-a-100-modern-day-faithful-recreation">original Atari 2600+ launched in 2023</a>, when it was described as a "modern day faithful recreation" of Atari's classic 70s/80s console. As for the new 2600+ Pac-Man Edition - released to celebrate the character's 45th birthday - it's pretty much the same thing, featuring mod cons like HDMI output, USB power, and multiple screen resolutions. However, the Atari 2600's timeless, woody hued design has been abandoned in favour of "signature pac-Man yellow".
</p>
<p>
And you know what? It's pretty tasteful in its own garish way. While the body of the machine is about as (Pac-Man) yellow as yellow can be, the spherical chomper and his old ghost pals make an apparently illuminated appearance on the front panel, while the black of the upper panel is broken up with a matching yellow cartridge slot and knobs.

<p>
"The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition is more than just a console," manufacturer Plaion writes in the machine's announcement, "it's a tribute to the moment home gaming truly began. By reimagining the iconic hardware in Pac-Man's unmistakable style, we're celebrating the legacy of two cultural giants who helped define a generation of play."
</p>
<p>
If that burst of enthusiasm has you sold, you can pre-order the Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition starting 23rd July, and it'll cost you £129.99. For that, you get the machine itself, one CX-40 wireless joystick (also yellow), and a Pac-Man Double Feature cartridge, which includes Pac-Man's home console debut - Pac-man 2600, which released in 1982 - and Pac-Man 7800, a "brand new, arcade-style version of the classic".
</p>
<p>
And if you're after more than one Pac-Man CX40+ wireless joystick, you're in luck; they're also being sold separately for £29.99 each. But don't think you're limited to yellow. Plaion is also releasing Blue (Inky ghost), Red (Blinky ghost), Pink (Pinky ghost) and Orange (Clyde variants), and you can pre-order those from 23rd July too.

            <p>Rematch developer Sloclap admits some of the studio's fans were "disappointed" by the game's reveal, because they were expecting more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>.</p>
<p>Sloclap released its football game Rematch earlier this year, to plenty of praise. However, it wasn't what many expected the studio to come up with following its previous release, the kung-fu roguelike, Sifu.</p>

<p>"Some Sifu fans were disappointed when the game was revealed and we're sorry to say that," Sloclap creative director Pierre Tarno admitted to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/rematch-dev-is-sorry-that-players-wanted-more-sifu-but-for-the-moment-it-was-better-to-let-it-rest/">GamesRadar+</a>, before adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">marketing could have perhaps been a bit better on Rematch's reveal</a>.</p>
<p>"Because the reveal trailer had a cold open, like 'from the team behind Sifu', they were like 'alright, Sifu 2 incoming'," Tarno continued. "I'm sorry about that misunderstanding because I think we should have probably, early on, let the Sifu community know that we were about to announce a title and that it would not be Sifu 2, and they shouldn't be expecting it, just so they didn't have this disappointment."</p>
<p>The developer added Sifu was never intended to become the studio's identity, and it was time for something new. "We did a year and a half of post-launch support for Sifu," he said. "We felt that we'd really provided and kind of given everything we had on Sifu." But, at least for the time being, "it was better to let [Sifu] rest". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifus-last-ever-content-update-is-coming-in-september">Sifu ultimately got its last content update in September</a> 2023.</p>
<p>Continuing, Tarno said some players often expect "studios to be doing the exact same genre over and over again", but that is not the way Sloclap approaches things.</p>
<p>"We have a huge opportunity to pursue the creative projects that we are passionate about, and not many developers have that chance. It's really very rare for developers to be able to do that," Tarno elaborated. "And then I think players and also media realised that although it was not exactly the same, [the games are] both third-person action games. Both grounded, credible, still epic, with bodies and movement, it's physicality."</p>
<p>Tarno said "there is a lineage between the titles", from Sloclap's Absolver to Sifu to Rematch. "Our experience making the two previous games is what allowed us to make this one," the developer closed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">Rematch surpassed 1m sales in its first week on the market</a>, with three million "unique" players also joining the pitch thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom was one of those three million Rematch players, and had rather a good old time with it. "I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it. In fact I love it despite the fact that a large portion of the player base is the absolute worst kind of person: a ball hog."</p>
<p>For more, our Connor recently spoke to Tarno about the introduction of crossplay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-crossplay-top-priority-future-updates">which remains the "top priority" for Rematch and Sloclap</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-developer-sorry-to-disappointed-fans-wanting-more-sifu-but-it-had-given-everything-we-had-already]]></content:encoded>
