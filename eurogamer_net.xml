<p>You can turn your helmet on/off for regular gameplay, and some dialogue plays out without switching to an in-game cutscene. When it does switch to an in-game cutscene, it's helmets off all round.</p>

<p>I spent some of my review time playing via GeForce Now, but wouldn't want to base any firm technical opinions on that (I had no complaints, though!). Digital Foundry has a detailed look at Shadows' PC performance coming.</p>

    <blockquote><cite>themightyant says:</cite> - New Eurogamer feature?

<p>New Eurogamer feature/old Assassin's Creed fan - hello :)</p>
<p>It took me 55 hours to hit the credits, completing the main story, all companion sidequests and the epilogue quests for both Naoe and Yasuke. That's the real meat of it all, though of course completionists have more to do. (Hello again.)</p>
<p>Exploration is a big part of the fun of the game. I found it far more rewarding, not least because Shadows' world is so visually stunning. Anything to do with Naoe/Yasuke's personal stories are great and very worth doing. Companion characters are a mixed bag, and not essential.</p></div>

    <blockquote><cite>StingingVelvet says:</cite> I'm only really interested in stealth. Just how often will I be forced to go all out action with the samurai guy?</blockquote>
<p>As a long-term Assassin's Creed fan, stealth is my go-to as well. As a percentage of the game's full run-time, it's not often Shadows forces you to play as one character over another - and as Yasuke much less than Naoe, who gets the game's lengthy prologue pretty much to herself. </p>

            <p>A year and a bit on from its monumental debut which saw the internet dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' game surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> now has crossplay.</p>
<p>The update went live today across platforms, with developer Pocketpair proclaiming "the wait is over". Crossplay was included in a roadmap laid out by the developer back in January, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">Palworld team outlined its plans for the game's second year</a>. At this time, however, no release date was mentioned.</p>
<p>Other new bells and whistles added with today's update include a new storage system, dedicated servers for those playing on Mac, and a photo mode.</p>

<p>You can check out the full notes for today's Palworld update below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Crossplay! Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</li>
<li>Global Palbox - Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</li>

<li>Cosmetic Armour System! You can now equip armour cosmetically in the Antique Dresser. Change your character’s appearance without affecting armour stats!</li>
<li>Photo Mode - Accessible from the Pal Command Wheel. Hide the UI and move the camera around to take stunning screenshots.</li>

<p>In addition to the above, the Palworld studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-discusses-games-ending-says-its-been-mapped-out-for-quite-some-time">currently building an "ending scenario" for the game</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">an upcoming Terraria crossover</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, earlier this week Pocketpair discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-had-to-scale-back-a-little-bit-and-hire-security-guards-palworld-developer-reveals-nintendo-lawsuit-reaction">moment it discovered Nintendo had launched legal action against its Pokémon-style game</a>, calling it "a very depressing day".</p></div>
