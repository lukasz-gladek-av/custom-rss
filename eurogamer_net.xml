            <p>Last week, EA head Andrew Wilson suggested <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> would have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">performed better for the publisher had it been a live-service game</a> - a remark that raised eyebrows around the industry, and prompted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/id-probably-like-quit-former-dragon-age-leads-react-to-eas-suggestion-the-veilguard-should-have-been-live-service">former Dragon Age creative director Mike Laidlaw to state he would "probably, like, quit that job or something"</a> if a company ever suggested this to him.</p>
<p>And, Laidlaw isn't alone in his condemnation of Wilson's comments. Hazelight founder Josef Fares - who has regularly partnered with EA to get his games published - has also scoffed at the remark, and said the A Way Out and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> maker will "never be a live-service game studio", and live-service will "<em>never</em> be [his] choice."</p>

<p>Speaking with Eurogamer during a preview event for Hazelight's upcoming co-op caper Split Fiction, which EA is once again publishing, Fares stressed his aversion to live service games. "We will not have them, I do not believe in them," he said in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>"I think [live service] is not the right way to go," the studio founder furthered. "I hope more and more [developers] focus on their passion, and what they believe in. At the end of the day, we see clearly - and Hazelight is living proof - that when you trust in your vision and go with it, you can still reach a big audience. That's what I want people to focus on."</p>
<p>Fares continued: "I have an understanding that publishers have a lot of, you know, worries about the 'money issue'. But, I think also you have to understand that we are working with a piece of art here, so you have to respect the creativity as well. They have to meet in the middle. You can't also be too much focused on creativity. You can't just say 'give me $100m, I want to do what I want to do'.</p>
<p>"But, there has to be a balance. It can't just be towards the finance side. So, no, it will not happen with a Hazelight game, ever. I guarantee."</p>

As for It Takes Two, back in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marital-platformer-it-takes-two-sales-pass-20m">Hazelight announced the marital platformer has now sold a rather impressive 20m copies</a> since its release in 2021.</p>

            <p>Peacock has shared its first trailer for the second season of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming second series stars Anthony Mackie, Stephanie Beatriz, Joe Seanoa, Will Arnett and Anthony Carrigan. Today's teaser, which you can check out below, shows Mackie's John Doe and Beatriz's Quiet gearing up to take part in a demolition derby which is being hosted by a "mysterious man" by the name of Calypso (played by Carrigan).</p>
<p>"As they try to survive an onslaught of dangerous new foes and familiar faces alike, including the murderous clown Sweet Tooth, things get complicated for John when he reunites with his long-lost sister, the vigilante Dollface," reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>The second season of Twisted Metal is set to debut this summer on Peacock, although a more concrete release date hasn't been announced as yet.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twisted-metal-tv-adaptation-renewed-for-second-season-on-peacock">series was renewed for a second season in December 2023</a>. "I have to give a Sweet Tooth-sized thank you to our incredible fans - I read every comment and was so blown away by everyone's love, support, and rabid enthusiasm for a paper bag," Twisted Metal showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith said at that time.</p>
<p>"We are beyond thankful we get to continue the story of John Doe, Quiet, and Sweet Tooth as they face off against familiar faces and new grim foes in the long-awaited Twisted Metal tournament. The mixtape is made, and I'm thrilled to get back on the road with our stellar cast and crew."</p>
<p>The first season of Twisted Metal was nominated for Best Adaptation at the 2023 Game Awards, however <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">this accolade ended up going to HBO's The Last of Us TV series</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
