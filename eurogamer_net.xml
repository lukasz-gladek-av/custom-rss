            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> merch is releasing, even though we still don't actually have a date for the game itself.</p>
<p>Konami's upcoming remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">first announced back in May 2023</a>, and will retain the 2004 original's story. This story follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>Around this time last year, it was then suggested by PlayStation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater would release at some point in 2024</a>. However, that obviously did not happen. We are now two weeks into 2025, and a release date still remains unknown. But, what we do have in lieu of a date for the game is a date for… Funko Pops. Yay?</p>

<p>The Funko Pops in question are modelled on the two main characters in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater – Naked Snake and The Boss.</p>
<p>Naked Snake's figurine is wielding his combat knife. "This skilled soldier is sure to prove himself an invaluable asset to your POP! Games lineup," reads the Amazon description.</p>
<p>The Boss, meanwhile, has her signature The Patriot weapon in her hands and will also "prove herself an invaluable asset to your POP! Games lineup."</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D98SHGXZ,B0D98W27ML&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=distrackers-20&amp;linkId=0ba0328aa880433028e4734d8a191b95&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Amazon sale's page</a>, these Funko Pops will be available on 25th March, in America at least (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/DisTrackers/status/1878859570199875716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1878859570199875716%7Ctwgr%5E84317e71e7c588a514aa5a0a9e82664bf76eca54%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fmetal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-funko-pops-before-release-date%2F">DisTrackers</a>). So, could we maybe see a release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater around then? Well, we will let you know as soon as Konami lifts the lid on the game's launch.</p>

<p>Last year, series producer Noriaki Okamura said Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is being remade as Konami believed that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">"younger generation" was now unfamiliar with the series</a>.</p>
<p>Also, did you know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/20-years-later-konami-confirms-fan-suspicions-metal-gear-solid-3s-eva-was-voiced-by-the-little-mermaid">Metal Gear Solid 3's Eva was actually voiced by the same actor who played Ariel in Disney's The Little Mermaid.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo is collaborating with Sea Life UK to tour an interactive, live <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> experience.</p>
<p>The event will allow guests to "discover incredible marine life alongside some of the game's characters" as they explore the 'Sea Life Islands', meet Tom Nook and Isabelle, and collect character stamps.</p>
<p>There will also be a fossil dig to reveal the ancestors of marine life, as well as a search for Gulliver who washed up on the island's beaches.</p>

<p>Animal Cross: New Horizons merchandise will also be sold in aquarium stores.</p>
<p>It begins next month in Sea Life Manchester, before continuing in Sea Life Birmingham, Sea Life Brighton, Sea Life London, and Sea Life Chessington World of Adventures, with the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sea Life Manchester: 8th Feb – 9th March 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Birmingham: 12th April - 5th May 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Brighton: 24th May - 15th June 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life London: 30th June - 27th July 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Chessington World of Adventures: 1st – 31st August 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>Sea Life UK is part of Merlin Entertainments, which also owns theme parks Alton Towers and Thorpe Park.</p>
<p>However, it appears other aquariums in the UK - including Scotland - aren't included.</p>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has of course proven exceptionally popular since its release on Switch in 2020. By 2022 it had become the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-now-the-best-selling-game-ever-in-japan"> best-selling game ever in Japan</a>.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a remaster of 2010's Wii release, which was developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo. However, Retro Studios is not the team behind the upcoming remaster, with porting duties instead being handled by Forever Entertainment.</p>
<p>In the new game's credits, Forever Entertainment is front and centre, however Nintendo has omitted the original development team from the credits. Instead, the credits simply state the HD remaster was "based on the work of the original development staff", as you can see in the images below (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/retro-staff-credits-removed-from-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-forever-entertainment-confirmed-as-devs">Nintendo Life</a>).</p>

<p>This is not the first time an original game's staff have been left out of the credits by Nintendo. The same thing happened in 2023, when former Retro Studios engineer Zoid Kirsch said he was "let down" by the lack of individual credits in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/external-translators-hired-for-nintendo-projects-bemoan-lack-of-credit-in-almost-every-big-title">translators contracted from firms outside of Nintendo voiced their disappointment at not being credited for work on high-profile games</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-rpg">Super Mario RPG</a>.</p>

            <p>Retro immersive-sim Fortune's Run has had its early access development paused due to its sole developer being sentenced to prison.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">update on Steam</a>, developer Dizzie explained why the game's other developer left the project and admitted to being sentenced to three years in prison, meaning development is "imploding".</p>
<p>Dizzie doesn't explain the nature of the crime, though the developer "lived a very different life" prior to working on this project. The post does specify, though, that the crime was not sexual in nature and the other developer was not involved.</p>

<p>"I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years," wrote Dizzie. "It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well. My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this.</p><p>"I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life."</p>
<p>The developer said the game "isn't totally dead" but "it's unclear what will happen".</p>
<p>And without the other developer, development on Fortune's Run will be "completely interrupted" until Dizzie is released. She left the project after recovering from a botched surgery, Dizzie explained. "If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule," said Dizzie.</p>
<p>The post continues: "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p>Due to game sales, Dizzie will be able to afford rent once released, so there's a chance the game could be completed. "I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen," said Dizzie.</p>
<p>The post comes alongside a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320">new major update</a> to Fortune's Run as part of its early access.</p>
<p>The game's description cites the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> as influences.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
