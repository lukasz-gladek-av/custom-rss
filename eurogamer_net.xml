            <p>Here is something I wasn't expecting to say today. The director's cut of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> is available on Xbox Series X/S now.</p>
<p>"It is my pleasure to finally announce that Death Stranding Director's Cut will be delivered to Xbox players," creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> said today. "I would like to thank all the fans who have stayed connected with us as well as everyone in the Xbox community who have been patiently waiting. Kojima Productions (Death Stranding) will continue to connect more and more players around the world, so please stay tuned."</p>
<p>In addition to Xbox, the director's cut version of the game - described as the "definitive vision" of Death Stranding - is also available on PC and PS5. </p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut "challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic 'Death Stranding' event", the official blurb reads. "This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America."</p><p>Those interested can scoop up Death Stranding Director's Cut for just £18 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p?dm_i=74N0,SXRP,1MPOSW,3X2YT,1">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">PC</a>. This deal is only available for a limited time, with the full price being £35. There is also an upgrade option for players who already own Death Stranding on PC. It remains full price on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01968_00-DEATHSTRANDINGEU">PlayStation 5</a>. </p>
<p>Along with today's Xbox news, Kojima Productions also announced it now has full ownership of the Death Stranding IP.</p>

            <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has an upbeat outlook on this year's Borderlands film, and said that the  "disappointing" movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that the Borderlands film did not take off to the degree many had hoped and will not exactly go down in a Hall of Fame alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">HBO's The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">Amazon's Fallout</a>, both of which were praised by fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>Alas, for poor ol' Borderlands, this year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was instead branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. Eesh. The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>

<p>Zelnick commented on the film's performance last night during an earnings call for Take-Two. When an investor asked about the project and how it contributed to the company, Zelnick stated Take Two didn't "really need to break out the contribution from the film because while it was economically positive, it wasn't material" to the company's results.</p><p>"Even though the film was disappointing, it actually benefited our catalogue sales," he continued. "So that is a sign that making a movie or a television show based on our very high-quality IP can drive catalogue sales and that can be a good thing."</p>
<p>That's not to say Take-Two is now going to go all in on film and television adaptations for its various IPs.</p>
<p>"All that said, we're really selective. And one of the reasons we have been so selective about licensing is we would really prefer that everything that comes out with our brands in it is really, really successful," Zelnick stated. "And we can't guarantee that, especially when it's out of our hands. So we have licensed other titles, we'll continue selectively… emphasis on the word selectively."</p>
<p>I now wonder what could be next...?</p>

<p>Earlier this year, founder of Borderlands developer Gearbox Randy Pitchford defended the studio's recent flops such as the film by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-randy-pitchford-defends-recent-flops-by-comparing-gearbox-to-the-beatles">comparing the company to The Beatles</a>. Writing on social media, Pitchford stated he was "going to keep making stuff" and subsequently brought the English rock band into the conversation.</p><p>As for what is next from the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">Borderlands 4 was announced back in August</a>. While the team at Gearbox has not announced a release date yet, it has said the game will be coming in 2025. It will be available across PS5, PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> publisher Take-Two has doubled down on the game's expected late 2025 launch window, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">following earlier rumours that Rockstar could still delay</a> the game's arrival.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's latest financial briefing last night pinned GTA6 to "fall of calendar [year] 2025", as previously expected. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming launches from the publisher include Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country - both of which simply have "fiscal 2026" launch dates. That means they'll arrive between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026.

<p>
Judas, the long-in-development next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine, is listed with no firm launch window at all, meanwhile - it's simply down as "TBA". 
</p>
<p>
Back in February 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">Take-Two had the game listed as launching by the end of March 2025</a> - something the publisher is no longer stating. We got a quick look at the game in December 2022 at The Game Awards (it looked a lot like BioShock!) and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">saw a bit more in January of this year</a>, but have heard nothing more since.
</p>
<p>
Levine's last game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, launched in 2013 - over a decade ago.

<p>For now, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - also released a decade ago - continues to "outperform" sales expectations, specifically through "sustained engagement" (and spending) in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Sales of Grand Theft Auto V outperformed our expectations and to date, the title has sold more than 205m units worldwide," Zelnick said. "Grand Theft Auto Online also exceeded our plans, driven by sustained engagement with the summer content pack Bottom Dollar Bounties and an array of updates, including the new multistage Assault on ATT-16 [ph] mode and experience improvements such as a new anti-cheat system for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto Online."</p><p>Membership of the GTA+ subscription grew by 35 percent this year, Zelnick continued, as it added Rockstar classics such as Bully. Red Dead Redemption 2 has also continued to sell, and is now up to 67m sold since launch six years ago.</p>
<p>Zelnick previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-wont-be-on-a-subscription-service-on-day-one-because-take-twos-decisions-are-rational-says-ceo">not to expect GTA 6 to launch via any kind of subscription service</a>, such as Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, because Take-Two's "decisions are rational".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> has announced the sale of its indie-focused publishing label Private Division. Additionally, the company has finally confirmed the closure of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/roll7">Roll7</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a>'s Intercept Games, six months after CEO Strauss Zelnick insisted, "We didn't shutter those studios."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/obsidians-new-rpg-is-being-published-by-take-twos-new-label-private-division">announced the formation of Private Division</a> back in 2017, specifically to publish games from smaller independent teams. Since then, it's released the likes of Obsidian Entertainment's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> and Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked, set up a new development team - Intercept Games - to create a sequel to Kerbal Space Program 2, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-division-buys-olliolli-developer-roll7">acquired Roll7</a>, which later released OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome.
</p>
<p>
However, 2023 brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-confirms-layoffs-reported-to-affect-private-division-and-more">word of layoffs at Private Division</a>, and a flurry of reports this May suggested a major shift in strategy for the label. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-is-working-with-take-two-to-develop-a-brand-game-based-on-a-new-ip">previously announced publishing agreement with Silent Hill 2 Remake developer Bloober Team</a> was cancelled, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kerbal-space-program-2-studio-reportedly-shut-down-by-take-two">mass layoffs were reported at Roll7 and Intercept Games</a>, as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-laying-off-550-people-weeks-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-to-do-so">five percent reduction in staff</a> company wide, effectively bringing an end to the studios. That's despite CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-claims-publisher-hasnt-shut-down-olliolli-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">later insisting</a>, "We didn't shutter [them]". Shortly after, it was reported Take-Two was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-is-reportedly-set-to-close-roll7-and-intercept-and-sell-off-private-division">looking to sell Private Division</a> amid word only a skeleton crew was left at the label to work on No Rest for the Wicked.

<p>
And now, as part of its Q2 2025 earnings report, Take-Two has confirmed the sale of Private Division. "We recently made the strategic decision to sell [the] label to focus our resources on growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term," Zelnick said in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">prepared remarks</a>. "As part of this transaction, the buyer purchased our rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles." However, Take-Two - which hasn't revealed Private Division's buyer - will continue to support No Rest for the Wicked despite the sale.
</p><p>
"The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Zelnick said in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits">separate comments made to GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits." Additionally, a Take-Two spokesperson confirmed that Roll7 and Intercept Games were closed prior to the sale of Private Division.
