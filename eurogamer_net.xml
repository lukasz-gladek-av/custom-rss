            <p>
The physical release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> will be on a game key card and will take up around a third of the console's storage capacity.
</p>
<p>
Some Switch 2 physical games are sold as game key cards, which use the card solely as a key to download the full game. Many third-party publishers are opting for this method of release on Nintendo's new console.
</p>
<p>
Images of the game box on <a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade---switch-2">Square Enix's store</a> prove Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be another game key card release, while its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/limited-early-purchase-editionfinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOooMV8kwa75CskPgxZMlJ4rAwW63sBdWbil-myyKr466ROJJPwwY">eShop listing</a> states it requires a download of up to 90GB. As the Switch 2's storage capacity is 256GB, that means the game will take up approximately 34 percent (though of course you'll need to account for console system files).

<p>
The reported maximum size for a proper game card is 64GB, which is the card size CD Projekt Red opted for with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> release on Switch 2. But at 90GB, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s game wouldn't fit.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the huge size of games is exactly the reason Nintendo offers game key cards as an option, but this has been heavily criticised by game preservationists. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-dont-like-nintendos-controversial-game-key-cards-you-can-now-let-the-company-know-directly">Nintendo even released a survey</a> to gather reactions.
</p>
<p>
So what's the alternative solution here? Should Square Enix be to blame for its decision and/or inability to reduce the game size? Or is Nintendo to blame for not offering larger game cards?
</p>
<p>
Larger game cards would be more expensive for publishers, while a higher console capacity would be more expensive for Nintendo who seems more than happy to let consumers choose to expand storage space through expensive MicroSD Express cards - this now looking pretty essential if you plan on playing triple-A third-party games on the Switch 2.
</p><p>
One developer at Ubisoft did explain why it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-dev-comes-out-with-first-actually-good-reason-for-using-switch-2s-controversial-game-key-cards">opted for a game key card with Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2</a>, stating traditional cards "simply didn't give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for". The game was built around the SSDs of release platforms and as such it "relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments".
</p>
<p>Perhaps Square Enix has a similar reason.</p>
<p>
Still, Square Enix has confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">entire Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy is headed to Switch 2</a>. And considering second game Rebirth is 145GB on PS5, there's no way you'll be able to play all three games on your Switch 2 in future without opting to expand the memory.

            <p>
Balatro was set to receive a 1.1 update this year, but its solo developer LocalThunk has pushed it back in order to preserve his "hobbyist" approach to game development.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">statement titled "I'm slow"</a>, the developer apologised for the delay, adding he "probably shouldn't have announced any date". "I feel bad for not keeping that promise, and I am sorry," he said.
</p>
<p>
Since release, LocalThunk has been crunching alone on a balance patch and a mobile port, before taking some time out and then beginning 1.1 work slowly this year. "However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist," he said, "and it turns out that it's a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch."

<p>
LocalThunk said the prospect of rushing the work "felt terrible". "I am working slowly, but I like it that way," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I have never, before Balatro, set a deadline for any of my creative projects and I now realise how important that is for my process," he continued. "I am in a very lucky position in that I can choose to work this job however I wish, and I think the best version of 'work' for me is the version that makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development 5 years from now as I am today. I don't want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets."
</p>
<p>
As such, the 1.1 update will be "done when it's done", and will be available for free across all platforms. It just won't be this year.
</p>
<p>
He concluded: "The Balatro player in me will absolutely not allow me walk away from developing this game...Rest assured, it will happen."
</p>
<p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">shaky start with ratings boards</a>, Balatro has gone on to find phenomenal success. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-completing-balatro-has-developer-better-equipped-to-design-the-next-big-update">LocalThunk has 100 percent completed his own game</a>, which has "equipped" him to better design the next update.
