            <p>Introducing mod support for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has proved so successful, developer Larian Studios is restricting the number of mods console players can run at any one time.</p>
<p>Given high mod usage is resulting in "slow loading times and game crashes" for some players, the studio is introducing a 100-mod limit for console players.</p>

<p>"Now that there are more than 100 mods available to download on console, we need to have a serious chat. Who plays with more than 100 mods in a single save you might ask? Well, as it turns out, there's a handful of you," Larian confirmed in a <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/hotfix-29-now-live-console-only_127">post</a> on the official website.</p><p>"Unlike PC, consoles can only juggle so many files at once. The more mods you have installed, the quicker this file limit is reached. Now that some of you have been trying to play with more than 100 mods, you've been letting us know that you're experiencing slow loading times or even game crashes.</p>
<p>"While we recommend only installing the mods you know you'll definitely continue playing with, to maximise stability, we're introducing a 100-mod limit for console platforms," the post concluded.</p>
<p>This means that from here on in, if you're on console and running more than 100 mods, you'll get a message telling you that you won't be able to load your save "for the time being".</p>
<p>If you move between PC and console via cross-save and have more than 100 mods, you'll need to disable the number of active mods from PC to load in and keeping playing on console.</p>
<p>There's currently no workaround for games that already have more than 100 mods, but a "follow-up fix is planned to give you the means to restore these saves".</p>
<p>For more, a very familiar voice is here to breakdown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHlbagHZR2U">how Baldur's Gate 3 mods are curated for consoles</a>.</p>
<p>Back in October, Larian celebrated 50m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). At this same time, the developer said 10k of those mod downloads were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-modders-really-want-to-change-withers-name-to-bone-daddy">players changing Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity Withers' name to Bone Daddy</a>.</p><p>As for what's next? Larian previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before the studio decided to try something new instead. The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Developer GSC Game World said Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's first patch will respond directly to feedback from players.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415">update</a> posted to Steam over the weekend, the studio said it has identified a number of issues, and listed its priorities.</p>

<p>Memory allocation failures - "which previously caused the game to exit unexpectedly, particularly around rendering, skeletal meshes, and quest-related cutscenes" - are first on the list, followed by main quest progression issues, including NPCs getting stuck in objects, incorrect quest markers, and issues with quest cutscenes. Main quests like Visions of Truth or A Minor Incident will be revised "to ensure smooth transitions, avoiding rare cases of players not being able to proceed further".</p>
<p>Here's everything else scheduled for a fix in the first upcoming patch:</p>
<p>Gameplay and balance adjustments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixing the price of the weapons with upgrades installed compared to their value without attachments.</li>
<li>NPCs behavior, including the way they act when lacking a shelter during the Emissions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cutscenes and visual fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rarely missing facial animations, misplaced NPCs, and visual inconsistencies like detached heads and clothes clipping.</li>
<li>Quality and stability improvements of the visual effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Softlock fixes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue where players were unable to close the trade screen after putting ammo in a wrong slot while playing on a gamepad.</li>
</ul>
<p>User interface improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quest notifications now showed correctly during dialogues.</li>
<li>Corrected texts and missing interaction prompts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Noted to be addressed in future updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analogue sticks dead zones bugfixes.</li>
<li>A-Life system bugfixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now there's no word on when the patch will go live, but GSC Game World hinted it's coming "during the week to come" to both PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"The game has been out for several days now (it’s still surreal to say that), and we've been following your feedback in all possible forms carefully," the team said. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">To the more than one million stalkers in the Zone</a>, thanks for playing - that means the world to us."</p>
<p>"Full of anomalies in more ways than one, Stalker 2 is a mess of bugs and jank that nonetheless stays faithful to the open world survival shooter of yesteryear," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Eurogamer's Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft reckons 40 percent of PC players look up tips and guides whilst playing, and 88 percent use a browser whilst gaming to get help, which means we're forever interrupting our sessions by switching windows or monitors or grabbing our phones.</p><p>"Game Assist is a special version of Microsoft Edge that’s optimised for PC gaming and can appear on top of your game in Game Bar," Microsoft explained. "It's game-aware and will suggest tips and guides for what you're playing. It also shares the same browser data with Edge on your PC so the information you care about is always accessible while you play - including your favorites, history, cookies, form fills, and more.</p>
<p>"This means you don't need to log into sites again, and it's easy to get to what you care about. You can even quickly access your favorite services like Discord, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, Spotify, or any other page or site in the sidebar. And, like other Game Bar widgets, you can pin Game Assist above your game so you can reference a guide or watch a video while you play."</p>
<p>You can access Game Assist (Preview) via a Game Bar that overlays your game if you have Microsoft Edge Beta 132 and Windows 11. If you're interested, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/edge/download/insider?form=MA13FJ">opt-in to the public preview</a> and then hit Win+G from within your Game Bar to access it.</p>
<p>Right now it only support English, though, and supports just a "selection of popular PC games": <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Hellblade 2</a>: Senua's Saga, League of Legends, Minecraft, Overwatch 2, Roblox, and Valorant.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies">hundreds of staff at Bethesda parent company ZeniMax went on strike</a> in protest at parent company Microsoft outsourcing work without bargaining with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union.</p>
<p>The one-day walkout by staff who work on Fallout, Starfield and Doom came after concerns over the "unilateral decision" to outsource quality assurance (QA) work to external teams at a time of uncertainty and layoffs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Developer Asobo has advised <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> players to "move your community packages" if they experience persistent stability issues or long loading times.</p>
<p>In a notice appended to the 1.1.9.0 Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now">release notes</a>, Asobo noted that outdated packages in the Community Folder could adversely impact performance, adding that relocating the packages to another folder and relaunching the game should help.</p>

<p>"If you are playing on PC, outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behaviour," the statement said. "If you suffer from stability issues or long loading times, move your Community package(s) to another folder before relaunching the title."</p><p>The patch itself also addresses a crash when you select "As Arrival" in the EFB, a crash that could occur when "closing and invoking the Camera menu after changing the Drone focus mode option to a value other than undefined", as well as "various" other crashes across the title".</p> <div>

<p>A few other "general" bug fixes have also been resolved, including the missing cursor on Xbox Live sign-in popup, a problem where you could lose focus when creating a new input profile, and a bug wherein the aircraft selection is accessible via the control menu, but can only be changed from the home page.</p>
<p>It also fixes an issue where you could get stuck when accessing the menu bar from any help page.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-studio-apologises-for-issues-as-it-increases-server-capacity">the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 team apologised to its community</a> for the game's less than perfect debut, admitting, "this is not the launch experience we want for our players", admitting it vastly underestimated how many of us would be looking to take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 at launch.</p>
<p>In related news, we recently learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-borrowed-all-its-animals-from-planet-zoo">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 borrowed all its animals from Planet Zoo</a>.</p>
<p>"I called my friend, the CEO. His name is Jonny [Watts], and I said, 'Hey, Jonny, I'm working on Flight Sim, can I have your animals from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a>?' And he's like, 'Yeah, why not?'," said Flight Simulator boss Jorg Neumann. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> fan believes they've discovered a hidden message that adds further credence to a long-held fan theory about the seminal horror game.</p>
<p>The player believes that on two television sets found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> – the TV in the hospital cafeteria, and another in the nurses' lounge – a secret message is being played via Morse code.</p>

</div><figcaption>Here's Eurogamer's review for Silent Hill 2 remake in video form.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOv1JTfPnuQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"A message is playing on the TV in Brookhaven Hospital, transmitted in morse code," YouTuber Shiba explained.</p>
<p>"The sound is mostly drowned out by the static from the TV, making it difficult to hear clearly. However, the Morse code is distinct, with a clicking sound that resembles a telegraph. The loud clicks mark the beginning of a signal, while the softer click signal its end. If we listen closely, we can decipher the following message."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another fun Silent Hill 2 Remake discovery, a TV in Brookhaven Hospital in morse code repeatedly says, "Again and Again and Again and Again" endlessly: <a href="https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb">https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1859864583252607265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>The message itself is pretty short, consisting of just two words and played on a loop: "Again and."</p>
<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team">hidden message discovered hiding behind the mysterious photos found in Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, the morse code message adds further validity to the popular fan theory that James Sunderland is trapped in the town of Silent Hill, reliving his search of Mary on a loop "again and again and again and".</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remakes-graphical-glitches-on-ps5-pro-have-finally-been-patched">Konami deployed a new Silent Hill 2 Remake update to address graphical glitches</a> affecting the horror game on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>The patch comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-fans-want-to-know-when-the-game-will-run-properly-on-ps5-pro">Silent Hill 2 Remake players called on Konami to address the technical issues still plaguing the game on PS5 Pro</a> almost two weeks on from the Pro's release. However, some players report all the patch has done is remove PSSR and fails to address any of the underlying issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
