            <p>Cloud Imperium Games has responded to players unhappy about the recent introduction of "<a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7956894">pay to win</a>" flight blades in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a>, admitting it "missed a step".</p>
<p>While Star Citizen's community doesn't typically shy away from financially supporting the game's 12-year-old early access period, on this occasion, players took umbrage that even though the blades give an undeniable in-game advantage, they had been introduced as a premium item that could not be earned organically through gameplay.</p>
<p>The fallout has been so intense, CIG has now posted a statement, stressing to players that they will be able to obtain flight blades through the in-game currency aUEC "in our next patch this June" and said that "for future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one".</p>

<p>"We're pushing 11 patches this year instead of 4. We're crushing more bugs than ever, building more exciting content, moving faster than ever to make the Persistent Universe a better experience for everyone, and in moving that fast, we missed a step," stressed Tyler "Zyloh-CIG" Witkin (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/after-raising-over-usd800-million-from-its-community-star-citizens-developer-delays-the-release-of-a-new-ship-upgrade-as-players-baulk-at-having-to-pay-for-it/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"To be clear, the new Flight Blades will be obtainable for aUEC in our next patch this June. We followed our usual approach by offering early access on the pledge store to help support development. But after some reflection, we've decided that for smaller components like Flight Blades or bomb racks, they should be available in-game at the same time they appear on the store.</p>
<p>"The choice has and should always be yours," the statement continued. "If you want to support the project early, you can, but it's not required.</p>
<p>"Thanks to everyone who's weighed in, especially those who brought the heat constructively. This game has always been shaped by the community," Witkin concluded." Star Citizen wouldn't exist without your passion and support, or your scrutiny and feedback. We hear you, and we take it all to heart."</p>
<p>Not all players were mollified, however.</p>
<p>"This is meant to be constructive, but you cannot keep the status quo and move up the in game part a little faster and act like you have solved the root of the problem," <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7954429">responded</a> one. "This is a bandaid to calm people down, but the root issue here is that you continue to sell more and more items in the game that have a wider impact on what a player would do day to day.</p>
<p>"Everyone knows the convienence of the pledgestore would outweigh any gameplay in an MMO that is meant to be played and slowly gained progress over years…"</p>
<p>"Flight blades were kept from players in PTU with complete radio silence from CIG only for them to pop up in the store once the patch hit LIVE," <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7955870">added</a> another. "They wanted to cash in on the FOMO during Invictus, and have not changed course. This isn't an act of goodwill, this is a non-apology and business-as-usual for CIG."</p>
<p>Another said players "deserve what we tolerate", <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update/7959094">stating</a>: "These flight blades feel so gimicky, and having them locked to a single type of ship is just greedy design.</p>
<p>"If we accept this and CIG makes money off these blades, then we deserve more pay-to-win features. "Vote with your wallet, citizens! I've been following the project since 2.6 and I was happy with the development till they changed the ship prices to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> online prices (and economy). That was a hard pill to swallow, but seeing these flight blades come out in this manner, it just paints a clear picture of things to come."</p>

            <p>Semiwork has outlined the next batch of changes coming to its fan-favourite co-op horror game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/repo">REPO</a>.</p>
<p>In a new, and brilliant, video, designer Pontus discussed a revamp of the game's health and re-gen systems, as well as give us a sneaky peek at a devastating new weapon that's slated to arrive, too.</p>

<p>After a cheeky nod to the not-remotely-secret spam-E-as-the-level-loads health glitch - which, sadly, will not be making a return any time soon - Semiwork said it was "listening to feedback", including taking "another look at health balancing in general, as well as crystal balance".</p>
<p>"We are tweaking the health system so that it will be easier to heal your entire team," designer Pontus explained. "We'll be adding a team discount for the health kits, so the more players you are, the cheaper the health kits will get. Also, the truck will be more generous with its health recovery when Semibots return to the truck."</p>
<p>This means that below Level 5, players will get 50 HP when successfully making it back to the truck, and after level 5, you'll regain 35 HP. From Level 10+, it'll be 25 HP.</p>
<p>"We want the health kits and the crystals to be more attractive to buy, so they will have a similar cap on the pricing," Semiwork added.</p>
<p>That's not all. There is also enemy re-balancing on the way, especially as some enemies, like Robe, can't be stunned by lighter items. The fix for this, Semiwork said, is to make enemies more "unsteady" below Level 5 so they'll be easier to stun and push over.</p>
<p>"We always take a look at glitches that become popular, or even mods," he added. "And we take that as a sign that we need to tweak or change the gameplay design, or add to it."</p>
<p>We're also getting something called the Cart Cannon and the Cart Laser, which are exactly what they say on the tin.</p>
<p>"We hope that this weapon, together with the other things, will be at great disposal for your Semibot team."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new report alleges that Marathon developer Bungie is in "chaos" after the studio was forced to admit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">an external artist's work has been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/17/new-marathon-info-bungie-morale-launch-worries-and-changing-plans/">Forbes</a> claims morale at the studio is in "free fall" right across the organisation, with one source telling the outlet "the vibes have never been worse".</p>
<p>The issue came to light earlier this week following recent playable alpha tests of Marathon, from which <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605">artist Fern Hook recognised their designs</a> had been used. Responding via its less-visible <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262">Marathon Dev Team social media account</a>, Bungie wrote that it had "immediately investigated" Hook's claim and found that, yes, a former artist at the company had swiped the designs.</p>

<p>Then, in an ill-timed and palpably awkward livestream last night, the developer revealed it would not be sharing any Marathon gameplay due to the ongoing investigation.</p>
<p>"Our show is a little bit different today," explained game director, Joe Ziegler, at the beginning of the stream. "We had planned to show a lot more stuff, but for a lot of reasons we're about to get into, we decided not to show a bunch of this stuff. But we are going to be discussing a lot about what we learned through Alpha, some of the plans that we're going forward with."</p>
<p>Ziegler later said part of the reason Bungie wasn't showing any gameplay was because the team was "still scrubbing all of our assets to make sure that we are being respectful of the situation".</p>
<p>"It came to our attention that an artist who worked on Marathon in the early stages of pre-production took a number of graphic elements from a graphic designer, without permission or acknowledgement, and placed them on a decal sheet that was then checked in, in 2020," added art director Joe Cross, reading from a statement.</p>
<p>"The decal sheet included icons and text elements. These elements ended up in our alpha build and there is absolutely no excuse for this oversight, and we are working on, and 100% committed to, our review process to ensure instances like this don't happen again on Marathon or at Bungie."</p>
<p>Forbes now reports sources at Bungie say the explanation given publicly about the incident - which is that a former employee is responsible - is the same reason given internally, but "morale was in free fall" as the team scrambled to recover from the latest in a line of plagiarism accusations. With changes to its marketing plan - which pre-dates this week's incident - and possible amendments to its playtesting plans, as well as now an audit into what should be every single graphic element used on Marathon, some fear the shooter will struggle to hit its 23rd September release date.</p>
<p>Forbes also intimates staff have been uneasy with the direction of development, saying, "as far back as five years ago, devs were telling [management] what would and wouldn't work and were often ignored. Many have said previously that it needed to have some sort of PvE component".</p>
<p>"Sony and Bungie legal" are reportedly looking into what happened with the stolen assets, but Bungie's decision not to share <em>any</em> footage in yesterday's livestream is perhaps telling enough.</p>
<p>Marathon is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 23rd September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But company is confident player account information remains secure.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works has suffered a "data leakage due to unauthorised access".</p>
<p>In a brief <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.com/notice-regarding-data-leakage-due-to-unauthorized-access/">statement</a>, the company said that while its systems had been illegally accessed by a third-party and data was leaked, it didn't believe the leak included any "personal information or player account information".</p>

<p>"We regret to announce that we have discovered that our systems were illegally accessed by a third party and that data held by us was leaked to outside parties," the statement read.</p>
<p>"As of May 12, we have not confirmed the leak of any user personal information or player account information due to the unauthorised access. We are working diligently to determine the cause of the unauthorised access and the extent of the impact with the help of outside experts, and we will inform you if any new facts are discovered as a result of the investigation.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologise to all for any inconvenience and concern this may cause. We are truly sorry."</p>
<p>The statement closed on imploring people not to try and access the data that was allegedly leaked, "as there is a possibility that it may cause malware infection".</p>
<p>What information, exactly, the leakers <em>did</em> manage to access remains to be seen. Arc System Works hasn't said if it was employee data or information pertaining to unreleased or unannounced game projects, but <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/guilty-gear-strive-source-code-leak-explained-season-5-characters-discovered-3193826/">Dexerto</a> reported earlier this month, before Arc's statement, that Guilty Gear Strive's source code was leaked, including "new data" about the game's story and characters.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't the first time a studio's plans been hacked and prematurely leaked. In December 2023, PlayStation-owned Spider-Man developer Insomniac had detailed plans of future projects published online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-investigating-insomniac-hack-which-reportedly-leaked-wolverine-files-and-employees-personal-data">stolen from the company by hackers</a>, and then ransomed for $2m. The files include a project roadmap for the next decade and beyond including an array of unannounced projects, plus production details, art assets, and personal information on Insomniac employees.</p>
<p>Perhaps more famously still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90-gta-6-videos-and-screenshots-have-allegedly-leaked-online">90+ videos and screenshots from Rockstar's then-unannounced GTA 6 also leaked online early in September 2022</a> after a hacker managed to access its internal systems.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
