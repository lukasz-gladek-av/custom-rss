            <p>While Neil Druckmann has previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog won't be known as The Last of Us studio forever</a>, the team sure does seem to be making the most of the franchise by churning out different editions of both Part 1 and Part 2.</p>
<p>Now, just days before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastereds-pc-specs-and-features-detailed-as-sony-reiterates-no-psn-account-required">The Last of Us Part 2 makes its PC debut</a>, it's been reported another "PS5 special edition" for the series is on the way.</p>

<p>This comes from the ever-reliable Billbil-kun, although they admit they aren't sure which game in the series it could be. "Could it be for Part 1, Part 2, or something entirely new?" they <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1906684709146366140">mused</a>.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-mysterieuse-edition-physique-dun-jeu-de-naughty-dog-est-en-cours-de-preparation-60078">Dealabs' report</a>, this mysterious special edition is set for a physical release on PlayStation 5. As for pricing, Billbil-kun stated it will retail for â‚¬119.99 EUR or $109.99.</p>
<p>"Everything seems to indicate that the officialisation of this edition, as well as the opening of pre-orders, would take place very soon, in a time window that we estimate within two months," Billbil-kun wrote (via Google Translate).</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to PlayStation for further comment.</p>
