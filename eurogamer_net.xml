Beloved 8-bit isometric puzzle-platformer Head Over Heels is back and (not for the first time) getting the remake treatment, bringing "colourful modern visuals" and "refined gameplay" when it comes to PC and Switch later this year.
</p>
<p>
The original Head Over Heels was developed by Ocean Software and released for various platforms, including the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64, in 1987. It cast players as Head and Heels, two interstellar spies on a mission to liberate planets from an evil Emperor.
</p>
<p>
All this unfolded across 300 isometric rooms, with players needing to utilise Head and Heels' slightly different abilities in order to overcome obstacles - including, famously, a dalek with the head of (then) Prince Charles - and mount their escape from Castle Blacktooth.

<p>
Head Over Heels is beloved enough that it's already had one remake; this initial 2003 update brought substantially overhauled visuals in a version that would later come to PC and Switch. Now though, it's set to get a more faithful remake in the form of Head Over Heels: Deluxe.
</p>
<p>
Head Over Heels: Deluxe's most obvious difference is its art style, which adheres far more closely to the pixel art visuals of the 1987 original. It also features a brand-new soundtrack composed by Space Fractal, "re-engineered controls that feel snappy and precise", multiple save points, three difficulty levels, hints, and selectable play speeds.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, there's a new world to explore - complete with new enemies and objects (including chickens!) - bringing the total number of "majestic" locations up to 500. And for those hoping for something a bit more traditional, it's possible to switch to "classic mode" graphics and sounds closer to the 8-bit original.
</p>
<p>
Head Over Heels: Deluxe is developed by Rusty Pixels and Ogre Games Ltd and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3153640/Head_Over_Heels_Deluxe/">releases on Steam</a> this Thursday, 6th March. A Switch version is due to arrive later this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-lovecraft-inspired-the-sinking-city-2-starts-crowdfunding-this-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Frogwares, the Ukranian studio best known for its long-running series of Sherlock Holmes deduction adventures, is launching a Kickstarter campaign this Thursday, 6th March, to crowdfund development of its Lovecraft-inspired survival horror sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">announced last year</a>, teasing a "horror-first" evolution of the open-world formula established in the 2019 original. It features a standalone story, albeit one still set in 1920s United States, and its big change is that deduction (previously core to the experience) is now entirely optional - a way to uncover more of the story but never required to progress.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">Kickstarter page</a> is a little light on detail ahead of Thursday's campaign launch - although it does confirm a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC release - but the studio previously explained it would be seeking crowdfunding as a "safety net" during development.

<p>
Frogwares successfully <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">took a similar crowdfunding approach for 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened</a>, as it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sherlock-holmes-developer-frogwares-shares-update-on-life-in-ukraine-amid-ongoing-war-with-russia">shared some harrowing updates</a> during that game's creation.
</p>
<p>
The Sinking City 2's imminent Kickstarter campaign comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-now-sole-publisher-of-the-sinking-city-following-dispute-with-nacon">resolution of Frogwares' lengthy dispute with publisher Nacon</a> over the rights to the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> - a dispute that at one point saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-dev-tells-people-not-to-buy-its-own-game-from-steam">Frogwares urging people not to buy the game</a> after Nacon published an out of date version missing features on Steam. Since last year's resolution, Frogwares has taken over as The Sinking City's publisher, updated the Steam build, and released new DLC.
