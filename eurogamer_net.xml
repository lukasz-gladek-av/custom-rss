            <p>Microsoft has sided with Epic in its feud against Apple, claiming the iPhone maker has "stymied" the company's efforts to launch its Xbox mobile game store.</p>
<p>Back in May last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-open-web-based-mobile-game-store-this-summer">Microsoft announced plans to release a new Xbox mobile game store</a>. At this time, the company envisioned it to be ready for release by that summer. However, this did not happen.</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft has filed a legal brief in support of Epic Games as part of Apple's appeal against a recent ruling, which follows a five-year legal battle between Epic and Apple, and has now resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-finally-back-on-apple-devices-in-us-and-europe">Fortnite making its return to the App Store in the US</a>. Here, Microsoft shed more light on the delay to its own mobile store.</p>

<p>Microsoft stated it wishes to "offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store", but efforts have been "stymied" by Apple and its strict App Store rules.</p>
<p>As shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/671409/microsoft-xbox-mobile-store-delay-apple-epic-court-case">The Verge</a>, this is how Microsoft explains its current situation:</p>
<p>"The district court's injunction allows Apple to maintain its in-app exclusivity but at least should have enabled Microsoft to offer consumers a workable solution by launching its own online store - accessible via link-out - for in-app items to be purchased off-app and used in games or other apps. And that is what Microsoft wants to do. But even this solution has been stymied by Apple.</p>
<p>"Prior to the district court's most recent order, Microsoft had been unable to implement linked-out payments (or even inform customers that alternative purchase methods exist) because of Apple's new anti-steering policies that restrict Microsoft's communication to users and impose an even higher economic cost to Microsoft than before the injunction."</p>
<p>As noted by the publication, the recent court ruling does make it possible for Microsoft to launch its mobile store, but the company still wants to ensure Apple's appeal against the ruling is unsuccessful, in order to avoid having to potentially remove its own store further down the line.</p>
<p>Microsoft notes in its filing that Apple "makes no argument that the technical or policy changes cannot be undone", and that the company's own "experience managing app stores confirms that Apple's policies could be restored if Apple ultimately prevails on appeal".</p>
<p>We will keep you abreast of any further developments regarding both Epic vs Apple, and Xbox's mobile store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-frightfully-british-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-and-sequel-plans-are-already-in-discussion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Atomfall - the seudo-apocalyptic survival game set in 1950s rural England - was "immediately profitable" for developer Rebellion, and now talks of a sequel are already afoot.</p>
<p>Atomfall released back in March across PC, PlayStation and Xbox. It was also available on both Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, likely bolstering its popularity. Speaking to Eurogamer's sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass">GamesIndustry.biz</a> last month, Rebellion head Jason Kingsley noted that much of Atomfall's success could be attributed to its release on Game Pass, stating it "does mitigate risk" and guarantees "a certain level of income" for a studio.</p>
<p>But, even though it was indeed available to play via Xbox's subscription service, of course meaning players did not have to buy the game outright if they already had Game Pass, Atomfall still made back its development costs more or less straight off the (cricket) bat.</p>

<p>This nugget comes from Rebellion head Jason Kingsley, who sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59eD2qMEcR8">The Game Business</a> to reflect on the launch of Atomfall and the industry in general.</p>
<p>During this chat, the studio affirmed the studio has DLC for Atomfall planned, but also that the idea of a sequel or a spin-off has already been floated, saying Rebellion of course wants to "keep on making games" in the future.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Rebellion wants to "continue to make more good games," Kingsley said. "We've now got the challenge of a massive new success in Atomfall. What do we do in the future with Atomfall? Well… we've got DLC coming up," he continued before adding: "We're talking about what do we do about sequels? Do we do spin-offs?"</p>
<p>So, is a sequel something you would like to see for Atomfall?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-release-breaks-records-for-sniper-elite-studio-though-i-thought-wed-have-drunk-more-tea">Atomfall was Rebellion's "most successful launch" ever</a>, and soon after it was released the studio celebrated 1.5 million players joining in the oh so rather British fun. At this time, the studio revealed we had managed to devour 4m pasties, and savour 300,000 cups of tea in the game, though those numbers are likely even higher now.</p>
<p>If you haven't played Atomfall for yourself yet, but are curious about it all, you can check out our review. "If you can get over a difficult start and fancy a lean take on the survival genre, Atomfall delivers an intriguing tale worth discovering," our Tom wrote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atomfall-review">awarding the game three Eurogamer stars</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Doug Cockle, the voice of Geralt in The Witcher games, has called out so-called fans as "stupid" for describing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> as "woke" for having Ciri as the protagonist.</p>
<p>CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">revealed the next game and its protagonist last year</a>, though some have already criticised the studio as "woke" for having a female protagonist.</p>
<p>"That's just stupid," said Cockle in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufg-mhMsR7o">video published by Fall Damage</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke">IGN</a>). "There's nothing woke about it."</p>

<p>He continued: "[Ciri's] a cool character from The Witcher, and they're going to focus on that character. I think that's awesome. We can't just have Geralt for every single game for The Witcher ad nauseum, through eternity. Besides, we've seen the end of Geralt's journey - Blood and Wine was supposed to wrap up Geralt's journey.</p>
<p>"I celebrate Ciri. I celebrate her being the protagonist. So all you people who think it's woke… [blows raspberry]."</p>
<p>He added fans of the game should also read the books.</p>
<p>"If you read the books then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue," said Cockle. "There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it. If you think it's woke, read the damn books!"</p>
<p>Following the reveal of The Witcher 4, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-talks-ciri-fan-reaction-playable-geralt-coyness-and-if-the-game-will-honour-your-previous-choices">CD Projekt spoke to Eurogamer about the fan reaction to Ciri</a> as the protagonist.</p>
<p>"So I can really understand if some people, you know, might have wished to play another game with Geralt - like I can say myself, I could make games about Geralt until the day I die, and I would probably die happy," said narrative director Philipp Weber.</p>
<p>"But I think for me, and I think for all of us [at CDPR], it's also just really exciting to see all the opportunities that Ciri brings us, both with her character, and also by just virtue of who she is, what we can do with her in terms of the gameplay as well. So I think the best answer for us, for those people that really are worried right now, is basically to show them, when we are ready, that we really do this well and with care. And I think - I hope - we can then convince them with the game itself. Because I think actions speak louder than words."</p>
<p>Earlier this year the studio stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">doesn't plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026</a>, meaning it could end up being a next generation game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
