            <p>
July is here in a waft of warmth (your meteorological mileage may vary), meaning a fresh batch of games has arrived for PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers. And it's a pretty exciting month, with CD Projekt's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> making its service debut, alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> studio Don't Nod's well-received Banishers.
</p>
<p>
That's not everything, obviously, and July brings a total of 10 new games across PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers. Sony's latest catalogue refresh takes place next Tuesday, 15th July (with the exception of Cyberpunk 2077, which arrives a little earlier on 9th July), and you'll find the full list of this month's additions below:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cyberpunk 2077 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Abiotic Factor (PS5)</li>
<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden | PS5</li>
<li>Bluey: The Videogame (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Planet Zoo: Console Edition (PS5)</li>
<li>Risk of Rain 2 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Tropico 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>New World: Aeternum (PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Twisted Metal 3 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Twisted Metal 4 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So there you go! Cyberpunk 2077 is obviously the biggie, but there's a bunch of other good stuff too. Planet Zoo's a rock-solid management sim, taking Frontier's usually rather lightweight formula and adding some welcome depth (it's also a treat if you just want to build stuff and stare at the beautifully realised animals), and the sun-kissed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tropico-6">Tropico 6</a> is a fine time for genre fans too. 
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, which we called a "poignantly performed story about grief and injustice, where the difficult choices tug at your heart and principles," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">our four star review</a>. Also worth a look: Abiotic Factor's chaotic co-op survival in the depths of a paranormal research lab, and some similarly frenzied co-op action in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>. As for this month's Premium-exclusive retro titles, there's cult-classic driving mayhem in Twisted Metal 2 and 3, which launched for the original PlayStation in 1996 and 1998 respectively.
</p>
<p>
And that's your lot! As a reminder, the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 17th June (aside from Cyberpunk 2077, which is out today) meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/herere-your-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-june">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention shifts elsewhere. And as for July's Essential tier offerings, you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-games-for-july">can read about them here</a>.
