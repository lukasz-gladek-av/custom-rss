            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has shared a fresh look at the upcoming reboot's neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>, and with that early access release due some time this year, the team has been sharing a few snippets of what players can expect via a series of dedicated blog posts known as The Grind.</p>
<p>Volume four of The Grind was released last night, complete with a glance at Skate's neighbourhoods. First up, there is Hedgemont, where players will begin their skating shenanigans. Then, players will be able to venture further afield to Gullcrest Village, Market Mile, and Brickswich.</p>

<p>"One of the sickest spots in Gullcrest Village is the House of Rolling Reverence (the church)," Full Circle says. This "communal place of shredding" includes plenty of pews and stained glass windows.</p>
<p>Market Mile, meanwhile, boasts tall buildings, elevated walkways and San Vansterdam's coast. "Don't let the shiny veneer fool you - there are some hidden (and not-so-hidden) gems here," the Skate team teases. "The skatepark to the left of the neighborhood is ripe for throwdowns, and near the south side, you've got a community park to add to and tear it up."</p>
<p>Last up, there is Brickswich, which comes with a stadium to grind on. "The city is vertical, so get climbing," Full Circle says.</p>
<p>Additionally, the team has said its music for the upcoming reboot will be detailed next month. Let's hope Skate has Hozier on the soundtrack, because EA wants to take us to church.</p>
<p>You can find further information on Skate's neighborhood's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-four">via The Grind</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the Skate reboot team revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-wont-be-playable-offline-to-offer-a-massively-multiplayer-sandbox-thats-always-online-and-always-evolving">the game won't be playable offline</a>, in order to offer a "massively multiplayer" sandbox that's "always online and always evolving".</p>
<p>On its eventual release, Skate will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Furthermore, it will also have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-has-a-communal-place-of-shredding-full-of-pews-and-stained-glass]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Surgent Studios has revealed the full cast for its forthcoming psychological horror game, Dead Take.</p>
<p>Headlined by Ben Starr and Neil Newbon, the cast will also include Jane Perry (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/returnal">Returnal</a>) and Alanah Pearce (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>). In addition, there will be cameo appearance from the likes of Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part 2), Matthew Mercer (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>), and Sam Lake (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>).</p>
<p>Alongside the cast list comes a new trailer for the game, which you can watch below. The trailer shows off the game's splicing mechanic, where live-action clips are merged to form new clues to solve the game's mysterious narrative.</p>

<p>The full cast list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ben Starr</li>
<li>Neil Newbon</li>
<li>Jane Perry</li>
<li>Matt Mercer</li>
<li>Laura Bailey</li>
<li>Sam Lake</li>

</ul>
<p>"Dead Take is about actors. So we needed actors who've lived it," said Abubakar Salim, creative director of Dead Take. "It's a game about the high of ambition and the rot underneath it. The lies we tell ourselves to get in the spotlight, and the monsters we become to stay there. Everyone in this cast has felt that pressure. This was a chance to bleed it out."</p>
<p>Salim previously discussed with Eurogamer how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries">Dead Take will blur the boundaries between game and film</a>.</p>
<p>"You're going to be watching Ben and Neil do their work on screen as actors," said Salim. "And the reason why is because I didn't want them to hide behind animated characters, or 3D characters. I wanted to show you them. That's essentially something that I really wanted to hammer in as well, while using these guys, is because we're so used to seeing them behind Astarion or Clive. What are they as actors when you see them in the flesh?"</p>
<p>Dead Take is due for release on 31st July on PC (via Steam and Epic).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/surgent-studios-reveals-full-cast-for-dead-take-including-sam-lake-jane-perry-and-laura-bailey]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A few days ago, PlayStation's Insomniac team shared a social media post of Marvel's Spider-Man perched on an antenna making a peace sign with his right hand. "Hey, how are ya?" the post read, along with a couple of accompanying hashtags. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>Except, these days a post can't just be a post, and this little and fairly casual bit of engagement from Insomniac now has many replies calling for an Xbox port of Marvel's Spider-Man.</p>
<p>"So Spiderman 2018 coming to Xbox?" <a href="https://x.com/chaosprimeZ/status/1944745186312982790">reads one reply</a>. "Looks good wrapped in green," <a href="https://x.com/ThunderDomeGam1/status/1944785699749642574">another added</a>. "Xbox announcement," <a href="https://x.com/Stormzy010/status/1945082964183789785">reads a third</a>, and really I am only sharing a few examples.</p>

<p>Does this mean Spider-Man will make the swing to Xbox? After all, in 2018, when Insomniac's game was initially released, the <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/981334875188809728">studio did post a tweet to say it would "never" come to Microsoft's consoles</a>.</p>
<p>But that was several years ago now, and since then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform">Sony has announced former PlayStation console exclusive Helldivers 2 will be available on Xbox</a> later this year (this is despite Arrowhead's community manager once saying it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/getting-helldivers-2-on-xbox-would-need-sony-and-phil-spencer-to-duke-it-out-arrowhead-community-lead-says">need "Sony and Phil [Spencer] to duke out" in order to get an Xbox port of the shooter off the ground</a>).</p>
<p>Then again, Insomniac has also shared a <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1945272265630691375">more recent post</a> showing Kit from Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart giving us all a cheery thumbs up. Maybe the team is just wanting to share some love.</p>
<p>So, would you like to see Insomniac's Peter Parker don his Spidey ensemble and use his web-tastic skills to plop on over to Xbox consoles soon?</p> <div>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony execs Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst said PlayStation will remain "thoughtful" with which of its games it brings to other platforms</a>.</p>
<p>The company is "continuously exploring new ways for players to interact with their franchises", Hulst said, before adding: "It's important to realise that we're really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we're taking a very measured, a very deliberate approach in doing that.</p>
<p>"Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they're such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console. They are real showcases of the performance, of the quality of the hardware, so we want to ensure that players get the best experience from these titles."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-shares-casual-spider-man-post-now-fans-want-an-xbox-port]]></content:encoded>
