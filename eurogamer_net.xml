Ubisoft is set to close its UK studio based in Leamington, as it sheds 185 jobs across the business. 
</p>
<p>Leamington's team of around 50 people will be disbanded, while other Ubisoft offices in Düsseldorf (formerly Blue Byte), Stockholm and the Newcastle-based Ubisoft Reflections will be downsized.</p>
<p>
"As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritise projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site," a Ubisoft spokesperson said in a statement to Eurogamer.
</p>
<p>
"Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition."
</p>
<p>Founded in 2002 as FreeStyleGames by a group of former Rare and Codemasters veterans, Ubisoft Leamington had most recently worked as a support studio on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy's The Division</a> series, and also assisted development on games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>.</p><p>In its heyday, under its previous ownership by Activision, Leamington was best known for its DJ Hero games, before it was put to work on the publisher's Guitar Hero and Call of Duty franchises. Ubisoft then acquired the firm in 2017.
</p>
<p>As for the teams that have been downsized, Ubisoft Düsseldorf is best known for developing Anno and The Settlers, while Ubisoft Stockholm most recently worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> with Massive Entertainment. Ubisoft Reflections, the veteran team originally founded in 1984 and acquired by Ubisoft in 2006, had been working closely with Leamington supporting AAA game development.
</p>
<p>Ubisoft's latest layoffs come as the company continues to try and cut costs amidst a string of disappointing game launches, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">including the failure of big budget bet Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">the shutdown of live-service shooter XDefiant,</a> and wider concern for the firm's future.
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">Ubisoft said it was "taking decisive steps" to reshape the company</a>, in order to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". 
</p>
<p>Ubisoft has repeatedly reduced its headcount since 2022, when it employed 20,279 people. By the end of September 2024, Ubisoft employed 18,666.

<p>Those interested in scooping up Rise of the Ronin via Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/">can pre-order now</a>.</p>
<p>If you purchase before 2nd April, you will also be able to get your hands on a selection of early purchases bonuses based on other Team Ninja games, "which includes four combat styles; Hayabusa-ryu for katana, Hayabusa-ryu for naginata, Nioh-ryu for katana and Aisu Kage-ryu for katana, the Iga Ninja armour set, and the Iga Ninja’s katan".</p><p>On its release, we awarded Rise of the Ronin four out of five stars. "[Developer] Team Ninja borrows the open-world familiarity and historical tourism of Assassin's Creed while adapting its own breed of hardcore action for the mainstream," Alan Wen wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rise-of-the-ronin-review">Eurogamer's Rise of the Ronin review</a> from March last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
