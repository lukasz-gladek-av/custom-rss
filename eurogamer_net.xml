<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> Expeditions' existence isn't much of a mystery given all the teasing Epic's been giving it on social media recently, but the teasing has now made way for a full reveal. And what is it? Expeditions, it turns out, is a mission-based PvE mode where players join forces to thwart the nefarious plans of an evil mask maker. As for the when, it's out this week.
</p>
<p>
Those wishing to embark on an Expeditions adventure will be enrolled in the Supernova Academy, where they'll hang out with other players, chat with members of the faculty (including founder Vengeance Jones), and take on co-op missions pitting them against Mask Maker Daigo's minions - which include sentient crystals, demon guards, and formidable Titans.
</p>
<p>
These missions whisk players (and as many as three friends) to key locations around the world map, including Utopia City, Spire Excavation Site, and Busted Bridge, with more - such as Demon's Domain, where Daigo resides - coming after launch. As for what you'll be doing out in the field, there's talk of rescuing civilians, setting up comm relays, and deploying field generators, all while fending off waves of enemies - and if players can find moment to explore amid the chaos, they might uncover useful resources, currency, gear, and more.

<p>
To aid in their adventures, players can switch between four distinct classes at will, each with their own XP-based skills trees. Shadow Caller, for instance, can summon projectiles that heal or deal damage; The Hunter is all about inflicting massive damage to a single target, while Rift Rippers can use their rift abilities against either single or multiple foes. Players can also randomly acquire gadgets and weapons - including Plasma Pistols, Dual Daggers, and the War Hammer - by spending Essence found during missions back at the academy.
</p>
<p>
As missions are completed, they'll contribute to global goals known as Team Projects, and Epic also mentions Academy Assignments, additional objectives players can pick up from faculty members and tackle during their downtime.
</p>
<p>
Lego Fortnite Expeditions comes to all versions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on 18th June, and can be accessed via the Battle Bus in either Odyssey or Brick Life modes. Additionally, Expeditions monsters will begin infiltrating Odyssey in July (hero classes will follow, according to Epic), and players can start crafting Expeditions weapons in preparation soon.
