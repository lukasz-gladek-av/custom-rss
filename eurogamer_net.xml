            <p>Blood Message, a single player narrative action game, has just been revealed by Netease Games.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PC and consoles, though no release date has been announced.</p>
<p>Developed by 24 Entertainment, the studio responsible for melee battle royale Naraka: Bladepoint, the new trailer introduces the Dunhuang's Uprising as Blood Message's setting, where your character must make a 1,000 mile trek with a crucial message in hand.</p>

<p>The trailer - which you can watch above - is a visually impressive display, showcasing plenty of third-person action across various distinct locations. While 24 Entertainment does have action experience courtesy of Naraka, this looks to be a much slower, cinematic affair.</p>
<p>An accompanying press release states Blood Message will feature: "Visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics", as well as "expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia". In terms of gameplay comparisons, think something along the lines of The Last of Us, albeit with a close-quarters, historical focus.</p>
<p>"We are ushering players a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," said Zhipeng Hu, lead producer and NetEase executive vice president. "As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world."</p>
<p>We're seeing a lot of these big budget action games come from China as of late, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">the success of Black Myth: Wukong changed the game for the country's developers</a>. Prior to Blood Message, Phantom Blade Zero, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Lost Soul Aside, and Tides of Annihilation are just a handful of examples of interesting titles following the path Wukong first tread.</p>
<p>These examples have yet to release, and as such whether or not the financial and critical success of Wukong can be replicated by its contemporaries remains to be seen. Nonetheless, this wave of interesting looking games coming to the West from a historically under-represented part of the video game industry (at least as far as big budget AAA is concerned) certainly offers another avenue for exciting games to reach the hands of curious players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has received an update to make its Overture DLC easier to access and play.</p>
<p>The game's director, Jiwon Choi, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-will-have-difficulty-reduced-in-future-update">stated in a video last week</a> an update including "difficulty reduction" was on the way. Now it's here.</p>
<p>Specifically, the DLC can now be accessed from Chapter 5 instead of Chapter 9, as long as you're on your second playthrough.</p>

<p>Further, repeat playthroughs will have reduced monster difficulty, while on a first playthrough certain field monsters will have adjusted stats. I really hope it's those bastard kangaroos that have been nerfed.</p>
<p>This is great news for everybody, except me. It means that if you're on a second playthrough of the game (on NG+), you can now access the DLC earlier. I, however, have already had to do a NG+ speedrun up to the end of Chapter 9 prior to this update just to access the DLC. Sigh.</p>
<p>Still, alongside the DLC, an update for the full game has brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc">new easier difficulty options</a>. So even if the DLC's difficulty has put you off (or, like me, you just want to get through the base game quicker), it's easier to do so on a lower setting.</p>
<p>Alongside the balance adjustments, a number of bugs have been fixed, as per the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519716851054280776">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Lies of P has <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001716.000010988.html">now sold over 3m copies</a>, thanks to the release of the Overture DLC. Previously, publisher Neowiz revealed the game had reached 7 million players, but as it was initially released on Xbox Game Pass, these didn't count towards copies sold.</p>
<p>To celebrate, developer Round8 is (according to <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284">The Elec</a> - thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-devs-get-bonus-paid-holiday-and-switch-2-consoles-for-hitting-sales-milestone/">VGC</a>) rewarding its employees with a bonus payout, extra holiday, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> console each.

            <p>An advert for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has reportedly been photographed on the London Underground, stating the game is "out now".</p>
<p>Officially, the game is only due for release at some point this year, so the discovery of this advert has sparked hope a release is imminent.</p>
<p>The images, reportedly taken at Oxford Circus, have not been verified. Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for confirmation of Metroid Prime 4's release date.</p>

<p>Still, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lfnbga/metroid_prime_4_ad_in_london_underground_out_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit post</a> does include multiple images from different angles, so it certainly appears real. So what's going on?</p>
<p>At the very least, Metroid Prime 4 is certainly not "out now". It's not available to purchase on the eShop, and it seems unlikely Nintendo would shadow drop it.</p>
<p>Instead, this is likely a mistake: either the advertising company has mistakenly put the advert up too early, or a "coming soon" sign of some sort is meant to cover the "out now" part for removal later. Either way, we're awaiting official clarification from Nintendo.</p>
<p>As the advert is specifically for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> Edition, it includes: support for mouse controls, up to 4K resolution in docked TV mode, frame rates up to 120fps, and HDR support.</p>
<p>The game is also set for release on the original Switch, presumably at the same time.</p>
<p>After years of waiting, the hugely anticipated sci-fi adventure received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">first gameplay trailer in June last year</a>. A deeper look at the game was provided during the March Nintendo Direct, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">Samus' psychic powers were revealed</a>.</p>
<p>I was able to play Metroid Prime 4 at the Nintendo Switch 2 preview event in London and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-is-the-best-example-of-switch-2s-varied-control-capabilities-but-you-might-want-to-work-on-your-thighs">tested out its variety of control options</a>. Mouse controls certainly work well enough, but I'm not convinced it'll be the most comfortable way to play on your sofa.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
