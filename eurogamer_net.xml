            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> kickstarts a huge month for the game tonight, with its impending Fortnite Remix: The Prelude live event. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games has warned fans to join the game "a few hours early" in advance of the event's 10.30pm UK (6.30pm Eastern) kickoff time, in order to avoid server queues.
</p>
<p>
Once logged in, the event will take place within Fortnite's Battle Royale and Zero Build modes - just head to the Restored Reels location. Here, the game's Storm will be paused, and player combat will be disabled shortly before the event's start.
</p>
<p>
Exactly what will happen tonight remains a mystery, though some kind of remixed musical event is expected. Could Fortnite favourite DJ Marshmallo make an appearance, since he just got a new in-game skin? Might Snoop Dogg appear, since he's all set to arrive as the next featured icon in the game's Fortnite Festival musical mode?
</p><p>
Whatever happens, Fortnite's Battle Royale and Zero Build portions are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-estimated-release-date-and-time">set to revisit the game's fan-favourite Chapter 2 map</a> beginning tomorrow, Saturday 2nd November. Capitalising on the success of last year's Fortnite OG mini-season, fans expect a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-season-looks-to-bring-back-sharks-and-midas">similar month-long visit back to the game's second map</a>, home to spymaster Midas, buff cat Meowscles, and the game's infamous season where the map was flooded.
</p>
<p>
All of that is then set to wrap up on 30th November with another live event, dubbed Fortnite Remix: The Finale. This is expected to bring Fortnite's revitalised Chapter 2 map to yet another catastrophic conclusion, making way for the game's all-new Chapter 6 at the start of December. 
</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> may have welcomed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">impressive number of Steam players giving the open beta a whirl</a>, but many of these players are not especially impressed.</p>
<p>A quick look over on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> reddit feed shows multiple screenshots of angular, almost Nintendo 64-looking graphics. In one clip shared by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1gh0deu/graphics_be_damned_ill_hunt_them_all_the_same/">Magolich</a>, the player looks like they are trying to hunt down an animated origami creation, rather than a fully fleshed beast.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as you can see in the header image above and the posts below, several characters look like a very basic version of what they are surely meant to look like, and the fellow above brought to my mind a Lord of the Rings' Uruk-hai after a bad night.</p>
<p>"Just beat the demo, it was fun but I think the graphics could be a bit better," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ggwpob/just_beat_the_demo_it_was_fun_but_i_think_the/">one user</a> shared, with their own rather janky screenshots.</p>

</span></p><p>These images have certainly made me chuckle, but obviously are far from ideal. Thankfully, the Monster Hunter Wilds' team has said the final game is "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test". It has also shared a few <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/4175478969021690194">troubleshooting pointers</a> for those still looking to get into the beta.</p><p>"The purpose of this test is to allow players to experience a limited portion of Monster Hunter Wilds and also to verify various technical aspects such as network load and overall operation prior to the game's full release," the developer wrote on Steam.</p>
<p>"Please note that the final product is still in development. Certain aspects such as game specifications and balance may differ in the full version. We are committed to ensuring the quality of the final product."</p>

<p>Our Ed has been hands on with the game already, and came away impressed. "For the most part, Monster Hunter Wilds strikes a balance between approachability and depth of combat. It offers a familiar thrill of the hunt, of player customisation (the new armours look awesome), and of extravagant combat, but with a fresh world ripe for a bit of co-op action - even with NPCs," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release in full in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">February next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered is sitting on a mixed Steam user score as players take issue with a number of things, including performance, stuttering, audio glitches, and the fact you need a PSN account despite the game being a single player adventure.</p>
<p>Not that the latter is new information, of course. Just like other notable PlayStation-flavoured Steam releases such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, players knew they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-will-require-a-psn-account">wouldn't be able to play Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC without a PSN account</a>. That doesn't mean they're done making their unhappiness known, though, or plan to stop warning other players of the requirement.</p>

<p>"I really wanted to play but it sucks to have to have an [PSN] account to play it, and the worst thing is that when you want to verify your account or tells you that the password is invalid or you have to repeat the procedure again, why do I have to have a playstation account if I'm going to play on a damn PC???" posited <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamdoll19/recommended/2561580/">one</a> of the 39 percent of players to have left a negative review on Steam.</p>
<p>"Game runs very poorly. Awful optimisation. Running game with 4070. Refunded," added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051476976/recommended/2561580/">another</a> particularly succinct player.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt about it - when it comes to porting or developing for PC, Nixxes is still the best of them all!" says <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/stepasr/recommended/2561580/">one</a> more positive take. "The Complete Edition was already amazing, but now, with this Remastered, we've reached new heights, as with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p>"They've redone everything, even the benchmark, and the technical side is finally packed with features: from all upscalers to frame generation, all the way to dynamic resolution. The game's visual quality has improved tenfold, performance is excellent, they did an incredible job, and it deserves recognition. And all this for just 10 bucks! Kudos all around! Enjoy the game!"</p>
<p>On reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1gh15wp/really_enjoying_the_remaster_but_it_def_needs_a/">this player</a> broke down some of the game's biggest issues: "Really enjoying the remaster, but it [definitely] needs a patch or two. I'm noticing small stutters or hitching during cutscenes, the audio mix in that first town area has some weird reverb with NPC chatter and sound effects… A few minor floating items or clothing graphics glitches. This is not killing my immersion or anything but would be nice if these things were sorted out."</p>
<p>Other complains report problems with controllers, freezes, and numerous crashes.</p>
<p>The issue around PSN linking all stems back to the beginning of the summer with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers' PC PSN log-in requirement</a>. There was such a vitriolic backlash that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony backtracked on its original plans</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">auto-refunded players who bought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
