            <p>Following the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Sony has closed Concord studio Firewalk</a>, the live-service game's initial development deal reportedly cost $200m.</p>
<p>This, however, was not enough to cover the game's entire development costs, sources familiar with the agreement told <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">Kotaku</a>. This cost also did not include the purchase of the Concord IP rights or Firewalk itself, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">Sony acquired last year</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday's news detailed the human cost of closing the studio, which employed around 150-170 people. The $200m figure adds a sense of the financial cost of even beginning development.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-reportedly-cost-300m-to-make-amid-a-culture-of-toxic-positivity">report from September</a>, after the game was shut down, suggested the game had cost $400m to produce, with development rife with "toxic positivity".</p>
<p>A final statement from Firewalk shared last night on social media details what the studio achieved during its time on Concord.</p>
<p>"Firewalk began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience," reads the statement.</p>
<p>The assembled team then grew a new startup, the statement continues, built a "customised next-generation FPS engine", managed an acquisition from Sony, and ultimately delivered "a great FPS experience to players - even if it landed much more narrowly than hoped against a heavily consolidated market".</p>

<p>"We took some risks along the way - marrying aspects of card battlers and fighting games with first-person-shooters - and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward," the statement continues.</p><p>"The talent at Firewalk and the level of individual craft is truly world-class, and teams within Sony Interactive Entertainment and across the industry will be fortunate to work with them.  Please reach out to Recruiting at PlayStation for inquiries, and thank you to all the very many teams, partners and fans who supported us along the way."</p>
<p>Despite this hard work, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">Concord reportedly sold only 25,000 copies</a> - clearly not enough to recoup its huge costs. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled offline at the start of September</a>.</p>
<p>"The PvP first-person shooter genre is a competitive space that's continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," wrote SIE boss Hermen Hulst in an internal email shared yesterday. "We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is a "return to what made BioWare great".</p>
<p>During a Q&amp;A with investors in EA's quarterly earnings call, Wilson reflected on BioWare's recent history, which included looking back at beleaguered multiplayer shooter, Anthem.</p>
<p>The EA exec said this game was "probably the one people remember the most for not really living up to the expectations of what a 'BioWare game' should be". He noted the studio was trying to "do something very very different" to what had gone before, adding the "pieces of the puzzle" ultimately didn't come together as BioWare had hoped.</p>

</figure>
<p>Following Anthem, a "big shift" subsequently happened at the developer, which Wilson said saw the studio "really returning to BioWare-type games" and "returning to BioWare's strengths". And, that brings us to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is set to release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC on 31st October.</p><p>"The BioWare team has really rallied around what made BioWare a fan-favourite studio and a fan-favourite brand and the types of games they make; incredibly rich worlds, incredibly nuanced characters, really powerful and compelling stories with camaraderie and friendships and relationships, and decisions that matter in the context of gameplay," Wilson said.</p>
<p>"And I think it’s been that return to what made BioWare great and giving the studio the time to deliver against what makes BioWare great in the context of the Dragon Age world is what amounts to a game like Dragon Age: The Veilguard."</p>

            <p>Pokémon TCG Pocket, the digital trading card game, is now available on mobile.</p>
<p>It's free-to-start and allows players to split open booster packs to acquire digital versions of popular Pokémon trading cards - and then compete in battles.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-heading-to-mobile-this-year">first announced at the Pokémon Presents event in February</a> and is now finally available to download across iOS and Android devices.</p>

<p>One of the biggest draws are the "immersive cards" that allow players to dive into the artwork to explore the worlds within.</p>
<p>However, while free-to-start, there are microtransactions and multiple currencies in the store to acquire time boosters and other items, allowing players to open more packs.</p>
<p>Poké Gold costs 79p for five pieces, or up to £79.99 for 500 pieces. This can be used to buy bundles of items, costing from 45 pieces to 115 pieces.</p>
<p>That said, there are various freebies each day so, if you're willing to wait, you'll still have access to a decent chunk of the experience without paying - so far at least.</p>
<p>At launch, cards are from the Genetic Apex collection, which includes plenty of fan favourite Pokémon originating from the Kanto region.</p>
<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn went hands-on with the experience</a> stating while the focus is on opening card packs "there's a promising version of the card game underneath".</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket is expected to be a success, though it remains to be seen if it can reach the same levels as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>.</p>
<p>That game just launched its Gigantamax feature to a mixed response, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-gigantamax-battles-will-be-made-easier-in-response-to-mixed-feedback">Niantic acknowledging feedback to make the battles easier</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-gained-15m-new-players-in-the-past-year-despite-being-over-a-decade-old<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> might be getting on a bit, what with having launched over a decade ago now, but that doesn't seem to have dulled interest in the long-running life sim series; EA just announced The Sims 4 has managed to gain over 15m new players this year alone.
</p>
<p>
To put that into perspective, it took The Sims 4 six years to amass 20m players after its launch back in 2014 - a figure that then skyrocketed following EA's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-base-game-is-going-permanently-free-starting-in-october">transition the formerly premium title into a free-to-play game</a> in October 2022. That business model shift more than quadrupled The Sims 4's audience, with EA touting 85m players back in May this year, and we now know the past 12 months have brought a total of 15m new players.
</p>
<p>
That most recent figure was revealed as part of EA's <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Q2-FY25-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf">second-quarter 2025 financial earnings report</a> ("Increased engagement led to higher-than-expected net bookings for the franchise in
Q2", the publisher noted), and helps provide additional context for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">announcement earlier this year</a> that, despite its age, The Sims 4 will remain "a foundational Sims experience" as the series moves "beyond linear, sequential Sims releases".

<p>
The Sims 4's surge in popularity also explains EA renewed focus on the ten-year-old game, with the publisher having pledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-pledges-more-bug-fixes-more-often-as-it-looks-to-address-years-of-frustrating-technical-issues">more bug fixes more often</a> this May as it looks to address years of 'frustrating' technical issues. That's on top of a range of new in-game initiatives, such as the new live-service style Reaper's Rewards Event, and a continuing avalanche of new DLC.
</p><p>
Next on the expansion list is The Sims 4's extremely promising and wonderfully macabre <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-4-gets-embalming-grim-reaping-reincarnation-and-naked-moon-rituals-in-new-life-death-expansion">Life &amp; Death expansion</a>, which releases this Thursday, 31st October. Its launch follows a free base game update last week considerably expanding Sims' ghost-form gameplay (and making it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-ghostly-update-puts-woohoo-ing-the-grim-reaper-back-on-the-table">possible to bonk Death</a>), and comes ahead of a new series of creator-designed DLC packs.
</p>
<p>
Things have certainly come a long way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-responds-to-fan-outcry-over-the-sims-4-missing-features">since Swimmingpoolgate</a>.

            <p>
If relentlessly amassing sticks and bopping rocks is starting to feel a little stale in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, there's something new on the horizon. Developer Gameloft has unveiled The Storybook Vale, a second paid expansion for the village-life sim, that'll whisk players to a world of Greek myths, Scottish folktales, and more when it launches on 20th November.
</p>
<p>
The Storybook Vale, which follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-dreamlight-valleys-massive-a-rift-in-time-expansion-detailed">last year's A Rift in Time expansion</a>, introduces another world for Dreamlight Valley players to explore in the form of the titular Vale. Described as "the place in your heart where all your most treasured stories live", it's said to have previously hung in the sky over Dreamlight Valley - but was stolen away by Maleficent and Hades, eventually falling into disarray as the pair began to bicker. And that's where players come in, embarking on a quest for the Lorekeeper - an enchanted book who holds the world together - to retrieve her scattered pages and restore peace.
</p>
<p>
And all this takes place across The Storybook Vale's three new biomes. There's The Bind, inspired by "dark academia" and the "cool yet cosy ambience of an autumnal forest"; Mythtopia, themed around "Greco-Roman culture and ancient myths" (and it even gets its own Mount Olympus), plus Everafter, a blend of "dark enchanted mushroom forest and windswept moorlands" inspired by "Scottish and Scandinavian folklore".

<figcaption>Disney Dreamlight Valley: The Storybook Vale announcement trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv3kFpaq4Co" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The Storybook Vale will be released over two parts, the first arriving on 20th November and the second due next summer. Part one introduces three new villagers - Brave's Merida, Hercules' Hades, and Tangled's Flynn (who'll be able to reunite with Rapunzel if players happen to have last year's A Rift in Time expansion) - alongside new collectibles, tools, resources, and "dozens" of new recipes. Players can catch koi fish, for instance, or gather ambrosia, and there are new animal companions in the form of owls, mini dragons, and mini winged horses.
</p><p>
Additionally, the expansion introduces Trials, special quests inspired by fairy tales and myths that players will need to unscramble using their old and new tools. One of those new tools is the Royal Net, used to capture the Lorekeeper's scattered pages, come to life as ancient origami creatures known as Snippets, which can then be assembled into jigsaw-like tapestries and hung in in-game homes. And that's just Part One, with next year's Part Two, The Unwritten Realms, seeing players "venture into a strange world beneath the Storybook Vale [to] solve the mystery of the missing princess", alongside Maleficent and a currently unannounced second character. 
</p>
<p>
Both parts of The Storybook Vale are included in Disney Dreamlight Valley's second expansion pass, which releases on 20th November. Purchases also include 5,000 Moonstones - as the game's premium currency is known - and there's a Magical Edition, featuring 10,000 Moonstones, the Autumn Manor House stye, Storybook Vale dress and ensemble, plus Baby Pegasus companion and house. Alternatively, the Storybook Bundle includes the base game, new expansion, and 13,000 Moonstones, while the Enchanted Edition gathers together the base game, both expansions, 18,000 Moonstones, plus "exclusive rewards". Gameloft hasn't announced prices for any of these at the time of writing, but last year's A Rift in Time expansion cost £24.99 so expect things to start from there.

<p>
Alongside all <em>that</em>, Gameloft has shared a look ahead at the base game's next series of free updates, starting with Sew Delightful on 4th December. This brings Sally from A Nightmare Before Christmas to the Valley, complete with the usual introductory quest and Friendship rewards. That's alongside a new premium Star Path, which includes ice-themed furniture and other rewards. Sew Delightful also promises a number of new features, including floating islands. These act as extra building spaces, themed after existing base game biomes, that players can expand to if they need more room (object limits are independent from other locations) with each island being comparable to their Valley counterparts. Plaza Island, Forest Island, Sunlit Island, and Frosted Island as set to launch in December with more to follow. 
</p><p>
Additionally, builders feeling limited by the game's current four points of rotation will soon see that increased to 16, opening up new decorating possibilities. Gameloft says the enhanced placement system applies to furniture, buildings, landscaping items, resources, and even dropped items like prepared dishes, with support for fences and paths coming at a later date. 
</p>
<p>
But that's still not quite everything announced during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJJ6OqlJig0">Gameloft's latest Disney Dreamlight Valley stream</a>. The developer also shared a roadmap covering its three free updates for the first half of 2025. Early 2025, for instance, will let players explore "a whole new world and revel on a magical adventure" - the accompanying picture teasing the arrival of Aladdin and Jasmine - while Spring 2025 promises a "land of wonder", its image of the Cheshire Cat unquestionably marking the arrival of Alice's Adventures. And finally, Summer 2025 will give players the opportunity to "solve an ancient mystery and discover who is waiting inside Skull Rock." And given Skull Rock's origins and the red feather buried in the sand in Gameloft's tease, this should finally be the moment Disney Dreamlight Valley welcomes Peter Pan and friends.
