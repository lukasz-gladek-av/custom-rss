            <p>
A Japanese shrine famous to video game fans has announced a ban on visits by tourists, following an "unforgivable act of disrespect".
</p>
<p>
In 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-fans-crowdfund-repairs-to-typhoon-hit-island">Ghost of Tsushima players helped the Tsushima Watatzumi Shrine shrine raise 27m yen (£192k)</a> to repair its Torii gate, after it was destroyed in a typhoon. The crowdfunding campaign ultimately raised 500 per cent of its original target.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, the Watazumi Shrine has announced a total ban on tourist visits, after an incident occured earlier this week on 23rd March described only as "a grave and unforgivable act of disrespect committed by foreigner(s)".

<p>
Further details of the incident have not been released, though a message on the Watazumi Shrine's social media accounts states that, going forward, only worshippers will be allowed entrance.
</p>
<p>
Unacceptable behaviour by tourists at the Watazumi Shrine is nothing new, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-shrine-once-repaired-thanks-to-ghost-of-tsushima-fans-bans-all-tourists-after-unforgivable-act-of-disrespect/">Automaton reports</a>, and a previous, controversial ban had seen South Korean visitors barred, after incidents of vandalism and abuse directed towards staff.
</p>
<p>
Now, all tourists - domestic and foreign - are banned.
</p>
<p>
"Inbound tourism's destruction of places, things, and people cherished by the Japanese is nothing less than the destruction of Japanese culture," the shrine's message states. 
</p>
<p>
"Those who consider this place a theme park or simply a photogenic location are not worshippers."
</p>
<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-detailed-includes-destructible-shrine-changes-after-concern-over-copycats">Assassin's Creed Shadows quietly released an update that reduced the amount of destruction possible by players in the game's version of shrines</a>, after pre-release footage of a player causing damage sparked concern.

            <p>If you are hoping to see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> move over to Nintendo's consoles on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>'s release, well developer Pocketpair would absolutely consider it. That's even despite the studio's legal dispute with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough">IGN</a> at GDC, Pocketpair's communications director John 'Bucky' Buckley revealed the team would have happily seen its monster-catching survival game on the OG Switch as well, but due to how "beefy" Palworld is, it wasn't able to find a home on Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>This may change for Switch 2, though, providing the next generation of Nintendo's consoles has the ability to handle the chonky game.</p>

<p>When asked about Palworld releasing on Switch 2, Bucky said the developer doesn't know the hardware specs yet. "Like everyone else, we're waiting. I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them," Bucky said.</p>
<p>He added that should the specs be "beefy enough" for Palworld, then "it's 100 percent worth considering" a Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>"We did a lot of optimisation for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with," Pocketpair's communications director continued. "Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned! As for when we may hear more about those mysterious Switch 2 specs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo has a dedicated showcase for its upcoming console scheduled for next week</a>.</p>

<p>Ever since Palworld was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a>. In fact, Palworld was dubbed  'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release last year, and soon after its debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a>.</p>
<p>In September, Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a>, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, Pocketpair has released a game on Nintendo Switch. In January of this year, the <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/">developer's real-time roguelike deck builder Overdungeon arrived on the Switch store in Japan</a>, having previously been available via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-thanks-fans-for-heartwarming-response-as-game-launches-to-very-positive-steam-rating">warmly-received by fans of the series</a> - and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-tops-2-million-players-surpassing-the-launches-of-origins-and-odyssey">off to a good start sales-wise, too</a> - but players still have a long list of suggestions for what they'd like to see Ubisoft add to the game next.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ji48nm/which_new_featuresimprovements_would_you_like_to/">lengthy thread on the Assassin's Creed reddit</a> has dozens of feature ideas - including a particularly prominent handful of concepts from other <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> that didn't return in Shadows that fans want to see added back.
</p>
<p>
The ability to meditate and move the game's clock forward - changing day to night, or vice versa - is a big request. I can see why this didn't initially make the cut in Shadows, as stealth is such a big deal and I'd always change the clock to night for an easier ride (Naoe specifically has skills which boost her stealth after dark). But also, waiting for the night is no fun.

<p>
Numerous fans have asked for your mount's "follow path" option to return. Present in several recent Assassin's Creed games, this essentially put your horse on autopilot, allowing you to go check your phone for a bit. I actually appreciate that this isn't included in Shadows, with road traversal instead spiced up with random encounters - both friend and foe.
</p>
<p>
Smaller requests include hair and beard customisation (as seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>), fishing (again, as in Valhalla), faster selling/dismantling of gear, the ability to show headgear in cutscenes, an option to remove yellow paint, and the addition of poses for photo mode. 
</p>
<p>
The majority of fan requests are relatively minor - which is a good thing! There are surprisingly (to me) few requests for the return of the arrival drone, which I liked using but doesn't fit with Shadows' more detailed exploration mechanics. </p>
<p>A good number of fans have simply asked for the ability to sit down wherever in the game and watch the world go by.
</p>
<p>
"Let me pinch Junjiro's cheeks on demand," Soapy_Grapes wrote. Sure.
</p>
<p>
Will any of these suggestions make the cut? Ubisoft has already committed to evolving Shadows further over the coming weeks and months. 
</p>
<p>
"Thank you for being part of this journey with us," the Assassin's Creed Shadows development team at Ubisoft Quebec wrote in a message to fans this past weekend. "This is just the beginning for Shadows, and we're thrilled to see the game evolve with you by our side."
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.

            <p>
A mod putting a playable approximation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> has run into trouble after Rockstar owner Take-Two issued a copyright removal request to its creator's YouTube channel.
</p>
<p>
The mod, developed by Youtuber Dark Space, was an effort to bring GTA 6's map to life in GTA 5 by building on the work of the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/985670-mapping-vice-city-map-discussion-thread-no-leak-footage-allowed/">Mapping Vice City project</a> - a community led attempt to piece together GTA 6's map by scrutinising all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">currently released official media</a> and combining any discoveries with previously leaked map coordinates.
</p>
<p>
Dark Space began <a href="https://x.com/Dark_SpaceYT/status/1882980876201685289">detailing his progress on social media</a> in January and a version 1.0 release of his mod - built from GTA 5 assets - launched last week. However, the project may already have run aground; Dark Space is reining things in after Take-Two's legal team hit his YouTube channel with a copyright removal request.

<p>
"I spent months building a fan-made GTA 6-inspired map inside GTA 5 - something purely made out of passion, not profit," Dark Space wrote in an introduction to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U">new video detailing the week's events</a>. "But shortly after uploading a video showcasing the project, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> took it down. No warning. No conversation. Just gone."
</p>
<p>
"I've also removed the download link even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space continued in the video itself. "But I think it's smarter to get out in front of them rather than waiting for their email that will never come... So why did they remove my video?... Well, my guess is that the map is probably a little too accurate.""
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-map-in-gta-5-mod-suffers-inevitable-take-two-takedown-creator-believes-it-was-probably-a-little-too-accurate-and-could-have-ruined-the-surprise">follow-up interview with IGN</a>, Dark Space admitted he'd anticipated Take-Two might respond the way it did based on previous mod takedowns. "I went into this project knowing it was a possibility," he explained, "and the fact that it happened does not surprise me."
</p>
<p>
"I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get," he continued. "If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two has long been at loggerheads with the GTA modding community, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">shutting down the Liberty City Preservation Project</a> - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of GTA 4's map to GTA5. In 2023, however, it hired Cfx.re - the team behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">RDR2</a> RedM mods (and another group that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-bans-gta5-modders-who-made-their-own-multiplayer">previously faced Rockstar's wrath</a>) - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-enhanced-official-modding-utility-is-on-its-way">currently working on an official "conversion tool"</a> to bring GTA 5 mods into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">recently released PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for GTA 6, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">still targeting the autumn 2025 release window previously announced by Take-Two</a>, despite persistent reports of a delay - although a third-party accessories company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recently claimed the PC version won't arrive until early next year</a>.
