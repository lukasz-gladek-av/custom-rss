            <p>Katsuhiro Harada, has announced his departure from Bandai Namco having worked on the Tekken series for 30 years.</p>
<p>"I'd like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025," he wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I've devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas. I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.</p>
<p>"The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator. Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the centre of my identity. And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars. Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi - whom I respect as though he were another father - and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p><p>"Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects - VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</p>
<p>"To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>"I'll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything."</p>
<p>If you've been following Harada's outspoken comments over the past few years, this may not come as much of a surprise: the Tekken boss has made a few suggestions that his future may not rest within the walls of the Japanese publisher. First up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">he had a 'looking for work' tag on his LinkedIn page</a>, leading people to speculate that he was looking for the door in his current place of work.</p><p>Then, earlier this year, Harada spoke to Eurogamer about what a future without him would look like at Bandai Namco. "[I] feel over the past 30 years the gameplay has been polished and everything is in place, so it's much easier to continue with someone else," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekkens-harada-isnt-worried-about-his-future-absence-damaging-the-series-wont-be-hard-to-continue-with-someone-else">he told Connor Makar at Evo 2025</a>. "[Producer Michael Murray and I are] public figures for Tekken, sure. Compared to other people outside of the company - and this is [my] personal opinion not the official stance of Bandai Namco - it really depends [on the game]. There are other games out there - even fighting games - where there is no public figure to attach to it."</p>
<p>In the same interview, Murray also mentioned that he may have 'only one Tekken game left in him', so it feels like there could be a potential shift in the franchise as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> continues to grow and people start to think about what Tekken 9 (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> 3) could look like.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been the source of a lot of controversy ever since launch. Alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-receives-emergency-patch-in-response-to-season-two-balancing-backlash">a series of emergency patches</a> that had to be issued by the developer to appease irritated fans, there was also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-reneges-on-its-controversial-dlc-rollout-but-is-it-too-little-too-late">a glut of controversy</a> surrounding the game and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-street-fighter-6-monetization-hurdle">its DLC methods</a>, which Harada - in typical fashion - was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-community-up-in-arms-over-plans-to-add-premium-currency-to-game-post-launch">very outspoken about</a>.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about the game losing its identity without the dynamic, public-facing duo, fret not: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> was the first game in the series for years that didn't include much input from Yoshinori Ono, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-figurehead-yoshinori-ono-leaves-capcom-after-nearly-30-years">who also left Capcom after 30 years with the company</a>. Street Fighter 6 has been a massive success, however, proving that there is life in these storied fighting games - even without the notable figureheads leading the charge with the crowd-facing side of development.</p>

            <p>The European Top 20 didn't welcome any new entries last week, but Black Friday week saw a boost in sales nonetheless thanks in no small part to Sony, which was seemingly the MVP of Black Friday, hoovering up 62 percent of all console sales in the UK over the week.</p>
<p>The data – supplied by NielsenIQ and GSD, and published by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> – showed that console sales were much stronger this holiday period, with revenue up 14 per cent, and unit sales up 7 percent.</p>

<p>And while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> took a sizeable 23 percent chunk of all hardware sales, it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> that had its best week outside of launch. Xbox Series S and X accounted for just 10 percent of all console sales, possibly because Xbox consoles were discounted by around 8 percent on the typical price, but PS5 Slim consoles were down 21-34 percent depending upon the model.</p>
<p>Accessory sales, however, were down 17 percent when compared to the same period last year, as did joypad  and headset sales, which tumbled by 27 and 28 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>And while both the Meta Quest 3 and the PS5 VR headsets enjoyed their best weeks of the year, overall, VR headset sales dropped by around 7 percent, too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida-admits-it-would-be-difficult-for-japanese-developers-to-make-games-in-the-same-way-mihoyo-does">Japanese studios "can't replicate" the speed at which games are produced in China</a>, suggesting Chinese studios can hire more people "who can work long hours".</p>
<p>"Back when I talked to representatives of miHoYo, we discussed how it would be quite difficult for Japanese developers to make games in the same way miHoYo does. Not to mention the legal problems that would come with it," Yoshida said.</p>

            <p>UK developer Three Fields Entertainment - the studio behind the likes of Dangerous Golf and Dangerous Driving - says it has been "forced" into placing its "entire team on notice of redundancy" because publisher THQ Nordic has shown no "enthusiasm or financial support to continue development" of its latest title, Wreckreation.</p>
<p>Three Fields Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dangerous-driving-devs-wreckreation-is-an-open-world-racer-with-a-diy-focus">unveiled Wreckreation back in 2022</a>. A custom-content-focused open-world racer, it released on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox in October this year. Now, however, in a heartfelt message posted to X/Twitter, CEO Fiona Sperry said that it was "a heartbreaking moment for all of us", but hoped that by going public, "someone out there might also see the potential" in Wreckreation.</p>

<p>"Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard – with heart and dedication – to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project," Sperry wrote.</p>
<p>"But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future.</p> <div>

<p>"We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post-launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful."</p>
<p>Because of claims it has had to self-fund, Sperry added that the studio cannot be sustained and it "will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future," (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/wreckreation-developer-puts-its-entire-staff-on-notice-as-publisher-thq-nordic-abandons-it-we-simply-cannot-sustain-the-studio-in-its-current-form/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>

<p>After Skybound was reportedly unable to provide evidence of the line items to a third-party auditor, 8bit has now filed a breach-of-contract complaint with the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p>In the complaint seen by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/iam8bit-is-suing-skybound-game-studios-alleging-fraud-and-theft-of-designs-000822886.html">Engadget</a>, iam8bit similarly claims that after designing promotional materials for the launch of Stray, Skybound used iam8bit's materials to secure its own deal for the Nintendo Switch port, intentionally cutting the latter out while using "almost exact copies" of 8bit's marketing materials.</p>
<p>Iam8bit also claims Skybound used confidential information about 8bit's royalty split with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> to cut it out of the deal.</p>
<p>In all, iam8bit is suing for breach of contract, fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation. It's seeking real and punitive damages totalling $4 million. Neither company has publicly commented on the lawsuit.</p>
