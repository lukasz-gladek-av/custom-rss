            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a>'s development team has issued an apology following a recent and poorly received update to the game, which led to an influx of negative feedback on Steam.</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki - a cute and colourful dress up game with gacha elements - released towards the end of last year, offering players the opportunity to partake in some cosy RPG fun. However, while the free to play game was well received on its initial launch, things have since soured.</p>
<p>On 28th April, the developer released Version 1.5 or "Bubble Season" for Infinity Nikki. This update was meant to add things such as new challenge levels, tasks and gameplay features, but it also added a number of bugs which included players being unable to start the game on PS5, meaning it had to be redownloaded completely. Other issues included crashes and Nikki not moving, to name but two. Meanwhile, the developer retconned Infinity Nikki's story, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4bFJK5BZ2E">in the words of one player</a>, "dived deep into scummy monetisation practices" with this update.</p>

<p>When the update went live, the game recieved a number of negative Steam reviews. And now, two weeks down the line, the team has issued an apology to its community, adding it has "decided to extend Version 1.5's end date to ensure greater stability and prevent similar issues from recurring" in the game.</p>
<p>"We're acutely aware that these recent issues have impacted your experience and damaged the trust and affection you've placed in us. To all stylists, we offer our deepest apologies," <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1923937697745469653">the developer wrote on social media</a>.</p>
<p>The Infinity Nikki studio continued: "Throughout the development journey since launch, we've faced a multitude of challenges and uncertainties. From optimising performance across diverse devices with varying capabilities to tackling unexpected technical roadblocks, many of these hurdles were unprecedented for our team.</p>
<p>"Rather than offering premature communication, we chose to tackle these problems methodically - responding to your expectations only once we had secured concrete solutions.</p>
<p>"But rest assured, we've heard your feedback loud and clear."</p>
<p>It went on to clarify that the Threads of Reunion storyline's absence in this version of Infinity Nikki was "never intended as a removal" from the game's narrative, and its associated outfit remains on the development roadmap.</p>
<p>"Due to technical hurdles in Version 1.5, we were unable to properly refine the introduction of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> chapter and the narrative setup for Threads of Reunion, which regrettably led to confusion," it said.</p>
<p>"These elements are planned for future updates. Plans are underway to expand tiered cumulative top-up rewards in upcoming versions; new gameplay systems will undergo rigorous design scrutiny to ensure seamless integration into the open-world experience and lore consistency. On top of that, adaptation, performance, and stability issues across various platforms (including PS) have been identified and are being resolved systematically."</p>
<p>Other "adjustments" are also being discussed, the studio said. "Some changes require extended development cycles, but we commit to implementing them through phased updates. We will share progress once plans solidify and milestones are reached. In the meantime, we humbly ask for your continued patience and trust."</p>

<p>The studio additionally clarified "the delay arrangements, compensation plan, and key optimisation priorities", which are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Extension &amp; Adjusted Event Schedules</strong></p>
<p>Due to version scheduling adjustments, Version 1.5 "Bubble Season" will be extended until June 12 (UTC-7).</p>
<p><strong>Version Timelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Version 1.5 End Date: June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7)</li>
<li>Version 1.6 Launch Date: June 12, 2025, 20:00:00 (UTC-7)</li>
</ul>
<p>*The maintenance schedule of Version 1.6 may be adjusted based on actual conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of the following Bubble Season events is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7): [Chase the Bubbles!], [Rainbow Album], [Where Are the Gifties?], [Floating Bubbles], [Rainbow and Pattern], and [Adventure Together].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Store:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of [Pear-Pal Selected/Store: Clothing] is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Other Version 1.5 Adjustments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of Version 1.5 [Mira Journey] is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The limited-time items in [Starlit Shop] will be removed on June 12 at 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weekly Tasks "Starlit Pursuit" Delay Notice:</strong></p>
<p>After Version 1.5 launched, we received extensive feedback on co-op features and gameplay. Based on this, we are optimising related systems, and the new weekly tasks [Starlit Pursuit], originally scheduled for May 20 (UTC-7), will now debut in Version 1.6. This delay allows us to refine task mechanics for a smoother experience. Additional details will be announced at a later dateâ€”please stay tuned.</p>
<p>In light of this change, 360 [Starlit Crystals] will be given to all players as compensation. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every stylist for your understanding and continued support.</p>

<p>The development team said it recognised its communication efforts "may not meet every stylist's expectations", and it is therefore launching a new initiative known as Miraland Round Table. This will allow players to share feedback with the Infinity Nikki team via email (include the keyword [Table Advisor] in the email's subject line and send it to the support team at <a href="mailto:infinitynikki_cs@infoldgames.com">infinitynikki_cs@infoldgames.com</a>) or in-game via the Customer Service tab.</p>
<p>These channels will be prioritised, the Infinity Nikki team said, but added it will still continue to monitor feedback elsewhere as well.</p>
<p>"All collected input - past and present - will be compiled, with key issues receiving direct responses. Your candid feedback - both critical and encouraging - has prompted deep reflection. Drafting this message stirs mixed emotions: guilt over delayed promises, yet gratitude for your unwavering support," the developer said, offering compensation in the form of in-game Diamonds and Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>"Thank you for standing with us," it closed. "Together, we'll make Infinity Nikki shine brighter than ever!"</p>

<p>Recent changes aside, Jessica Orr had good things to say about the game on its release, calling it a "true step forward for open-world gacha games" that "finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly", in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">Eurogamer's Infinity Nikki review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
