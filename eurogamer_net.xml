            <p>The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> update, released last night, accidentally introduces a few new issues - including chickens that mysteriously disappear.</p>
<p>The 1.6.9 update - which was released alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-version-16-console-release-date">1.6 for consoles</a> - adds a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-latest-update-adds-a-new-friend-to-retrieve-lost-items-and-more">new friend to retrieve lost items and more</a>. However, there have been some cases of players losing their chickens when they start a new farm on the Meadowlands farm and open the door to the coop on the first day.</p>
<p>Stardew Valley creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has said that a fix for this, for the time being at least, is to make sure players leave the door to the coop "closed for one day". Then - not that he needed to but I love that he has - <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514">Barone</a> blamed the chickens' disappearance on a "wild coyote" nosing about the farm on day one. What a cheeky blighter (the coyote, not Barone).</p>
<p>Barone has already released a patch - known as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/413150/view/4445708897933590775?l=english">Update 1.6.10</a> - on Steam and GOG that addresses the rogue chickens, as well as some crashes. This update will arrive on other platforms "as soon as possible", Barone said.</p>

<p>So, after all this is sorted, what is next for Barone? Earlier this year, the creator admitted he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">hadn't actually touched his next game - Haunted Chocolatier - "in a long time"</a>, because his focus had been on Stardew Valley.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was first announced back in 2021</a>, with a cute trailer showing off its spooky chocolate-making, monster-stabbing, small town-living role-playing gameplay. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone previously said he's "not too concerned with the pressure" of releasing Haunted Chocolatier</a>, saying, "it's better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".</p>

            <p>
Nintendo has lowered its sales projections for Switch hardware and software, as the company faces one final Christmas focused on its current, aging platform.
</p>
<p>
Switch hardware sales were down 31 percent year-on-year for the three months ending 30th September. The company has now cut its total Switch sales forecast for the financial year to 12.5m, down from the 13.5m it expected previously.
</p>
<p>
After more than seven years on sale, the Switch stands at 146.04m units sold, just 8m shy of the Nintendo DS, the company's best-selling gaming device.

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, released just before the end of September, shifted 2.58m copies before the end of that month. 
</p>
<p>
Other recent releases to sell over a million copies include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/paper-mario-2-thousand-year-door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> (1.94m) and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/luigis-mansion-2-hd">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> (1.57m).
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, the Switch's evergreen bestseller, sold another 1.37m copies, and remains by some margin the console's best-selling game. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's final sales update of 2024 paints a picture of a company on the cusp of announcing much-needed new hardware - though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-year-fiscal-year">provided no new word on when that announcement might arrive</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo eventually ends up calling it, is expected to finally launch in 2025 and will be announced before the end of March.

            <p>If you were expecting to hear more about Nintendo's next console, which has been dubbed '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>', during today's latest financial report from the company, I am sorry I am going to have to disappoint you. The company has made no new announcements regarding its Switch successor.</p>
<p>It does still plan to share more on its next console before the end of this fiscal year, however. That all remains the same.</p>
<p>Following the release of the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241105_5e.pdf">latest earnings report</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa affirmed the next console will be announced by the end of March, 2025.</p>

<p>It seems unlikely that this announcement will happen before the end of the calendar year, however. According to Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda, making a new console announcement before January "has gotten quite difficult" for Nintendo, he told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/">Reuters</a>. "You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season," Yasuda reasoned.</p><p>We got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">official confirmation of Switch 2's existence back in May</a>, when Furukawa first said the company planned on sharing more on the upcoming console "this fiscal year". At this time, Furukawa tempered expectations, adding we would not be hearing any more about the Switch successor during its then scheduled summer Nintendo Direct.</p>
<p>But, while we don't have an official look at the console, we know developers are now openly working on games for it. Meanwhile, several announcements recently have suggested games are coming to Nintendo's future hardware, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yooka-laylee-remaster-headed-to-ps5-xbox-and-nintendo-platforms-so-switch-2">Yooka-Replaylee</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-gets-first-confirmed-release-in-my-time-at-portia-sequel">My Time At Evershine</a>.</p>
<p>It was once said Nintendo wanted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-successor-reportedly-due-late-2024">launch Switch 2 in late 2024</a>. Plans have, evidently, now shifted, and a report in August suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Nintendo's next console won't launch before April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere during last night's financial report, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-as-the-wait-for-new-hardware-continues">Nintendo revised down its expectations for total Switch console and game sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
