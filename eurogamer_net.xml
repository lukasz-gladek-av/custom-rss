            <p>Tonight, 6th November 2026, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> published its latest financial report, and it had some pretty large revelations about the upcoming game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. The headline news: instead of launching on 26th May, 2026, the game has been pushed back about half a year to 19th November, 2026. This has also been <a href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1986540361011880167">confirmed by tweets</a> from the offical <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> social media accounts.
</p>
<p>Per Take-Two, this delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">This isn't the first delay</a> the game has seen this year. Back in May, it was confirmed that the game had slipped from its previous release date into May 2026.</p>
<p>As a result of this news, we're already starting to see Take-Two stock plummet. The story broke about 9pm UK time, and as of 9.35pm stock has dropped by a massive 8% (see image below). In real terms, that means Take-Two stock is down about $30.</p>

<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">has spoken to IGN</a> about the delay: "We've had more time to develop the title. And so we are getting closer to the release. We are grateful that it is still within the same fiscal year. And mostly we’re grateful to Rockstar for constantly seeking perfection.
</p>
<p>"We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach."</p>
<p>It seems both investors and the general public don't share this same sense of optimism, as stock continues to fall as I'm writing this story.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on its new date of 19th November. And there's little doubt it's going to be big, even with this new set-bacK: Take-Two confirmed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.
