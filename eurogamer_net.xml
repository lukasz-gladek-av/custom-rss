            <p>Visions of Mana director Ryosuke Yoshida has departed NetEase to assume a new position with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement on X/Twitter, Yoshida thanked NetEase and his development team for their support, but confirmed he quit the Chinese megacorp at the end of October and will join Square Enix in December.</p>
<p>Whilst Yoshida had been employed at NetEase subsidiary Ouka Studios, Visions of Mana was published by Square Enix - the company he has now joined.</p>

<p>"On a personal note, I quit NetEase Ouka Studios on October 31st. We were a new studio, but we were able to release Visions of Mana. I am grateful to the development team and NetEase for their support," Yoshida wrote (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1863447158667514060">Knoebel</a>).</p>
<p>It was a very good experience. Thank you all. I am happy to announce that I joined Square Enix in December.</p>

<p>Yoshida stopped short of revealing what position he will take on at Square Enix, or what game or franchise he may be working on.</p>
<p>The news comes after Ouka Studios <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-developer-ouka-studios-reportedly-set-to-close-days-after-games-release">had "all but a handful of jobs" cut</a> by parent company NetEase.</p>
<p>Ouka Studios opened in 2020 and hired staff from the likes of Capcom and Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner">NetEase told Eurogamer it remained committed to "a strong global presence"</a> despite pulling funding from Worlds Untold, the studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> veteran Mac Walters, and just days after fellow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-director-casey-hudsons-aaa-sci-fi-game-cancelled-studio-closing">BioWare veteran Casey Hudson announced the closure of his own new studio</a> due to similar funding issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
