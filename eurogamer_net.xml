<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will return to the world of The Walking Dead by offering up a cache of assets for players and developers to go build themed mini-games with.
</p>
<p>
Characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins. This latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan - responsible for perhaps the series' most grisly moment - as a skin next. 
</p>
<p>
Negan's baseball bat Lucille is among the items from the franchise being added as props to Fortnite. A selection of comic book-inspired walkers (zombies) will also be included. Additionally, you'll be able to switch on a post-processing effect to make in-game experiences have more of a comic book-style effect.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sB3hyiahKE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
In a press release, Epic Games said it hoped the assets would inspire The Walking Dead "role-playing survival RPGs, prison escape roguelikes, and chaotic free–for-all shoot 'em ups" to be made in Fortnite.
</p>
<p>
As with previous licenses, such as Lego, creators of user-made experiences agree to share 12 percent of Fortnite's engagement payout with the owner of the property - in this case, Skybound.
</p>
<p>
In other Fortnite news, today's latest update to the game has included files relating to Sabrina Carpenter (as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1904507845845885343">prolific Fortnite leaker ShiinaBR</a>), all but confirming the Espresso-loving popstar as the next icon set to take centre stage in the game's Guitar Hero-esque Fortnite Festival mode.

<p>
Previous stars such as Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg have become available as skins in-game alongside their arrival as the next Fortnite Festival headliner, with a season pass for the mode that includes a selection of digital instrument cosmetics and music tracks by the artist. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, today brings the launch of Fortnite OG Season 3. This takes the classic version of Fortnite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-scrambling-to-solve-the-mystery-of-fortnites-looming-meteor">into the era of the meteor</a> - now, incredibly, seven years ago.

<p>You can check out the full PS5 changelog below, as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">laid out by Sony</a> itself.</p>
<ul>
<li>We've made it simpler to view details about activities.</li>

<p>Meanwhile, while we may now be in the PS5 generation, Sony is still issuing updates for PS4.</p>
<p>The latest PS4 update, system software update 12.50, is more typical of the stability updates Sony likes releasing to patch various exploits used to modify or jailbreak consoles. The patch notes are short and very to the point.</p>
<p>"We've improved the messages and usability on some screens," reads a post on PlayStation.com.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ps3-gets-new-system-software-update-19-years-after-release">Sony also released an update for its PS3</a>, a console which is now old enough to buy itself a pint down at the pub here in the UK.</p>

            <p>
A Japanese shrine famous to video game fans has announced a ban on visits by tourists, following an "unforgivable act of disrespect".
</p>
<p>
In 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-fans-crowdfund-repairs-to-typhoon-hit-island">Ghost of Tsushima players helped the Tsushima Watatzumi Shrine shrine raise 27m yen (£192k)</a> to repair its Torii gate, after it was destroyed in a typhoon. The crowdfunding campaign ultimately raised 500 per cent of its original target.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, the Watazumi Shrine has announced a total ban on tourist visits, after an incident occured earlier this week on 23rd March described only as "a grave and unforgivable act of disrespect committed by foreigner(s)".

<p>
Further details of the incident have not been released, though a message on the Watazumi Shrine's social media accounts states that, going forward, only worshippers will be allowed entrance.
</p>
<p>
Unacceptable behaviour by tourists at the Watazumi Shrine is nothing new, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-shrine-once-repaired-thanks-to-ghost-of-tsushima-fans-bans-all-tourists-after-unforgivable-act-of-disrespect/">Automaton reports</a>, and a previous, controversial ban had seen South Korean visitors barred, after incidents of vandalism and abuse directed towards staff.
</p>
<p>
Now, all tourists - domestic and foreign - are banned.
</p>
<p>
"Inbound tourism's destruction of places, things, and people cherished by the Japanese is nothing less than the destruction of Japanese culture," the shrine's message states. 
</p>
<p>
"Those who consider this place a theme park or simply a photogenic location are not worshippers."
</p>
<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-detailed-includes-destructible-shrine-changes-after-concern-over-copycats">Assassin's Creed Shadows quietly released an update that reduced the amount of destruction possible by players in the game's version of shrines</a>, after pre-release footage of a player causing damage sparked concern.

            <p>If you are hoping to see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> move over to Nintendo's consoles on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>'s release, well developer Pocketpair would absolutely consider it. That's even despite the studio's legal dispute with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough">IGN</a> at GDC, Pocketpair's communications director John 'Bucky' Buckley revealed the team would have happily seen its monster-catching survival game on the OG Switch as well, but due to how "beefy" Palworld is, it wasn't able to find a home on Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>This may change for Switch 2, though, providing the next generation of Nintendo's consoles has the ability to handle the chonky game.</p>

<p>When asked about Palworld releasing on Switch 2, Bucky said the developer doesn't know the hardware specs yet. "Like everyone else, we're waiting. I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them," Bucky said.</p>
<p>He added that should the specs be "beefy enough" for Palworld, then "it's 100 percent worth considering" a Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>"We did a lot of optimisation for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with," Pocketpair's communications director continued. "Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned! As for when we may hear more about those mysterious Switch 2 specs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo has a dedicated showcase for its upcoming console scheduled for next week</a>.</p>

<p>Ever since Palworld was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a>. In fact, Palworld was dubbed  'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release last year, and soon after its debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a>.</p>
<p>In September, Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a>, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, Pocketpair has released a game on Nintendo Switch. In January of this year, the <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/">developer's real-time roguelike deck builder Overdungeon arrived on the Switch store in Japan</a>, having previously been available via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
