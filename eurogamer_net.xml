            <p>
An advert released to promote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has been banned after the UK's Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints that it "trivialised sexual violence" following an investigation.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in a <a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/activision-blizzard-uk-ltd-g25-1319083-activision-blizzard-uk-ltd.html">ruling shared on the regulator's website</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/call-of-duty-advert-banned-in-the-uk-for-trivialising-sexual-violence-">Game Developer</a>), the advert - which began airing on YouTube and Video on Demand channels last November - focused on an airport security check where two security officers were, according to dialogue, "Off playing the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 7." Standing in for the officers were two "replacers".
</p>
<p>
"A male member of the public was then shown to be passing through the metal detector," the ASA description continues. "A male security officer said, 'You've been randomly selected to be manhandled – face the wall!' and turned the man around. The female security officer was then shown to be licking her teeth while picking up a prescription container and shaking it, before showing it to the male officer who winked back at her.
</p>
<p>
"The male officer then told the man, 'I'm gonna need you to remove your clothes, everything but the shoes.' The woman then put on a pair of gloves and said, 'Time for the puppet show!' A post-credit scene showed the male officer putting a hand-held metal detector in the man's mouth and said, 'Bite down on this, she's going in dry.'" 
</p><p>
The ASA says it received a total of 11 complaints about the advert. Nine believed it "trivialised sexual violence" and "challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and offensive", while two believed the ad "encouraged or condoned drug use" and "challenged whether the ad was irresponsible".
</p>
<p>
During the ASA's investigation, Activision Blizzard UK told the regulator the advertisement had been reviewed by Clearcast (a non-governmental organisation which pre-approves British TV advertising) which gave it an "ex-kids" timing restriction, meaning it could not be broadcast during or around children's programming or content likely to appeal to under-16s.</p>
<p>Activision also argued the ad "depicted a deliberately implausible, parodic scenario that bore no resemblance to real airport security procedures" and that previous ASA rulings "recognised that ads containing obviously absurd or parodied scenarios reduced the likelihood of being interpreted literally or being viewed as behaviour to emulate."</p>
<p>Addressing complaints of "trivialised sexual violence", the publisher insisted the advert "did not sexualise the act of performing searches and contained no implication that the acts were sexual in nature." It similarly argued the ad did "not depict illegal drugs or misuse of prescription medication."
</p><p>
Despite Activision's assertions, however, the ASA noted that while the advert contained no explicit imagery and while "most viewers would understand the ad was intended to be humorous", the humour was "generated by the humiliation and implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration of the man, an act associated with sexual violence." It also felt that the officers' "confident and joking demeanour presented this [act] in a humorous manner."</p>
<p>"Because the ad alluded to non-consensual penetration, and framed it as an entertaining scenario," the regulator concluded, "we considered that the ad trivialised sexual violence and was therefore irresponsible and offensive." However, it did not uphold complaints regarding drug use, determining the advert was "unlikely to be understood as encouraging or condoning drug use" and was therefore "not irresponsible on that basis."
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the ASA ruled - as a result of the upheld complaints - that the Call of Duty advert "must not appear again in its current form". Activision Blizzard UK was also told to ensure its ads were "socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, for example by trivialising sexual violence". At present, the airport security spot is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH1csdj8oMk">viewable as a video on the official Call of Duty channel</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, the upcoming entry in Konami's legendary horror series, looks to be a console launch exclusive on the PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>This stems from <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/townfall/us/en/">the game's official website</a>, on which only three platforms are listed: Steam, the Epic Games Store, and PS5. There's no mention at all of the Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, or older consoles.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-proper-look-at-silent-hill-townfall">recently got a story trailer</a> revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony's State of Play</a>, showcasing the Scottish town of St. Amelia. Developed by Glasgow-based Screen Burn, it follows the tale of SImon Ordell as he navigates the mysterious town with his CRTV, a small electronic device he seems glued to for better or worse.</p>
<p>The game also got a further explanation courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw">a Silent Hill Transmission</a> hosted by Konami on the 12th February. This gave a further look on how the game will work, its mechanics and story, by the developers at Screen Burn.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">The game was first announced back in 2022</a>, and is one of multiple big SIlent Hill projects that have seen the light of day recently. Obviously there was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">was a great release from Bloober Team</a>, but also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">which also stole the hearts of many horror fans</a>.</p>

            <p>The long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">remake of the first Witcher game</a> is seemingly on the back-burner as CD Projekt Red has reportedly added support studio Fool's Theory to the massive development effort of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. Moreover, there have been recurring <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">rumours of an all-new Witcher 3 DLC</a> made by the same studio. Meanwhile, original lead story designer Artur Ganszyniec has been revisiting Geralt of Rivia's first big RPG adventure, giving longtime fans all-new insights into the game's making.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@artur-ganszyniec">Ganszyniec's YouTube channel</a> already houses his complete playthrough of the game with valuable commentary, so we highly recommend diehards to slowly chew through it if they have the time. That said, the story designer's most shocking revelation (hat tip to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/that-was-a-mistake-i-think-the-witcher-1s-lead-writer-says-the-story-team-didnt-know-about-its-twist-ending/">VGC</a>) came near the very end, during the 26th and final episode of the series, which you can watch below:</p> <figure>

<p>At the 1:30:22 mark, once the 'artwork cutscene' in line with the rest of the game's ends, he talks about what happened between the story team and the rest of the studio. Apparently, a final CG cutscene (which is part of the game as we all know it) was added without the team knowing it. "That's where we wanted the game to end, with an open question and open future... But while we were finishing the game, someone decided – the board decided or Michał Kiciński (co-founder of CDPR) decided – that we needed an animated outro for the game," Ganszyniec says.</p>
<p>The CG cutscene introduced the idea of Witchers that are hunting down kings, which led directly into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings</a>. "The script for what we're seeing now, this animation, was created not really involving the story team. It was sort of... we weren't really paying attention," the lead story designer adds before elaborating on what the story team's original plans were. "That's why the second Witcher is very political and there's not really room for exploring who Geralt is, his family, his history and stuff like this." If you've played through the entire Geralt trilogy, the shift is obvious, but having more clarity on what went down behind the scenes definitely helps after all these years.</p><p>Regardless, even Ganszyniec concludes he's excited to see how the remake turns out. As for the different route The Witcher 2 took, it could be argued <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</a> went back to a more personal story with Geralt and his family at the centre of a high-stakes epic.</p>
