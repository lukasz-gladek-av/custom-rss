            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft has inserted a stub about its wider business statistics and annual fiscal performance in the description of a recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> update trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer, which showcases the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-will-get-third-person-mode-in-free-update-ahead-of-new-film">free third-person update coming to Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> ahead of the launch of the upcoming films. Slapped into the video description is a section titled "About Ubisoft", which goes on to note various IPs and the Ubisoft Plus subscription service.</p>
<p>This is an odd thing to find in a video description for a game update, especially on a consumer-facing video. Typically, this sort of info stub is written directly for those on dedicated business pages, investor information blogs, and the like.</p>

<p>The full section reads as follows: "Ubisoft is a creator of worlds, committed to enriching players’ lives with original and memorable entertainment experiences. Ubisoft’s global teams create and develop a deep and diverse portfolio of games, featuring brands such as Assassin’s Creed®, Brawlhalla®, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>®, Far Cry®, Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon®, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/just-dance">Just Dance</a>®, Rabbids®, Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six®, The Crew® and Tom Clancy’s The Division®.</p>
<p>"With a Ubisoft+ subscription, players can access new releases, premium editions and extra content on Day One on PC, console and cloud. For the 2024-25 fiscal year, Ubisoft generated net bookings of €1.85 billion. To learn more, please visit: <a href="http://www.ubisoftgroup.com/">www.ubisoftgroup.com</a>."</p>
<p>That being said, now's the time for Ubisoft to start promoting its business acumen. The company took on a substantial amount of investment from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">to form a new business housing its most popular IPs</a>, following a low period for the French industry giant. This new business <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">recently revealed Charlie Guillemot as its head</a>, son of Ubisoft co-founder Yves Guillemot.</p>
<p>Statements from Ubisoft in recent days have also raised some eyebrows. The company suggested it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suggests-to-shareholders-a-new-ghost-recon-game-is-on-the-way-even-though-theres-been-no-public-announcement-yet"> working on a new Ghost Recon game to shareholders</a>, though no public announcement for any such game has been made yet. Ubisoft also stated it believes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reckons-microtransactions-help-make-games-more-fun-but-still-wants-to-ensure-they-respect-the-player-experience">microtransactions make games "more fun" in a recent financial report</a>.</p>
<p>All the while, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-moving-some-of-our-biggest-productions-into-2026-and-2027-after-positive-impact-of-assassins-creed-shadows-delay">Ubisoft has moved some of its bigger projects to 2026 and 2027</a> following the boons granted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadow's</a> delay. So the company is seemingly steering its way towards greener pastures than it found itself in over the past few years.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/for-some-bizarre-reason-ubisoft-has-planted-company-fiscal-info-a-trailer-for-its-new-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> actor Charlie Cox has vowed to play the game after all the praise he's received, despite only spending four hours in the recording booth and knowing very little about it.</p>
<p>The actor, known for his roles in Daredevil and Stardust, voices Gustave in Sandfall Interactive's well-praised RPG. But Cox hasn't played a game since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>.</p>
<p>"I remember being in the studio and thinking, 'this is beautiful, the visuals are extraordinary'," Cox said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHK8HD2scfY">Q&amp;A at GalaxyCon</a> in New Orleans. "They've come a long way since Mario 64, which is probably the last computer game I played."</p>

<p>Previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/daredevils-charlie-cox-feels-like-a-total-fraud-following-clair-obscur-expedition-33-praise">Cox revealed he recorded most of his lines for the game in a single four hour session</a> and now feels "like a total fraud". He reiterated this point at GalaxyCon after being confused by a fan question, as he's unfamiliar with the full game.</p>
<p>"I wanna play the game," he said. "I need to play the game. I need to get a console first, and then I need to play the game."</p>
<p>When the fan told him he did a fantastic job, he replied: "People keep telling me that and I feel like a fraud because I just did the voice."</p>

            <p>The voice actors for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Toad and Peach have been announced, following the surprise recasting of Samantha Kelly last month.</p>
<p>Back in June, Kelly - who had voiced Toad and Princess Peach for 18 years - revealed she would no longer be providing their vocals for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> era. This came as a surprise to Kelly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-voice-actor-confirms-shes-been-replaced-after-18-years-in-the-role">who was only informed by Nintendo when Mario Kart World released without her name attached to the project</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them," Kelly said at the time. "Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I'm sad that it's over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever."</p>
<p>Now, Toad and Peach's new voice actors have been revealed, and they are played by Paul Castro Jr. and Courtney Lin respectively. Castro Jr.has also lent his vocals to the likes of NEO: The World Ends with You, while Lin's previous credits include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a>.</p>

<p>Sharing the news, <a href="https://x.com/PaulCastroJr/status/1947503212095017462">Castro Jr. called the role of Toad a "childhood dream"</a>, adding he "can't thank Nintendo enough" for the opportunity.</p>
<p>Lin, meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/thecourtneylin/status/1947399822946013624">said she was "eternally grateful" to Nintendo for "trusting me to help carry the legacy of this icon"</a>. Lin also voiced Baby Peach in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"These characters are so much bigger than ourselves. I am so honoured and honestly can still hardly believe it. I have so much respect for all of the Peaches that came before me, especially the one I grew up with," Lin continued. "I will do my best with every opportunity I am given, and I hope you all have been enjoying the game. Wahooo!! Sweet."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been five years since artist Alexander "Red888guns" Berezin's efforts to reimagine the grim world of Fallout as a 3D Doom-style shooter had us wondering what a more substantial version of their vision might look like. And finally we have an answer thanks to a newly shared, and stunningly atmospheric, Fallout: Bakersfield trailer.
</p>
<p>
When Fallout: Bakersfield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-fallout-re-imagined-in-3d-looks-incredible">first came to our attention</a>, it was little more than an animated gif, presenting a vision of what Fallout's originally isometric universe - or more specifically, the ghoul city of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> (AKA Bakersfield, California) - might look like when presented using the first-person action and iconography of the original Doom. But since then, Red888guns has been turning that proof-of-concept into something closer to reality.
</p>
<p>
Two years later, Red888guns gave us our <a href="https://youtu.be/FMjJM9HAqqk?si=U1v0Vkd-651-5UWz">first progress update on the project</a>, improving on that once mostly static image with approximately ten seconds of footage featuring a player blasting their way through an enormously atmospheric slice of first-person action, built using the GZDoom Engine. And with a few more years having passed since then, we've finally been given another taste, and the results are more impressive than ever.

<p>
Red888guns' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e8WrmOibpM">latest Fallout: Bakersfield reveal</a> begins with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fr1KDYGkeo">nod to Fallout 1's trailer</a>, the camera slowly zooming out from an old-fashioned transistor radio (rather than the black and white television set) to reveal the surrounding ghoul-populated desolation of Bakersfield, all to the old-school warbling of the Ink Spots' I'd Climb The Highest Mountain.
</p>
<p>
From there, as the mood darkens, the trailer switches to a player-controlled first-person camera, initially as our jumpsuited protagonist quietly explores the filthy, decimated world, and next as they confront a group of gun-toting mutants using a blood-stained knife. After that there's some shooting, some classic Fallout fridge looting, and even a dialogue tree conversation with a big bad before things go seriously south.
</p>
<p>
Red888guns (who's also serving as an artist on developer New Blood's long-teased but still unannounced Fallout-inspired CRPG) is developing Fallout: Bakersfield alongside Denis Berezin, and a brief progress update at the end of the trailer reveals their non-commercial Doom 1993 total conversion is 60 percent complete. A heavily obfuscated release date is also seen, confirming it'll be out ??.??.202?. So mark your calendars as best you can.
</p>
<p>
Fallout, of course, has had something of resurgence in recent times, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">Amazon's well-received live-action TV adaptation</a>. Season two - which visits a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-leaks-give-first-look-at-new-vegas">much-loved location</a> - airs this December, and in the game itself, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">saw the release of the impressive Fallout: London</a>.
