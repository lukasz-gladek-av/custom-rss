            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/new-ecco-the-dolphin-game-on-the-way-reviving-the-mega-drive-icon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new Ecco the Dolphin game is in development, alongside remasters of the original two Mega Drive games.</p>
<p>The new game will have "contemporary play and GPU sensibilities" and has been revealed alongside a new countdown on the <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">game's website</a>. It's unclear if this is counting to a final release date or further news, but either way it's currently 8510 hours away - that's 354 days and 14 hours from now, which points to 25th April 2026.</p>
<p>News of a new entry was confirmed by series creator Ed Annunziata in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a>, as part of a celebration of Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.</p>

<p>Annunziata and the entire original team are behind both the remasters and the new project.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin was first released in 1992 for the Mega Drive and was followed by a sequel, The Tides of Time, in 1994.</p>
<p>Both games are 2D side-scrollers focused on the titular Ecco, who explores vibrant ocean environments with his sonar abilities. I still have my copy of the first game from when I was a kid: its shimmering oceans are gorgeous, but the puzzle gameplay gets very hard very quickly - not to mention its incredibly weird, alien story.</p>
<p>It's unknown yet if the new game will be 2D or 3D, but the original games were followed by the 3D Defender of the Future on the Dreamcast, though Annunziata wasn't involved with this one.</p>
<p>That game is not as well regarded and its proposed sequel was cancelled due to declining sales of the Dreamcast. Annunziata attempted to raise a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ecco-the-dolphin-creator-launches-kickstarter-for-spiritual-successor-the-big-blue">Kickstarter for a spiritual successor back in 2013</a>, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Speaking to Xbox Wire, Annunziata discussed the role of the gaming community in raising awareness about global issues.</p>
<p>"I feel gamers possess a higher than average IQ than the average human," he said. "Not only because they are frequently fully engaged and challenged mentally with real-time systems and information technology, but they are highly socially connected as well. Like the ocean, a gaming community is an ecosystem â€“ games like Ecco can and should be a conduit to join these realms.</p>
<p>"I have high expectations of gamers for all the above-stated reasons. But there is something else gamers possess that can make the difference, and that is love. A universal love of games and gaming gives us all something we all share, when games like Ecco reach the hearts of gaming communities, that love can really make things happen in the real world."</p>
<p>Back in January of this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/freshly-filed-sega-trademarks-hint-at-the-return-of-another-classic-series-25-years-after-its-last-entry">Sega filed a new trademark for Ecco the Dolphin</a>, hinting a new project was on the way.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another one of Microsoft's key franchises will arrive on PlayStation this year, via a revamped edition of the original Gears of War game.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded's announcement comes almost 20 years since the series first made its Xbox debut.</p>
<p>This modernised version of the original Gears of War will launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th August. It will cost $40, and also be available via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief. It will feature faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity", with the studios promising "clarity, smoothness, and immersion that matches the power of today's hardware", Microsoft has said.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date/">laid out in an Xbox post</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded players can expect the following enhancements on the game's release this summer:</p>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>Reloaded will also boast some platform specific features, and support cross-play and cross-progression.</p>

<p>Those who already own the digital version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a> will receive a free upgrade to Gears of War: Reloaded, but only if they purchased the game prior to this announcement. So, if you decide to plump for Gears of War: Ultimate Edition on Xbox now, you will not be eligible for that free upgrade when Reloaded releases.</p>
<p>"As we approach the 20th anniversary of Gears of War in 2026, we're reflecting on what this franchise means. It's about the stories we've told, the friendships we've built, and the unforgettable moments we've shared together," The Coalition studio head Mike Crump said yesterday. </p>
<p>"With Gears of War: Reloaded, we're opening that door to more players than ever."</p>

<p>The next new entry in the series will be Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>. </p>
<p>Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
