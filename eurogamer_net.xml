            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rollercoaster-tycoon">RollerCoaster Tycoon</a> Classic is heading to Switch at the start of next month.</p>
<p>As announced by Atari, the theme park sim will arrive on 5th December, with the Switch version joining its availability on mobile and PC.</p>
<p>The re-release pairs the original RollerCoaster Tycoon with its sequel, bringing updated UI and controls.</p>

<p>These two games are generally considered the best in the series, and even if they're showing their age, their simplicity is charming compared to more recent sim games.</p>
<p>Indeed, it's great timing from Atari just after the release of Frontier's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a>, a game with far more modern enhancements.</p>
<p>Atari is the sole publisher of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series, after<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-bought-rollercoaster-tycoon-3-for-7m"> acquiring the rights to the third game from Frontier</a> earlier this year. Atari boss Wade Rosen said at the time this would bring "new opportunities for Atari" and "benefits to the fans of games across the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise".</p>
<p>This Switch release of RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic (not the third game) is the only follow-up news so far, so it's unclear what's in store for the rest of the series.</p>
<p>For an alternative, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-theme-park-management-sim-parkitect-hits-playstation-and-xbox-this-week">Parkitect was released on PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> earlier this year, following its previous PC release. It's a classic take on the theme park sim genre, akin to RollerCoaster Tycoon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl developer GSC Game World has announced the game has already sold 1m copies in just a few days since release.</p>
<p>That figure does not include those who have taken to The Zone via Game Pass, meaning the game has been played by even more players.</p>
<p>"No wonder it feels a bit crowdy in the Zone," the Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl team wrote on social media platform X, announcing this sales figure.</p>

<p>"This is just the start of our unforgettable adventure," it continued. "The Heart of Chornobyl emanates stronger with each of us. Thank You, stalkers!"</p>
<p>The game got off to a strong start on Steam, where on its launch it peaked at 113,587 concurrent players. In the last 24 hours, that number has risen once again. At the time of writing, its all-time player peak on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1643320/charts/">Valve's platform</a> now sits at 117,928.</p><p>These sales figures and impressive player numbers are despite a number of bugs present in the game itself. The developer has already acknowledged there are a few issues, and earlier this week it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">assured players it will address any issues that arise in the game</a>, as and when it is able.</p>

<p>"In this heartfelt novella-like story of romance, newfound friend Fuddler needs a helping hand to express his feelings, and players join Snufkin and his best friend, Moomintroll, on a camping trip deep into the wilds before winter sets in," Raw Fury explains. "What should have been a relaxing excursion for two, turns into a chaotic and romantic journey, with many new and old friends."</p><p>As yet, there's no firm date on when we can expect Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley to hit these consoles (it's already out on Switch and Steam), but Raw Fury said it'll let people know "soon". Don't forget that standard physical editions are also now available, with a deluxe edition launching on 20th December.</p>
<p>"You can't throw a rock in Brighton without hitting a moomin. There are boutiques and galleries devoted to them," Chris Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snufkin-melody-of-moominvalley-review">Eurogamer's Snufkin: Melody of the Moominvalley review</a>, in which he awarded the "lovely" game four stars out of five.</p>
<p>"They're on our teacups and our beach towels. They're on plant pots by our windows and on the rough-papered covers of fancy Tove Jansson reprints stocking our libraries. It's not surprising that they've made it to video games, but it is surprising - to a moomin outsider, at least - to discover that the sort of thing that middle-class Southern idiots like me lap up so readily has a little bite to it. Snufkin: Melody of Moominvalley, a musical stealthy exploration game, is the best kind of surprise."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
