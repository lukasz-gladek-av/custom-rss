            <p>Forza Motorsport "is no more", according to a former employee at Turn 10 Studios, though the Horizon series will continue.</p>
<p>Fred Russell, who worked at the studio as content coordinator for four years until 2016, shared a post on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlfaMale164S/posts/pfbid02mgvk2jQz4X6qum7CiHzVn5YceHn7vHEzpWHYT1913tJBV8XCufKY8knnGjYTzgzbl">Facebook</a> with images from across his time working on the series. "Turn 10 Studios has shuttered the Forza Motorsport space and the team is no more," he said. "A very sad day for one of the best car racing video games. I loved my time there."</p>
<p>In a follow-up reply, Russell added: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> will continue at this point." Another reply from Russell states "the studio is open to support the Horizon sideâ€¦ shuttered the Forza Motorsport side only."</p>

<p>Though it's unclear officially how many have been laid off from Turn 10, losses include the likes of Business Operations Program Manager Jordy Ressler and content creator John Schommer, who worked at the studio for over a decade. "I'm very thankful for the 10 years I was able to be a face and voice for this brand and its awesome car loving community," replied Schommer on Russell's post.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft for clarification on the future of both the series and the studio.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">Microsoft laid off a reported 9,000 employees across the business</a>, including significant cuts from its gaming division. This included nearly 50 percent of Turn 10 being impacted by layoffs, according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier.</p>
<p>Other cuts included layoffs at Zenimax and King, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">cancellations of Rare's Everwild</a>, The Initiative's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark, and an unannounced Zenimax MMORPG</a>.</p>
<p>The Forza Motorsport series began in 2005 for the original Xbox, developed by Turn 10 and published by Microsoft. A sim racer to rival the likes of Gran Turismo, it spawned seven follow-up games in addition to the more casual spin-off Forza Horizon from Playground Games.</p>
<p>Over time, the Horizon games have outperformed the Motorsport series.</p>
<p>Playground Games, meanwhile, is now developing the eagerly anticipated next game in the Fable RPG series. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-fable-reboot-delayed-into-next-year">delayed earlier this year into 2026</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Joanna Dark actor Alix Wilton Regan has implored fans to use their voices to save Perfect Dark, after the game was cancelled by Microsoft earlier this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft announced a wave of layoffs across the company, with games such as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark reboot, a new Zenimax MMORPG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild all cancelled as a result</a>. At this time, Microsoft also shuttered Perfect Dark's studio, The Initiative.</p>

<p>Soon after, Joanna Dark's actor shared an image of her Perfect Dark character on <a href="https://x.com/AlixWiltonRegan/status/1940539481586913465">social media</a>, calling her "Resilient. Determined. Creative. Caring. Strong". Adding that her time working with The Initiative had been "an honour", Regan stated: "Agent Dark doesn't give up and neither should any of you.... like Joanna, we will all rise again."</p>
<p>Regan has now called for fans to "speak up if you wanna see Perfect Dark survive". In a <a href="https://x.com/AlixWiltonRegan/status/1941021209891909790">recent social media post</a>, the Joanna actor wrote that "a lot of people have been reaching out and floating this idea on my timeline, my phone and in my DMs, so I'm just gonna say it:</p>
<p>"I HOPE WE LIVE IN A NICE WORLD."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, actor Elias Toufexis - known for playing Adam Jensen in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series - says "thousands of dollars" he was expecting will now be lost due to the cancellation of Perfect Dark.</p>
<p>In his own <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/with_replies">post on social media</a>, Toufexis revealed he had "a good amount of days of acting in Perfect Dark" that got "scrapped" when Microsoft put an end to the reboot earlier this week.</p>
<p>"These games getting cancelled is a constant threat," Toufexis wrote, "..now every game I do as director or actor I wake up hoping it isn't cancelled."</p>
<p>In subsequent posts, the actor, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-sam-coe-and-andreja-actors-recorded-lines-for-the-player-character">who has also had roles in the likes of Starfield</a>, assured his followers that he does get paid for the days he works. "But when you're working on a game they 'hold' you for x amount of days each month. (so I can schedule work around other games and shows)," Toufexis elaborated.</p>
<p>"You can't help but look at the holds and think about the $ that would have been made."</p>

<p>Word of this week's layoffs at Microsoft - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">also impacted the likes of King, Raven Software and more</a> - first began last month, when a report stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">Xbox was set to restructure much of its central-European distribution</a>. At this time, Bloomberg described the then-upcoming redundancies as a "major restructuring", and the fourth case of layoffs to hit Xbox in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-laying-off-3-of-workforce-in-biggest-round-of-cuts-since-2023-report">Xbox cut three percent of its total workforce</a>, which at the time was the biggest loss of staff since 2023. Previously in September 2024, Xbox laid off 650 employees, which it said was to "organise our business for long term success".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/joanna-dark-actor-asks-fans-to-call-for-perfect-dark-to-be-saved-as-adam-jensens-actor-details-financial-loss-due-to-cancellation]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Destiny: Rising, the free-to-play mobile version of Bungie's long-running sci-fi shooter series, has been given a release date. It'll officially be whisking players away for some alternate-timeline shenanigans when it comes to Android and iOS on 28th August.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-neteast-unveil-free-to-play-mobile-shooter-destiny-rising-with-closed-alpha-coming-soon">last October</a>, Destiny: Rising is a collaboration between Bungie and Chinese publisher NetEase, and is officially described as a "shared world" adventure set in an "alternate Destiny timeline, exploring a narrative in the post-Dark Age era". It's a result of a partnership the two companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-moves-to-reassure-destiny-fans-after-securing-usd100m-for-new-game">initially announced</a> - albeit in vague terms - back in 2018.
</p>
<p>
After a period of closed alpha testing that began last November, Destiny: Rising is almost ready for its full launch, which'll see players - in the role of a "fully customisable" Lightbearer named Wolf - embarking on a sci-fi adventure stretching from the sanctuary of Haven to the "icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift."

<p>
Destiny's familiar looter-shooter action is said to remain at the heart of the experience, and there's talk of "dynamic and challenging" single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer gameplay, plus various open-world objectives, missions, strikes, PvP battles, and six-player PvE activities. That's alongside customisable Primary and Power Weapons, the ability for characters to share compatible weapons across their arsenal, a new Mythic rarity gear tier, and more.
</p>
<p>
In a bid to encourage pre-registrations ahead of Destiny: Rising's 28th August release, NetEase is holding a pre-launch event that'll provide special in-game bonuses to anyone that registers their interest ahead of time. More rewards unlock as new registration milestones are crossed, and if that sounds like the sort of thing you want to support, you should direct your attention to <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/c6f53fla">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/kxdnllj3">App Store</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Daddy Destiny (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, if you must), Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">recently announced its next major multi-year story arc</a>, the Fate Saga. It begins with a new paid expansion, titled The Edge of Fate, that arrives on 15th July alongside a free "core game update" for all players. Weirder is this year's second paid expansion, Renegades, which launches on 2nd December and promises to be "integral" to Destiny 2's new Fate Saga, despite its Star Wars theme.
