            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft boss Satya Nadella will earn a wallet-busting $79.1m (£60.9m) this financial year, up 63 percent on his compensation for 2023.
</p>
<p>
The huge boost to Nadella's pay in both cash and stock, announced by Microsoft last night, comes after a positive year overall for the company's financial revenues - but a turbulent 12 months for its employees.
</p>
<p>
2024 has seen two mass layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 staff laid off in January</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">a further 650 Xbox employees were shown the door</a> in September. 
</p>
<p>
Regardless, Microsoft's shares are up and the company's market value is now higher than $3tn, as it works to capitalise on the rise of AI. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">shut down three Bethesda gaming studios</a> in June - Arkane Austin, the now-external Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-concerned-over-layoffs-due-to-lack-of-industry-growth">Xbox boss Phil Spencer discussed a lack of overall growth in the console market</a>. 
</p>
<p>Writing in Microsoft's 2024 Annual Report, released last night, Nadella painted a rosier picture, however.</p>
<p>"We are bringing great games to more people on more devices," Nadella wrote. "With our acquisition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> King, which closed October 2023, we've added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1bn in lifetime revenue—from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, Diablo, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. 
</p><p>"And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love - where, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms."</p>
<p>That cross-platform publishing programme will continue over the next few months with the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> for PC and Xbox in December, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">PlayStation in February 2025</a>, with the expectation that other games will then follow. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"You just throw out accusations based on vibes and if you aren't doing that then it's just hilariously emotional takes like 'can't wait for you all to lose your jobs and go bankrupt'," Bucky wrote.</p>
<p>"If you're hyping a building full of people losing their jobs, then it's not an us problem, it's a you problem. These sorts of over-emotional takes are running rampant in the gaming scene these days, but the Palworld ones are particularly silly."</p><div>

<p>"The sad part is most of the directed hate on Palworld is bait. Some rando account that posts 24+ times a day and struggles to get 1000 views per post picks up Palworld as an easy target, gets a cosy half a mil off a low-effort 'PALWORLD IS SLOP' post and then milks it for a week," they added.</p>
<p>"If you hate Palworld, and I mean if you genuinely hate Palworld, then do yourself a favour and mute us on Twitter, hide the game on Steam, and stop thinking about it. Who wants to dedicate time and energy to things they don't like?</p>
<p>"Your hate serves only to upset yourself and feed grifters their views. Move on."</p>
<p>In response, iWill - who seemingly prompted Bucky's message with a viral post earlier this week <a href="https://x.com/iWillTheGamer/status/1849269224788602936">pointing out the similarities between Pals and Pokémon</a> - said, "I would like to state, I don't hate Palworld. Never played. Think its cool how they started the year off tbh. I personally just found this funny and never seen that 'Pal' before and made that comparison. Don't talk bad about Palworld. Please? They iight."</p>
<p>Following last month's shock announcement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo is suing Palworld maker Pocketpair</a> for the infringement of "multiple patents rights", an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ps5-release-finally-available-in-japan-despite-looming-nintendo-lawsuit">IP expert has claimed it's "exceedingly plausible"</a> Nintendo crafted its patent applications specifically to target Palworld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> almost upon us (or already upon us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-times">depending on your geographical location</a>), analysts have been weighing in on the impact it's likely to have on Xbox Game Pass, with some reckoning it could bring as many as 4m new members to Microsoft's subscription service, albeit at a cost of up to 6m sales.
</p>
<p>
Black Ops 6 will, of course, be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">first Call of Duty title to launch day one</a> on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, the move marking a critical test for Microsoft's subscription service strategy following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
And Black Ops 6's Game Pass launch will lead to a significant surge of new subscribers according to analysts<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m"> interviewed by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, albeit at the expense of game sales. Wedbush Securities managing director Michael Pachter, for instance, believes Microsoft will see between three and four million new members following Black Op 6's Game Pass launch, although he reckons the move could result in up to 6m lost sales, based on the idea 25 percent of Game Pass subscribers may have bought the game anyway.

<p>
Ampere's head games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls, meanwhile, was slightly less optimistic about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Game Pass allure, telling GamesIndustry.biz its introduction will likely only result in a 10 percent subscriber boost to Game Pass Ultimate - equating to approximately 2.5m members - while noting not all of those will be completely new users, given some will be upgrading from lower Game Pass tiers.
</p><p>
"Microsoft will be trading premium full-game sales in exchange for a bigger audience that can be monetised in-game instead," he continued, adding, "Call of Duty is increasingly a live-service game first and foremost that monetises strongly in-game". This fact alone, he noted, raises questions about "how [Black Ops 6 will be] monetised and whether there is a bigger onus on in-game monetisation compared to previous entries in the franchise."
</p>
<p>
"Nobody knows what Microsoft's expectations are for Game Pass growth past launch," Katan Games' Dr Serkan Toto added, "but if Black Ops 6 does not meet targets, things can become very grim very quickly. I also wonder if Black Ops 6 will be able to retain subscribers in the long run or if numbers will drop sharply again early next year, after the initial hype runs out."
</p>
<p>
And as for how Black Ops 6's Game Pass launch might impact PlayStation, given Sony has traditionally positioned itself as the primary place to play Call of Duty through its previous marketing and exclusivity deals with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, Harding-Rolls doubts the "longer-term audience on PlayStation will be significantly disrupted".
</p>
<p>
"Those who own both Xbox and PlayStation consoles may be swayed to play the game on Microsoft's devices," he explained, "but cross-platform play and multi-platform accounts mean this is not necessarily a permanent decision".
</p>
<p>
Expect Microsoft to be trumpeting numbers loudly if Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 proves to be the Game Pass success it's hoping for. The company most <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-game-pass-now-has-34m-fully-paid-subscribers">recently shared membership figures</a> back in February - for the first time since 2022 - reporting 34m "fully paid" subscribers, up from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pass-now-has-over-25-million-subscribers">25m members announced previously</a>. As for Black Ops 6 itself, the most interesting thing to come out of its launch so far is that some of its characters are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-your-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-characters-blue-make-sure-youve-disabled-high-contrast-mode">inadvertently turning blue</a>.

            <p>
Remember Balatro's free Friends of Jimbo collaboration update back in August, which saw the acclaimed poker-themed rogue-like adding a bunch of card cosmetics inspired by popular video games? Well it turns out there was more where that came from, and players can now adorned their desks with cameos from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>.
</p>
<p>
Balatro's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-free-collaboration-update-adds-the-witcher-vampire-survivors-among-us-more">original Friends of Jimbo update</a> gave players the option to swap out the game's usual Kings, Queens, and Jacks with characters from The Witcher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. So if fancied bolstering your deck with a beaming Jaskier, for instance, or a little red space-pal, then you were well and truly catered for.
</p>
<p>
And now, Balatro developer LocalThunk is doing it all again with the free Friends of Jimbo Pack 2, featuring cameos from The Binding of Isaac and Slay the Spire, alongside Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley. That means you can now set Johnny Silverhand as your ice-cool King, Isaac's Mother as your varicose-veined Queen, even Stardew Valley's general store manager Pierre as your Jack - with all 12 new card faces getting an airing in the trailer below.

<p>
And beyond that, there's not a lot more to report - other than the fact Balatro's free Friends of Jimbo Pack 2 update is available now on PC, PlayStation, Switch, Android, and iOS. As for what's next, LocalThunk previously confirmed he's working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">major free content update</a> - promising to "bring new ideas and strategies to the game" - that'll launch sometime next year.
</p><p>
And if you've yet to play the absurdly compelling Balatro, it's definitely work a look. Christian Donlan had good things to say about its rogue-like spin on poker in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">four star review</a> earlier this year, calling it, "So striking and so brilliantly constructed, and something that has given me such pleasure for the last week".
