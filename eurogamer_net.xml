            <p>Today's the day. After months and years of speculation about what Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> will be, today, it releases in the wild. You'll be able to get your mitts on it and tell us what you think. Are you as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-couple-of-hours-mario-kart-worlds-open-world-left-me-slightly-underwhelmed-but-is-there-more-to-it">excited by Mario Kart World</a> as the, um, world seems to be? What do you make of the Switch 2 upgrades for games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/welcome-tour-is-the-switch-2s-welcome-surprise-and-might-even-be-worth-your-8-quid">Is Welcome Tour really worth the Â£8 Nintendo is asking for</a>? And Will the Switch 2 launch go as smoothly and successfully as Nintendo hopes?</p>
<p>We'll be covering all aspects of the Switch 2 launch and gathering everything together here so you can see at a glance what's been going on. We'll be keeping an eye on any launch issues there may be, any launch stock there may be, and how the world is reacting to playing Nintendo's new machine. And that includes you - we want to hear what you think in the comments below.</p>
