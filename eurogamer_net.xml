            <p>
Silent Hill and Siren creator Keiichi Toyama has confirmed he and his team at Bokeh Game Studios is working it's next project, and it won't be a sequel to horror oddity Slitterhead.
</p>
<p>
Toyama shared the news in an <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/47230">interview with Famitsu</a> (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-creator-keiichiro-toyama-is-already-working-on-his-next-game-and-its-not-a-slitterhead-sequel/">Automaton</a>). "I can't reveal the exact details," he explained, "but we have started working on our next title... Once again, we have to pour in all our efforts as a studio and prove that we are up to the task... However, we're still in the beginning phase, so I believe we'll be able to reveal more details [about the new project] somewhere in the future."
</p>
<p>
One thing the new game won't be, however, is a sequel to last year's Slitterhead. The idiosyncratic, horror-tinged action-adventure launched to a mixed critical reception, and Toyama admitted to Famitsu the team had been aiming for a lot more sales than it eventually received. And, while he acknowledged its "cult favourite" status, he also speculated its reception might ultimately have been down to confusion over whether it was supposed to be a horror or action game.

<p>
Commercial success isn't the team's only goal, Toyama stressed, and it remains determined to take on new challenges. That's despite personal concerns around his advancing age. "As for how long we'll be able to continue," he explained, "it becomes a difficult topic especially if we take my age into consideration. However, I believe that moving forward, I also have to pass the baton to the next generation. As a studio, we're still midway to reaching our goal."
</p>
<p>
Toyama isn't the only renowned developer to publicly ponder their age in recent years, of course. In January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">wrote</a> he "[couldn't] help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", adding: "Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock." And speaking to The Guardian in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/dec/30/nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview-mario-zelda-switch-pikmin-splatoon">Shigeru Miyamoto joked</a>: "More so than retiring, I'm thinking about the day I fall over... In this day and age you have to think about things in a five-year timespan, so I do think about who I can pass things on to, in case something does happen."
</p>
<p>
Back to Toyama, Eurogamer contributor Vikki Blake was won over by the "singular and unapologetically strange" Slitterhead in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterhead-review">four star review last year</a>, so it'll certainly be interesting to see what Bokeh does next.

            <p>A YouTuber may end up facing jail time due to reviewing handheld devices which on occasion come pre-loaded with old games.</p>
<p>The YouTuber in question is Francesco Salicini - aka Once Were Nerd - from Italy, who said customs enforcement officers from the Guardia di Finanza turned up with a search warrant back in April of this year, with the intent to investigate promotion of pirated copyrighted materials (thanks, <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/once-were-nerd-youtuber-copyright-lawsuit-3577995/">Android Authority</a>). </p>
<p>Salicini is accused of having violated copyright law, mainly related to the "sponsorship" of consoles that can also be purchased with micro SD cards full of games.</p>

<p>Salicini said more than 30 consoles were "confiscated" from his collection, including ANBERNIC, Powkiddy, and TrimUI gaming handhelds. At this time, the authorities also took Salicini's phone, along with transcripts of his conversations with these gaming handheld makers. His phone was subsequently returned two months later, on 18th June.</p>
<p>While the YouTuber complied with the authorities as he did not believe he had done anything wrong, Salicini is presently accused of violating Article 171-ter of the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/477668">Italian Copyright Law</a> - that is to say, the Law for the Protection of Copyright and Neighbouring Rights - which holds a maximum penalty of €15,000 (that's just shy of £12,000 here in the UK). Additionally, Salicini could face up to three years' jail time.</p>
<p>In a video uploaded by Salicini (see below), the creator spoke of his plight. He said Italian law enforcement isn't required to disclose what exactly the charges are, or even who has brought them, until the initial investigation is finished. After that time, a judge could then decide to either dismiss the case, or take it to trial.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/un-aiuto-per-chi-vorra-e-potra-ad-un-semplice-nerd-onesto">Salicini has now started a GoFundMe to help cover his legal fees</a>.</p>
<p>Here, the YouTuber noted: "I have never 'sponsored' but 'reviewed' with the utmost objectivity citing both Pros and Cons of each device" (via machine translation).</p>
<p>Continuing, Salicini said: "To date, the Guardia di Finanza, as a precautionary measure, is also proceeding to obscure all my social channels, thus making it impossible for me to continue to bring other content that is not the subject of this investigation.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately this proceeding will almost certainly lead to a trial, I have already had to contact a defense lawyer and you can imagine how many expenses I will have to face to deal with this, in my opinion, injustice, since none of my content (more than 200 videos) violates YouTube's policies."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Salicini for comment on his current situation and legal issues.</p>

            <p>Roblox has today announced a suite of new safety features coming to the platform, including an AI used to estimate a teenager's age by taking a selfie.</p>
<p>Roblox, used primarily by children and teens, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">long been criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>. Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">it was claimed Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a> in 2023. The company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">taken further steps to improve child safety</a> over the past year, though back in March co-founder and CEO David Baszucki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">parents shouldn't let their kids play Roblox</a> if they're "not comfortable" about their safety. </p>
<p>Now, the company is advancing its "safety and civility vision" with the addition of four new features, as <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-communication">outlined in a new blog</a>.</p>

<p>"Safety has always been foundational to everything we do at Roblox," the blog reads. "Our goal is to lead the world in safety and civility for online gaming. We've spent nearly two decades building sophisticated safety systems, which supports our mission of connecting a billion people every day with optimism and civility.</p>
<p>"We are dedicated to supporting experiences that are both deeply engaging and empowering for players of all ages, while continuously innovating how all users connect and interact. Today, we're taking a significant step forward and announcing an expansion of our safety platform."</p>
<p>The first feature is Trusted Connections. Friends will now be known as Connections, and users 13 and older will be able to specify Trusted Connections, intended to allow for more free communication with people they know. Users who are 13 to 17 can add each other, but can only add users who are 18+ through a QR scan or Contact Importer. All conversations remain proactively monitored by Roblox.</p>
<p>Trusted Connections requires age verification. For this, Roblox is rolling out Age Estimation as a prerequisite. Essentially, this is an AI that will estimate a user's age by analysing a video selfie "against a large and diverse dataset", which the company assures is "handled securely". If the tool identifies a user as under 13, or is unable to verify age, Trusted Connections will be inaccessible. Age verification can still be done with an ID - and in future, by parental consent. How easily this can be exploited remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Roblox is adding new privacy and well-being tools to "help teens set healthy boundaries". This includes online status controls, a do not disturb mode, and insights into screen-time.</p>
<p>Lastly, the parental controls for parents of users aged 13 and under will be extended globally to parents of teens too. Parents will be able to set up a linked Roblox account to gain visibility into a child's Trusted Connections, screen-time insights, and spending notifications - if a teen gives consent.</p>
<p>"Today's announcement marks an important step forward, as we build on our existing safety systems with investments in advanced machine learning with AI, content moderation, and comprehensive parental controls," the blog post concludes.</p>
<p>"The launch of Trusted Connections with Age Estimation, new privacy tools, and parental insights for parents of teens builds on our existing safety systems to deliver industry-leading, age-informed communication that redefines digital safety and civility."</p>
<p>On top of safety concerns for users, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-exploiting-young-game-developers-new-investigation-reports">Roblox has previously been accused of "exploiting" young game developers</a>, as per an investigation in 2021.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies]]></content:encoded>
