            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sony has announced in its latest quarterly financial report that the PS5 has sold 80.3m units since its release in November 2020.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/25q1_supplement.pdf">which can be read here</a>, covers the full scope of Sony as a business. On page 12 details on the PlayStation 5's performance - as well as software and peripherals on the platform - are revealed.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-5">PS5</a> sold 2.5m units in Q1 2025, a slight rise from the Q1 2024 figure of 2.4m. Software sales across PS5 and PS4 is up significantly however, with 65.9m copies sold compared to 53.6m at the same time last year.</p>

<p>Monthly active users of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PlayStation Plus</a> are also up. 123m were recorded in Q1 2025, compared to 116m in Q1 2024. Add-on content (DLC) also saw a slight increase, bringing in 292,609m yen in Q1 2025 compared to 290,846 in Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's a lot of numbers, but what does it mean? Well, it means there's continued growth across pretty much all aspects of the PS5 business. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation">PlayStation</a> revenue from games, game DLC, and hardware is up. Plus, there are more people playing online on the PS5 than before.</p>
<p>The console passing 80.3m units sold throughout its life so far also puts it around about the same pace in terms of sales as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/playstation-4">PS4</a>, give or take a million or so. Given the rougher economic climate we're in right now, and the fact that there were serious supply issues at the start of the PS5's release, that's not too bad.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-5-has-sold-803-million-units-as-it-closes-on-in-on-fifth-anniversary]]></content:encoded>
