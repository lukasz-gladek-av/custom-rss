            <p>A pro skater has claimed he will appear in a yet-to-be-announced remastered Tony Hawk video game.</p>
<p>Professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones was chatting during an interview on the Breakfast Club podcast, when he casually stated: "I'm in a Tony Hawk coming out, that's cool... They got a new one they're remastering so that's about to come out, I was in the last one."</p>
<p>As a reminder, Jones was one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-tony-hawks-remaster-does-justice-to-one-of-the-greatest-demos-of-all-time">new playable pro skaters added to the remastered Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a>, which came out in 2020.</p>

<p>But, while Jones is clearly on (skate)board with this upcoming Tony Hawk remaster (could it be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a>+4?), it is worth noting that nothing has been officially announced to be in the works by Activision. That's not to say that there hasn't been plenty of Tony Hawk-flavoured chatter, however.</p>
<p>Plans to give Pro Skater 3 and 4 the remake treatment were reportedly scrapped after A<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">ctivision made the decision to merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> in 2021. But, that apparently wasn't the end of it after all, and in September last year, Tony Hawk himself gave us all a glimmer of hope that something was in the pipeline.</p>
<p>More pertinently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">Hawk revealed he had been "talking to Activision again" last September</a>, and added these talks were " insanely exciting" and he was "working on something" with the studio.</p>
<p>A little later that same month, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAgXDa1PI8a/">Hawk then popped up on Instagram</a> with a post marking the 25th anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. And how did he round everything off? Well, like this:</p>
<p>"I'm not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future."</p>

<p>Hopefully we will hear something more concrete on what exactly this franchise future will look like soon. In the meantime, Eurgamer has contacted Activision Blizzard for comment on Jones' statement regarding a new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
UK retailer GAME appears to have dropped its widely-criticised delivery fee for in-demand Pokémon Prismatic Evolutions card sets, which saw £11 tins cost £31 to get delivered.
</p>
<p>
Exasperated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-scalping-popular-pokemon-cards-staff-say-demanding-20-shipping-for-11-mini-tin">GAME staff told Eurogamer last week that the chain's inflated postage pricing was a deliberate move</a>, rather than a simple mistake. Employees also told us they were tired of Pokémon card stock being kept back to sell for more money via GAME's website, rather than to customers visiting to try and buy the cards in-store.
</p>
<p>
The story spread online, and Eurogamer heard yesterday from a source close to the chain that GAME's "Oversized Delivery" fee was being reconsidered, or potentially relabelled. Today, Eurogamer has spotted that the Pokemon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin no longer has its previous £19.99 "Oversized Delivery" option.

</figure>
<p>
That's not to say that GAME's regular options are cheap - the chain's Standard Delivery is £4.99, or you can pay the same amount just for GAME to hold the item for you in store. Alternatively, you can pay £11.99 to get the cards via Next Day Delivery by DPD, or £9.99 to chance it with Next Day Delivery by Evri. 
</p>
<p>
But these are, at least, now GAME's usual rates.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously contacted GAME to ask why a small tin of Pokémon cards no bigger than a mobile phone required a £19.99 "Oversized Delivery" option, when a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> console did not. Eurogamer is still waiting for a response.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-fall-of-game-no-games-no-accessories-instead-we-received-136-zendaya-action-figures">Eurogamer reported on GAME's various ongoing issues as it is further integrated into Sports Direct's Fraser Group</a>, and suffers store closures, redundancies, and stock problems.
