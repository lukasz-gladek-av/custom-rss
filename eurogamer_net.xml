            <p>Future updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will seemingly include "Hagga-Basin-like maps".</p>
<p>Revealed by community manager Iggy in the Dune Awakening Discord server, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1006265467754790943/1379064253537063103/1384818624283545693">he wrote</a>: "I think Joel kinda leaked in the past that we plan to add more Hagga-Basin-like maps in the future as part of new content".</p>
<p>Iggy refers to pre-launch developer vlogs in which Dune: Awakening spoke about the roadmap for future updates. Creative director Joel Bylos stated updates for the game would be free, with only optional cosmetics, battle passes, and especially large expansions being sold.</p>

If it ever comes as part of a paid package, I imagine it would be because it's something big." Iggy continues "But for now I think we have said we plan to release content for free, and then optional stuff via optional DLCs so we can actually afford rent, lights, and pineapple on pizza."</p>
<p>Dune Awakening has proven exceptionally popular since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend">its launch on Steam, breaking 150,000 concurrent players</a> and popping off among the higher reaches of the Top Sellers list alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a>. A recent patch for the game provided several quality of life fixes, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">ended the practice of crushing players with orniphopters in PvP</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Eurogamer's recent review of Dune Awakening</a>, which scored it four stars, offered praise to the progression through Hagga Basin. It features the following: "[...] the process of gathering material around the starter area of Hagga Basin, refining your haul at your handcrafted base, and manufacturing new gear is made endlessly compelling with an unwavering faithfulness to the source material."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Gears of War Reloaded developer The Coalition has extended the second weekend of the game's beta, which along with more time will also include more modes and more maps for participants to check out.</p>
<p>The upcoming weekend's beta will now run between 20th June 8pm UK time until 23rd June 5am UK time, and feature five maps for both Social Team Deathmatch and Competitive King of the Hill and Execution. Initially, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-reloaded-multiplayer-beta-coming-this-weekend">things were planned to be wrapped up within 48 hours and with less variety</a>.</p>

<p>As to why the team has decided to do this? Well, "we heard you," is what it wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1935414750034411784">post on social media</a>.</p>
<p>You see, the first Gears of War Reloaded beta weekend didn't <em>exactly </em>go all that smoothly for the developer, and there were multiple reports from players of <a href="https://x.com/SASxSH4DOWZ/status/1934359201523929512">server instability</a> as well as technical issues. Many were quite <a href="https://x.com/Lilkillsville/status/1934044001050730864">vocal about their experiences</a>.</p>
<p>"Most of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> stream thumbnails are of people sitting trying to find a match. When you eventually can get into a match, everybody is laggy and when you start shooting somebody they just disappear and then randomly you die or they stutter back and forth taking multiple full clips and not dying," read <a href="https://x.com/Freas23Gaming/status/1933863257304875257">one such post on social media</a> following the first beta. "I knew the beta was probably gonna be bad but this is just terrible and unacceptable."</p>
<p>Hopefully things will go a bit better this weekend.</p>

            <p>Sloclap launched its football action game Rematch today, but crossplay has not been included due to "unforeseen technical complexities".</p>
<p>Rematch released across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (Steam), but players are unable to play with others on rival platforms - at least, not yet.</p>
<p>"We understand many of you were looking forward to playing Rematch across platforms from day one," said the studio in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch blog post</a>. "We did our utmost to include crossplay at launch, but Rematch is the studio's first crossplay title, and we faced unforeseen technical complexities which prevented us from having this feature ready in time. We should have communicated as soon as it became apparent that crossplay wouldn't be available at launch, and we're sorry for the inconvenience and frustration it caused to some of our players."</p>

<p>The studio noted it's "very important for us that our players are able to enjoy Rematch with their friends" and so crossplay is its "absolute highest priority" alongside bug fixes. It's "committed to delivering this feature swiftly". A basic working version has already been produced from a technical standpoint, but needs to be debugged and polished before full implementation.</p>
<p>The studio also noted other issues it's looking to fix, based on feedback from the early access period. These include: performance optimisations to improve stability; preventing server and client desynchronisation; and resolving game-breaking bugs.</p>
<p>Beyond these issues, the studio will be working on broader updates with new content like tournament and leaderboard systems, social features like spectating and (ironically) easier rematches, as well as more casual game modes such as quick play and implementing AI bots to train against.</p>
<p>Sloclap will also tweak the core gameplay, with improvements to the sliding tackle, goalkeeper mechanics, the dribbling system, and wall contacts, among others. "Our general objective is to keep adding depth and granularity to our mechanics, to make the game as interesting as possible in a competitive environment," the studio said.</p>
<p>"Please remember that we are not a huge team, and that these features take time, so don't expect all this by the end of the year!" Sloclap concluded. "We will communicate on a more precise roadmap for upcoming seasons as soon as we have better visibility on when we can deliver on these intentions."</p>
<p>The studio added: "We're dedicated to making Rematch the outstanding multiplayer football experience you deserve, and we're committed to communicating regularly and transparently with our community to keep you updated on our progress. Thanks to all players who joined us already for your incredible enthusiasm and support, this is really what motivates us to make this game as great as it can be!"</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Tom Orry has been playing Rematch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-the-challenging-new-online-football-game-hitting-game-pass-immediately-transported-me-back-to-my-schools-playground">likened it to being transported back to the school playground</a>, stating "the same blinkered overconfidence of school days is here to see in Rematch".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Rematch has also been added to Xbox Game Pass</a>, for those with a subscription.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
