            <p>Marvel's Wolverine finally has a release date, and good news: it's coming out later this year.</p>
<p>Announced just a few minutes ago, the upcoming Marvel action game by Insomniac and PlayStation Studios will release on the 15th September, 2026. You can wishlist it now, if you're especially keen on it. This news also comes with an incredibly short <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2026341241936335224">release date trailer published on social media</a> - though if you were hoping for more gameplay you're out of luck.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-but-dont-expect-to-see-wolverine-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play">The game bizarrely skipped the Sony State of Play earlier this month</a>, though this date reveal comes after a vague and mysterious <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?s=20">social media post by Insomniac</a> which stated we'd hear more about the game in spring 2026. There was also an open fall 2026 release window established relatively recently, which has as of today been narrowed all the way down.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">The game was first revealed in 2021</a>, with a cinematic teaser during a State of Play livestream. Since then, it's been largely radio silent for the AAA super hero slasher, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-later-playstation-and-insomniac-gives-marvels-wolverine-a-2026-release-window-debuts-trailer-full-of-blood-brutality-and-blades">save for a gameplay trailer released last September</a> which was packed full of action and gory violence.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s producer Alexia Christofi has spoken about the game's meta-progression overhaul, which needed a rework following player-feedback shortly after the game's launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/battlefield-6-s-meta-progression-needed-a-little-bit-of-a-rework-says-producer?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Speaking to Game Developer at DICE</a> earlier this year, Christofi told the outlet about the team's approach to making substantial changes to how players unlock weapons and other in-game items through challenges in Battlefield 6. Their initial approach faced criticism after many found the requirements too daunting or unrewarding.</p>
<p>Players didn't like feeling they were forced into specific modes," Christofi stated. "We took a step back, re-evaluated, and as we're launching future seasons, we've changed our ethos a little bit to challenges and player progression in general."</p>
<p>Following this shift in approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-challenges-are-being-made-far-easier-following-intense-community-feedback">meta-progression requirements were drastically reduced</a>. Within a short period of time, what was once difficult became far easier, allowing players to unlock specific tools in a relatively short amount of time, without feeling the frustration of a long grind or arduous task. This, according to Christofi, has influenced other aspects of the game experienced today.</p><p>"There have been times when I've woken up in my morning, we've seen something, we've got some bugs we need to fix for the next patch, and we haven't got around to fixing it by the evening... and then we've been able to hand it over to someone in LA to take that on and carry on working on that," Christofi explained.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-season-2-first-reactions">Battlefield 6 players are entrenched in the game's second season</a>, which added a new map as well as various other activities to engage in. There's also the game's battle royale mode — RedSec — <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-redsec-battle-royale-makes-me-miss-peak-pubg">which was initial received with mixed reception from players and critics alike</a>. This too, has undergone a suite of changes and tweaks in response to feedback.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to play Battlefield 6 yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>. In it, Rick Lane wrote: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-hunters-gathering-is-a-three-player-tactical-co-op-game-that-looks-a-bit-like-dauntless-with-a-closed-playtest-coming-soon">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a> wasn't exactly what we were expecting when we first heard about Guerilla Games tackling an online multiplayer Horizon game for Sony, but the PS5 and PC "tactical co-op" title certainly looks interesting to enough to warrant a closer look. Now, it appears the first closed beta test is about to happen, and its timing is a bit funny.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/wait-some-fans-will-be-playing-horizons-divisive-ps5-pc-multiplayer-game-this-weekend">Push Square</a> and social media posts, we've learned the first Horizon Hunters Gathering test will be happening during certain time slots this weekend. More specifically, from 7:00pm to 10:00pm CET in Europe, and 4:00pm to 7:00pm PST in North America; it'll "get underway from 27th February and run until 1st March." At the time of writing, it seems other regions are not part of this test.</p>
<p>To access, you'll need to both be part of the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/?">PlayStation Beta Program</a> and get lucky. The good news is the closed test seems substantial, as it'll include access to three different characters: Axle, Rem, and Sun. Two modes, Machine Incursion and Cauldron Descent, come with this test, which will happen exclusively "on the previously announced Colorado Springs map." Moreover, the Gathering social space and a customisable camp site will also be available, which suggests development on the game is further along than many thought.</p>
<p>At the same time, Sony and Bungie will be hosting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-come-has-come-for-you-to-judge-marathon-for-yourself-again-theres-a-new-server-slam-running-late-feb-into-march">Marathon's "server slam" weekend</a> to test the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-outlines-marathon-networking-and-security-features">online infrastructure</a> ahead of its launch on 5th March. Unlike the closed Horizon Hunters Gathering test, Marathon's pre-release weekend is free for everyone and open, so we're gonna assume Horizon's little event is <em>really </em>limited when it comes to player numbers, as overlapping them (and the ensuing conversations) seems a bit silly.</p>
