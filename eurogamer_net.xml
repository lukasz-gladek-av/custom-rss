            <p>Team Cherry's long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> has spawned lengthy discourse around difficulty in games, and now the developers have addressed the topic too.</p>
<p>The game is part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/Game%20Worlds%20exhibition%20at%20Australia's%20national%20museum%20of%20screen%20culture%20(ACMI)">Game Worlds exhibition</a> at Australia's national museum of screen culture (ACMI), which was attended by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hollow-knight-silksong-devs-address-difficulty-concerns-3252994/">Dexerto</a>. The exhibition's co-curator Jini Maxwell spoke with Ari Gibson and William Pellen from Team Cherry at the event.</p>
<p>"The important thing for us is that we allow you to go way off the path," Gibson explained. "So one player may choose to follow it directly to its conclusion, and then another may choose to constantly divert from it and find all the other things that are waiting and all the other ways and routes."</p>

<p>While Gibson admitted Silksong "has some moments of steep difficulty", he added "part of allowing a higher level of freedom within the world means that you have choices all the time about where you're going and what you're doing."</p>
<p>So instead of players repeatedly attempting a particular boss fight, they "have ways to mitigate the difficulty via exploration, or learning, or even circumventing the challenge entirely, rather than getting stonewalled."</p>
<p>Gibson further noted that as Hornet is "inherently faster and more skillful than the Knight" of the first game, even base level enemies had to be "more complicated, more intelligent".</p>
<p>Added Pellen: "The basic ant warrior is built from the same move-set as the original Hornet boss. The same core set of dashing, jumping, and dashing down at you, plus we added the ability to evade and check you. In contrast to the Knight's enemies, Hornet's enemies had to have more ways of catching her as she tries to move away."</p>
<p>Team Cherry's approach was therefore to "bring everyone else up to match [Hornet's] level".</p>
<p>One other area of contention are the boss runbacks, which often task players with repeating difficult platform sections before re-attempting a boss. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-silksong-drags-them-into-the-spotlight-again-have-boss-runbacks-had-their-day">have boss runbacks had their day?</a></p>
<p>"Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Silksong review</a>.</p>

            <p>Epic will soon allow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> developers to sell in-game items from their Fortnite islands, allowing creators to make more money.</p>
<p>This will begin in December 2025, and for the first year developers will earn 100 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales - usually this is at 50 percent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items?lang=en-US">news</a> comes as Fortnite's Creative Mode of fan-made content is proving exceptionally popular - recently, the Fortnite version of Roblox meme game Steal A Brainrot had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mtklb7/oh_wow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">more concurrent players</a> than Epic's official maps.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-is-getting-a-major-new-sandbox-mode-separate-from-battle-royale">Fortnite's Creative Mode first launched back in 2018</a>, and allows players to create their own maps and modes. Epic then offers a payout based on engagement - <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-ecosystem-2024-year-in-review-celebrating-creators-and-looking-ahead?team=personal">last year</a> it paid out $325m to creators, with seven receiving over $10m.</p>
<p>Since Creative Mode's release, Epic has revealed, players have spent over 11.2bn hours across 260,000 creator-made islands, resulting in $722,000,000 paid to creators.</p>
<p>The amount of money creators will make in Fortnite is only going to increase when they're able to sell in-game items directly from their islands, in addition to receiving an engagement payout from Fortnite's item shop sales.</p>
<p>Epic has a formula for calculating the V-Bucks value in US dollars each month, which takes all real-money spending towards V-Bucks (in dollars), subtracting platform and store fees, and dividing by total V-Bucks spent. With creators usually earning 50 percent of V-Bucks value from sales, this equates to 37 percent of retail spending. Roblox offers 25 percent, by way of comparison.</p>
<p>In addition, Epic will add a Sponsored Row to Fortnite's Discover, meaning creators can pay for increased visibility by bidding for placement in the row. That's a further investment in generating more in-game sales.</p>
<p>Epic has also announced Fortnite Creator Communities, to allow creators to share updates directly with players on the web and within Fortnite. Creator posts will be text and image-based and allow for sharing information and gathering feedback - much like on Steam.</p>

</figure>
<p>But despite the huge success of creator islands, is this really what Fortnite players want?</p>
<p>Take Steal A Brainrot. It's proven to be a phenomenal success - as <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/steal-a-brainrot-smashes-records-with-nearly-24-million-players-across-roblox-and-fortnite-3250973/">Dexerto</a> reported, it had 24 million players in a single day across both Roblox and Fortnite versions. While the Roblox version peaked at 23.4 million players in a day, Fortnite's version contributed 542,000. That vastly outweighs Fortnite's primary Battle Royale modes that generate around 100,000 players during peak weekend play.</p><p>"They are promoting AI slop, copy and paste creative maps more than their own BR season," wrote one player on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1n4fbrt/this_is_very_much_so_alarming_and_needs_to_be/">reddit</a>. "This is going to prove to be extremely unhealthy for the game in general I believe, and with the already low player counts this season Epic needs to do something to steer back to the basics, this metaverse stuff has RUINED Fortnite. This game has become a corporate shell of what it once was and I believe the remainder of this year will very much so make or break Fortnite as a whole."</p>
<p>"Stuff like this cluttering the overview makes me disinterested in random creative maps. Those who put genuine effort into their maps often get hardly any attention," wrote a user on a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mtklb7/oh_wow/">separate reddit post</a>. Others point to the casual nature of user-made maps, as well as the high XP offered, as reasons for players to flock over.</p>
<p>Still, this new update for Fortnite creators is further shifting the game away from its Battle Royale roots into a Roblox-rivalling metaverse.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has responded to Sony's Horizon lawsuit, claiming its action adventure game Light of Motiram uses "time-honoured" genre tropes.</p>
<p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a> claiming its newly-revealed game was a "slavish clone" of the Horizon games, owing to its red-headed heroine, post-apocalyptic world, and robotic enemies.</p>
<p>Tencent has now filed its response in a motion to dismiss, stating Sony "seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions" (thanks <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/">The GamePost</a>). It reads as something of an attack against Guerrilla's games, stating Sony's claims of Horizon's originality are "startling".</p>

<p>"Plaintiff Sony has sued a grab-bag of Tencent companies - and ten unnamed defendants - about the unreleased video game Light of Motiram, alleging that the game copies elements from Sony's game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and its spinoffs," said Tencent.</p>
<p>"At bottom, Sony's effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property. It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain."</p>
<p>Sony previously claimed Horizon Zero Dawn was "like no fictional world created before [or] since". In response, Tencent claimed this is "flatly contradicted" by Guerrilla itself, pointing to a behind-the-scenes documentary where art director Jan-Bart Van Beek admitted the game's central premise has been done before - specifically in 2013 game Enslaved: Odyssey to the West.</p>
<p>"That claim is startling, because it is flatly contradicted by Sony’s own developers, not to mention the long history of video games featuring the same elements that Sony seeks to monopolise through this lawsuit," said Tencent.</p>
<p>"Sony's Complaint tellingly ignores these facts. Instead, it tries to transform ubiquitous genre ingredients into proprietary assets."</p>
<p>It continued: "By suing over an unreleased project that merely employs the same time-honoured tropes embraced by scores of other games released both before and after Horizon - like Enslaved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, Far Cry: Primal, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-new-dawn">Far Cry: New Dawn</a>, Outer Wilds, Biomutant, and many more - Sony seeks an impermissible monopoly on genre conventions."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Comparison of characters from Sony's initial Complaint | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Tencent's response also addressed a meeting at GDC in March 2024 where Tencent representatives pitched a licensed Horizon mobile game that Sony ultimately turned down. The Chinese company stated no executives or employees were at the meeting, so nothing at the meeting "is alleged to be an act of copyright or trademark infringement".</p>
<p>What's more, Tencent has claimed Sony is attempting to sue the wrong company, so wants the case thrown out on legal grounds.</p>
<p>While Sony's lawsuit is against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., and Tencent Holdings, Light of Motiram - according to Tencent's response - is being developed and published by Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios, a developer operating under Tencent Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd, and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd, a company in Singapore "doing business as '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent-games">Tencent Games</a>' and/or 'Level Infinite'".</p><p>"None of the served defendants develop and market the Light of Motiram video game that Sony alleges infringes its intellectual property in the Horizon franchise," said Tencent. It stated Tencent Holdings Ltd. is simply a parent company and has no involvement in Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>"Sony's threadbare, conclusory allegations improperly lump these Defendants together with the foreign companies alleged to be responsible for the core conduct at issue. Sony's vague allegations against 'Tencent' or 'Defendants' generally cannot substantiate the claims it brings against Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S., or Tencent Holdings specifically."</p>
<p>Lastly, Light of Motiram won't release until the end of 2027, meaning Sony's lawsuit is built on what the game "might" look like before it's even out, said Tencent.</p>
<p>Still, shortly after Sony began suing Tencent, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">Light of Motiram's Steam page was quietly altered</a> to remove, edit, and/or replace key art, as well as rewrite the description.</p>
