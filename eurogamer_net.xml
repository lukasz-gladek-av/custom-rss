            <p>Paradox Interactive has parted ways with Cities: Skylines developer Colossal Order in a mutual decision "made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams".</p>
<p>The publisher and developer have worked together on the series for over 15 years. Now, Colossal Order will explore "new creative opportunities", while development on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> will transfer to Finnish developer Iceflake Studios, which is one of Paradox's internal management game studios.</p>
<p>The city building sequel was released back in October 2023, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">heavily criticised at the time for performance issues</a>. Console versions, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">remain some way off following seemingly troubled development</a>.</p>

<p>"For over fifteen years, the Cities Series and our partnership with Paradox have been a defining part of our journey at Colossal Order," said Mariina Hallikainen, CEO of Colossal Order, in a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">shared statement</a>.</p>
<p>"When we set out to create Cities in Motion, we never imagined it would grow to become a cherished franchise with a passionate, loyal community of millions of players around the world. We want to thank everyone at Paradox for their trust and collaboration, and of course the community for the incredible support that has made Cities what it is today. We're confident that the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox's leadership. As we move forward, we're excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision."</p><p>Added Mattias Lilja, deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive: "Our partnership with Colossal Order is one of the longest-running relationships we've enjoyed here at Paradox. Four games, dozens of expansions, and a community of millions of Cities players; it's remarkable how much we've achieved together. We have deep respect for the Colossal Order team and we look forward to seeing where they go from here. On our end, we're eager to continue working for the passionate Cities: Skylines community and make sure to provide them with more content and new experiences."</p>
<p>Iceflake Studios will take over all ongoing development on Cities: Skylines 2, including free updates, continuous work on the Editor, forthcoming console editions, and future expansions. The studio will take the helm at the start of 2026.</p>
<p>"Taking the reins on a genre-leading franchise like Cities is an immense honour and a great responsibility," said Lasse Liljedahl, studio manager of Iceflake Studios.</p>
<p>"There's a huge, loyal community out there and I want to say to every member of that community that we will humbly carry this legacy with respect, together with all of you. Iceflake has the capacity and capability to get started. We have a decade worth of experience from making city building and management games. We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game."</p>
<p>Colossal Order still has some work to finish up, including the forthcoming Bike Patch, Old Town buildings, bug fixes, and general improvements.</p>
<p>The last few years have been a troubling time for Paradox, known for publishing strategy and simulation games. News of this change in developer follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parting ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven</a> last year, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">sudden cancellation of its Sims-like game Life By You</a>.</p><p>"What we have to do is start small, listen to the fans early, and most importantly, stay within our core,"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-must-refocus-to-rebuild-trust-and-survive-bosses-say-after-life-by-you-cancellation"> Lilja told Eurogamer last year, discussing the company's future</a>. "We do more extensive and earlier peer reviews to get honest feedback earlier.</p>
<p>"We do want to take risks. We want to try new things," he added. "But we need to be much more disciplined about it than we've been."</p>
<p>Last month, Paradox released its long-awaited action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a>, though it received negative reviews. "The Chinese Room has managed to make something from a box of inherited parts, but this action RPG feels hollow and functional, and is only redeemed by some stellar performances from the characters and cast," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">our review</a>.</p>

            <p>Just this very moment, the first official photos from The Legend of Zelda live-action film were shown on the Nintendo today app.</p>
<p>These images show Bo Bragason as the titular Princess Zelda, complete with bow and arrow, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. We were treated to a shot of the duo looking out over Hyrule, as well as individual character images. </p>

<p>Ever since set footage from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-zelda-and-link-filming-the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-in-new-zealand">upcoming live-action Legend of Zelda movie adaption first came to light over the weekend</a>, I have been trying to piece together clues to work out which game the crew is adapting. So, please allow me to take you through my thinking…</p><p>As you can see in the images below and above, our first look at Bo Bragason as Zelda show her in a blue tunic. In my mind, this put the film in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s timeline, where the Champions and the princess all largely wore a splash of blue in their day to day wear, be it tunics or sashes. The way Bragason's hair has been styled is also very Breath of the Wild. </p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group"><figure>

<p>However, after Zelda first appears in the footage, she then walks up to another character next to a horse. Many have surmised that this is Impa, a mainstay in the Zelda series. The thing is, Impa here is much younger than she appears in Breath of the Wild, even with the silver hair, and is wearing quite a knightly-looking garb. This in my mind then put the film into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> category, where Impa serves as a strong warrior.</p>

</figure>
<p>Others online, meanwhile, have pointed out that the actress perhaps playing Impa in the film (the character has not been officially confirmed yet) looks a lot like the Impa seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-skyward-sword">Skyward Sword</a>. This is canonically the game that started off the whole Zelda timeline. As for who the actress is, again we don't have official word yet but she appears to be Dichen Lachman. I first came across Lachman when she appeared in Neighbours as Katya Kinski, though she has since starred in the likes of Severance and Altered Carbon.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>@farourage via X</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then, finally, we come to the Legend of Zelda series' main man, Link. In the film, he is played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, who can be seen in set footage wearing Link's iconic green tunic ensemble. Again, this pushes my initial Breath of the Wild thoughts towards the back burner as while Link can certainly get green clothing in the series' most recent timeline, this is not what he wears in any of the key art or promotional images.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Link does not yet appear to have the Master Sword in any of the set images. Will finding it be part of the film's story?</p>

<figcaption>While Link traditionally wears green in promotional images for Legend of Zelda games (as shown in the Twilight Princess artwork), for the most recent series releases he has worn blue.  | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So, what can we conclude then? Well, in all honesty, I am not exactly sure which game in the Legend of Zelda series the film will be adapting, despite my initial thought being Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Perhaps the team will do something similar to what Sony tried to do with its Uncharted adaptation, and create a sort of melange of set pieces from across the Zelda series. Or, perhaps, we will be presented with an all new story for the Legend of Zelda…? What do you hope to see on the film's eventual release?</p>
<p>Filming for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-the-project-begins-production-it-looks-like-the-legend-of-zelda-film-is-following-in-lord-of-the-rings-esteemed-footsteps">Nintendo's Legend of Zelda adaptation began earlier this month in New Zealand</a>, and is expected to run until April next year. The film is due to release on 7th May, 2027.</p>
<p>I will be keeping my eyes open for any more set leaks and cast announcements, so stay tuned. Personally, I am most interested to hear who will play Ganondorf.</p>
