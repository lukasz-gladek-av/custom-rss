            <p>Valve has amended its guidance on AI disclosure and clarified that while developers using "AI-powered tools" for "efficiency gains" is not the focus of its policy, they must still disclose if generative AI is used in their games.</p>
<p>Now, as spotted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/">GameDiscoverCo,</a> Valve has now amended its AI policy, making it clearer that studios that use "AI powered tools" such as code helpers may not have to disclose if there are no genAI assets like music, artwork, narrative design, or localisation in the content that "ships with [their] game".</p>
<p>"We are aware that many modern games development environments have AI powered tools built into them," the developer disclosure page now reads. "Efficiency gains through the use of these tools is not the focus of this section. Instead, it is concerned with the use of AI in creating content that ships with your game, and is consumed by players. This includes content such as artwork, sound narrative, localisation, etc."</p>
<p>Developers are then asked to indicate Yes or No to the question: "Does this game use generative artificial intelligence to generate content for the game, either pre-rendered or live-generated? This includes the game itself, the store page, and any Steam community assets or marketing materials."</p><p>Quite what qualifies as an "efficiency gain" and what doesn't remains to be seen, but ultimately, game makers publishing on Steam are still required to tell players if they use AI to generate any content, or its Steam-flavoured marketing materials.</p>
<p>"This feels like a really thoughtful middle ground that actually makes sense for developers," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7417944214812106752?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7417944214812106752%2C7417947262959513600%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287417947262959513600%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7417944214812106752%29">said</a> one commenter. "The way they've separated efficiency tools from actual content generation shows they understand how teams actually work. It's refreshing to see a platform think through the nuances instead of just blanket policies, and putting players first in these decisions feels like the right call."</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">Epic Games' Tim Sweeney criticised Valve's requirement to disclose generative AI</a>, saying "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Valve's platform recently crossed the 42 million barrier</a>, setting a new record.</p>
