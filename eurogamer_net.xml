            <p>
Alien: Rogue Incursion, the action-horror adventure from developer Survios, is ditching its headset requirements and getting a non-VR release on PS5 and Steam this September.
</p>
<p>
Alien: Rogue Incursion initially launched for PSVR 2 and PCVR last December, putting players into the big clompy boots of ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks as they - alongside their ever-present synth companion Davis 01 - embarked on a dangerous mission to the uncharted planet Purdan, in the hope of exposing the Weyland-Yutani's black-site experiments. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't take long for those pesky Xenomorphs to make their presence known.
</p>
<p>
Survios calls Alien: Rogue Incursion (which additionally launched for Meta Quest 3 earlier this year) part one of a two-part story, albeit one that "stands alone as a complete story" if you don't include "thrilling cliffhanger". It's newly announced non-VR release is titled Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition, and is described as having been "re-envisioned" for console and PC. What that means in specific terms isn't entirely clear, but there's talk of "even deadlier Xenomorphs and enhanced visuals."

<p>
The original Alien: Rogue Incursion currently has a 'mixed' rating on Steam, having garnered criticism for issues ranging from wonky AI to poor performance - but the general concensus seems to be it's built on solid foundations and manages to capture the essence of the beloved sci-fi series. And if that works for you, Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition will be available in two guises when it launches for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3655390/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_Evolved_Edition/">Steam</a> on 30th September.
</p>
<p>
There's a $29.99 USD Standard Edition featuring just the base game, plus a $39.99 Deluxe Edition. This includes the base game, a Blue Camo armour skin, a Blue Camo weapon skin, and The Art of Alien: Rogue Incursion in-game art book. It's unclear, however, if owners of the earlier VR edition will be able to access the new version without forking out for the new release.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition launches for Steam and PS5 on 30th September. And if that's put you in an Alien mood, why not take a trip to last year, when Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">celebrated a decade of Creative Assembly's all-time horror classic Alien: Isolation</a>?

            <p>
If you've been hankering for a lizard-scented blast of nostalgia, you're in luck; Crystal Dynamics' cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels are being bundled up for a PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC release on 16th June.
</p>
<p>
The Gex Trilogy, you might recall, was announced earlier this year, and gathers together the series' original 1995 outing - 2D PS1 platformer Gex - alongside its two 3D sequels, Gex: Enter the Gecko and Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko, which launched in 1998 and 1999 respectively.
</p>
<p>
Limited Run Games, which is publishing the collection, isn't quite going as far as describing the bundle as a remaster, but it <em>is</em> promising "extras and numerous improvements". There's talk of native widescreen support, save states, and the ability to rewind the action. That's in addition to artwork and archival material including classic adverts, a music player, and a new interview with the voice of Gex (in the US at least), Dana Gould.

<p>
The Gex Trilogy will initially be available as a digital release when it comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183970/GEX_Trilogy/">Steam</a> on 16th June. However, Limited Run is also planning to give the bundle a physical release later this year, and those wanting to hold Gex's heft in their hands have a couple of options. There's a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-standard-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$39.99 USD Standard Edition</a>, which contains either a disc or a cartridge depending on your platform of choice (the PC version contains a Steam key), plus a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-classic-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$74.99 Classic Edition</a> that also includes a Steelbook, reversible poster, soundtrack selection CD, and a "retro box" resembling a PS1 game.
</p>
<p>
If you really want to go all-out in a fury of nostalgia, however, there's also a <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/gex-trilogy-tail-time-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc">$199.99 Tail Time Edition</a>, which is available to pre-order from 9th May to 6th July. This includes everything in the Classic Edition (and upgrades the CD to a full soundtrack), then throws in a 7-inch Gex statue, trading cards, a Remote Pin, and a special box featuring artwork from Final Fantasy artist Yoshitaka Amano. Oh, and there's a 36-inch inflatable Gex to do with as you please.

Crystal Dynamics has, of course, long waved goodbye to Gex, having released the likes of its Legacy of Kain series, Marvel's Avengers, and numerous Tomb Raider titles in the years since. Currently, the studio - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">announced layoffs earlier this year</a> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/at-long-last-the-perfect-dark-reboot-gets-a-first-gameplay-trailer">assisting Microsoft with its troubled Perfect Dark reboot</a>, and continuing work on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-games-working-with-crystal-dynamics-on-next-tomb-raider">untitled Tomb Raider game in partnership with Amazon</a>. This latter title was presumably planned to launch alongside Amazon's Tomb Raider TV series, but recent reports have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-tomb-raider-series-from-phoebe-waller-bridge-reportedly-dead">suggested the Phoebe Waller-Bridge penned show has been scrapped</a>.
