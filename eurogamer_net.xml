            <p>What had been a closed beta test for Funcom's upcoming Dune Awakening is now available to everyone who has pre-ordered the game, not just those lucky enough to have bagged a code.</p>
<p>In a message posted to social media, Funcom confirmed that has "had heard [the] feedback" from fans surprised a pre-order wasn't enough to secure a beta key, and now anyone who has ordered the MMO "can now also access the beta" which is live now and due to close tomorrow, Monday 12th May.</p>

<p>"We heard your feedback on this, "the studio said. "If you already own or decide to pre-order any of the editions this weekend, you should now also see a Beta Weekend product in your Steam library. You might need to restart your Steam client to see the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> Beta Weekend app."</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening has been in closed beta for over a year now, but with its full release now looming following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-delayed-for-last-minute-changes-from-beta-testers">brief delay</a>, this final, large-scale beta blowout will run from 9th-12th May. The studio is calling it Dune: Awakening's "largest beta yet... with a huge number of new players joining compared to previous closed betas".</p>
<p>It's likely the studio acquisced after players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1kfzht6/have_people_been_informed_that_they_are_in_the/">game's subreddit and Discord complained</a> about not getting access to the latest beta despite having pre-ordered the MMO.</p>

<p>"If we see that we’re nearing capacity, we will be able to spin up more. This is not our first rodeo, we’ve launched several MMOs and survival games over the past 25 years, and we have a robust set of tools and processes in place, managed by an experienced live operations team."</p>

            <p>Almost 200 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> developers working at Activision Blizzard have unionised, joining the Communications Workers of America (CWA) after the "overwhelming majority" of workers signed up.</p>
<p>A wall-to-wall unit - now known as The Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA (OWGG-CWA) - the union includes game developers across all disciplines, including design, production, engineering, art, sound, and quality assurance.</p>

<p>"The massive layoffs in the video game industry, and at my own studio, became one of the first reasons I started to learn about how to organise to create a healthier workplace for everyone," said Frank Le Cocq, VFX artist and organising committee member.</p>
<p>"When we began our union efforts, it was empowering to know that our coworkers next door at World of Warcraft had already successfully gone through the process."</p>
<p>"California continues to be a hub for video game organising, and we are excited to welcome Overwatch game developers to CWA alongside our video game union siblings at World of Warcraft and SEGA of America," said CWA Local 9510 President Jason Justice. "When workers come together to build power, we become able to ensure a brighter future for all."</p>
<p>Microsoft has recognised the union alongside the other 2100+ plus Microsoft workers who have formed a union with the CWA.</p>
<p>As game development becomes increasingly insecure all over the world, more and more developers and performers are organising collective bargaining. Following news of the SAG-AFTRA strike last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity stated it stood "in solidarity", but would not be authorising a strike</a>. It did, however, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actors-union-stages-baftas-protest-seeking-improved-conditions-for-performers">call on the games industry to improve conditions for performers</a>, and a protest took place outside last month's BAFTA Games Awards as Equity members held placards reading "Union contracts in gaming now".</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">US union warned of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse"</a> in the latest proposal to end industrial action. Negotiators on behalf of video game companies responded that "meaningful progress" had been made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
