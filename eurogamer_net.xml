            <p>
Our first look at the long-awaited remaster of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion comes from a leak of screenshots and details taken from port developer Virtuos' website.
</p>
<p>
A remake or remaster of Bethesda's beloved Oblivion has been expected for months, and has been the subject of numerous industry whisperings. Eurogamer understands Bethesda's current plan is to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of then, fans on reddit have been poking around Virtuos' website and discovered a number of images that look set to be used upon the game's announcement. These include screenshots of the game, and comparison images showcasing this new version of Oblivion versus Bethesda's original. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="631"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">Oblivion images on Virtuos website</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Taurnil/">u/Taurnil</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Eurogamer has corroborated that these files are currently being hosted on Virtuos' servers, for now. We've also contacted Bethesda for more.</p>
<p>Word of an Oblivion remake or remaster first popped up back in 2020, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">references to the project in a leaked internal Microsoft document</a>. A further leak in 2023, from a former employee of Virtuos, confirmed the game was in development at the studio, and was being built using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-reportedly-set-for-imminent-reveal">the leaks have come thick and fast</a>, with an imminent reveal expected. Additionally, back in January, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">Virtuos employee updated their LinkedIn profile to mention a not-so-mysterious "unannounced Unreal Engine 5 remake"</a>, with newly reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery, hit reaction and a fresh HUD.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. I fear that ship has now sailed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The long-running Metal Gear in Concert series will finally get a UK premiere on 1st November 2025, at London's Royal Albert Hall.
</p>
<p>
Metal Gear Solid voice talent Stefanie Joosten (Quiet) and Donna Burke (iDroid) will make special guest appearances, while the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra performs excerpts from the series' soundtrack and "iconic songs".
</p>
<p>
If you're a fan of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s stealth action series, you'll be able to listen to tracks such as Encounter and Father and Son, plus songs such as The Best is Yet to Come, Snake Eater and Heavens Divide.
</p>
<p>
For a taster, here's Burke belting out Sins of the Father from the 2020 Metal Gear in Concert performance held in Tokyo. It's stirring stuff.

<p>
Metal Gear in Concert began in Osaka in 2017, and has since been performed most years in Japan. Subsequent performances have been toured internationally to Paris, New York and Los Angeles - but never to the UK, until this year.
</p>
<p>
Tempted? Tickets for the event's matinee (at 2.30pm) and evening (at 7.30pm) performances on 1st November will go on general sale at 10am this Thursday, 17th April via the <a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/events/2025/metal-gear-in-concert">Royal Albert Hall ticket site</a>. 
</p>
<p>Kojima may have now left the Metal Gear series behind, but he is making a return to its genre for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">the mysterious upcoming Physint, a fresh action-espionage game and movie</a> set to arrive at some point for PlayStation 5, following the upcoming launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>, Ubisoft's beleaguered pirate adventure? Having been announced in 2017, the game finally released in February of last year after numerous delays and setbacks. However, Skull and Bones failed to make positive waves on its debut, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">players calling out the underwhelming gameplay and poorly designed end game</a>, among other gripes.</p>
<p>Since its release, Skull and Bones has pretty much fallen off the radar, to be honest. At the time of writing, the game currently boasts <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/">221 players on Steam</a>, and while that is obviously not a complete overview (the game released on other platforms, as well) it still isn't an especially auspicious number .</p>
<p>But despite all this, Ubisoft is still updating Skull and Bones (perhaps tinkering away with the engine and such while it gets ready for the yet-to-be-announced, but much desired and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">heavily rumoured piratical remake of Assassin's Creed Black Flag</a>).</p>

<p>Last night, Skull and Bones' team released patch notes for the first season of the game's second year, known as Ascent into Chaos. This new season kicks off today, 15th April, and includes things like a new ship (a Schooner), a new status effect (Shell-Shocked), new upgrade tree and a new pet in the form of a tiger cub.</p>
<p>Item Ascension will also arrive this season, with the accompanying lore blurb reading:</p>
<p>"The Indian Ocean is set ablaze by the war between the Megacorporations, with each side looking to gain an advantage over the other by using increasingly powerful weapons. The origins of these ascended weapons remain a mystery, but what is known is that acquiring them may be vital to surviving the coming onslaught."</p>
<p>You will need to have made your way up to Infamy Tier 9 at a minimum to be able to make use of Item Ascension. When you reach this, though, you can expect to recieve some mail which will enable you to begin the Ascension and Modification quest. Once you do that, you will then need to pop over to  the Blacksmith to unlock the Item Ascension feature.</p>
<p>There are three modification grades, Ubisoft explains. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic - General improvements</li>
<li>Advanced - Noteworthy improvements</li>
<li>Special - Powerful improvements with unique properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Modification Slots, meanwhile, are assigned based on the weapon rarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common - 2 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Uncommon - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Rare - 2 Basic, 1 Special</li>
<li>Epic - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find full details in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/19T7NArKvzO1MofftUXPDi">Ubisoft's Skull and Bones blog post</a>.</p>
<p>In an accompanying Skull and Bones: Year 2 Showcase video, senior community developer Alexis Cretton thanked the game's community, adding Ubisoft was "committed to support Skull and Bones for years ahead".</p>
<p>You can check out the full showcase below.</p>

<p>On its release last year, our Matt complimented Skull and Bones' "beautiful world" and "bombastic ship-to-ship combat". However, he was less enamoured with the game's boring busywork and tedious traversal.</p>
<p>As he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">wrote in Eurogamer's two star Skull and Bones review</a>: "No game, let alone a swashbuckling pirate adventure, should be so consistently dull."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-has-a-buried-page-that-totals-all-your-spending-if-you-dare-to-look<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Video games can be an expensive hobby, but how much money have you actually spent? Steam has you covered.</p>
<p>Buried away in the help section of Valve's PC game platform is a page called External Funds Used, which provides a total of all your expenditure.</p>
<p>It's not a new page, but it is hard to find and certainly proves interesting once you know it exists. Users on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1jycup7/comment/mmxdv4f/">reddit</a> recently explained how to find it (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/steam-total-account-spend/">PC Gamer</a>), though whether you want to is up to your discretion.</p>
<p>If you're intrigued, head over to: help &gt; steam support &gt; my account &gt; data related to your steam account &gt; external funds used.</p>
<p>Funds are listed under different categories, though TotalSpend is the big one. OldSpend is for funds applied before April 2015, PWSpend is for players whose accounts are linked to Perfect World for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">CS:GO</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and ChinaSpend is funds applied from China.</p>
<p>Steam hosts regular sales, but even with big discounts they're likely responsible for a high proportion of sales when they come around.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-every-single-steam-sale-event-planned-for-2025">Valve confirmed all the Steam sales planned for 2025</a>. Next up will be the Sokoban Fest from 21st - 28th April, followed by Wargames Fest from 28th April - 5th May.</p>
<p>The biggest, though, will be the Steam Summer Sale, running from 26th June - 10th July.</p>
<p>In other Steam data news, Valve released its Steam Hardware and Software Survey in March, which revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/50-of-all-steam-users-in-february-were-chinese-speaking">Chinese-speaking users now account for half of the entire userbase</a>.</p>
<p>The platform also has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games">new feature that warns users of potentially abandoned early access games</a>.</p>
<p>Have you checked your total spend? Were you surprised?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A Minecraft Movie has now amassed more than $550m (£415m) globally since its launch less than two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/a-minecraft-movie-500-million-the-amateur-china-global-international-box-office-1236367389/">Deadline</a> reports that $270m (£204m) of the film's haul comes from overseas, with the UK its biggest market outside of the US, followed by China, Germany, Mexico and Australia.
</p>
<p>
The viral success of the film has caused it to overperform expectations despite limp critical reviews. In short: kids love it, and have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">loved going to throw popcorn in the air during its meme-tastic Chicken Jockey scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while Minecraft is proving popular, there's still some way for it to go to beat The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which wound up earning $1.3bn (£982m) during the same spring release window back in 2023, setting the record for the highest-grossing film based on a video game. 
</p>
<p>
Can Minecraft beat Nintendo's mascot? Possibly - it seems like Minecraft still has plenty of life left in it yet, even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the film does now include a warning message asking audiences to behave</a>, in an attempt to curb feral behaviour (and possibly because Warner Bros doesn't want a lawsuit involving animal cruelty after someone brought a live chicken to a showing).
</p>
<p>
Regardless of where A Minecraft Movie ultimately ends up, it's happy days for Warner Bros, which is reportedly already in talks over a potential sequel. And, as is the norm for movies hoping to become franchises these days, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">A Minecraft Movie naturally ends with a teaser for what could come next</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A former developer who worked on the cancelled PlayStation console exclusive Concord has called out online commenters comparing it with Bungie's recently showcased Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">Bungie revealed more about its next shooter at the weekend</a> including its release date: 23rd September.

<p>"Many players know about Concord, and what happened with that project. Concord failed to inspire players, and the message was heard loud and clear," the developer admitted.</p>
<p>"It was gut wrenching to see our project fail, and be the laughing stock of many online. I have learned that failure is what drives me to succeed. No one feels as bad as the people who put their time on the line, hoping it will entertain the masses of gamers across the globe. I am not asking for pity, or even sympathy because, after all this is the name of the game, you win or lose. The margin for success is very thin. I took a chance, and lost.</p>
<p>"Some of you probably smell blood in the water, and probably want to roast me for no longer lurking, and exposing myself. I hope you don't, and see that people create these projects, and work very hard to be the next big thing. Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream, gave me hope, and excitement for what is to come for Marathon.</p>
<p>"I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed."</p>
<p>The developer concluded: "I worked on Concord, and did my best. We came up short, please don't punish others for our mistakes. We are all human beings who are trying to create something special, and Marathon is no different. Be kind, and be cool, as video games are meant to be fun."</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Concord was taken offline just two weeks after its release</a> due to low sales and player numbers, as Sony and developer Firewalk Studios admitted "our initial launch didn't land".</p>
<p>The following month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Firewalk was closed</a>. It seems unlikely Concord will make a return.</p>
<p>Marathon, then, is the next big hope for both Sony and Bungie, as the Destiny developer seeks to prove its online shooter and live-service prowess, and follow in the footsteps of last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, which became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>.</p>
