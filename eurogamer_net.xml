            <p>Animal rights campaign group PETA is calling on Nintendo to remove <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s Cow's nose ring.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.peta.org/news/peta-mario-kart-world-controversy-cow-nose/">statement</a>, PETA said no real-world cow would sport Cow's "goofy grin" if they were forced to wear a ring, "a tool of cruelty that causes lasting pain and discomfort", and wrote to Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa earlier this week to explain that "nose rings are forcibly pierced through one of the most sensitive parts of a cow's body", often used to drag or control cows ans bulls "to their deaths".</p>

<p>"We know Mario Kart World is just a game – and that's exactly why Cow’s nose ring needs to go," the organisation said. "Mario Kart is supposed to be a fun escape, not a reminder of the painful tools used on cows in the meat and dairy industries. No one wants to think about animal suffering while zipping around a race track."</p><p>The dairy industry also reportedly clips "spiked nose rings on baby cows so that the comforting act of nursing from their mother causes her pain and the baby is rejected and kicked away. To control bulls, a chain might be fastened from the nose ring to the bull’s horn for even more pain-driven control".</p>
<p>"It's not a style choice," the organisation added, "It's a cruel tool used to control and hurt cows in the meat and dairy industries, which causes lasting pain and discomfort."</p>
<p>PETA has previously taken action against other games, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, which it said encouraged "abusive behaviour toward fish and insects [...] tearing wildlife out of their homes and display them in cramped cases in a museum". It's also launched campaigns against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> and Hunting Simulator 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo sold 5.82m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of Mario Kart World, meaning the launch title had an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 will reportedly release on 14th November, 2025, and there's still no <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> release planned.</p>
<p>That's according to noted and highly reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383">Dealabs</a> leaker billbil-kun, who suggests the latest instalment of Activision's tentpole franchise will be coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series, but will not be available on Switch at launch.</p>

<p>We noted Nintendo Switch 2 was notably absent from the launch platform line-up when the game was revealed during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-team-committed-to-bringing-series-to-nintendo-as-black-ops-7-release-omits-switch-2">Summer Games Fest</a>, running counter to Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-agreement-for-call-of-duty">10-year promise to launch Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms on "the same day as Xbox, with full feature and content parity"</a> if its gargantuan $69 billion offer to buy Activision Blizzard was approved. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Which it was</a>, of course.</p>
<p>At the time, however, sources confirmed to Eurogamer: "We're committed to getting the franchise on Switch. Both teams [are] working on it. Will share details when ready."</p>
<p>Dealabs posits that all this release information will be confirmed at next week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, including news of a physical release (with a disc included) and pre-orders set to go live on 20th August, following a reveal the night before at Opening Night Live. While U.S./UK pricing has yet to be leaked or confirmed, the leaker suggests it'll retail for €79.99 in Europe. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-bullishly-hiking-xbox-games-to-80-microsoft-confirms-u-turn-starting-with-the-outer-worlds-2">Xbox has, of course, previously pledged not to raise prices past $70 USD</a>.</p>
<p>Former Activision Blizzard president Mike Ybarra thinks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> will "boot stomp" Call of Duty this year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year">that this will push the CoD series to stop being "lazy"</a>.</p>

        <p>"Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue," Roblox said</p>

            <p>The U.S. state of Louisiana is suing Roblox, alleging it facilitates "the sexual exploitation of Louisiana's children".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Article/322">statement</a>, Louisiana Attorney General, Liz Murrill, claimed Roblox "endangers the safety of the children" of the state, writing: "Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritises user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety.</p>
<p>"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home."</p>
<p>The legal papers then names several "highly inappropriate" Roblox mini games such as Escape to Epstein Island, Public Bathroom Simulator, and Diddy Party.</p>
<p>"These games and others are often filled with sexually explicit material and simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape. A recent report even revealed a group of 3,334 members openly traded child pornography and solicited sexual acts from minors," the Louisiana announcement says, <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">citing a 2024 report</a>.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Roblox is violating Louisiana law - choosing profits over child safety. It's basically open season for sex predators on this platform. <a href="https://t.co/fGSQ8IFgWw">pic.twitter.com/fGSQ8IFgWw</a></p>— Attorney General Liz Murrill (@AGLizMurrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1956343934877090064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>The lawsuit claims that while Roblox requires children to have permission from their parents or guardians to open an account, the company "does nothing to confirm or document that parental permission has been given, no matter how young a child is. Nor does Defendant require a parent to confirm the age given when a child signs up to use Roblox".</p>
<p>"[Roblox] has access to biometric age verification software that requires the user to take a photo of a government-issued ID along with a real-time selfie photo that is then verified through artificial intelligence," the AG adds. "However, while Defendant utilises this software for other purposes, Defendant intentionally does not utilise this feature when new accounts are created."</p>
<p>In a press conference announcing the lawsuit, Murrill said: "So [Roblox] have chosen profits over child safety. It's basically open season for sex predators on this app. For this reason, and all of the others that we've talked about today, Roblox is violating Louisiana law, and that's why we filed this lawsuit."</p>
<p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsui">said</a> it does not comment on pending litigation, but stressed "it would like to address erroneous claims and misconceptions about our platform, our commitment to safety, and our overall safety track record".</p>
<p>"Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn STEM skills, play, and imagine, and have a safe experience on our platform. Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue. No system is perfect, and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users."</p><p>It added that it is constantly innovating safety tools and launching new safeguards, has taken an industry-leading stance on age-based communication, and serves players of which 64 percent are aged 13 or over. It also dedicates substantial resources to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behaviour, and collaborates with law enforcement and government agencies, as well as mental health organisations, child safety organisations, and parental advocacy groups "to keep users safe on the platform".</p>
<p>"We know safety is critically important to families, and we strive to empower our community of parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children. This includes a suite of easy-to-use parental controls to provide parents with more control and clarity on what their kids and teens are doing on Roblox," the statement concludes.</p>
<p>"We aim to create one of the safest online environments for users, a goal not only core to our founding values but contrary to certain assertions, one we believe is critical to our long-term vision and success. We understand there is always more work to be done, and we are committed to making Roblox a safe and positive environment for all users."</p>
