            <p>RoboCop: Rogue City's standalone expansion - known as Unfinished Business - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>It'll launch across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/">Steam</a> on 17th July, the team announced today.</p>
<p>The expansion begins where Rogue City left off, although developer Teyon promises you won't need to have played Rogue City to still enjoy Unfinished Business.</p>

<p>"While RoboCop continues policing the streets, OCP are working on a new project, the OmniTower, a housing complex designed for the residents evicted from their homes as the corporation proceeds to make way for Delta City," reads Unfinished Business' official blurb.</p>
<p>"A group of mercenaries tears into the Metro West precinct, leaving after stealing components from RoboCop's medical chair. Their next target, the OmniTower. The tower can serve as a potential power source, which, combined with those stolen components, would give the mercenaries access to all OCP's technology, including RoboCop.Pulling off this plan will take time, so they've seized control of the tower, turning each floor into a dangerous maze of enemies, traps, and bullets that you'll have to contend with if you want to retain control of yourself."</p>
<p>The team warns that as players ascend the tower, though, "ghosts" from Alex Murphy's past will come back to haunt him. You see, one of those mercenaries - in fact, their leader - used to be a colleague of Murphy's, so there is a personal connection here. And, while their goal of protecting Old Detroit may be the same, "their motives differ". Ooh!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/24/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-coming-to-ps5-july-17/">per a PlayStation Blog post</a>, there will be a flashback sequence for players to work through on the expansion's release. Meanwhile, along with RoboCop and Alex Murphy, there will also be the chance to play as former OCP scientist Miranda Hale. </p>

<p>As a reminder, if you do want to give RoboCop: Rogue City a go before Unfinished Business arrives, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-ps-plus-games-for-april">game is part of this month's PlayStation Plus games</a>.</p>
<p>We awarded RoboCop: Rogue City three stars on its release. "While Rogue City might not do much that's new, it is for the most part a convincing facsimile of the old," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robocop-rogue-city-review">Eurogamer's RoboCop: Rogue City review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
