            <p>2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-top-notch-hack-and-slash-stumbles-off-the-battlefield">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>, which has just celebrated its first anniversary, was <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dynasty-warriors-origins/">generally considered a big success</a> and a much-needed evolution of the long-running hack-and-slash series. Later this week, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dynasty-warriors-origins-visions-of-four-heroes-official-reveal-trailer-state-of-play">Visions of Four Heroes DLC</a> and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL69vFOt_lM">Nintendo Switch 2 port</a> are launching, and a recent interview with producer Tomohiko Sho has teased what might be coming next.</p>
<p>We've known for some time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> sold quite well, with Koei Tecmo itself <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/news/koei-tecmos-dynasty-warriors-origins-sells-over-1-million-units-worldwide/">confirming on February 2025</a> the game had crossed 1m sales during its first month on sale. On top of the aforementioned DLC and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> port, the general assumption (though <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-developers-eye-more-crossovers-hint-at-possible-sequel/">it hasn't been confirmed</a>) is that developer Omega Force is already looking at developing a sequel. Now, Sho has revealed during <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/63110">an interview with Famitsu</a> (with the relevant excerpt <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/19385-dynasty-warriors-origins-continuation-may-be-expanded-from-duology-to-trilogy">translated by RPG Site</a>) that a single follow-up might not be big enough to tell the whole story the devs want to tell.</p>
<p>The producer has been sitting on those thoughts for a while, it seems: "I thought of making a duology where we would depict up until the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. But as we ended the development, the game depicted up until the Battle of Chi Bi with much more density than we guessed… In that case, if we maintain this density in the sequel, it would be impossible to depict up until the Battle of Wuzhang Plains (strained laugh). That’s why in the middle of the development, I ended up thinking that we would have to make it into a trilogy."</p>
<p>Traditionally, Dynasty Warriors games have covered (repeatedly) a very large portion of the Chinese Three Kingdoms period, starting with the Yellow Turban Rebellion in the 180s and taking players to the Battle of Wuzhang Plains in 234 AD. More recent games took us a bit further in order to also tell the Fall of Shu Kingdom in 264 AD. It all involves heroes (as well as villains) sending hordes of soldiers flying with all sorts of weapons, but at its core, it's a massive historical drama.</p><p>With Origins, the main pitch from a narrative perspective was to spend more time with each part of the larger story. The game goes up to the Battle of Chi Bi / Red Cliffs in 208 AD. The expectation was to have the rest of the period covered in just one sequel, but looking at the density of the content and intertwined story arcs, we're inclined to support Sho's tentative decision to go bigger and longer. Two more entries instead of one would also allow Omega Force to better iterate on the many changes to Dynasty Warriors' traditional combat system and the RPG layer that added much-welcome depth.</p>
<p>"I kindly want you to buy this DLC, and I want even more people to play the base game," the producer added, suggesting a final decision hasn't been made and encouraging fans to vote with their wallets.</p>

            <p>The release date for Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon has seemingly leaked via an Xbox Store pre-order trailer.</p>
<p>According to this trailer, Marathon will be released on 5th March. There was also mention of a Deluxe Edition.</p>

<p>The trailer itself has since been removed from its original source, though the footage with Marathon's release date can still be found online.</p>
<p>"Infil into the dark sci-fi world of Tau Ceti 4: A derelict colony rife with rival Runners, hostile UESC security forces, and unpredictable environments. Play with your crew, as a solo Runner, or form uneasy alliances with proximity chat,"  reads <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28">Marathon's official blurb</a>.</p>
<p>"Scavenge, buildcraft, and take on greater PvPvE challenges - culminating with the derelict Marathon ship hanging above."</p>

<p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Bungie confirmed Marathon would be released sometime in March</a>, though at this time it didn't give a specific day.</p>
<p>After announcing its March release window, Marathon's art director and veteran Bungie developer Joseph Cross announced his departure from the company. "I'm incredibly proud of the visual world we built for Marathon. Getting support at this scale for something a bit different is rare, and the art team at Bungie is the best in the biz. I'll be enjoying playing the game as a fan with all of you," Cross said last month.</p>
<p>"Massive thank you to everyone who has supported through all of it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">Cross confirmed his departure from the studio was his own decision</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">it was discovered the extraction shooter used artist Antireal's work without permission</a>.</p>

            <p>It's safe to say <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is 2026's biggest indie hit so far, with the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">securely funding the next two years of development</a> before it was even out into early access last week. It seems the idea of a proper competitor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> was a golden one, but that isn't stopping modders and passionate tinkerers from putting Minecraft <em>inside</em> Hytale.</p>
<p>On 17th January, X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/iamcxv711">iamcxv7</a> (Sadat Sahib/ssquadteam <a href="https://github.com/ssquadteam">on GitHub</a>) posted he'd gotten Minecraft running in Hytale's world map through "pure pixel data manipulation," which sounds pretty bonkers and signals the new blocky sensation may have a bright future ahead when it comes to modding and all sorts of experiments.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The achievement was also shared <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qflbs7/got_minecraft_030_running_in_hytale_map/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on Reddit</a>, where the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qflbs7/comment/o05iv7j/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">full explanation of the process</a> was explained: "No GPU, no OpenGL calls - just pure CPU-based 3D rendering". In short, no one who's really into software and creative problem-solving knows what he's saying, but it's all impressive if you're aware of the basics. At the time of writing, the game "runs entirely server-side at 35 FPS with a resolution of 320x240," so this isn't a trick of playing a short gameplay video via Hytale and calling it a day. It is an old version of Minecraft (0.30) though. That doesn't exactly make it any less impressive, however.</p>
<p>Further digging through <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SSquadTeam/submitted/">Sahib's Reddit profile</a> also reveals other stunners, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qfp9xb/gameboy_gameboy_colour_emulator_working_in_hytale/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">GB and GBC emulation</a> working through the same process (quite convincingly, I must add) and the entirety of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qg9lah/fully_functioning_windows_95_inside_hytale_wip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Windows 95</a> reportedly running with no visible hiccups. And in case you (like us) were wondering, yes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hytale/comments/1qfdo8c/yes_it_runs_doom_wip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it runs Doom</a> as well. Now we're talking.</p><p>So far, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">Hytale is shaping up to be a heavy hitter</a> due to its bigger focus on RPG elements versus Minecraft and similar open-world crafting games. It must also be noted the game hasn't been released on Steam at the time of writing, making its success story on PC far more impressive as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Valve's platform becomes the go-to place for millions of gamers</a>.</p>

            <p>Former Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté is reportedly suing Ubisoft following a surprise and suspicious departure from the company last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté left Ubisoft in October</a> with the company claiming he'd chosen to leave but Côté claiming he was pushed out. <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio Canada</a> said Côté's lawsuit seeks CAD $1.3m (£698k) for a mixture of lost severance pay and "moral damages", and for Ubisoft to lift Côté's non-compete clause.</p>
<p>The lawsuit apparently claims (I can't independently find the filing) that problems began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-announce-new-subsidiary-vantage-studios-to-lead-development-for-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-franchises">when Ubisoft created new company Vantage Studios with Tencent</a> in October, to control its most valuable gaming properties. These include Assassin's Creed - the franchise Côté was leading, or so he thought. Côté quickly discovered that Vantage was hiring for a new role, Head of Franchises, that would effectively overrule him.</p>

<p>He alleges that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot blocked his application for the role because Côté was based in Canada and not France, and said he was offered a lower role as Head of Production instead. "Tense" discussions ensued and resulted in an offer for Côté to lead a "Creative House" looking after second-tier Ubisoft brands.</p>
<p>Côté, "disoriented, confused, and affected by the anxiety-inducing situation", according to the filing, took a break from the company to think and reflect.</p>
<p>Ubisoft management apparently told him that at the end of his two week period of reflection, he'd have to make a choice whether or not to accept the position offered, which Côté saw as an "unacceptable demotion" and therefore a form of "disguised dismissal", so he demanded severance pay in accordance with that.</p><p>Côté had been expected back at work on 13th October but the lawsuit said Ubisoft told him not to show while it formulated a response. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">The company then suddenly announced he had left the company of his own accord</a>, seeking new opportunities elsewhere, which the lawsuit claims Ubisoft did to avoid paying severance and to apply a non-compete clause. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">Côté wrote an emotional message at the time,</a> claiming he did not walk away but was asked to step aside.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has not yet responded to the lawsuit filing.</p>
<p>Marc-Alexis Côté worked at Ubisoft for 20 years, spending 15 of those on Assassin's Creed. He was a lead level designer on Brotherhead, director of 3, and then led Ubisoft Quebec as it made Black Flag add-on Freedom Cry, and Syndicate. He was senior producer of Odyssey, and then in 2022, Côté stepped up to take control of the entire Assassin's Creed franchise, rebooting it somewhat and kicking off the new era with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Assassin's Creed Shadows, which launched in March last year</a>.</p>
