With The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered now exactly two weeks away from its PC release, Sony has detailed the platform-specific features it's implementing - and in the case of PSN requirements, <em>not</em> implementing. That's alongside word of new content coming to all platforms.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-features-and-new-no-return-content-detailed/">highlighted on the PlayStation Blog</a>, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for PC includes all the improvements seen in last year's PS5 version - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">Digital Foundry called "accomplished"</a>. That's in addition to the newly announced platform-specific stuff, including support for Nvidia DLSS 3 Super Resolution, AMD FSR 3.1 and AMD FSR 4 (including upscaling and frame generation), DirectStorage, and Ultrawide monitors. Unsurprisingly, there's also full gamepad support, and a variety of control customisation options for keyboard and mouse players.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, tweakable settings include VSync and framerate cap options ('uncapped' being one of them), LOD distance range, plus adjustable quality options for textures, volumetrics, shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion. The PC version also features various graphics settings and presets - as detailed in Sony's system requirements below.

The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches for PC via Steam and Epic on 3rd April, and Sony reiterates - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">previously announced</a> - the mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements that have controversially dogged the company's PC releases over the last year will no longer apply. However, as an incentive to sign in with PSN, players that do so get 50 in-game points to activate bonus features, as well as a new Ellie skin featuring Jordan A. Mun's jacket from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.
</p>
<p>
Sony notes the jacket will also be available to PlayStation 5 players as part of Remastered's 2.0 update, which comes to the console alongside the PC release. This also brings new additions to the roguelike No Return mode, including two new characters - The Last of Us Part 1's Bill and Marlene (sporting the Smuggler and Risk-Taker playstyles respectively) - plus four new maps.
</p>
<p>
There's Overlook, set high above Seattle, as well as an abandoned elementary school map, simply titled School. Streets, meanwhile, takes places in the overgrown Seattle neighbourhood of Hillcrest, while Nest is the building teeming with Infected previously explored by Abby. All this, including new Trophies and additional bug fixes, will be available on both platforms.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's PC and 2.0 release comes just ahead of The Last of Us TV adaptation's highly anticipated season two. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprised of seven episodes</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">begins on 13th April</a> - and if you'd like a cheeky peek at what's to come, you'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-hbo-the-last-of-us-part-2s-trailer-is-here-and-april-cant-come-quickly-enough">find the latest trailer here</a>.
