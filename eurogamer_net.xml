<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a>'s next season is named Dual Destiny, and will kick off next week on Tuesday 3rd December. 
</p>
<p>
Its logo features obvious black and white-themed branding, which should perhaps not be a surprise considering Pok√©mon Black and White region Unova is next on the docket to be featured in the game's Go Tour event series. Dual Destiny finishes on 4th March, around the time we'd expected Go Tour Unova to be held.
</p>
<p>
So, why "Dual Destiny"? In a press briefing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/niantic">Niantic</a> said the name was designed to reflect "opposites coming together to strengthen one another and celebrate two sides of a whole", which is nice.
</p>
<p>
In terms of content, much of what is to come will be announced over the coming days, but perhaps the headline for now is the early introduction of teacup Pok√©mon Sinistea. This fits the Dual Destiny branding as it has two different types - Antique and Phony - depending on whether it comes with a stamp of authenticity. (Maybe it should have been called Authencitea?)
</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with Sinistea - a Ghost-type Pok√©mon that debuted in Pok√©mon Sword and Shield - it looks like a small chipped teacup. Its Pok√©dex entry describes it thus: "The soul of someone who died alone possessed some leftover tea." It evolves into Polteageist: "The tea that composes Polteageist's body has a distinct and enjoyable flavor. Drinking too much, however, can be fatal."</p>
<p>
From the start of the season, Red and Blue-striped Basculin will now be Shiny-possible and available in 7km eggs. Oddly, though, the form you obtain will relate to where the gift is <em>hatched</em>, not from where it was sent. (Here in the UK, you'll obtain Blue Basculin while on the West side of the Prime Meridian line, and Red Basculin on the East.)
</p>
<p>
Gigantamax Lapras will also make its debut in Max Battles, while Go Battle League will feature avatar items based on Unova Elite Four member Grimsley. Dragalge, Bibarel, Glliscor, Starmie and others will receive additional moves.

            <p>Improvements to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> are still not ready, despite Remedy today releasing a new update for the game across all platforms.</p>
<p>As with a handful of games, playing Alan Wake 2 on Sony's more powerful console results in performance issues, which players are waiting to be patched.</p>
<p>"The PlayStation 5 update (1.200.005) does not contain anything PlayStation 5 Pro specific, but we wanted to acknowledge that we are seeing your feedback," wrote Remedy in a post on X. "We are still researching a few things on the Pro when it comes to improved performance. We'll keep you posted. As PS5 Pro support was a work of many months, it will take the team longer than a few weeks for changes and improvements. Thank you for understanding!"</p>

<p>Still, the <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/">new patch</a> does include a number of improvements and fixes. For instance, Alan's hair now gets messier and when using the Classic Outfit it gets "properly soaked". He also now wears his wedding ring - bit awkward that.</p><p>Other changes include collectibles from DLC The Lake House appearing in Saga's Mind Place; the Night Springs theme is available in the Writer's Room after finishing any Night Springs chapter in the main campaign; gyro controls have been improved; and the "Thrower" enemies are less frustrating thanks to less frequent movement and teleportation.</p>

<p>Ahead of the PS5 Pro's release, Remedy released a detailed blog post explaining all the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-ps5-pro-enhanced-label-will-see-30fps-quality-mode-with-added-ray-tracing">improvements the Enhanced label would bring</a>. That included a 30fps and 4K Quality Mode with added ray tracing, and a 4K Performance Mode at 60fps.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-alan-wake-2-how-does-ps5-pro-handle-one-of-the-best-looking-games-of-this-generation">as Digital Foundry explored</a>, the PS5 Pro's PSSR upscaler provides mixed results, while the game actually runs worse in Performance Mode.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-review">The Lake House DLC</a> arrived last month too, though it "feels a little lacking compared to the main game" reads our review.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
