            <p>Competitive ITV show Hell's Kitchen is now blowing up as an experience in Roblox, with a cartoony version of Gordon Ramsay at the fore.</p>
<p>Since its debut last month, ITV's first-ever Roblox experience has had over 20m visits from aspiring chefs, and boasts 450k daily active users happy to have the show's celebrity chef express disdain at their dishes.</p>
<p>As with Hell's Kitchen on telly, those who participate in the official Roblox experience will be popped onto either the Red or the Blue team. And, while I haven't seen word that Ramsay will call users an "Idiot Sandwich", his Roblox counterpart still shares his disappointment if food isn't up to snuff.</p>

<p>"By blending the unique essence of Hell’s Kitchen with the immersive possibilities of Roblox, we're offering players a fresh way to engage with the brand and create their own culinary adventures," <a href="https://www.itv.com/presscentre/media-releases/zoo-55-and-metavision-launch-itvs-first-ever-experience-roblox-gordon-ramsays-hells">claimed</a> Ashley Lewis, boss of the experience's developer Metavision.</p>
<p>"We've got an exciting 2025 roadmap for the experience and can't wait to show the community what we have in store next."</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adding-further-parental-controls-as-its-belated-push-to-improve-child-safety-continues">Roblox announced further tools designed to improve the safety of its young audience</a>. These tools included the ability for parents to remotely manage their child's account, view their child's friends list and limit the amount of time made available to play.</p><p>This move followed frequent criticism that the platform was not doing enough to ensure the safety of its audience, which is predominantly children. In July of last year, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Roblox itself had reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation in 2023</a>, and that more than two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in-game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Origin, EA's universally-disliked PC storefront and launcher launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reveals-steam-rival-origin">back in 2011</a>, will finally shut down this year, on 17th April.
</p>
<p>
EA has, of course, long since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-ditching-origin-brand-with-new-ea-desktop-app-as-part-of-ongoing-rebranding-efforts">replaced Origin with the EA App</a>, which isn't much better. 
</p>
<p>
From mid-April, any PC users still using Origin will need to switch in order to continue accessing their library of games and gameplay data.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/">statement</a> on EA's support website, the publisher states that it is finally killing off Origin as "Microsoft has stopped supporting 32-bit software". 
</p>
<p>
"If you use Origin, you need to upgrade to the EA app, which requires a 64-bit version of Windows," EA notes.
</p>
<p>
If you have a relatively new PC with a 64-bit version of Windows, downloading the EA App now and ensuring your game saves are ported over is probably a good idea. 
</p>
<p>
Cloud saves should carry across automatically, though games without cloud support will need manual save migration. 
</p>
<p>
Don't have a 64-bit PC? Then it's bad news. "To run a 64-bit version of Windows, make sure your PC has a 64-bit-capable processor," EA helpfully states. "If your PC doesn’t have one, you'll need to use a newer computer to play your games on the EA app."
</p>
<p>
EA typically <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-ea-is-returning-to-steam">also now launches its PC games on Steam</a>, of course, including last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.
