            <p>
It's seven months since the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">massive 1.6 update</a> and developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is still introducing new features and fixes for the beloved farming life sim; and that continues with today's 1.6.9 update - released alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-version-16-console-release-date">1.6 for consoles</a> - which, among other things, adds a new friend to retrieve lost items.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, once Stardew Valley's 1.6.9 update is installed, players who've unlocked and then lost a unique item will find a special shop now materialises in the secret woods at midnight. Items that can't be re-obtained any other way will be available to purchase here for 10,000g, and Barone notes anyone can buy lost items in multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, players can now put legendary fish in fish ponds, albeit with a limit of one per pond. These will then produce legendary fish roe with fish having a unique water colour. There are also new Easter eggs, dialogue tweaks, JojoMart work portraits for Sam and Shane, and the ability to place beds and sleep in any constructed building (as long as they permit furniture). Additionally, objects dropped in water now float, meaning there's a short time to retrieve them.

<p>
That's on top of balance changes and quality of life updates, including improved automatic save game recovery and tweaks that'll resend most achievements, recipes, and important mail if players manage to miss them. Stardew Valley's 1.6.9 update is available now on PC, and <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/">full patch notes can be found on Barone's website</a>. Additionally, all 1.6.9 features are included in the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-soon-let-players-drink-mayonnaise">mayonnaise-guzzling</a> 1.6 update, which arrives on consoles and mobile today.
</p><p>
Whether that's it for Stardew Valley updates remains to be seen; Barone hasn't shared his plans for the farming life sim beyond his 1.6 console release, but he did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">previously admit</a> he'd been so "committed to finalising Stardew 1.6", he hadn't done any additional work on his next game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, "in a long time". So probably don't expect news on that anytime soon.

            <p>
Remember being told in the school playground that holding Down and A when you saw your Pokéball wobble meant you had a better chance of catching the creature inside?
</p>
<p>
It was all nonsense, obviously, but that didn't stop the conspiracies from spreading. As an avid <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> player, I've seen similar rubbish spread via word of mouth at meetups, from players who insist you'll have better luck if you quit battles at a certain time/spend money/stand on one leg, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
And so, with the launch of Pokémon TCG Pocket, it's unsurprising to see the same kinds of conspiracy theories spreading once again. Here, as you'd expect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">from a game essentially about paying to open digital card packs</a>, the prevailing theories are all based on how to get better cards. 
</p>
<p>
First, one that seems like it has a chance of actually working. X user MetaTradingCo has suggested using your phone's screen recording feature to capture the game's Wonder Pick shuffle, so you can play it back in slow motion and work out where specific cards land. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">𝗣𝗼𝗸𝗲́𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗖𝗚 𝗣𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝗛𝗮𝗰𝗸<br>1️⃣ 𝖲𝖼𝗋𝖾𝖾𝗇 𝖱𝖾𝖼𝗈𝗋𝖽 𝗌𝗁𝗎𝖿𝖿𝗅𝖾<br>2️⃣ 𝖯𝗅𝖺𝗒𝖻𝖺𝖼𝗄 𝗂𝗇 𝗌𝗅𝗈𝗐-𝗆𝗈𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇<br>3️⃣ 𝖶𝗂𝗇 <a href="https://t.co/hKJjtGvXGE">pic.twitter.com/hKJjtGvXGE</a></p>— 𝙆𝙃𝙄𝙍𝙊 (@MetaTradingCo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaTradingCo/status/1852936365576786265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Several theories spotted by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-conspiracy-theories-gacha/">ComicBook</a> include one that X user hawaiinguy808 describes as a "pretty significant glitch". 
</p>
<p>
"If you do a Wonder Pick and skip the shuffling cutscene and immediately choose the spot that had the card you want, you will get it 90 percent of the time," they wrote, posting footage of an Articuno EX card as proof. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>There’s a pretty significant glitch in Pokémon TCG right now that I figured out.</p><p>If you do a wonder pick and skip the shuffling cutscene and immediately choose the spot that had the card you want, you will get it 90% of the time.</p><p>I’ve now done this with 10 rare ex’s <a href="https://t.co/FnRe2JhRRK">pic.twitter.com/FnRe2JhRRK</a></p></div>— USOVINNY🇼🇸 (@hawaiinguy808) <a href="https://twitter.com/hawaiinguy808/status/1851895072557867193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Next up, "the folded crimp trick". This involves fondling your digital card pack until it faces sideways, then looking for a specific wrinkle in its packaging. 
</p>
<p>
"If you see it look a bit folded/wavy instead of perfectly straight, there's a hit in the pack," X user SteeloAndKri wrote. "It's not every time," they added. "Does seem to drastically increase hit rates though?"
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Holy crap. The folded crimp trick actually works. When you look at the packs, turn them sideways. Then look at the top of the pack.

While we wait for a Pokémon theory that does actually pan out, here's a look back at how the actual Pokémon Red and Blue catching mechanics operated behind the scenes. Did you know that you didn't actually need to lower a creature's health down to 1HP for the best chance at capturing it? Now you do.
