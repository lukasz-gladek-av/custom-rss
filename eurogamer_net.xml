            <p>The PC requirements for Mafia: The Old Country have been revealed.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country - the next game in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>'s Mafia series - is set to release for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 8th August.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available now, but if you are wondering which platform to plump for, perhaps the now-revealed PC specs will help you make up your mind (or, just allow you to check that your kit is up for the job). </p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> last year. Following its announcement, the developer confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">Hangar 13 said Mafia: The Old Country would be a "focused, linear" experience</a>, retailing at Â£45 for those of us in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has pushed back on the suggestion that AI-generated images have been used in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.
</p>
<p>
The statement comes after eagle-eyed viewers watching the game's recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWjkbAQOGY8">Nintendo Treehouse livestream</a> noticed in-game billboards by the sides of the racetrack that featured artwork similar in appearance to that made by generative AI.
</p>
<p>
"AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World," a Nintendo spokesperson told Eurogamer.

<p>
The images in question include artwork of a bridge, used on a billboard in a city area. It includes wonky lines and oddly-placed elements reminscent of an AI-generated image.
</p>
<p>
A second billboard next to this one features a work-in-progress skyscraper, with strangely-orientated floors and pathways, again similar to an image created using AI generation.

A third billboard features an image of an oddly-shaped car with unusually large windows that, once again, looks similar to something created by generative AI.
</p>

<p>
It should be noted that the version of Mario Kart World shown during the Nintendo Treehouse livestream was likely not the final version of the game, and it is normal for placeholder visuals to be present while a game is still in development.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see if these pieces of artwork make it into the game's launch version.
</p>
<p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s key launch title will arrive on 5th June, alongside Nintendo's new console. I played an hour of the game last month, and came away hugely impressed. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World reinvents the series, and feels like Switch 2's killer app</a>," I wrote.

            <p>Return to Silent Hill, the forthcoming film based on Konami's horror franchise, will be a "faithful adaptation" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to distributor Cineverse, which has acquired the rights for the film in the US for theatrical release (thanks <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/return-to-silent-hill-theatrical-release-1236391288/">Variety</a>).</p>
<p>Christophe Gans, who directed the 2006 Silent Hill film starring Sean Bean, will return for this new film, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">first announced back in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Said Gans: "I am delighted to partner with Cineverse, which has shown a genuine understanding of fanship. Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, Konami's iconic Silent Hill 2. I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."</p>
<p>"Silent Hill is one of the best video game franchises period and Christophe Gans did a phenomenal job capturing the atmosphere of the games once again with Return to Silent Hill," said Cineverse executive director of acquisitions Brandon Hill.</p>
<p>As previously reported back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">Return to Silent Hill will star Jeremy Irvine as James</a>, known for his roles in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Treadstone and War Horse.</p>
<p>The plot will follow "James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads a press release. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."</p>
<p>The film is yet to receive a release date.</p>
<p>Still, it's good timing following the success last year of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake, which faithfully recreated the PS1 horror classic.</p>
<p>"Against the odds, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has delivered a remake that both expands Silent Hill 2 in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer Silent Hill 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>By January this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">remake had sold over 2m copies</a> following its release in October. As part of its latest financial report, Konami yesterday revealed the Silent Hill series had total cumulative sales of 11.5m.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
