            <p>The annual cascade of Summer Game Fest broadcasts formally begins tonight with the Opening Showcase at 10pm UK time (11pm CEST/5pm EDT/2pm PDT). We'll report all of the major announcements from it here, as they happen, while also chatting with you. So grab a tea or a coffee, or something harder if you like, and join us for the show.</p>
<p>Tonight's Opening Showcase is expected to be a long one with a projected runtime of around two hours. It'll be hosted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, as ever, although he'll be joined this year by friend-of-Eurogamer Lucy James, which is nice. You'll know her from GameSpot.</p>
<p>Keighley has kept a tight lid on announcements for tonight, although a couple of <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1930630371760361955">promo reels for the show</a> have included footage from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, new James Bond game 007: First Light, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and a bunch of other games I don't immediately recognise. There's also been an uptick in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-just-got-a-sneaky-teaser-by-capcom-fans-believe">Resident Evil 9 speculation</a> ahead of the show, suggesting a possible unveiling tonight. Wouldn't that be nice?</p>

<p>This week's gaming festivities were kicked off on Wednesday by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">a PlayStation State of Play broadcast</a>, which unveiled 007: First Light to the world, resurrected Capcom's lost-in-development Pragmata, debuted Silent Hill F, revealed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lumines">Lumines</a> game, and more.</p>
<p>Tonight's Opening Showcase will be followed directly by Day of the Devs, and then by a packed weekend of broadcasts including an Xbox Showcase on Sunday at 6pm UK time. I'll return to live-report that show. We've compiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams#section-7">a full Summer Games Fest 2025 schedule</a> elsewhere on the site.</p>
<p>Join us shortly before 10pm UK time for the show. In the meantime, speculate away - what would you like to see?</p><div data-live="true">

    <p>Bit of exclusive behind the scenes action for you here: two possible header images for this blog that didn't make the cut. I have to say, I do like chicken Geoff.</p>

Good afternoon! Here we go, then. This is the big one. There should at least be an announcement or two in here to get excited about. Ian Higton just made a good point while asking what the rooster or chicken was about in the headline image, to which I said "I don't know" because I didn't put it there - the Summer Games Fest Twitter/X account did. Could it be a nod to Fable 4?
