            <p>Surgent Studios founder Abubakar Salim has detailed more on the studio's next game, Dead Take, and its exploration of Hollywood, which stars Neil Newbon and Ben Starr as its two leads.</p>
<p>Newbon is perhaps best known as Astarion from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, among other roles, while Ben Starr starred as Clive in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and, most recently, as Verso in the well-received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>Salim, himself an actor known for playing Bayek in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, described Dead Take to Eurogamer as "a reverse escape room" set in a Hollywood mansion. It's a psychological horror game that blurs the boundaries between film and game as it explores the theme of success.</p>

<p>"How far will you go for success?" asked Salim. "What are you willing to give for that? Can you separate the art from the artist?"</p>
<p>The fresh teaser trailer, above, hints at what we can expect from both gameplay and the actors' performances.</p>
<p>Salim explained players will be exploring the mansion to solve puzzles by finding live-action clips containing solutions that can be spliced together. It all sounds very Alan Wake meets <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/her-story">Her Story</a> to me, with Salim admitting both were influences.</p>
<p>Indeed, the use of live-action footage will reflect the game's themes and the focus on the acting profession. "You're going to be watching Ben and Neil do their work on screen as actors," said Salim. "And the reason why is because I didn't want them to hide behind animated characters, or 3D characters. I wanted to show you <em>them</em>. That's essentially something that I really wanted to hammer in as well, while using these guys, is because we're so used to seeing them behind Astarion or Clive. What are they as actors when you see them in the flesh?"</p>
<p>As such, the game's blurring of boundaries is a reflection of Salim's own career, balancing game development with working as an actor himself, most recently in Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon.</p>
<p>The studio's previous game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a> was a personal project for Salim, influenced by his own experience of grief after the passing of his father. Dead Take, initially at least, is a highly contrasting follow-up, but it's no less personal.</p>
<p>"Within Hollywood and acting, I've experienced and seen and heard a lot of stories of people who would do and give anything for stardom and are quite openly very comfortable with that," he said. "It's quite frightening."</p>
<p>Salim explained how the game will explore abuse of power and the toxicity of fame, which he, Starr, and Newbon have all witnessed in their careers. "I grew up with these guys," said Salim, who's worked together with both actors in the past. "Now we're in the games industry together, and yet the stories are always the same. That is essentially what I really wanted to depict and play with here, pulling from very raw and honest, truthful spaces."</p>
<p>He added: "The reason why it's with friends is because it deals with such raw and honest topics that are based on reality, and the only people you can really do that with, or explore that with, are people that you trust and rely on and are incredibly professional. It's very revealing."</p>

<figcaption>The change in tone from Tales of Kenzera is plain to see | <span>Image credit: <cite>Surgent Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Still, the horror tone of Dead Take is in stark contrast to Tales of Kenzera. "People have an idea in regards to 'oh, this is the kind of game that you'll always make as a studio'," said Salim. "With Dead Take, this is us saying 'we're storytellers first and foremost' and that's really what's key for this.</p>
<p>"People would have obviously expected a similar element or ilk of Zau with it, but actually what we want to show is that we are diverse in regards to the stories that we can tell and the genres and the spaces and the places we can play in."</p>
<p>He continued: "It's coming from a place of what's the story we want to tell, what's the best medium for it, and what's also the best genre or take on it? And what better way of exploring how far you will go than putting you in a first-person psychological horror game where you're playing an actor who literally is always living on the edge of 'I don't know when my next paycheck is coming through'? How do I secure a legacy? How do I secure that my sense of self is important and valid? That is the journey of an actor, constantly."</p>
<p>Essentially, Dead Take will peel back the layers on Salim's own work as an actor. "The more you succeed, or the deeper down you go, the darker it gets, the weirder it gets, the more behind the curtains you see," he said of the game. "It's very different playing a day part of a film than playing the lead role in something. The lead role, you're so much more involved, you see more of how the cogs are working. That's the journey I want to take you on here."</p>
<p>The personal experience of Salim, Newbon, and Starr will only add to the game's authenticity, again paralleling Tales of Kenzera and its Afrofuturist aesthetic inspired by the Bantu Tales. "In truth," said Salim,"for us the only thing we can do is speak from that authenticity. And this game made sense for that."</p>
<p>Dead Take will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">published by Palworld maker Pocketpair</a>. "It's really lovely when you meet someone who's aligned in regards to the vision of where they want to see the industry go," said Salim of the collaboration. "It's like fireworks, it just made sense."</p>
<p>Dead Take doesn't yet have a release date, but will launch later this year on PC (Steam). The studio also has another game in development, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Afrofuturist gothic-horror RPG currently known as Project Uso</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But original project co-founder says he's willing to "reach out" to Riot.</p>

            <p>
Last week, Riot Games announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">pulling the plug on promising Minecraft-like sandbox game Hytale</a> after over a decade of development. Since then, several notable names have been linked to possible revival efforts as fans search for a way the project could be saved, but now one of those name - Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone - has distanced himself from reports he could help resurrect Hytale.
</p>
<p>
Hytale, to give you the potted history, started development in 2015, and was an attempt by developer Hypixel to combine the mini-games found on its hugely popular eponymous Minecraft server with its own RPG-like, Minecraft-style sandbox experience, built from the ground up. It generated enough buzz that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games heavily invested in the project before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last week, however, Riot announced it was ending development on the still-unreleased project as it "became clear we couldn't bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise." At the time, there was suggestion Hypixel had unsuccessfully attempted to shop the game around to "investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward", leading to employee layoffs and the studio's imminent closure.
</p>
<p>
Fans, however, weren't quite ready to give up after a ten year wait for Hytale, and took to social media in a bid to convince industry figures they should pitch in to help save the project. Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone, for instance, was <a href="https://x.com/not_mynes/status/1938700223511159281">accosted on Discord</a> by a fan eager to save Hytale. After receiving the sales pitch - "I assume this investment would pay out for you too" - Barone responded noncommittally, "Possibly, but I would have to hear more about what the plan is, why it failed initially (behind the scenes), etc."
</p>
<p>
With fans perhaps reading more into that "possibly" than was ever intended, Barone has now released a follow-up statement clarifying his position. Noting that his widely shared original comment was "not a public message [he] was trying to convey", Barone <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">told Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, "I'm not actively doing anything to make this happen. If something were presented to me, I would be open to entertaining the idea, that's all. It's not something I am thinking about too much, since I'm focused on working on my next game."
</p>
<p>
Barone is currently developing spooky chocolate-making life sim Haunted Chocolatier, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">announced in 2021</a>. Work paused temporarily while his attention shifted back to Stardew Valley and its unexpectedly massive 1.6 update, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-hes-back-working-on-next-project-haunted-chocolatier">development resumed last December</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while Barone's focus is currently elsewhere, there's perhaps still some hope for Hytale fans. Original Hypixel founder Simon Collins-Laflamme - who departed the company following its acquisition by Riot - has also become embroiled in the community's Save Hytale campaign, telling fans he's willing to "reach out" to Riot with a possible $25m investment proposal. This, he explained, could potentially allow for a "very early access release with temporarily removed features", as development with a "relatively small" team was spun up again.
</p>
<p>
"Keep your expectations extremely low," he <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1938944710334148817">cautioned on social media</a>, "because usually when large companies shutdown a project like this the chances of revival are next to impossible. Yes, I made the decision, I will give my best to save Hytale... It's the least I can do to the same community that gave me the opportunity to be where I am today... It will take months to get answers and months to get done. I will share as much as possible as I go through the process."

            <p>Borderlands 4 includes a slider that lets you mute Claptrap.</p>
<p>Claptrap, for those unaware, is Gearbox's talkative robot companion who is often considered to be the Borderlands series' mascot. He first popped up in the original Borderlands game, and was most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-joins-borderlands-movie-cast-as-claptrap">voiced by Jack Black in the Borderlands film adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>While Claptrap can be a source of comic relief, some players have found him a tad annoying, and now Gearbox has come up with a solution to quite literally dial him down a touch: that aforementioned Borderlands 4 slider.</p>

<p>This slider will allow players to adjust Claptrap's volume, from 100 percent to mute. Teasing the feature, Borderlands 4 narrative director <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1939780570365796763">Sam Winkler said</a>: "I wrote some lines just for this feature and it includes maybe the dumbest most niche reference to a certain terrible accent in a certain classic immersive sim."</p>
<p>In a subsequent response to one social media user who suggested Gearbox shouldn't have "caved" to those less keen on Claptrap's vocals, <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/with_replies">Winkler joked</a>: "I pitched that you should be able to put him from zero percent to 200 percent but I think the government said no."</p>
<p>So, will you be muting Claptrap on Borderlands 4's release, or turning the volume up as high as your tech will allow?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> is "happy" with the critical reception of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach, and has spurred on fans to fight back against war and climate change.</p>
<p>Speaking at the London leg of the Death Stranding 2 World Tour that Eurogamer attended, Kojima was asked by host <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> for his final thoughts on the evening's events, which included performances from Caroline Polachek and Chvrches.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of things right now," said Kojima. "We have war, we have climate change, we have a lot of earthquakes, we had the pandemic, we have a lot of things. And we have maybe a dark future a little bit. But today, if we gather like this and if we are going to be connected, we can fight and battle all these things."</p>

<p>Kojima dedicated the evening - also attended by actors Norman Reedus and Léa Seydoux - to the memory of Low Roar lead singer Ryan Karazija, who passed away in 2022 due to complications of pneumonia. Low Roar's music was a key part of the first game's identity and Kojima had wanted to use more of the band's music in the sequel.</p>
<p>"When I was creating Death Stranding 2, I wanted to contact him and there was Covid so he couldn't come to Japan to perform so I was trying to write an email," explained Kojima. "But then I got this sad message that Ryan passed away and that was so tragic when I first heard that. I also heard from his relatives that he does have some new songs and I decided to put in his new songs in Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>"So I think he's watching us somewhere. In Death Stranding 2 there's this line 'death is not the end, it does not separate us'. I still feel connection with Ryan so I'm going to cherish this relationship with Ryan. And I hope everyone will feel that way too."</p>

<p>Singer Caroline Polachek, meanwhile, performed the game's title song On The Beach for the first time at the event.</p>
<p>"I am always terrified the first time I perform songs, but I've gotta say I've never sung a song that feels more like playing a video game than that song," she said. "It has so many rollercoaster dips in it."</p>
<p>Kojima was introduced to Polachek's music by the team at KindaFunny, which eventually led to the pair collaborating on the song. "If I hadn't received that CD, this connection would never have happened," said Kojima.</p>
<p>Polachek explained more about the writing process for On The Beach. "I often keep special songs in a treasure chest for when they have the right moment, and this was one of them," she said.</p>
<p>"Hideo explained to me the concept of Death Stranding 2 and I was so taken by the ethical conflict in the story and also how far that carries back into Death Stranding 1 as well. This idea of: is extinction a good idea, is it a bad idea? And how provocative that is, actually. One of the things that's special about this song is the verses are really evil and looming and then the chorus is so innocent and has this feeling of being saved. And I really liked the match between the song and these ideas. He sends me a synopsis of the game and I take it away and study it. And about a month later we had the song."</p>
<p>The lyrics to On The Beach are a riddle, though the singer didn't want to give it away. "In this case I wanted to pick up the gauntlet that Hideo threw down, which is how many strands of the game can you put into the song but in a way people won't necessarily be able to read until they've played it," she said.</p>
<p>Polachek also admitted she was "so nervous" to send Kojima her first recording of the song, and Chvrches later mirrored this sentiment after their performance of the title track from the first game. This was the first performance from Chvrches in two years, with the band confirming they've been back in the studio for six months writing a new album.</p>
<p>In a previous interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-isnt-interested-in-appealing-to-the-mass-market-but-death-stranding-2-playtests-proving-popular">Kojima stated he's not interested in "appealing to the mass market"</a> and, despite playtests of Death Stranding 2 proving popular, he wished it "was a bit more controversial".</p>
<p>The reaction would suggest otherwise. While sales figures haven't been released, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-topples-mario-kart-world-from-uk-physical-sales-top-spot-but-still-some-way-from-beating-the-original">Death Stranding 2 did top the UK physical charts last week</a>. And with such a strong critical reaction, it's no wonder Kojima is feeling "very happy".</p>
<p>"A busier, louder, and more emotionally resplendent take on this singular hiking sim," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2 review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-happy-with-death-stranding-2-critical-reception-spurring-fans-to-fight-and-battle-against-war-and-climate-change]]></content:encoded>
