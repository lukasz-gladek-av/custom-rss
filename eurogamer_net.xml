            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> is currently in the primordial ooze phase of its PvP meta, as players hit the end game and figure out which weapons and strategies are the best for taking out their fellow man. In this soup they've discovered a busted technique that's strong - so strong that the developers are stepping in to fix it.</p>
<p>That technique is repeatedly landing your orniphopter (the Dune equivalent of a helicopter) onto someone until they die. You see, a player packing a pistol or powerful rifle may be able to outshoot a foe on foot, but these weapons won't do much against a vehicle.</p>
<p>While a buggy or bike can be avoided by climbing to higher ground, an orniphopter crushing from above is significantly harder to avoid. Add on top of this the fact that landing on a player doesn't damage the vehicle in any way, and you've got an ammoless, largely skilless method of taking out any player you find in a PvP environment.</p>

<p>This scenario is perfectly captured by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/">Bombe18 on the Dune Reddit</a>, who provided a video of them being repeatedly crushed in the Deep Desert. What's particularly funny about this video is the pilots appear to be letting Mr Bombe18 self revive each time before crushing them again.</p>
<p>Later in the video, another orniphopter flies over and joins in, at which point Bombe uses the in-game proximity voice chat to concede defeat. To this surrender, the pilots silently continue to crush Bombe.</p>
<p>In the replies to this video, Funcom's very own CCO Joel Bylos responded to say: "Yeah sorry about this. We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="566"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/">Dune developpers, I agree to have a defeat in PVP. But been crushed by orni that do not take any damage. No.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bombe18/">u/Bombe18</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/">duneawakening</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>So there are multiple ways of looking at this. Let's start at the obvious. This is quite funny. Not for Bombe, or anyone else on the receiving end of orniphopter "goomba stomping", but for those watching it happen. Especially the pilots, one can only assume.</p>
<p>But it probably isn't healthy for the game either. One could argue, as I was initially inclined, that the game provides weapons better suited for dealing with vehicles. The missile launcher is the obvious example.</p>
<p>But, then again, should every Dune Awakening player have to pack a missile launcher for a trip to the Deep Desert, <a href="https://youtu.be/xE0V-TmqTP8?t=168">lest they end up like Romano in ER</a>? The answer is probably no.</p>
<p>You could also argue that the game has only been out for a short while,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-hits-142000-concurrent-players-during-full-launch-smashing-past-record"> and its substantial playerbase</a> could have adapted to the orniphopter crushing strategy with techniques of their own. Perhaps widespread adoption of the missile launcher, sure. Or maybe a standard practice of keeping a bike in your vehicle storage, so that you can quickly drop a bike and hop on it before you get stuck in the great limbo of orniphotercide.</p>
<p>This would be more convincing if crashing into people from above was an intended use of the orniphopter, and not an obvious oversight. Bylos' quick response and promise to remedy the situation reveals this to be true. So, as funny as it is to watch videos of Dune Awakening Goomba stomps happen, the sooner this technique is banished from the game the better.</p>

            <p>Mob Entertainment has announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 4 will be making its unsettling way onto consoles later this month.</p>
<p>The latest chapter in the series is set for release on Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10012036">PlayStation</a> and Xbox on 25th June. It will retail for $19.99, the PR has said. I have asked for clarification on its UK pricing, though the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/poppy-playtime-chapter-4/9n31k5cww4k8">Microsoft Store here in Blighty</a> has it listed for £16.74, so assume this will be the same on other platforms.</p>
<p>"Brace yourself for the darkest chapter yet in the epic Poppy Playtime saga," reads the official blurb, adding that players will be "pushed deeper into the undiscovered depths of the Playtime Co. factory, far below anything the world knew". You can check out a trailer for Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 below.</p>

<p>The latest chapter in the Poppy Playtime series promises players "terrifying" new threats, along with "shocking" revelations.</p>
<p>"Can you outwit the unnatural new creations lurking in the shadows? Can you survive here long enough to eventually unravel the mysteries behind the experiments? Every step will test your courage, every puzzle will challenge your mind, and every corner may be your last," the studio teases.</p>
<p>Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in May of last year, the studio announced a Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time</a>.</p>
<p>"This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has received an update that offers visual improvements when played on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>, a nice bonus for fans who want to pick up and play the RPG on the new console.</p>
<p>These improvements include graphic enhancements such as new shadow and reflection efforts, as well as an extension to the distance objects are rendered at. For example, you can now see a forest off into the distance clearly, whereas before it may have looked like a low-poly blur of green shrubbery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/patchnote/ver_1_3_0/">In the official update blog post uploaded to the games' official website</a>, we see that exact example in a side-by-side comparison, as well as a pair of screenshots showing water effects on the Switch vs the Switch 2. Water now has lovely reflections of light on it. A little thing for some, but a little boost for those willing to make the leap to a new console, cosy RPG in hand.</p>

<p>Other features of this update include an automatic lock-on feature that should make combat a little easier, as well as an adjustment to the Hagram build feature allowing players to press the cancel button and return a moved object to its original position.</p>
<p>God's Touch was adjusted too! It can now be cancelled by attacking or dodging, plus the button assigned to activating God's Touch has been relocated on the game pad. Game pad users also have an increased selection of key configurations, and all players can benefit from a new depth of field graphical option.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Fantasy Life i; The Girl Who Steals Time is a very popular RPG that got off to an outstanding start,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-hits-500000-sales-in-three-days"> selling 500,000 copies in just three days</a>. In response to this success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-studio-announces-free-dlc-as-the-slow-life-rpg-sequel-gets-off-to-a-flying-start">the developers offered free DLCthat included new recipes and expanded content earlier this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
