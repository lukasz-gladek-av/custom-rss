            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> on Steam's Top Sellers chart, one day before its early launch for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners. Only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> seems able to keep the Survival MMO at bay.</p>
<p>The game previously hit a concurrent player peak of 37,889 during a closed weekend beta, initially limited to those invited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/funcom-has-heard-your-feedback-and-opened-the-dune-awakening-beta-to-all-pre-orderers">but opened up to pre-orderers near the conclusion</a>. These folks were able to play through the same early portion as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">our lovely Bertie dived into in the Eurogamer preview</a>.</p>
<p>It has managed to slip past Elden Ring Nightreign, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-strong-start-on-steam-reaching-over-300k-concurrent-peak">which had a strong start on Steam</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">recently surpassing the 3.5m sales mark across all platforms</a>. It's worth noting of course that Nightreign came out last Friday, so it was bound to start trickling down the Top Sellers chart sooner or later.</p>

<p>Dune Awakening, the next big release from Funcom, releases for all players on 10th June, but those looking to hop in tomorrow will have to drop at least £58.50 / $69.99 / €69.99  for the Deluxe Edition. Obviously, there's no way to differentiate which version Steam users are buying to cause this surge up the store page, but it's certainly a good indicator for initial interest.</p>
<p>Recently, Funcom peeled back the curtain on the mid - end game experience in Dune Awakening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMpSKFSWjMM">in a lengthy live stream</a>, providing much-needed information on what those who sink dozens if not hundreds of hours into the game will actually be doing. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.vg247.com/">VG247</a> also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/dune-awakenings-creative-director-speaks-on-the-end-game-and-how-the-landsraad-will-give-key-roles-to-crafter-and-killer-alike">interviewed the creative director on the Landsraad system</a>, a rotating semi-randomised set of server wide tasks the Atreides and Harkonnen will be battling over.</p>
<p>For those unaware the game follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-devs-explain-their-alt-history-approach-to-the-vast-intricate-follow-up-to-conan-exiles">an alternate history of Frank Herbert's sci-fi series of novels</a>, though aesthetically more aligned with the recent films by Denis Villeneuve. Its creators at Funcom were responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-secret-world-preview-2">The Secret World</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anarchy-online">Anarchy Online.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Is it just me, or is the game's second anniversary event kinda nothing?</p>

            <p>The time has come to celebrate the second anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Yes, the game has been out for two years now, even if it does not feel like it's been that long. And with every anniversary, of course, comes a new event from Blizzard designed to commemorate it.</p>
<p>The second Anniversary Celebration is now live in-game. And, honestly, does not feel like that much of a big deal. At all.</p>
<p>The Diablo 4 Second Anniversary event is available from now until Tuesday, 17th June, giving you about two weeks to take part in the muted festivities. And you'd only really want to do that, of course, if you care about the rewards you could get from grinding through the activities; rewards which this event does actually have, even if they're nothing to really write home about.</p>
<p>Now that Diablo 4 has <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-season-8-belials-return-new-battle-pass-reliquary-details">adopted Call of Duty's battle pass system</a>, there's a new Event Reliquary (which is essentially a mini-battle pass) that runs parallel to the Season 8 Reliquary. While the new system <em>does</em> offer more utility, and is practically designed for situations like this, it has not been well received by players <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-reliquaries-new-battle-pass-system-season-8-player-reaction">because of how little of the premium currency it offers compared to the old style</a>.</p>
<p>But we're not here to talk about that, we're here to reveal the rewards... all six of them. As part of the event Reliquary, you'll be able to exchange your Gold for these rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunflame Lantern Mount Trophy.</li>
<li>Burning Dawn Banner Mount Trophy.</li>
<li>Sunraiser Sword Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Sunflame Sword Two-Handed Sword Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Burning Barbs Polearm Cosmetic.</li>
<li>Burning Dawn Bow Cosmetic.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<figcaption>Look at my horse, my horse is amazing. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Blizzard</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once you've collected all six of the skins above, you'll automatically earn The Burning Dawn Mount Armor. Having Gold set as the currency of this particular event is certainly interesting, mainly because it doesn't involve some other paid currency, or any sort of in-game grinding. You will, of course, need to have enough Gold to be able to afford everything, but farming Gold isn't difficult, and gives you the freedom to do whatever you want in the game (rather than force you into certain time-gated events).</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-berserk-cross-over-event-details-skins-gameplay-cosmetics">Berserk collaboration event</a> certainly reminded everyone why limited-time events exist to begin with, with its meagre in-game rewards, and a skin pack that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/diablo-4-berserk-cross-over-event-cosmetics-skins-prices">would've run you £110 if you wanted the actually good cosmetics</a>.</p>
<p>Given that, many players will no doubt be happy to learn that there are zero skins being sold for real money as part of the Anniversary event. As a bonus, a Mother's Blessing event will also be running right alongside the two-year party, giving everyone 35 percent extra XP, and 50 percent extra Gold.</p>
<p>This improved version of Mother's Blessing also means each time you turn in your Grim Favors at the Tree of Whispers, you'll receive an extra cache, which includes items you'd find in a Collection of Chaos cache. If you've been away from the game for a while, or don't know what that means, trust me when I say: it's a pretty good boon to have.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is boldly going where no nine-year-old exploratory space sim has gone before: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. Developer Hello Games has announced a free launch-day update that'll bring significant upgrades compared to the original Switch release, including enhanced visuals, multiplayer, and more. That's in addition to a major update for all platforms arriving today.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Switch 2, Hello Games says this new version of No Man's Sky is a "huge leap" over the original Switch release, featuring "massively" increased density and detail, plus higher resolutions and improved frame rates (the <a href="https://youtu.be/cgYYQwHuh-Y">studio's announcement video</a> suggests 40fps at 1080p while playing portable, and 30fps at 1440p in docked mode).
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 also gets multiplayer and settlements - two features missing on Switch 1 - as well as cross-save and cross-play, so it's possible to jump seamlessly between devices. No Man's Sky's Switch 2 upgrade is free to existing users and launches alongside the console on 5th June.

<p>
It'll also include <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update">No Man's Sky's new Beacon update</a>, which arrives today, 4th June, on all other platforms. This provides a significant overhaul of the space sim's existing settlement system, which essentially enables players to become the mayor of their own Mos Eisleys.
</p>
<p>There are new robotic settlements, for instance, and it's now possible to own multiple settlements instead of just one. There's also suggestion of more granular customisation and management, with talk of new upgradeable buildings types and settlement features, ranging from custom starship merchants to fishing ponds. That's alongside citizens with their own stories and abilities, and the option to enlist wingmen to protect your settlements from pirates. All of which sounds wonderful, but if the update wipes out the sprawling, settlement-adjacent cliffside base I've spent the last two years building, I will 100 percent cry.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, No Man's Sky's Beacon update is out today on PC, PCVR, Steam Deck, PlayStation 4, PS5, PSVR, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 1, with a Switch 2 update due tomorrow, 5th June. And as Hello Games is fond of teasing, "more will follow". But what of the developer's next game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">planetary sim Light No Fire?</a> It's been a while since we've had an update on that, so fingers crossed for a bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a> news.
