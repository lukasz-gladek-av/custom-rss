            <p>Production has started on the film adaptation of horror work sim The Mortuary Assistant, with Willa Holland in the lead role.</p>
<p>Holland - who has previously starred in Arrow and Gossip Girl, although I knew her first as  Marissa Cooper's little sister Kaitlin in The OC - will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as, you guessed it, a mortuary assistant.</p>
<p>Holland is joined by House of Cards and Boardwalk Empire Paul Sparks, who plays Rebecca's boss Raymond Delver in the upcoming film. As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-willa-holland-paul-sparks-1236376119/">Deadline</a>, Rebecca's boss "appears to be a mentor, but also a potential threat".</p>

<p>Indie horror The Mortuary Assistant initially released on PC in 2022, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-finally-coming-to-consoles">becoming available on consoles</a>. As you may have surmised, it casts players as a newly hired assistant at a mortuary who embalms corpses. However, there is a catch - the mortuary is haunted.</p>
<p>Film director Jeremiah Kipp told Deadline he and the game's creator Brian Clarke "respond to character-driven storytelling within a disturbing horror space". Kipp said as Clarke's "influences have been largely cinematic, the whole process has organically felt like an expansion of his unique gameplay".</p>
<p>"We've captured the atmosphere of singular dread that players responded to so powerfully - this movie will be scary as hell," Kipp said.</p>
<p>Clarke added that "seeing the mortuary assistant evolve over the years from a small prototype to a full feature film is beyond anything I could have imagined as a solo developer", calling Kipp an "insanely skilled director".</p>
<p>"It has been one of the highlights of my life working with him," Clarke said. "The entire team at Epic Pictures have done an amazing job capturing the spirit of the game while adding their own unique cinematic flair. It is an honor to see Willa and Paul bring these characters to life along with the rest of the film crew.</p>
<p>"I feel extremely fortunate and can't wait for fans to see The Mortuary Assistant expand into new territory."</p>

<p>The Mortuary Assistant adaptation was first heard of back in 2022, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-mortuary-assistant-is-getting-a-companion-piece-movie-adaptation">Kipp said the film will be a "companion piece" to the game</a>. According to Deadline's report, the film will expand the game's world further by "delving deeper into the lore of the demonic entities plaguing River Fields".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The most-watched game on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> last year was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, still, after more than a decade on sale. 
</p>
<p>
Of course, Rockstar's ever-evolving <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> is the big draw here - and the developer is still regularly updating the game's online portion with new story beats and quests. But its 25.8m hours broadcast and 1.4bn hours viewed in 2024 is still extraordinary - and also highlights the astronomical potential of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>.
</p>
<p>
Outside of GTA, Twitch viewers flocked to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> (1.18bn hours watched), and then the usual evergreen shooters such as Valorant (804m hours), Fortnite (539m hours) and Call of Duty (a combined 451m hours).
</p>
<p>
Overall, gaming content on Twitch was viewed for 15.6bn hours across 2024, and the platform had an average of 105 million monthly visitors. 
</p>
<p>
Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-ceo-reveals-2025-plans-collaboration-mobile-and-more-monetisation">Twitch boss Dan Clancy detailed the company's plans for 2025</a>, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">bumpy 2024 marked by layoffs</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside including improvements to the Twitch mobile app, the company confirmed it would be opening up monetisation for "most" streamers, including the ability to offer subscriptions and bits. 
</p>
<p>
As our Ed wrote at the time, usually streamers need to reach Affiliate status before monetisation tools kick in, but this year streamers will be able to start earning immediately - something that not only benefits the streamer but also Twitch, which takes a cut.
</p>
<p>For more, Ed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-ceo-reveals-2025-plans-collaboration-mobile-and-more-monetisation">chatted with Twitch last year about the future of the company</a> and its approaches to safety, growth, and online communities.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-begins-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-begins-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week.1173438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-begins-testing-the-crew-2-offline-mode-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has finally given an update on its plans to add an offline mode into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and The Crew Motorfest, which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">first confirmed back in September 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
This decision was prompted by the acrimonious situation with Ubisoft's original The Crew game, which was shut down and nuked from orbit, removing all players' access and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-states-players-dont-have-unfettered-ownership-of-games-as-the-crew-lawsuit-continues">prompting a still-ongoing legal challenge</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, Ubisoft has said that development is progressing "smoothly" on The Crew 2's offline option - which will ensure the game remains playable if and, let's face it, ultimately when Ubisoft does decide to pull the plug again.
</p>
<p>
The first user tests for The Crew 2's offline mode will begin next week, on 30th April, when a select group of fans will be invited to test the option on PC. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtX3oXj9yng&amp;ab_channel=Ubisoft">video message to fans</a>, producer Grégory Corgié confirmed the mode would roll out fully to all platforms at some point "before the end of 2025".
</p>
<p>
An offline mode for The Crew:  Motorfest, meanwhile, sounds further off - but is still coming.
</p>
<p>
"Regarding The Crew: Motorfest, our teams are currently focused on the live-service, and support for the game for years to come," Corgié said.
</p>
<p>
"But rest assured, The Crew: Motorfest will receive an offline mode. The Crew 2 will be first, allowing players to enjoy and switch between the online and offline mode whenever they want, when we will deploy the version before the end of 2025."
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/privacy-firm-files-ubisoft-legal-complaint-over-data-collection-forced-online-in-single-player-games">privacy firm revealed it had launched a fresh lawsuit against Ubisoft over data collection and forced online in single-player games</a>.
</p>
<p>Last year, one group of modders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back">set to work recreating the server-side software needed to play The Crew online once again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hot off the heels of the news she is attached to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">produce a movie based on Sega's OutRun series</a>, Sydney Sweeney is again making headlines for another video game to big screen adaptation.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/">Variety</a>, the Euphoria actress is set to star in the film adaptation of Josef Fares' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. She will also executive produce the upcoming film, which is being directed by Jon M Chu. Chu's previous works include last year's musical hit, Wicked.</p>
<p>Joining Sweeney and Chu on the film are screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, known for Deadpool &amp; Wolverine.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it has not been decided whether Sweeney will play Mio or Zoe in the Split Fiction film.</p>
<p>It was first revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> earlier this year, when sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>
<p>But, it's not the first Hazelight game reportedly getting a film adaptation. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>. However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>
<p>As for Split Fiction, the co-op caper shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">another million copies in its first week</a> - and now it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">officially record-breaking, too</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
