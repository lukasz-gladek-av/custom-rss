            <p>
As the thrills of July make way for the spills of August, Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings once more, this time bringing 13 titles to subscribers, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/civilization-iii">Civilization 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
As is now customary for the service, Prime Gaming's August additions arrive across four scheduled content drops, and the month's first batch of titles is available to claim right now. This initial wave is arguably the best of the bunch too, bringing classic 4X strategy action in the form of Civilization 3 Complete and some rebooted first-person stealthing via Thief: Definitive Edition, both of which can be claimed through GOG.
</p>
<p>
Then, as the month progresses, there's some chaotic multiplayer infiltration in Filthy Animals: Heist Simulator, fantasy action in FATE: The Traitor Soul, a bit of tactical roguelite deck-building in Necroking, a splash of old-school D&amp;D in the Silver Box Classics bundle, and more. You'll find the full list of August's titles (plus the digital stores they can be grabbed from) below.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/contraband">Contraband</a> - a game under development by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/p-justcause-x360">Just Cause</a>) - has been suddenly cancelled by Microsoft, four years on from its public debut, as reported first by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/xbox-drops-work-on-contraband-video-game-after-four-years">Jason Schreier at Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>The game was revealed in June 2021 during the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, but little to nothing of the co-op smuggling title has been seen since.</p>
<p>Avalanche Studios released a statement in response to the news breaking, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/contraband-update">posting on its website</a>: "Over the past several years, Avalanche Studios and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> Publishing have collaborated on Contraband. Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future.</p>
<p>"We're thankful for the excitement we've seen from the community since we announced and will give an update on what's next as soon as we can."</p>

Following these cuts, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft's CEO stated that "Microsoft is thriving"</a> as the company emphasised its focus on AI.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-are-unionising">over 100 developers at Avalanche Studios unionised</a>. At this time, no layoffs have been announced as part of the cancellation of Contraband.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-exclusive-contraband-reportedly-cancelled-as-avalanche-states-its-active-development-has-now-stopped]]></content:encoded>
