            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>IOI's upcoming James Bond game has finally got itself an actual name, after years of it being known as Project 007.</p>
<p>IOI first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>, and since then details on the project have been few and far between. However, that is set to change soon, with the developer today announcing the upcoming release will officially be called 007: First Light, with a full reveal promised for later this week.</p>
<p>This reveal will feature "never-before-seen footage", the developer has teased, calling this the start of a "new era for James Bond in video games".</p>
<p>Along with this announcement, the studio also shared a teaser image, showing a male character - call me Miss Marple, but I am going to say this is none other than James Bond himself - bathed in shadow. You can see the image in the header above.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, IOI said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>, adding the release will not be a "gamification of a movie".</p>
<p>"It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond," IOI boss Hakan Abrak said in October.</p>
<p>"It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is... to work on this together with the family [and create] a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p>
<p>Meanwhile back in April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-confirmed-for-switch-2">IOI's James Bond game was additionally confirmed for Switch 2</a>, although no release date was teased along with this announcement.</p>
<p>Hopefully we will learn more later this week. While the developer hasn't yet said when its 007: First Light reveal will be, I am going to make a guess it will crop up at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest's opening night this Friday</a>. Stay tuned!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A number of would-be customers across the pond in the United States have experienced unexpected <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> cancellations.</p>
<p>Posts on the likes of reddit and social media platform X show several patrons have had their Switch 2 orders cancelled from retailers such as Walmart and Target.</p>

<p>"Just checked because I [saw] a post on X from Wario64 and it was about [making] sure payment is and all is good to go for when they are ready to ship.. I [checked] and my order got cancelled two days ago," reads one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1kylszy/target_canceled_my_order/">reddit post titled Target cancelled my order</a>. According to replies, the original poster is not the only one this has happened to.</p>
<p>Another post - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/walmart/comments/1kzkboe/did_anyone_elses_switch_2_preorder_get_cancelled/">Did anyone else's Switch 2 preorder get cancelled out of nowhere?</a> - shared on the Walmart subreddit said the same thing. "I just got an email saying it was canceled due to a payment error even though it was the same card I preordered it with," it reads.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://x.com/MechaPaddington/status/1928635220070150169">more examples of these Switch 2 cancellations</a> can be found on X. "Walmart you have failed me for cancelling my switch 2 preorder when my payment method is valid and has funds available, give it back," <a href="https://x.com/Bumbles1593/status/1928607013644165162">one poster wrote over the weekend</a>.</p>
<p>While Walmart and Target seem to be the main retailers in the US to have cancelled Switch 2 orders, <a href="https://x.com/noggin_chomper/status/1929273279459594600">GameStop has also been namechecked online</a>, although the problem doesn't appear to be as widespread.</p> <div>

<p>These reports follow last week's news here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-cancels-some-switch-2-online-pre-orders-a-week-before-launch">which saw retailer GAME admit it had cancelled a number of Switch 2 online pre-orders</a>, with just days to go before the highly anticipated console's release. At this time, GAME said it was aiming to "reinstate as many affected pre-orders as possible".</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is set to release later this week, on 5th of June. Eurogamer's former EIC Tom Phillips has already been hands-on with Nintendo's upcoming console. You can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">read his Switch 2 impressions here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
