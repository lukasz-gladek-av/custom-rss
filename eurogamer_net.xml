            <p>Blizzard co-founder Mike Morhaime has launched a new live-service game with the new publisher he co-founded, Dreamhaven.</p>
<p>Wildgate - not to be confused with Splitgate 2, which has just gone back into beta - is a crew-based first-person space shooter available now across PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5.</p>
<p>It's been developed by Moonshot Games, one of two developers under the Dreamhaven umbrella. The other is Secret Door, which recently launched its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sunderfolk-from-former-world-of-warcraft-boss-is-streamlined-tabletop-dd-by-way-of-final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles-and-some-is-hidden-on-your-mobile">tabletop-inspired RPG Sunderfolk</a>.</p>

<p>Wildgate casts players as "prospectors", teaming up and exploring space in search of an ancient relic known as the Artifact. Crews must either collect the Artifact and safely reach the exit, or destroy all rival ships to dominate space.</p>
<p>It's all presented in an over-the-top cartoonish style, filled with colourful alien characters and a vibrant sci-fi aesthetic.</p>
<p>"The response to Wildgate's open beta was incredible," said Morhaime. "It was truly inspiring to see so many players teaming up, jumping in, and having fun.</p>
<p>"Wildgate represents what Dreamhaven believes games can be: rich, imaginative, and deeply engaging. We're just beginning to open the gate to a galaxy full of wonder, strategy, and discovery, and we hope the game resonates with players of all kinds."</p>
<p>The development team has already shared its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3504780/view/530976484112732607">planned roadmap</a>, including bi-weekly updates, mid-season patches, and seasonal content drops.</p>
<p>"We're also going to present a few opportunities for players to purchase in-game content; however, our goal for paid content in Wildgate is for it to remain cosmetic and opt-in," the developer said.</p>
<p>At Blizzard, Morhaime was heavily involved in the development of World of Warcraft, and was CEO during the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>No doubt Morhaime and Dreamhaven will be hoping for live-service success with Wildgate, despite the difficulties of launching a new game in this genre.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is finally getting a reveal livestream tomorrow, where the public will be able to get their first look at the upcoming modern FPS in-action.
</p>
<p>The livestream will take place on the 24th July, at 4PM BST / 5PM CEST / 11AM EST / 8AM PST. You can watch it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgNCgJG0vnY&amp;ab_channel=Battlefield">the official Battlefield YouTube channel, right here</a>!
</p>
<p>The livestream will be the first <em>official</em> reveal of Battlefield 6 for those who haven't been able to jump into the game's closed beta tests, which have been running over the past few months. There's no word as of writing what exactly will be shown, nor the exact length of the trailer we'll be seeing.

<p>Despite there being little revealed from the game's developers or publishers, there have been some leaked details in recent months. Earlier this month leaks <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-image-suggests-the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-called-battlefield-6-and-the-reveal-event-is-coming-very-soon">indicated that the game would in-fact be called Battlefield 6</a>. Details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">Battlefield 6's single player component</a> have also crept out, plus the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">fan-favourite Rush mode</a>.
</p>
<p>Information on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">Battlefield 6 weapons and the game's battle royale mode</a> have also been sneakily dropped by closed beta testers. Reporting has also claimed that lofty expectations have been levied against Battlefield 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller">with a 100m player figure established internally</a> for the main game and its free-to-play battle royale.
</p>
<p>Excitement for Battlefield 6 is palpable among FPS lovers and series diehards alike. This group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-youre-worried-about-one-of-battlefield-6s-most-controversial-design-changes-dice-just-confirmed-your-fears">has been torn as of late due when it comes to classes</a>. In the past, weapons and gadgets have been locked to these dedicated classes, and old fans love this system. A classless approach has been announced for Battlefield 6, though official Battlefield social media accounts has recently announced <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383">playlists for both class and classless matches</a>.

            <p>Obsidian has given Eurogamer a good indication of how long Grounded 2 will be in early access for, and whether the game will come to PlayStation and other platforms besides Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>As with the original ant-sized backyard survival game, Grounded 2 will launch in early access, starting next week, from 29th July. But how long will it remain in open development for? "As long as we need to to get the game right," executive producer Marcus Morgan told me.</p>
<p>"We don't plan on being in early access forever," he added, "but you definitely need the time. We were in early access for Grounded 1 for about two years and that gave us enough time to meaningfully take community feedback and actually adjust the game. Roughly that window again, but the appropriate amount of time to make it right."</p>

<figcaption>Grounded was one of the first Xbox-exclusive games to travel to other platforms, but there were a few teething issues.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJqr2IZp2m0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Grounded 2 will be a PC and Xbox game because Obsidian is a Microsoft-owned studio. But Grounded was also one of the series Microsoft experimented with offering on other platforms, on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. Those versions launched last year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">they seem to have performed well</a>. Tonally speaking, Grounded is a perfect fit for Switch, and though there were performance issues on original Switch hardware, we are now of course in the era of the more powerful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Will Grounded 2 come to other platforms besides PC and Xbox, then? Marcus Morgan smiled when I asked him this, specifically about a PlayStation release, then said, "Can't talk about that right now. But I will say that Grounded 1 is on all of those platforms so..." And then he smiled again.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will bring a bevy of new ideas to the Grounded formula, notably insect mounts to ride around a much larger playing world in, that of Brookhollow Park, which will have ice dungeons and other varied biomes to explore. There are also deeper gameplay systems now and added nuance in combat, which lends the game much more staying power and interest over time.</p>
<p>I can tell you more about Grounded 2 when the embargo on early access impressions lifts on 29th July.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/will-grounded-2-come-to-playstation-and-switch-2-grounded-was-on-all-those-platforms-teases-obsidian-executive-producer]]></content:encoded>

            <p>They do say pride comes before a fall, and despite donning <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">a hat proclaiming "Make FPS Great Again" at Summer Game Fest earlier this year</a>, studio founder Ian Proulx and 1047 Games are putting Splitgate 2 back into the beta box. Not only that, the studio is also taking the original Splitgate offline and laying off members of staff. </p>
<p>In a statement shared on Tuesday addressing the Splitgate 2 community, the studio admitted  it had exited the sequel's initial beta far too early. "We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly - we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with," 1047 Games wrote.</p>
<p>As such, Splitgate 2 is going back into beta, less than two months after its official launch. The studio will now do a significant amount of rework on areas including progression, as well as adding more portals to maps and "simplifying" monetisation.</p>

<p>This rebuilding phase will last "until early next year", the developer said, and Splitgate 2 will remain playable during this time. The game's third chapter will still ship, and the team has promised "fixes and high priority changes" for those who stick around. "We hope you will continue to play and support the game," it wrote.</p>
<p>However, all of this has come with a human cost, and as a result of this decision the studio is laying off staff, and that's after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-lays-off-small-group-of-valued-staff">already laid off other team members shortly after Splitgate 2's initial launch</a>. "This is heartbreaking. These are our teammates and our friends, and they helped build what we have today," 1047 Games said of the studio's most recent layoffs. According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-will-go-back-to-beta-to-undergo-a-massive-rework-amid-more-layoffs-and-splitgate-1-shutdown">IGN</a>, the number of those affected totals 45.</p>
<p>In closing, 1047 Games wrote: "We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we've learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
<p>"We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up."</p>
