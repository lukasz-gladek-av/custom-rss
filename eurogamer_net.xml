A fresh version of Nintendo's iconic GameCube controller looks to be in development for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, fans think. 
</p>
<p>
The evidence here comes from a recent FCC filing for a Switch 2 controller with an oddly-located product label - that matches the location of the product label on a GameCube controller. 
</p>
<p>
The filing, for a Switch 2 peripheral with the product code BEE-021, matches other Switch 2 components with the same BEE prefix, and does not appear to be a new Switch 2 Pro controller. 
</p>
<p>
Evidence dug up by <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/new-fcc-filing-discovered-that-looks-a-lot-like-a-gamecube-nso-controller.12879/#post-1660543">Famiboards</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/switch-2-gamecube-controller-rumours-resurface-following-new-nintendo-filing">Nintendo Life</a>) points to the fact this device lacks NFC support - something included in Switch 1 Pro controllers and Joy-Con - but does include wireless Bluetooth, something included in past Nintendo Switch Online pads. 
</p>
<p>
The suggestion, then, is that Nintendo is prepping a GameCube controller re-release in the same way it has done for other retro controllers, such as the N64.

<p>
Take a leap of logic further, and the supposed existence of this controller could also point to GameCube support for Nintendo Switch Online... but one thing at a time.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's brilliant GameCube controller and its wonderful Wavebird counterpart are now nearly two decades old, but are still beloved by many fans - indeed, the pads are still a preferred method of control for many hardcore Super Smash Bros players. 
</p>
<p>
Just a few weeks remain until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo properly lifts the lid on its Switch 2 plans at the start of April</a>. Could we see GameCube Switch Online support announced at the same time?
