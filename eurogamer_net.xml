Giant Skull, the studio founded by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-war-3">God of War 3</a> game director Stig Asmussen last year, has signed a deal to create a new single-player action-adventure set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
</p>
<p>
Asmussen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-and-survivor-director-stig-asmussen-is-leaving-ea">announced his departure from Star Wars Jedi developer Respawn Entertainment</a> back in 2023, when it was said he was waving goodbye in order to "pursue other adventures". Seven months later and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-director-stig-asmussen-opens-new-triple-a-studio-giant-skull">Giant Skull was unveiled to the public</a> with the goal of "building gameplay-driven, story immersed action-adventure games set in captivating worlds".
</p>
<p>
And the first of those worlds, it now transpires, will be a familiar one to RPG fans; Wizards of the Coast has announced it's signed a deal with Giant Skull to create an "all-new, single-player action-adventure title set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons". Details are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but we do know it's in development for PC and console using Unreal Engine 5, with more information promised "at a later date".
</p>
<p>
"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity," Asmussen wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement. "Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace."
</p>
<p>
Giant Skull's new game is just one of a number of Dungeons &amp; Dragons titles confirmed to be in development over the last few years. Payday developer Starbreeze, for instance, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">working on a co-op live-service game</a> currently expected to release in 2026, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> studio Game Loft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-dungeons-and-dragons-game-on-the-way-from-disney-dreamlight-valley-team">developing a co-op adventure built around "real-time survival and action"</a>. And then there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-dragons-triple-a-unreal-engine-5-game-in-development">triple-A Unreal Engine 5 project from Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance developer Invoke Studios</a>, first announced back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
It's a busy time in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games, then, and amid all this, Wizards of the Coast's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">search for a new studio to take on the Baldur's Gate series</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">developer Larian's departure</a> seemingly continues.
