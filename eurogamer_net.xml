            <p>Sucker Punch's upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is getting its own official popcorn bucket, but it's proven so popular it has already sold out online.</p>
<p>The bucket itself was available to pre-order from <a href="https://t.co/Kre862VVjF">AlamoMart</a>, and is shaped like a traditional Japanese rice basket. It was released for pre-order to coincide with Alamo Drafthouse's "curated" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a> film programme, which will showcase five films that helped define the genre. This series of films will <a href="https://x.com/alamodrafthouse/status/1945892543234805970/photo/1">be hosted in August</a> at select Alamo Drafthouse theaters.</p>

<p>Anyway, the hand painted Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket, as it is known, itself retailed for $40. That's around £30 here in the UK, though not factoring in any shipping costs. It was designed by Sony's own artists, and has a 100oz capacity.</p>
<p>"Elevate your movie snack game with the limited-edition Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket," the description reads, with Alamo Drafthouse calling it "the perfect keepsake for any aspiring warrior".</p>
<p>A perfect keepsake it may well be, but even though the popcorn bucket was only revealed last night, it has already sold out online. Sorry for any of you who were looking forward to reaching into a Ghost of Yōtei-themed food vessel, but that chap just simply isn't available any more. I have popped my email address into the 'Notify Me When Available' tab, so will let you know if this changes.</p>

            <p>The next round of Everdark Sovereigns will be added to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on 31st July, with four enhanced Nightlords available to beat.</p>
<p>In a nod towards live service updates, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-update-brings-new-challenges-and-a-welcome-live-service-twist">extra challenging Everdark Sovereigns were added to the game on a rotating basis last month</a>, with three added individually over three weeks. Then, last week, FromSoftware announced these would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-nightfarers-youll-get-another-chance-to-beat-elden-ring-nightreigns-sovereign-super-bosses">rotate again before new additions arrived</a>.</p>
<p>Now we know the enhanced Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will arrive on 31st July - so that's immediately after the current rotation concludes.</p>

<p>While not confirmed, presumably these will be added to the game one at a time on a rotating basis over the course of four weeks. And after that? Perhaps they'll come round again.</p>
<p>Still, what players are really after is a duo mode. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">FromSoftware confirmed at the start of last month the mode is on the way</a>, but no further details have been provided.</p> <div>

            <p>Valve boss Gabe Newell spends his days scuba diving and hanging out on a boat as well as working, but is effectively retired at this point.</p>
<p>Newell was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZALKAR.SALIEV">YouTube channel Zalkar Saliev</a>, which is dedicated to "powerful interviews and lifestyle stories with successful men across the US", but with just a handful of videos so far - certainly an odd choice for Newell. Valve confirmed to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/gabe-newells-daily-routine-is-get-up-work-go-scuba-diving-says-hes-been-retired-for-a-long-time-but-works-7-days-a-week-the-things-i-get-to-do-every-day-are-super-awesome/">PC Gamer</a> the interview is real.</p>
<p>While the full interview is yet to be published, a couple of shorts have been released, including one where Newell discusses his daily routine.</p>

<p>"What is the daily routine for Mr Gabe?" he's asked.</p>
<p>Newell replied: "My daily routine: I get up, I work, I go scuba-diving, then work some more. Then either go on a second scuba dive or I go to the gym and work out. I live on a boat so I just hang out with everybody on the boat. Then I work."</p>
<p>He continued: "I work seven days a week: I'm working from my bedroom as you can tell." Indeed, the interview alternates between a view of Saliev's computer and the direct video call feed. Newell appears to be sat at the end of a bed.</p>
<p>Newell added: "I like working, it's fun, to me it doesn't feel like work. The kinds of things that I get to do every day are super-awesome."</p>
<p>He then admitted he's effectively retired at this point. "I've said it before but, when you retire, you want to stop doing your horrible job and go do what is most fun and entertaining," he said. "In that sense I've been retired for a long time."</p>
<p>So what exactly is he up to? He's working on "AI stuff" and "Steam stuff", but with one company he's working on an aerosol pathogen detection device. He added: "Brain-computer interfaces are incredibly cool and all of the associated neuroscience is incredibly cool."</p>
<p>Newell concluded: "I just work all the time, but it's not like 'oh my god I'm up late at night slaving away on stuff.' It's more like 'I can't go to sleep because I'm having fun', you know?" Lucky for some!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/aCgxGfVM_d0?si=DsHRmA-WgwIlSLPD">another video</a>, Newell discusses his thoughts on using AI as a tool. He predicted: "I think we'll be in this funny situation where people who don't know how to programme could use AI to scaffold their programming capabilities [and] will become more effective developers of value than people who have been programming for a decade."</p>
<p>It's unknown when the full interview will be published, but expect more to come.</p>
<p>Over at Steam, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve has introduced new guidelines around adult-only game content</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-boss-gabe-newell-reveals-daily-routine-in-bizarre-new-interview-i-get-up-i-work-i-go-scuba-diving-then-work-some-more]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware is reportedly in advanced development on a project it's yet to announce, which could be out as early as next year.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">mp1st</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-reportedly-has-another-unannounced-game-that-could-release-next-year/">VGC</a>), which has information suggesting the Japanese studio has a multiplatform game with the codename FMC in development.</p>
<p>Due to "the nature of the source these details come from", mp1st believes this project is in an advanced stage and should be out next year. The fact it's a multiplatform game confirms FMC is not the codename for the already announced The Duskbloods, which will be exclusive to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this game be? That's where things get speculative.</p>
<p>Mp1st has noted that previous Dark Souls games - and 2023's Armored Core 6 - had codenames with abbreviations beginning with F.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> was FDP, Dark Souls Remastered was FHD, and Armored Core 6 was FNR. By contrast, Sekiro was NTCG/NTC, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was GR (short for Great Rune).</p>
<p>The suggestion, then, is that FMC could be related to either the Dark Souls or Armored Core series.</p>
<p>Nick "Shpeshal Nick" Baker, co-host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Mmo392kpNoA">XboxEra Podcast</a>, reported last year Dark Souls 3 Remastered was in development. Series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> previously told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-3-interview-it-wouldnt-be-right-to-cont/1100-6432425/">Gamespot</a> he considered Dark Souls 3 to be "the big closure on the series". But would this rule out a remaster?</p>
<p>Armored Core 6, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">a successful revival of the series for FromSoftware</a>, selling 3m units in under a year. It seems likely the studio would want to build on that success.</p>
<p>All we officially know for sure is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods will be heading to Switch 2</a> and will combine vampires with jetpacks and dinosaurs. Miyazaki has also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">FromSoftware's focus hasn't shifted to multiplayer</a>, despite this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
British video game composer and sound designer Peter Connelly, known for his work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>, has been jailed for 16 months after being found guilty of fraudulently claiming a second Covid loan.
</p>
<p>
The news was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud">announced on the UK government's website</a> by its Insolvency Service agency, which appears to have embarked on a flashy series of press releases in recent months featuring dramatic ink-stamp graphics with words like "JAILED", "LOAN FRAUD", and "BANNED".
</p>
<p>
According to the agency's announcement, Connelly overstated his company's turnover to obtain a second Bounce Back Loan of £37,500 in 2020. Bounce Back Loans were provided to businesses who might otherwise have struggled to access finance during the Covid pandemic, but companies were only entitled to one. Connelly is said to have secured his first loan, for £22,000, at a different bank just a month earlier.
</p>
<p>
"Peter Connelly blatantly disregarded the rules of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, designed to support small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic," the Insolvency Service's chief investigator David Snasdell said in a statement accompanying the news.
</p>
<p>
In interviews with the Insolvency Service, Connelly told investigators he had been given the potentially lucrative opportunity to re-imagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack, and had taken out personal loans and sold his car to complete the project. Things then "stalled" at the start of the pandemic, and Connelly's company, Peter Connelly Limited, went into liquidation in August 2021 without repaying either loan.
</p>
<p>
Connelly, who previously signed an Individual Voluntary Arrangement agreeing to repay his debts, was found guilty of fraud and was jailed for 16 months by Durham Crown Court on Thursday, 17th July. The 52-year-old is also banned from being a company director for six years.
</p>
<p>
Connelly composed soundtracks for a number of Tomb Raider games while the series was under <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/core-design">Core Design</a>'s stewardship in the 1990s and early 2000s, including The Last Revelation, Chronicles, and The Angel of Darkness. He's also provided sound design work for the likes of Watch Dogs, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a>, and 2023's Dead Island 2.

Julian LeFay - who oversaw multiple Elder Scrolls games as chief engineer at Bethesda, and is often referred to as the 'father' of the series - is stepping back from game development to spend his "remaining time with his family and loved ones" following his cancer diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after its founding in 1987, and worked on the likes of The Elder Scrolls: Arena in 1994 and its 1996 sequel Daggerfall, before departing the company in 1998. LeFay briefly returned for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, and pursued various other ventures before setting up independent studio OnceLost Games with fellow Elder Scrolls alumni Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman in 2019. Since then, the studio has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wayward-realms-is-a-grand-rpg-by-former-elder-scrolls-devs">working on The Wayward Realms</a>, an open-world RPG announced in 2021.
</p>
<p>
News of LeFay's departure from the project, and from game development as a whole, was announced in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwMyPR8Li6k">emotional video addressed to The Wayward Realms community</a> on YouTube. "Our technical producer Julian LeFay, who I'm sure needs no introduction, has been fighting a battle with cancer for the last several years," creative producer Victor Villarreal explained. "He's fought bravely and strongly but it seems he doesn't have very much time left. He has stepped away from the project to spend that remaining time with his family and loved ones."

<p>
Villarreal also invited fans to "share any words, thoughts, or memories you might have of Julian, as well as any well-wishes you might have for his family." He noted the studio would discuss how the news impacts The Wayward Realms at a later date, adding: "It is something we've been preparing for. Julian has made his vision of the game very clear to the team and we will work tirelessly to bring that vision to life."
</p>
<p>
A separate, lengthier statement from LeFay's long-time friend and colleague Ted Peterson was shared alongside the video. "I could talk stories about our friendship and how we've worked together recently with our team on Wayward Realms as creative and technical directors," Peterson wrote, "but I need to come to the point of this. Julian has been courageously battling cancer. His doctors have informed us that his time with us is limited, and we are preparing to say goodbye to a true legend of the industry."
</p>
<p>
"Obviously, the team has already had a chance to say goodbye and give their individual messages, and I sat by his hospital bed, reading them to him," Peterson continued. "In that case, I was reading them out loud and Julian was giving me dictation to reply back, which is rather hard to do through my tears... To me, this is deeply personal, and I regret every second I didn't spend with one of the most charming, smart, funny, and interesting people I've ever met. It's also a spur to action for me: I will not let down his legacy."
</p>
<p>
"That said," Peterson concluded, "a final quote from the eminently quotable Julian LeFay. He said this at our last team meeting, and I believe it represents him and his beliefs well. 'It is personal. And if it's not personal, then you're just doing work for hire and you'll never have the motivation to accomplish a significant goal.'"
</p>
<p>
OnceLost also <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1945983192617652588">shared a follow-up message</a> from LeFay's daughter Shae on its social media page. "The best any of us can hope for is to leave this life and know that we have made a positive impact," she wrote. "That is my dad's greatest motivation to this very day. We are truly grateful for the outpouring of love and support since the announcement was made."
</p>
<p>
"It has reinvigorated both myself and my father and given us a sense of peace in stressful times, knowing of the impact he has made on all of you. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, everyone. We will continue to read the comments to keep our sprits up in the days ahead."
