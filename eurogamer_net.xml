            <p>
Team Cherry has revealed details of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first patch, which will make the early game a little easier.
</p>
<p>
That will be welcome news to those playing the game, as it's proven to be extremely challenging. And not just for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-developers-are-trolling-players-with-a-seemingly-safe-haven">its trick bench</a>.
</p>
<p>
In particular, a couple of early bosses will have "slight difficulty reduction", on top of other enemies receiving damage reduction, and some increases in rosary rewards.

            <p>
Late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata laughed at the prospect of localising the original Animal Crossing, as he believed the game was so specific to Japan it would be too difficult.
</p>
<p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west">Time Extension</a>, former Nintendo localisation manager Leslie Swan discussed some of the challenges of the job, citing the original Animal Crossing - first released in Japan on N64 as Animal Forest, before a localised version was released in America on the GameCube - as a particularly tricky project.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Takashi Tezuka, who worked as a producer on Animal Crossing, asked Swan to localise the game. She agreed, despite not playing the game herself in advance as she usually would. "But then he said, 'No, Leslie, I'm not sure you understand, it's going to be difficult'," she said. "And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen."
</p>

<p>
She continued: "Then like a month or two later, I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group, and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on', and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter. He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."
</p><p>
The localisation team had to rename every character, every catchphrase, and all the events, Swan explained. "So we wanted whatever it was to be something that would be useful in as many areas as possible so we would do things like call it 'Fireworks Day' or something so other cultures, not just the US, would be able to use it without it being tied to Independence Day," she said.
</p>
<p>
"Then there were also some items that didn't make sense at all. They would have so much charm in the Japanese version, but they wouldn't have provided the same kind of charm for Western audiences. I can't tell you the number of hours we spent on that game, all hands on deck. We were so lucky at that point that we didn't have other big projects, as we pretty much had the entire staff dedicated to that game."
</p>
<p>
In addition, the legal department had to clear every name, as the team were sure merchandise would be an option if the game sold well.
</p>
<p>
"It must have been at least six months or maybe a year for us to clear the name Animal Crossing," Swan continued. "I remember we had so many other names that we were in love with and then we would be crushed when they would be rejected. My favourite was 'Animal Acres', because the grids of the town lent themselves to being called acres. But again, that didn't clear."
</p><p>
Hundreds of names were considered, before finalising Animal Crossing. "We really wanted to maintain 'Animal' in the name," said Swan. "And we did try to keep 'Forest' in the name too, but legal told us, 'No, that's not going to happen'."
</p>
<p>
Swan was also the voice of Princess Peach in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>, in addition to working in the localisation team and on Nintendo Power. Eventually, she left Nintendo and retired in 2016.
</p>
<p>
"I have to say, I was so lucky to be able to work at Nintendo," she reflected. "It was a lot of work. It was a lot of stress. But one of the things that kept me there as long as I stayed was I just felt like I was learning something new with every single product we worked on. There was new technology and there was always something new to be learned, and the teams I worked with were just so energetic. The whole of the company was just oozing energy. It felt like such a family."

            <p>While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s cute character designs may suggest something light and effortless, do not be fooled. Silksong is not an easy game to play. In fact, it is darn difficult, requiring plenty of precision, be it platforming of fighting.</p>
<p>Thankfully, developer Team Cherry has popped a number of benches throughout Silksong, where the game's protagonist Hornet (and the player), can take some weight off and recover from the perils that have come before, before heading once more out into the fray. Except, when the team hasn't…</p>
<p>You see, many players have come to realise that Team Cherry has in fact planted at least one trick bench in the depths of Silksong, that doesn't really play fair (<strong>please read no further if you do not want to know where</strong>).</p>

<p>Silksong's trick bench can be found in Hunter's March, which itself is found off The Marrow. As with many other areas in Silksong, it is tricky. It's an area you can do early on, but should probably come back to with more upgrades to actually have a better chance of getting through. Needless to say, when you get to a bench, you will likely feel a sense of relief, and want to finally pause and take a breather. Except this trick bench will scupper that breather, and when Hornet sits on it she will activate a spike trap that will whop a load of health off. Ouch!</p><p>A post on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> reddit titled <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1nb3721/i_have_no_words_this_is_the_most_anger_i_have/">'I have no words. This is the most anger I have ever felt for any game ever. I had one mask'</a>, with an accompanying picture of the offending bench, has been commented on by many other players who feel a similar amount of anguish (though largely in good humour).</p>
<p>"I was like 'finally, a bench', sat down at two masks and let go of my keyboard.. Died," one reply reads. "My partner was spectating the whole thing and we just laughed for five minutes.</p>
<p>"Damn, the developer had <em>fun </em>making this game for seven years."</p>
<p>You can check out Silksong's bench trap in action via the posts below.</p> <figure>

<p>Thankfully, you can disable the trap, and the trick bench then becomes a regular safe bench. If you head to the left side of the bench before sitting on it, you will come across a lever. Swing Hornet's needle at it, and you will deactivate the spikes (phew).</p>

            <p>It's 9th September - I feel like a human calendar - and we're back with another coagulation of all of today's gaming news and events.</p>
<p>Today's question is: 'Borderlands 4 - are you planning to play it?' Because it's creeping up on us: this major new instalment is out on Friday (12th). And I'm curious: is there excitement among you for it? (I'm low-key trying to gauge who I can play with.)</p>
