            <p>Ubisoft is currently holding a call with its investors, and 15 minutes before the call began, the French company issued a rare delay to the release of its quarterly earnings release and halted trading on its shares, a fairly alarming move that has got some people online wondering what's going on at the publisher.</p>
<p>According to an unexpected November 13 press release, the company has decided to postpone sharing its earnings "until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results." Ubisoft requests that Euronext (a European exchange market) to halt trading until further notice.</p>
<p>The publisher's statement reads:</p>
<blockquote>Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26. Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.</blockquote>
<p>The suspension will remain in place until the company publishes the delayed results "in the coming days", Ubisoft announced in said in a statement shared with both <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/ubisoft-delays-half-year-results-requests-trading-suspension-2025-11-13/">Reuters</a> and posted online to various social media channels.</p>
<p>The motives for why the company has made this move are currently unclear. Well-known analyst for Nico Partners and online personality, Daniel Ahmad, notes that "this could imply an acquisition of sorts", or "could [...] imply some accounting / financial issue." </p><p>If you're wondering if Ubisoft is doing this because of broader market conditions, it's worth noting that whilst markets are in a downward trend today, it's only by about 1% in tech/financials markets (at time of writing, 6pm on 13th October). The most simple answer? Today’s earnings report is going to be spicy, and is liable to cause a big swing in the price of Ubisoft shares. In the current call, it's possible investors will discover additional info that will have an impact on business decsions they'll want to make.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on this story, and update you when more information reveals itself.</p>
