            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> continues to enjoy tons of success, nearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-had-nearly-1000000-concurrent-players-last-month-and-thats-on-pc-alone">almost 1m concurrent players </a>on PC alone and pushing onwards with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-shared-watch-event-rewards-pve">events</a> and regular updates <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/roadmap-january-april-2026">planned out until April</a>. Its <em>actual health </em>hasn't been great in 2026 so far though.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-latest-duplication-glitch-has-players-placing-hundreds-of-ziplines-and-trigger-nades-and-safe-to-say-its-scaring-everyone-i-hope-this-gets-addressed-soon/">massive duplication glitch</a> allowed cheeky players to double anything they were holding in their hands, which translated in maps littered with all sorts of traps and ziplines, among other things. Game balance issues aside, this was also bad for performance in especially crowded areas, so you can imagine why Embark Studios needed to act quickly on that whole mess.</p>
<p>Right after a hotfix was deployed to deal with the duplication glitch, another problem arose: <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-immediately-suffers-an-infinite-ammo-exploit-after-embark-fixes-a-dupe-heightening-criticism-of-the-studios-soft-response-to-cheaters/">an infinite ammo exploit</a>. This one also affected magazine sizes and even gun durability, which completely demolished Arc Raiders' in-game economy and the loop of looting and making do with whatever you can scavenge and preserve. In the following weeks, Embark has been hitting the game hard with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1808500/allnews/">patches</a>, both small and large, ahead of <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-arrives-next-week-embark-confirms-but-there-will-be-no-major-game-update-this-week-to-tide-you-over-until-then/">this month's 'Shrouded Sky' content update</a>.</p>
<p>Today, 17th February, the developers also confirmed <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/an-update-on-recent-exploits-and-corrective-actions">they'd finished conducting a large investigation</a> into how the recent exploits and glitches came to be and how to deal with offenders now and in the future. "Though these exploits stemmed from a design flaw on our part, the way they were used had a real impact on the game's economy and the way the community experienced ARC Raiders. It's on us to address that and work to restore balance," the article states before elaborating on why it's taken a while to see more substantial comms regarding all this drama.</p><p>Though the studios is supposedly better prepared for future events like these, the powers that be are warning they'll "be taking actions based on severity, intent, frequency, and impact." Warnings will be issued for "low-severity cases," coins obtained through these glitches will be deleted, and suspensions will be dished out for the "severe cases" that completely ruined other players' fun.</p>
<p>Embark is fully aware this won't be the last time it has to deal with rampaging exploits and whatnot, and is encouraging lawful raiders to share their findings through the game's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders">official Discord sever</a>.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has revealed the next batch of games coming to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service this February, and into next month.</p>
<p>Along with the already announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-xbox-game-pass-games-for-february">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Avowed</a>, which are available from today (17th February), Game Pass subscribers can look forward to the following games making their way onto the service:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aerial_Knight's DropShot</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 17th February via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Death Howl</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>EA Sports College Football 26</strong> (Cloud and Xbox Series X/S) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate</li>
<li><strong>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</strong> – Complete Edition (Cloud and Console) – 19th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium</li>
<li><strong>TCG Card Shop Simulator</strong> (Game Preview) (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, Handheld, and PC) – 24th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Dice A Million</strong> (PC) – 25th February via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Towerborne</strong> (Full Game Release) (Console, Handheld, and PC) – 26th February via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Final Fantasy 3</strong> (Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) – 3rd March via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
<li><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </strong>(Cloud, Xbox Series X/S, and PC) – 3rd March via Game Pass Ultimate, Premium, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>I am quite intrigued by Death Howl, which is a soulslike deck builder.  The game is described as a "poignant tale of grief, healing, and resilience", and follows the journey of hunter Ro as she leaves her tribe and ventures into a disturbingly realised realm of the spirits in the hope of reuniting with her deceased son.</p><p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, meanwhile, garnered a lot of love for its dedication to toil and turmoil in Bohemia, told through the eyes of Henry of Skalitz. A hardy combat system and eager embrace of vulgarity come together in a compelling RPG well worth playing.</p>

<p>As with every month, with new games coming to Game Pass, it does mean a selection of others will be leaving. On 28th February, the following with be leaving the service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monster Train (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Injustice 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
