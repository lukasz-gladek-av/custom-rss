Xbox won't switch on? Microsoft has announced you can now head down to high street chain Currys to get your console repaired. 
</p>
<p>
Currys has been named as the UK's first ever Xbox Authorised Service Provider, following the retailer's previous partnership with Microsoft to act as similar for the company's Surface laptops.
</p>
<p>
If you have a broken Xbox Series S or Series X, Currys stores will now host "expert colleagues" who may be able to help, a press release from Microsoft today states.

<p>
Alternatively, Currys can also help get your console booked in to be repaired. Fun fact: this will be within Europe's largest tech repair centre, which is based in Newark, Nottinghamshire. 
</p>
<p>
While consoles out of warranty will presumably not be repaired for free, there is a positive spin to all this which is to encourage people to try and repair goods where possible, rather than simply throwing them away and creating more electronic waste.
</p>
<p>If you're in the US, Microsoft announced a similar partnership last month with uBreakiFix by Asurion, which is now the first Xbox Authorised Service Provider over the pond. It will also seek to repair Xbox consoles, at nearly 700 participating store locations State-side.
</p>

            <p>Bandai Namco has reportedly lost over a hundred staff in the last year.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namco-studios-staff-silently-reduced-by-over-100-people-japan-pension-service-database-shows/">Automaton</a>, according to the <a href="https://www2.nenkin.go.jp/do/search_section/">online database of Japan's Pension Service</a>, the company's staff headcount dropped from 1294 on 1st April 2024 to 1177 on 4th February 2025 - a decrease of 117 people.</p>
<p>It's unclear which projects these employees were working on, or whether they left the company voluntarily or not.</p>

<p>The news follows a report from Bloomberg last year stating the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-reportedly-cuts-japanese-workforce-but-denies-pressuring-voluntary-leave">company was cutting its Japanese workforce</a> and cancelling a number of projects due to lacklustre demand.</p>
<p>What's more, while staff had not been directly laid off, around 200 employees were sent to what's known as "oidashi beya" - rooms where staff are left without a project to work on, often used instead for job hunting. These rooms are utilised in Japan due to strict labour laws making layoffs difficult to enforce.</p>
<p>At the time, Bandai Namco denied using these rooms. "Our decisions to discontinue games are based on comprehensive assessments of the situation. Some employees may need to wait a certain amount of time before they are assigned their next project, but we do move forward with assignments as new projects emerge," said a representative from Bandai Namco. "There is no organisation like an 'oidashi beya' at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bandai-namco-studios">Bandai Namco Studios</a> designed to pressure people to leave voluntarily."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has once again contacted Bandai Namco to confirm this latest loss of staff, but the company declined to comment.</p>
<p>However, these numbers from Japan's Pension Service do appear to line up with Bloomberg's report.</p>
<p>The Japan-only MMORPG Blue Protocol was cancelled by Bandai Namco in August last year, ahead of its Amazon Games published worldwide release. Mobile game Tales of the Rays was also shut down last year.</p>
<p>Several other projects have reportedly been cancelled or paused, including a project commissioned by Nintendo.</p>
<p>Last month, the Bandai Namco-published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unknown-9-franchise-cancelled-as-developer-admits-game-didnt-come-near-expectations-series-didnt-warrant-any-further-exploration">Unknown 9 franchise was cancelled</a> as the developer admitted it "didn't come near" expectations.</p>
<p>Next for Bandai Namco will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">network test for Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign</a> later this month.</p>
<p>The news also follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">bizarre LinkedIn update from Tekken boss Katsuhiro Harada</a> who, after posting he was looking for new job opportunities, claimed he just wants to "meet more people and expand my horizons in the future".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Former Dragon Age lead developers have reacted to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-suggests-dragon-age-the-veilguard-might-have-sold-better-if-it-was-live-service-so-what-does-this-mean-for-mass-effect-5">suggestion by publisher EA that the series' most recent entry would have sold better as a live-service game</a>. 
</p>
<p>
This week, EA boss Andrew Wilson said players "increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement", while the company's chief financial officer bluntly claimed that "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> underperformed, icing the competitive dynamics of the single-player RPG market".
</p>
<p>
The remarks raised eyebrows among fans, not least because Dragon Age: The Veilguard previously pivoted to being a live-service game mid-way through its development, only for EA to see sense and revert it back after BioWare's actual live-service effort Anthem was a flop.

<p>
"Look, I'm not a fancy CEO guy," former Dragon Age creative director <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lhhb477frc2h">Mike Laidlaw wrote</a> on social media, "but if someone said to me 'the key to this successful single-player IP's success is to make it purely a multiplayer game. No, not a spin off: fundamentally change the DNA of what people loved about the core game' to me, I'd probably, like, quit that job or something."
</p>
<p>
Laidlaw worked on the Dragon Age series from its creation, and was set to serve as director on what became Dragon Age: The Veilguard, up until its live-service pivot. It was at this point that Laidlaw did indeed quit BioWare, after more than 15 years, to go elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
"Just thinking out loud, of course," Laidlaw continued. "Who'd be silly enough to demand something like that? ...Twice."
</p>
<p>
Fellow BioWare veteran David Gaider also chipped in, offering his perspective after having served as lead writer on the series up until The Veilguard.
</p>
<p>
"If I really dig into my empathy, I can kinda see the thinking here," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lhibt3rwk22l">Gaider wrote</a> on social media. "Like, let's say you don't actually know much about games. You're in a big office with a bunch of other execs who also don't know much about games. What are they all saying? 'Live games do big numbers!' 'Action games are hot!'"
</p>
<p>
"My advice to EA (not that they care): you have an IP that a lot of people love. Deeply. At its height, it sold well enough to make you happy, right? Look at what it did best at the point where it sold the most. Follow [<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> studio] Larian's lead and double down on that. The audience is still there. And waiting. ❤️"
</p>
<p>
Laidlaw wound up founding his own indie studio, and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-strands-review">just released the single-player RPG Eternal Strands</a>. It launched this month on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Game Pass, if you fancy a new role-player that's not a live-service now.

            <p>The release date for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> has leaked early, along with a new trailer.</p>
<p>As updated on the PSN Store (and shared to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-releases-august-25th-2025-new-trailer-on-ps-store.1101735/">ResetEra</a>), the game will release on 28th August this year.</p>
<p>The release date is also in the new trailer, which shows a fresh look at familiar scenes from the classic stealth action game. The trailer ends with a monkey from Ape Escape slapping its bum, a nod to the Snake vs Monkey minigame in the original release that's presumably been recreated here too. (Below is the previously released trailer)</p>

<p>The game is also listed as being <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> Enhanced, though no further details are known.</p>
<p>Could this release date have accidentally been uploaded early ahead of a State of Play later this month?</p>
<p>Last year, a PlayStation blog in January suggested the game would release in 2024, but the <a href="http://eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-despite-its-2024-window">year passed without a firm release date</a>. It's widely expected to be released this year instead, but there's been no official word from Sony or Konami.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a remake of the third <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> game, which is chronologically the first. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">remake has been done with future generations in mind</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura said in an interview last year.</p>
<p>"It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura said. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
