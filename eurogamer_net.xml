            <p>
The grey, uncomfortably moist British summer is finally here and Epic is celebrating the occasion - well, the season - with the launch of its Epic Store Summer Sale. But there's more, seeing as Thursday also marks a fresh batch of new freebies, which this week includes Civilisation 6.
</p>
<p>
Starting with those freebies, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vi--platinum-edition">Civilisation 6 is available in its Platinum Edition</a>, meaning you get the base game, six DLC packs, and two expansions for your initial outlay of zero pence. That's good! Civilisation 6 is good (shut up haters)! So you should download it now.
</p>
<p>
Civ 6 will continue to be free until next Thursday, 24th July, after which Legion TD 2 - an "infinitely replayable multiplayer and single-player tower defense" game - takes its place.
</p>
<p>
So that's the free stuff out the way, which brings us to Epic's Summer Sale, which runs from today, 17th July, until 31st July. Working slightly backward, all purchases made during the sale (and using Epic's payment system) will earn you Epic Reward points as usual, but the percentage has been boosted to 20 percent. There's also a permanent 20 percent back for all purchases made in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>.
</p>
<p>
So what of this sale? Epic's calling it "two weeks of discounts on best-selling games, from the biggest titles to some excellent indie games." And there's some good stuff here. There's 10 percent off developer Sandfall Interactive's highly acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/expedition-33-b3240d"></a>, for instance, plus 25 percent off <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, 50 percent off <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-remastered">Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</a>, or 20 percent off if you <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/marvels-spider-man-2">opt for its sequel</a>. There's plenty more of course, and you'll find it all as you <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US">peruse moistly around the Epic Games Store</a>.

It's not magic brain science to suggest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> is going to be big, but one investment firm has suggested it's going to be big to the tune of $7.6bn in just two months, while also securing the accolade of "largest gaming release of all time." 
</p>
<p>
That's according to Josh Chapman, managing partner at "thesis driven investment firm" Konvoy Ventures (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-will-clear-7-6-billion-in-first-60-days-investment-firm-predicts/1100-6533204/">GameSpot</a>). Chapman shared his predictions <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo/">over on LinkedIn</a>, suggesting GTA 6 will be the "largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time".
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Chapman believes Grand Theft Auto 6 will generate $7.6bn USD in revenue in the first 60 days of its launch, and that it'll recoup its development costs in under a month. It's worth noting, however, all this is based on certain unconfirmed assumptions. Chapman's maths assumes the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">base version of GTA 6 will cost $80</a> (neither Rockstar nor publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> have announced a price yet, but there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">certainly</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">precedent</a>), and his predictions are also based on a speculative development budget of $2bn - a figure that's long been rumoured, but never actually confirmed.

<p>
Things then veer away from the financial to the perhaps a little fanciful, with Chapman calling GTA 6 the 'next user-generated platform'. More specifically, he predicts it'll "have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>] and Roblox)", alongside "200-person lobbies [with] higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily."
</p>
<p>
None of that's particularly far-fetched, of course, but neither is it supported by any real evidence, but given Chapman notes, "In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released", there's maybe a bit of room for some enthusiastic wishful thinking.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May next year, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">not exactly unexpected delay in May</a>. And there's little doubt it's going to be big; as Take-Two confirmed earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to assume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to do that and then some.
