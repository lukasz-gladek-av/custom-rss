<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure was released last month across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. The Switch version was created by Engine Software in association with developer Deck Nine Games.</p>
<p>It's a direct sequel to the first game in the series and follows original protagonist Max, though this has proven controversial with some fans due to the consequences of the original game's final choice.</p>
<p>Deck Nine is the studio responsible for various <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> prequels, follow-ups and remasters. The original game, however, was developed by Don't Nod.</p>
<p>That studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-director-hits-out-at-hateful-comments-about-life-is-strange-double-exposure">creative director Michel Koch hit back at "hateful" comments</a> against Deck Nine from disappointed fans.</p>
<p>"I didn't play the game yet, and I have no idea where they are taking the story. But what I know is that nothing justifies hating on people for how they wrote their game!" he wrote on Twitter/X.</p>
<p>"You can be disappointed, you can want other narratives for those characters you love, or different stories… but ultimately creation is hard and very subjective and if [Double Exposure's] story does not please you, it does not erase what you imagined."</p>
<p>"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-playstations-state-of-play-may-2024">brief tease earlier in the year</a>, Sony has now lifted the lid further on Alien: Rogue Incursion, with a new trailer and - importantly - a release date.</p>
<p>The upcoming game was once slated for launch on PS VR2 at some point this 'holiday' season, but today the team narrowed that tenuous date down. VR fans, get your headsets ready, Alien: Rogue Incursion is set to make its unsettling debut on 19th December.</p>
<p>In addition to this date, Survios' chief product officer <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/alien-rogue-incursion-new-story-trailer-gameplay-details/">TQ Jefferson</a> shared a new story trailer, which "delves deeper into Zula’s [the game's protagonist] story on LV-354, also known as Purdan". </p>
<p>Jefferson said this trailer was made with a three-act structure, culminating in a "big finish". I won't spoil that big finish for you here, because where is the fun in that? Instead, you can find out for yourself by checking out Alien: Rogue Incursion's new story trailer for yourself below.</p>

<p>Speaking on the trailer's third act, Jefferson stated: "We’ve established by this point that danger is truly everywhere, and now we want to show players that you have the means to fight back."</p>
<p>Zula will be able to do this with weapons such as the M41 Prototype Pulse Rifle and gear such as a Plasma Torch, with Jefferson saying all of this will allow players to experience the world of Alien "like you never have before".</p><p>"You will finally get to feel what it’s like to step into the world of the films - Aliens in particular - and immerse yourself in an experience so visceral and real that it will change your perceptions forever," the developer proclaimed, adding the game has gone gold.</p>
<p>So, what did you think?</p>

First up, we have Mare, a puzzle adventure, which is available from today. Then we have Trombone Champ: Unflattened, which arrives on 26th November.

            <p>A sequel to Turtle Rock's bloody good <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> is seemingly in development under the codename "Gobi 2".</p>
<p>Whilst Turtle Rock confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/back-4-blood-wont-get-more-new-content-as-dev-shifts-focus-to-new-game">work had shifted to its next title at the beginning of last year</a> and there has been no official word that Back 4 Good 2 is coming, there have been plenty of rumours, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gtphrt/back_4_blood_2_seems_to_be_in_development_under/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">latest of which</a> may be our strongest hint yet that a follow-up to the Left4Dead-style zombie slaughter game is on its way.</p>

<p>Firstly, take a look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/633807/depots/">Back 4 Blood's backend on Steam</a>. There you'll see the word "Gobi", which was seemingly the internal codename for Back 4 Blood.</p>
<p>Now take a look at the <a href="https://www.istunt.com/jesse-hutch-4776">online portfolio</a> of motion capture actor and stuntman Jesse Hutch, who includes his performance as a "lead performer" in "Gobi 2". More interestingly still, Hutch <em>also</em> worked on the original Back 4 Blood game. Curiouser and curiouser, right?</p>

<p>Whilst we won't know for sure until Turtle Rock make it official, this - along with the domain back4blood2.com being registered last year - makes the sequel all the more likely. Watch this space, eh?</p>
<p>Back 4 Blood launched back in October 2021 and has received a total of three paid expansions since then. It was generally well-received, with Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell calling it a "delightfully scrappy hang-out shooter" that delivered a successful if "strange mix of old and new" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/back-4-blood-review-weird-but-wonderfully-moreish-horde-shooter">Recommended review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
