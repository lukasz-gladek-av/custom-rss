        <p>Plus Resistance 1 &amp; 2 and more!</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-november-grand-theft-auto-v-dying-light-2-stay-human-like-a-dragon-ishin-and-more/">revealed</a> the games coming to PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra subscribers this month, with November's offerings including Dying Light 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/like-a-dragon-ishin">Like a Dragon: Ishin</a>!, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> (presumably for the benefit of the two remaining people who haven't yet played it).
</p>
<p>
In total, November brings 12 new PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for Premium and Extra members, alongside five Premium-exclusive titles - including Insomniac's fondly remembered PS3 shooters <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resistance-fall-man">Resistance: Fall of Man</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resistance-2">Resistance 2</a> - which combine to look like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Dying Light 2: Stay Human (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Like a Dragon: Ishin! (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>MotoGP 24 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>The Sims 4 Island Living - add-on only (PS4)</li>
<li>Digimon Survive (PS4)</li>
<li>Overcooked! All You Can Eat (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Stick Fight: The Game (PS4)</li>
<li>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Killer Frequency (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Hungry Shark World (PS4)</li>
<li>Chivalry 2 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Synapse (PSVR2)</li>
<li>Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Blood Omen 2 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Resistance: Fall of Man </li>
<li>Resistance 2</li>
</ul>
<p>
So while November's Premium and Extra catalogue additions aren't, perhaps, quite as strong as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/octobers-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-games-include-dead-island-2-dino-crisis">last month's stellar line-up</a>, there's still plenty of amusement to be found. GTA5 needs no introduction, of course, but there's also solid parkour-focused zombie slaying in Dying Light 2, enjoyable historical action as Like a Dragon spins off into the Edo period with Ishin!, and even some chaotic multiplayer medieval hack-and-slashery in the acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chivalry-2">Chivalry 2</a>.
</p><p>
And that's on top of those Premium tier exclusives, pretty much all good stuff this month. Alongside the first two Resistance games, there's Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain and its sequel - which should stand you in good stead if you been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-enhancements-include-map-compass-and-more">eyeing the upcoming Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 remasters</a> - plus some solid sci-fi shooting with Synapse for PSVR2.
</p>
<p>
All the above joins the PlayStation Plus game catalogue next Tuesday, 19th November, and you'll find more details on what else is on offer in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">full PlayStation Plus guide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hundreds of staff at Bethesda parent company ZeniMax will go on strike today in protest at parent company Microsoft outsourcing work without bargaining with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union. 
</p>
<p>
The one-day walkout by staff who work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Doom will be held today, Wednesday 13th November, from 10am to 6pm local time at four ZeniMax Studios offices in Maryland and Texas. 
</p>
<p>
Staff say they are concerned over the "unilateral decision" to outsource quality assurance (QA) work to external teams at a time of uncertainty and layoffs. In short, the worry is ZeniMax will undercut its own union staff by shifting the work elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>ZeniMax workers say they have also been prompted to walk out over continued concerns over remote work policies - the same issue which sparked a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy">protest by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 developers at Activision's QA studio in Minnesota</a> at the end of last month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted ZeniMax and Microsoft for comment.
</p>
<p>"Today, we are on strike," reads a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714377992278336">statement</a> from the striking workers' union posted on X. "We are not afraid to do what's necessary to make sure that Microsoft meets us at the bargaining table over key issues like remote work options and outsourcing."</p> <div>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recognises-300-person-zenimax-testers-union">Microsoft recognised the ZeniMax Studios union back in January 2023</a>, when 300 video game testers who worked on ZeniMax and Bethesda titles grouped together under the CWA. 
</p>
<p>
The union was the first Microsoft recognised and the largest video game union in the US. At the time, Microsoft was still battling to buy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, and was keen to voluntarily recognise worker unions to mitigate concerns over its growing portfolio's impact on workers.
</p><p>
"The Xbox business has never been more healthy," Microsoft's gaming boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Phil Spencer said in a Bloomberg interview published just earlier today</a>, when asked what the future had in store following a year filled with Microsoft layoffs. "The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build."
