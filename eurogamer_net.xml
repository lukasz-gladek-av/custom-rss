            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-streaming-ratings-down">Fallout Season 2</a> has been great fun so far, and it seems folks continue to tune in to find out what's next for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus. Its ratings are positioning it as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">one of Prime Video's biggest seasons of TV ever</a>. Now, we've received word straight from Amazon MGM Studios that episodes 7 and 8 will drop a bit earlier to accommodate East and West Coast viewers.</p>
<p>The second season's penultimate episodes now premiere globally on Prime Video Tuesday, 27th January, at 6pmPT/9pmET. Next week, the Season 2 finale will be on the platform at the same time on Tuesday, 3rd February. That's a six-hour change to allow all American viewers to catch the episodes before bed time. As for us Europeans, these are still dropping in the middle of the night, which is, uh, not ideal.</p>
<p>To celebrate the news and the start of this season's final stretch, Amazon also shared a new poster featuring most of the show's key players, a menacing Deathclaw, and an all-new suit of NCR-inspired power armour that will surely get diehard fans talking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">Work on Season 3 is already underway</a> after an early renewal in late 2025, with Amazon, Kilter Films, and game developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> all interested in keeping the hit show going and moving as fast as possible. We've yet to see where the lead characters end up at the end of Season 2, which could determine the third season's central setting. The key plot threads (so far) suggest a return to the LA area at some point, but meanwhile, the show could explore more iconic regions of the post-Great War United States as first introduced in the RPG games.</p><p>We know for sure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">Bethesda will be acknowledging the show's world-shaking events</a> one way or another when Fallout 5 becomes a tangible reality, but with rumours of <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/bethesdas-todd-howard-says-we-are-doing-other-things-with-fallout-that-we-havent-announced-and-therell-come-a-time-for-that/">more projects being in development</a> (inside or outside Bethesda's core studio), chances are the Fallout universe will see a lot of changes and additions in the coming years.</p>
<p>For now, the live-action show is leading the creative charge by essentially acting as a sequel to all previous games in the franchise, and that thankfully isn't stopping it from being its own thing. Can we get more video game adaptations like this one, please?</p>
