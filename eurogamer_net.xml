            <p>Physical copies of OG Switch games upgraded for Nintendo Switch 2, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, will seemingly ship with original Switch 1 cartridges.</p>
<p>That's according to a Nintendo support representative in the UK, who reportedly confirmed in writing that the Switch 2 "enhanced" editions themselves will have to be downloaded separately via "download codes" and then applied to the original version on the cart.</p>

<p>Whilst the exact question posed to the customer rep is not provided, Does It Play on X/Twitter tweeted an image of an email response allegedly taken from a customer services conversation that reportedly stated: "Yes, we can confirm that the upgrades will be download codes. Thank you for your understanding".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">According to a Nintendo UK Support Rep, Switch 2 Editions of physical games like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Metroid Prime 4 contain a download code for the upgrade pack along with a Switch 1 version cart of the game <a href="https://t.co/SK5uo4Thyf">https://t.co/SK5uo4Thyf</a> <a href="https://t.co/vRhUnxTvIX">pic.twitter.com/vRhUnxTvIX</a></p>â€” Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1908538278543786494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1908540986956923197">As Wario64 rightly points out</a>, this wouldn't be the first time a customer service rep unwittingly gave out inaccurate information - so we've reached out to Nintendo for confirmation - and there's nothing on the box art we've seen thus far that suggests a separate download is required.</p>
<p>"And it's weird they would be codes when Nintendo is pivoting to game key carts instead of download codes of retail games," Wario64 added. "I know game key carts are different, I'm highlighting it because it shows Nintendo is offering that solution instead of download codes for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, so offering a code for the upgrade pack doesn't make sense (they could put the upgrade pack as a license on the cart)."</p>
<p>As a commenter <a href="https://x.com/UltraJohnus/status/1908545794161942790">points out</a>, it all feels "needlessly convoluted", although others suggest it's "part of the plan".</p>
<p>"Pretty simple. If you resell the Switch 2 key cart, then the new person will have to purchase the upgrade pack. More money for Nintendo. Sounds like part of the plan," <a href="https://x.com/Setebos_Caliban/status/1908544726094987748">opined one</a>.</p>
<p>We'll try and clear things up as/when Nintendo comes back to us.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Stateside Nintendo fans will have to wait a little bit longer before they can pre-order a Switch 2</a> after Nintendo of American confirmed that US preorders - which were scheduled to go live on 9th April - will now be delayed "in order to assess the potential impact of [President Trump's] tariffs and evolving market conditions".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has confirmed with Nintendo that there are no current plans to adjust the ongoing pre-order process here in the UK.</p>

<p>Rise of the Ronin released on Steam on 11th March 2025, and it's currently sitting on a "mixed" user score, with just 57 percent of the 3118 reviewers opting to award it a positive rating.</p>
<p>Like many other PC ports of late, much of the criticism is aimed squarely at the game's "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/HatedSovietLion/recommended/1340990/">horrible</a>" optimisation, including issues with enemies loading in for bossfights, missing NPCs, invisible walls, and missing assets like ladders.</p>
<p>"I really like the gameplay, the combat, maybe the exploration (it has its issues, though) but I can't recommend this game in good faith when it has some of the most terrible optimisation ever," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/someone64/recommended/1340990/">explained</a> one player.</p> <div>

<p>"Not only that, but they managed to update the game to make it both look AND perform worse in an attempt to band-aid fix the performance issues, effectively ruining something I could at least enjoy before."</p>
<p>"A shame, the game seems quite good, but the port is just not worth paying any money for," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198148598345/recommended/1340990/">opined another</a>. "Performance is abysmal, frame rates above 60 fps lead to issues and bugs, and the only way to get a frame rate close to anything playable is to set lots of graphical options to the lowest, leading to a very poor image. I would love to play the game, but nobody should be paying for a port in a state like this."</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rise-of-the-ronin-review">awarded Rise of the Ronin four out of five stars</a> in Eurogamer's review, saying: "[Developer] Team Ninja borrows the open-world familiarity and historical tourism of Assassin's Creed while adapting its own breed of hardcore action for the mainstream."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> teased the news on 1st April and shared an image of a Bangboo daubed in Xbox-flavoured branding.

<p>In a tweet posted earlier today (5th April), however - several days <em>after</em> global prank day, thankfully - HoYo doubled down and revealed that an official livestream slated for next week will include an "exclusive reveal of [its] upcoming Xbox release", confirming the 1st April tweet wasn't a joke at all.</p> <div>

<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zeros-latest-update-adds-cat-testicle-jiggle-physics">two voice actors working on Zenless Zone Zero were suddenly recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike over AI abuse</a>, and discovered the change alongside the publication of the game's patch notes. In a statement subsequently shared on social media, the studio said its contracts offer "explicit AI protections, regardless of union status" and it will continue to work on its clients' projects "in the most human way possible".</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed fans recently noticed that, following the gacha game's latest update, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zeros-latest-update-adds-cat-testicle-jiggle-physics">ambient cats now jiggle their testicles whilst walking</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
