            <p>
If you've been looking forward to your second dose of fungi-orientated misery, there's some good news: HBO has narrowed down the release date for season two of its highly acclaimed The Last of Us live-action adaptation, confirming it's now targeting "spring" 2025.
</p>
<p>
The inevitable second season of The Last of Us (inevitable given the original season was both a critical and commercial smash, managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">win eight Emmys</a> and attract an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">average of 32m viewers per episode</a> the US) was announced in January 2023, just two weeks after the first episode aired. Then, last December, HBO confirmed the show was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">targeting a "2025" release</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, HBO and Max content CEO and chairman Casey Bloys has narrowed that window down further, revealing - during a 2025 programming slate presentation (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/max-reveals-new-release-date-details-for-the-last-of-us-season-2-and-peacemaker-season-2">IGN</a>) - that The Last of US season two will launch in "spring" next year.

<p>
As to what The Last of Us' second season will entail, showrunner Craig Mazin has already confirmed it'll be delving into the events of developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us Part 2, albeit with the game's storyline being split across more than one season. 
</p><p>
"We don't think that we're going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we're taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too," Mazin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">explained</a> earlier this year. "We feel like it's almost assuredly going to be the case that - as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television - season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four."
</p>
<p>
HBO also previously confirmed season two will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">feature a slightly shorter episode count</a>, coming it at seven episodes compared to season one's nine. "The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster," Mazin said in an interview at the time. "When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the [natural] breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes."
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two sees the return of Bella Ramsey as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel, with currently announced newcomers including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, Isabela Merced as Dina, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, and Catherine O'Hara in an unannounced role. Oh, and fans can also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">expect</a> "a lot more infected", according to Mazin.
</p>
<p>
HBO released a new trailer for The Last of Us' second season back in September, and you can read series aficionado Victoria Kennedy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">thorough breakdown of its shots</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer. If nothing else, it'll tide you over until spring next year.

Concord is officially no more, and neither is the studio that made it thanks to recent layoffs at Sony. But the ill-fated PlayStation shooter is set to live on in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Amazon's upcoming Secret Level video game series</a>, and the show's creator reckons its Concord episode - commissioned long before the game's fate was sealed - shows the 'potential of its world and characters'.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/">Rolling Stone</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-ill-fated-concord-animation-shows-potential-of-this-world-and-characters-creator-says">IGN</a>), Secret Level creator Tim Miller - who also directed the first Deadpool movie, and oversaw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>â€™s sci-fi anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots - explained the possibility of removing the Concord episode from Amazon's anthology was never even considered. That's despite Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">pulling the plug on the live-service game just weeks after launch</a> and its recent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">shut down Firewalk Studios</a>.
</p>
<p>
"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show," Miller told Rolling Stone, "because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters. If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."

"There was no nicer, more invested group of developers than the team on Concord," he added. "I honestly don't understand why it didn't work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that."
</p><p>
And while Miller acknowledged the irony of airing an episode based on a game that no longer exists, he noted it's not a whole lot different to the Secret Level episodes dedicated to long-dormant franchises such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> and Mega Man.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level makes its Prime Video debut on 10th December and consists of 15 episodes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-trailer-for-amazons-secret-level-reveals-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-keanu-reeves">reportedly starring the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Keanu Reeves</a>. Armored Core, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Warhammer 40,000, and a number of PlayStation Studios games are also set to feature - with the first batch of episodes covering the mature end of the spectrum, while the latter is more family friendly, according to Miller.
