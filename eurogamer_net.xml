A Super Smash Bros fan app that described itself as "the premium dating app for Smashers" has been blocked from release, its creator has said.
</p>
<p>
SmashTogether was first announced nearly a year ago, back in June 2024, and had this week been edging towards a beta release. 
</p>
<p>
24 hours from launch, Nintendo now appears to have stepped in, as SmashTogether's creator has suddenly reported receiving a notice demanding they cease and desist what they're doing (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-shuts-down-unofficial-smash-bros-dating-app-only-one-day-before-open-beta-launch/">Automaton</a>).

There are lots of reasons why Nintendo likely thought SmashTogether - an app designed to pair up fans of its colourful fighting game filled with kid-friendly characters - was a terrible idea, probable copyright infringement being just one. 
</p>
<p>
Still, there will be some out there who were looking forward to SmashTogether being a thing. Indeed, earlier this week the app's creator announced they had already secured 400 pre-registrations from fans keen to play Smash with other Smash Bros aficionados, and then play smash with them after.
</p>
<p>
Sadly this means - look, let's just get this all out the way - Mario fans will no longer be able to lay pipe, Solid Snake lovers will no longer live up to the name, and you won't be able to browse King Dedede's D.
</p>
<p>
There have been no further updates from the SmashTogether creator since the announcement of that cease and desist, but we've contacted them for comment.

Nintendo's continually-busy legal team recently celebrated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">a "significant" win against piracy for the "entire games industry"</a> after squashing a file-sharing site used for illegal copies of games. The Mario maker is also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">still going after monster battling game Palworld</a> for its various similarities to Pok√©mon.
