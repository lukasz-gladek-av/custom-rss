            <p>FromSoftware has announced the existing Everdark Sovereigns in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will rotate round again before any new additions arrive.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-update-brings-new-challenges-and-a-welcome-live-service-twist">more challenging variants of existing Nightlord bosses</a> were introduced at the end of June, with one Sovereign available to face each week. It began with the Gaping Jaw boss, and was then followed by Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight.</p>
<p>Now, these three bosses will rotate again in pairs, before the remaining bosses are added in their Sovereign form.</p>

<p>The rotation will begin this week as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>10th July - 17th July: Gaping Jaw and Darkdrift Knight</li>
<li>17th July - 24th July: Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight</li>
<li>24th July - 31st July: Gaping Jaw and Sentient Pest</li>
</ul>
<p>Note you won't face them as a pair, just both bosses will be available to challenge.</p>
<p>"The Everdark cycle continues, and the Night grows deeper still," reads a social media post from the studio. "The Everdark Sovereigns Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will be the next abominations to lay waste to Limveld."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>From the Night, familiar terrors rise anew.</p><p>The Everdark Sovereigns Gaping Jaw, Sentient Pest &amp; Darkdrift Knight Nightlords will come back in pairs over the next three weeks in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a>.</p><p>We are thankful of your valiant expeditions against the Everdark. <a href="https://t.co/3jpauUxg2X">pic.twitter.com/3jpauUxg2X</a></p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1942587654463205707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>The timing for these new bosses is still to be announced, but won't be at least until the end of this month.</p>
<p>The new rotation is all part of FromSoftware's live service aspirations for Nightreign, as it continues to update the game.</p>
<p>Still, players are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">awaiting the promised two player mode</a> that's due "at a later date".</p>
<p>There's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-confirmed-dlc-but-what-could-be-included">DLC confirmed</a>, though it remains unknown what this will include or its date of arrival.</p>
<p>Nightreign is FromSoftware's online multiplayer spin-off to its hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, which I described as "an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour" in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-nightfarers-youll-get-another-chance-to-beat-elden-ring-nightreigns-sovereign-super-bosses]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Beyond sharing more about Atsu's quest for vengeance, we're excited to show off her new weapons, new ways to personalise your journey at the edge of Japan, new special modes, and much more," Sucker Punch's senior communications manager Andrew Goldfarb shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/watch-the-ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive-on-july-10/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yōtei is set to launch on Playstation 5 later this year, on 2nd October. As mentioned, the game will focus on Atsu and her quest for vengeance. She is hunting down a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six, you see.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">Sucker Punch teased earlier this year</a>. "She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito."</p>
<p>Personally, I am really looking forward to finding out more. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-confirmed-for-thursday-by-playstation]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Square Enix has invested in a Danish indie studio to accelerate development of its forthcoming ARPG, as the Japanese company continues to look to the west for another publishing hit.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">Square Enix sold off its large western studios</a> and over 50 intellectual properties to Embracer for $300m, including the likes of Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal. It later stated this decision was "driven by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-feared-western-studios-cannibalised-sales-of-japanese-games">concerns that the titles cannibalised sales of the rest of the group</a>".</p>
<p>As such, Square Enix has most recently focused on its Japanese games (namely Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts), but by its own admission, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">the Final Fantasy games especially have underperformed</a>.</p>

<p>But western publishing has still continued at Square Enix. Publishing indie hit PowerWash Simulator through its Square Enix Collective has been a huge success for the company. That's alongside publishing Life is Strange Double Exposure last year for US studio Deck Nine Games, following previous games in the series.</p>
<p>It seems that western investment is set to continue. At Summer Game Fest this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-follows-up-foamstars-flop-with-traitors-esque-killer-inn">Square Enix revealed its new online multiplayer game Killer Inn</a>, which it's publishing for Canadian studio Tactic Studios.</p>
<p>Now it's investing in Danish studio BetaDwarf to assist with development of its Vaultbreakers ARPG, which was first announced at the start of the year.</p>
<p>"Square Enix is always looking for high-quality games and talented development studios," said Hideaki Uehara, Square Enix general manager of business development. "When I played Vaultbreakers, I was genuinely excited by the experience of connecting with other players and exploring its rich game world.</p>
<p>"After visiting BetaDwarf and learning about the team's mission and passion, we decided to invest in them to help realise their dream and bring this game to players around the world."</p>
<p>BetaDwarf CEO and game director Steffen Kabbelgaard noted the "amazing access to a combination of knowledge, talent, and resources" thanks to this partnership.</p>
<p>"We are already very far with our dream game Vaultbreakers: we have a huge amazing community, and we have already run 15+ tests with more than 50,000 players who constantly enable us to refine," added Kabbelgaard. "So getting this additional support feels amazing when we are far into production already. I can really see how this enables a home run vs having just started on an uncertain journey - yeah, I'm just really excited about our situation!"</p>
<p>Vaultbreakers is a Diablo-esque top-down ARPG set in a colourful fantasy world. It will be playable solo or in multiplayer in both PvE and PvPvE modes.</p>
<p>A beta test is currently taking place, though there's no firm release date yet.</p>
<p>Square Enix's next Final Fantasy game will be its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">long-rumoured Final Fantasy Tactics remaster</a>, The Ivalice Chronicles. It's set for release on 30th September across PS4, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-invests-in-danish-indie-studio-as-it-seeks-next-western-publishing-hit]]></content:encoded>
