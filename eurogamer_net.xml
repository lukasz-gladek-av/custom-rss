            <p>Nintendo has released a statement regarding the recent censorship of AdHoc's Dispatch on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Dispatch released on Switch consoles. However, many were disappointed to learn there would be some censorship differences on Nintendo's platforms. In versions of the game as it appears on other platforms, there is an option for players to toggle censorship of  explicit content on or off. In the case of Nintendo, though, players were not given this choice, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment">explicit content censorship being implemented in Dispatch as standard</a>. This saw black boxes covering characters' exposed breasts and penises, while noises of sexual pleasure were toned down.</p>
<p>At this time, AdHoc said this would not impact Dispatch's gameplay or narrative, stating these "core" experiences remain "identical to the original release".</p>

<p>Nintendo has now shared its own statement regarding the Dispatch discourse. "Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organisations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines," a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">GoNintendo</a>.</p>
<p>"While we inform partners when their titles don't meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations."</p>
<p>When it first came to attention that Dispatch would be automatically censored on Switch consoles, many were keen to point out that other games which also featured displays of nudity had not been met with the same stipulations. Games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, in which players can customise their Vs genitalia and more, are not censored on Switch consoles in the way Dispatch has been.</p><p>That being said, a specific Japanese version of Cyberpunk 2077 was released separately from the game's standard version, which removed nudity and decapitations. Therefore, some have speculated Dispatch's censorship issues may have come down to AdHoc not wishing to create a separate release of the game for Japan only. Again, though, this is speculation.</p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Soon after its initial release last year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>

            <p>To celebrate the conclusion of the Fallout show's second season, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> has gone free-to-play for a limited time. It also gained a new $30 DLC pack featuring a camo from the series.</p>
<p>The free-to-play period, which has already started and will last until the 5th February for Xbox and PC players (and the 4th February on PlayStation). You'll have access to all the released updates for the game, giving a pretty substantial peek into what Fallout 76 has got going on.</p>
<p>For those jumping in that are super fans of the Amazon show, the NCR power armour is available too! You'll have to bust out the wallet for it though, as it's part of the new Mojave bundle. It contains the power armour, as well as the ranger power armour paint, NCR flag, New Vegas neon sign, Ad Victoriam super sledge, legion legate outfit, and player titles.</p>

<p>That bundle costs $30. Steam reviews for the bundle currently lie at Mostly Positive, but taking a look at the reviews themselves paint a mixed picture.<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CirillaFionaElenRiannon/recommended/4250650/"> Some have added a phrase from the show</a>: "Never underestimate the power of brand recognition", <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/moonlitfrappe/recommended/4250650/">while others</a> wish they could buy the NCR power armour on its lonesome: "Only bought it for the Ranger armor, should've been in the atomic shop/earned via quest. I'm tired of Fallout being the staple of microtransactions franchise for content."</p><p>Amazon recent went to great lengths to tempt stragglers in to watch the popular Fallout show recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-watch-the-first-season-of-amazons-excellent-fallout-adaptation-free-on-youtube-but-act-quickly-as-it-wont-be-there-for-long">by uploading season one to YouTube</a>, though only for a limited time. As for Fallout 76, it recently received its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout show themed Burning Springs update</a>.</p>
