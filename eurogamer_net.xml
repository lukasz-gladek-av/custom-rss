            <p>While Nintendo itself is still keeping any firm <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> details under wraps until its dedicated showcase next month, analysts believe the company is on course to deliver the biggest launch in game industry history.</p>
<p>According to several <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus">Bloomberg</a> analysts, it is expected that the Switch 2 will be more expensive than its predecessor, with the upcoming console potentially retailing for $400 or more - around £310 here in the UK.</p>
<p>"The original Switch's Nvidia chip is estimated to cost $80 per unit, while the Switch 2's chip is likely to be in the $130-$150 range," Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said. "I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo goes ahead with $499."</p>

</figure>
<p>While Yasuda expects a slightly higher price point than others, fellow industry analysts including Serkan Toto, Yijia Zhai of UBS and Robin Zhu of Sanford C Bernstein believe Nintendo's upcoming console will see an increase of around $100 or more over the original Switch's $299 price point. External factors will also be a consideration on the console's debut, such as the US tariffs.</p>
<p>But, even with this expected higher price tag, the analysts all agree that the Switch 2 will have an auspicious debut.</p>
<p>"They will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price," Toto said. "We can expect a great software line-up in year one, from new Mario Kart and 3D Mario after eight years to Pokémon Legends: Z-A and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>. There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like Call of Duty."</p>
<p>Zhu currently expects Nintendo to release its Switch 2 console this June, adding the company has a first-day inventory of 6m to 8m units, which would make it the biggest console launch ever. As Bloomberg notes, the Switch sold 2.7m units during its first month on the market, while Sony's two most recent PlayStation launches each sold 4.5m units in their respective first quarters.</p>
<p>Macquarie Capital analyst Hiroshi Yamashina, meanwhile, forecasts sales of 20m units during the console's first year on the market.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> is overhauling its trade feature following pushback from players.</p>
<p>The ability to trade Pokémon has been a key feature of the series since its beginnings, and in January it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">finally added to the digital card collecting game</a>. However, due to new currency and restrictions, fans heavily criticised the trading feature calling it an "insult".</p>
<p>A few days later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-admits-restrictive-trading-system-stops-players-enjoying-the-feature-as-intended">The Pokémon Company acknowledged the backlash</a>, admitting trading restrictions were "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" the game.</p>

<p>Now, massive changes are coming to the trade feature, including the complete removal of trade tokens. Instead, trading will use Shinedust, an existing currency found simply by opening booster packs.</p>
<p>However, the changes will be implemented by the end of autumn 2025, so exact dates are as yet unknown.</p>
<p>As per the announcement, the following changes will be made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade tokens will be completely removed and players will no longer need to exchange cards to obtain the currency required for trading.</li>
<li>Instead, trading cards of three-diamond, four-diamond, and one-star rarity will now require shinedust.</li>
<li>When you open a booster pack, shinedust will be automatically earned if you obtain a card that is already registered in your Card Dex. Currently, shinedust is also required to obtain flair, so we are looking into increasing the amount offered since it will also be needed for trading. Altogether, this change should allow you to trade more cards than you could before this update.</li>
<li>Trade tokens you currently own can be converted to shinedust when the item is removed from the game.</li>
<li>There are no changes in how one-diamond and two-diamond rarity cards are traded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further, a new feature will be included to allow players to share the cards they're interested in trading in advance.</p>
<p>"We hope that these changes will make trading cards more accessible and allow more players to enjoy making trades," the announcement reads.</p>
<p>"In addition to the changes above, we are also looking into how to accommodate cards that are currently unavailable for trades, such as promo cards and two-star rarity cards. Keep an eye out for more information about this topic in the future."</p> <div>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> is getting a "cutting-edge ray tracing" overhaul courtesy of Nvidia's RTX Remix modding tools, and there's a playable demo coming on 18th March ahead of a full release.
</p>
<p>
As Nvidia explains it, RTX Remix is a way to "modernise classic games, enhancing their visuals while preserving the core gameplay that makes them special." And Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-portal-with-rtx-and-the-new-retro-ray-tracing-revolution">impressed by the tech's potential</a> when he took a look at Portal RTX back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
Now though, after a year in beta, Nvidia's RTX Remix tools have been officially launched into the wild, gaining the likes of DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and RTX Neural Rendering along the way. More pertinent to this story, however, is the news Nvidia's marking the occasion by releasing a Half-Life 2 RTX demo, showcasing the technology's capabilities, on March 18th.

<p>
Half-Life 2 RTX is being released in conjunction with Orbifold Studios, and its impending Steam demo - which is only available to owners of Valve's full Half-Life 2 - will specifically feature Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt, both given an RTX Remix makeover. A full version of Half-Life 2 RTX by Orbifold is planned to release "at a later date". And if you don't already have Half-Life 2 in your Steam library, you might like to know <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">there's currently 80 percent off</a>.
</p>
<p>
"RTX Remix requires a GeForce RTX GPU to create RTX Remix Mods," Nvidia notes, "while mods and games built using Remix are compatible with any hardware that can run Vulkan ray-traced games." Full details of today's release can be found in <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">Nvidia's announcement</a>. All of which should stand you in good stead for Half-Life 3, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-fans-desperate-for-half-life-3-news-say-they-have-evidence-its-hidden-in-steams-back-end">might just happen after all</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been a good long while since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022. But now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its curious Japan-set follow-up. And thanks to its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pPKJevpvZI">latest Silent Hill Transmissions stream</a>, we've got an eerie new trailer and a few more hints at what's in store.
</p>
<p>
Back during its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">initial 2022 announcement</a>, Konami revealed Silent Hill f is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07. And courtesy of its latest update, we now know a little more.
</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is, for instance, set in the 1960s, its events unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture. Here, we meet our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager" who suddenly finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.
</p>

<a aria-label="SILENT HILL f | Official Reveal Trailer (4K: EN/PEGI) | KONAMI" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ag157nqMV0Q?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
That idea of "beauty in terror" is a theme Konami repeatedly returned throughout its latest Transmissions episode, explaining that while Silent Hill f retains the elements of psychological horror long-time fans will associate with the series, its setting allows it to deal with some more classically Japanese ideas, such as the notion that "when something becomes too beautiful and perfect, it instead becomes deeply unsettling".
</p>
<p>
It also spent a bit of time addressing Silent Hill f's notable shift away from the titular town that's been the focus of the series since its debut in 1999. Sharing his own perspective, Ryukishi07 explained that while Silent Hill can be considered a physical place with a dark history, it's equally a series "about portraying characters' struggles with the evil within themselves - sin, discontent, and conflict - in a visually striking way". And this, he noted, is a concept Silent Hill f retains, adding, "It's a gateway into the psychological battles of the human mind."
</p>
<p>
Konami also confirmed the return of long-time Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, although this time he'll only be creating music for Ebisugaoka's Fog World. Music for its Otherworld (known as the Dark Shrine in Silent Hill f) will be composed by Kensuke Inage, whose musical credits include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, Samurai Showdown, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox-guard">Star Fox Guard</a>. In a message shared during the stream, Inage explained his compositions will use "imagery from shrines, blending ancient Japanese court music with ambient echoes", all interwoven with techniques intended to connect the player to the protagonist's "agonies, internal conflict, fear, and other emotions."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Konami teased "creatures that really infiltrate players' psyches", alongside easter eggs for long-time fans to uncover, despite Silent Hill f's new setting. And that's pretty much all we're getting for now. Silent Hill f doesn't have a release date yet, but it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC - and Konami says it'll have "plenty more to share in the future". Until then, there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag157nqMV0Q">new trailer</a>, which you can watch above.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f was one of four new Silent Hill games to be revealed back in 2022. PlayStation 5 freebie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s Silent Hill 2 Remake launched last year, and its fourth project, Silent Hill: Townfall, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">being developed by Stories Untold and Observation developer No Code</a>. Annapurna Interactive is still set to serve as the latter game's publisher, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">a "mass exodus" of staff</a> at the end of last year.
