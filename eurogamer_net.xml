<blockquote><p><strong>Intense four-player Link Battles in the Z-A Battle Club</strong></p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo/The Pokemon Company</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Z-A Battle Club is ready for its newest Link Battle entrants! Up to four players can take part in battles where they attempt to defeat as many of each other’s Pokémon as they can within the three-minute time limit.</p>
<p>When any of your Pokémon faint, you will return to your starting point and reenter the battle with all your Pokémon fully recovered. Defeating an opponent’s Pokémon earns you a point, and those points determine your ranking. Mega Power orbs, which can be collected to Mega Evolve your Pokémon, may also appear around the stage, as well as items to boost your Pokémon’s stats temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time battling gets serious</strong></p>
<p>In this title’s new battle system, some moves may work differently than in prior games in the Pokémon series. Moves have a wide range of effects—launching attacks in a fixed radius to deal damage to multiple Pokémon at once, targeting distant Pokémon by attacking in a straight line, and more. Launch attacks from places your opponents don’t expect or sweep through groups of opponents as you lead your partner Pokémon to victory by making full use of a variety of moves.</p>
<p><strong>Climb the ranks to earn rewards</strong></p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Test your real-time battling skills against Trainers around the world in Ranked Battles. You’ll earn points based on your placement in four-player Link Battles, and may earn an additional kicker based on your performance. Similar to the main story, you’ll start off at Rank Z and can climb the ranks to the ultimate Rank A.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy real-time battles with your friends</strong></p>
<p>Looking to settle who’s the best Trainer once and for all? Challenge your friends in Private Battles! You can input a Link Code to connect with nearby players using local communication or distant players online. Once you’re all connected, you can adjust the battle rules to your liking and battle against up to three other players.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link Battles can be played between Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A with the upgrade pack applied.</li>
<li>A paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is required to participate in battles via the internet.</li>
<li>In order to enjoy online play, you will need to have downloaded the latest update data.</li>
<li>The Pokémon Video Game Championships at the 2026 Pokémon World Championships will be played on <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/">Pokémon Champions</a>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set for rlease on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> on 16th October.</p>

            <p>In news unlikely to surprise you, modders have already rolled back the "downgraded game experience" introduced with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' latest patch, 1.5, for PC players.</p>
<p>While the Steam rating was already 'mixed', players have wasted no time sharing their dismay,  complaining in Steam reviews that the developers "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119960294/recommended/2277560/">sacrificed the original game's vision to appeal to a loud, nationalist minority</a>" and made "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198210163620/recommended/2277560/">plot change[s that make] the story completely different, and even make some of the characters motivation pointless</a>".</p>

<figcaption>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers Review.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZwdnMxUFsM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>These changes include revising boss fights so that you no longer kill them, but merely "exhaust" them, which some <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198322527246/recommended/2277560/">say</a> "breaks the whole plot of the game".</p>
<p>For its part, developer Leenzee didn't note any significant changes were coming with the latest patch, only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">detailed</a> some balancing and bug fixes, saying the patch "added some 'Wuchang' voice to complete the story, and added some NPC dialogues".</p>
<p>Now, as noted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-remove-censorship-patch-1-5-on-steam-mod/">TheGamer</a>, a mod for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers entitled "Rollback censorship patch - STEAM" seeks to undo those very changes.</p>
<p>"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," the mod developer wrote. "Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story advancing dialogue from the original game. Basically patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p>
<p>Uploaded on Friday, 15th August, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">mod</a> is already fast approaching 1000 downloads, with one user <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=posts">writing</a>: "Thank you. Hate seeing artistic integrity being sacrificed on the altar of politics again".</p>
<p>Ed thought Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' new PC patch offered "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-managed-to-sidestep-soulslike-fatigue-and-it-keeps-getting-better">improved performance and much-needed balance adjustments to tweak some of its infuriatingly cheap difficulty"</a>.</p>

            <p>The First Descendant developer/publisher Nexon has been accused of using a series of "embarrassing" AI-generated TikTok advertisements, at least one of which is alleged to have imitated a real content creator.</p>
<p>As collated by u/iHardlyTriHard on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1mrtayp/the_ai_ads_are_worse_than_you_think/">Reddit</a> by scrolling on their For You Page for just 15 minutes, they came across four ads, along with another two "low effort ads that aren't specifically AI".</p>
<p>As the OP points out, the issue isn't the use of generative AI in and of itself, but the fact that <a href="https://x.com/DeathMonkeyXL/status/1956828908617109977">at least one ad uses the likeness</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/danielthedemon">DanieltheDemon</a> – and we don't yet know if it was with their consent or not.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1mrtayp/the_ai_ads_are_worse_than_you_think/">The AI ads are worse than you think</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iHardlyTriHard/">u/iHardlyTriHard</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/">TheFirstDescendant</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"It's really a kick in the teeth to TFD content creators for them to be using AI for ads like this instead of actual content creators, especially since Nexon Creators has over 8.8k people signed up to it," the post author explained.</p>
<p>"If I saw these ads before playing the game, I'd assume the game was 1) fake, 2) some sort of scam, virus, or phishing attempt," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1mrtayp/comment/n92cgdd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one player.</p>
<p>Some players report that the team behind The First Descendant's TikTok account are "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1mrtayp/comment/n92w5dq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">deleting comments</a>" from people who call the ads out, and "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1mrtayp/comment/n92xvvz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">they delete and re-upload the AI ads whenever they get too much backlash in the comments</a>".</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Nexon has not publicly commented on feedback from players about the advertisements. Eurogamer has reached out for comment and will confirm if/when we hear back.</p>
<p>At the end of July, players similiarly hit out at The Alters developer 11 Bit Studios after AI prompts <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation">were discovered in both subtitles and flavour text in the game, intimating routine use of large language models (LLMs) without disclosure</a>. 11 Bit Studios later insisted the controversial elements discovered by players were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-alters-studio-responds-to-generative-ai-criticism-saying-use-was-temporary-or-very-limited">either "temporary" assets "never intended to be part of the final release" or used in a "very limited manner"</a>.</p>
