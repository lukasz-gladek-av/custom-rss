            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>'s PS5 release date will reportedly be announced tomorrow, 24th March.</p>
<p>That's according to ultra-reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1903783283785154729">billbil-kun</a>, who not only shared the proposed announcement date but also revealed the cover art, too.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle's "spring" arrival on PS5 has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">been known for a good few months now</a>, and earlier this month, Billbil-kun said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date-reported-by-reliable-leaker">The Great Circle will launch on Sony consoles on 17th April</a>.</p>

<p>According to graphics uncovered by billbil-kun, pre-orderers will get The Last Crusade pack, which includes the travelling suit outfit and the lion tamer whip, while those who buy the premium edition will secure two days' early access to the DLC The Order of Giants, as well as a digital art book and the Temple of Doom outfit, on top of the pre-order bonuses. It seems the premium edition will be available as both a digital and physical version.</p> <div>

<p>Billbil-kun has also asserted that a game disc will be included in the physical version of the premium edition, although it seems "an internet connection will still be required to download the game and its content".</p>
<p>Challenged on their sources, Billbil said the information comes via "metadata".</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in her five-star review of The Great Circle</a> last year, "[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames". It was also voted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2024.</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) - the same organisation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">used to run E3 before it was cancelled</a> - has announced the Accessible Games Initiative, a cross-industry campaign to provide consumers with clear information about the accessibility features available in video games.</p>
<p>The five founding companies - EA, Google, Microsoft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>, and Ubisoft - have partnered with the ESA to "help provide clear information about whether a specific video game has accessibility features and, if so, what those features are". Amazon Games, Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> have also since pledged support.</p>

<p>The initiative is launching with a set of 24 tags - such as clear text, large and clear subtitles, narrated menus, stick inversion and save anytime - with "clear criteria about what each tag means", and "over time", the initiative expects participating companies to place the Accessible Games Initiative tags on digital storefronts, product pages or digital catalogues. The tags have reportedly been developed with guidance and feedback from disabled gamers, advocacy groups, and developers, "all of whom provided valuable insights about the real-world applications of the tags".</p>
<p>"The timeline for implementation of the tags will be determined on a company-by-company basis and is always voluntary," the ESA added, and as feedback is gathered from the community and new technologies and features are developed, it "expect[s] the existing tags to evolve and to introduce additional tags in the future".</p>
<p>"Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games," said Stanley Pierre-Louis, ESA president and CEO.</p>
<p>"We are immensely proud to announce the Accessible Games Initiative in partnership with industry leaders. This initiative demonstrates how impactful we can be when we work together in our industry-wide pursuit of helping more people experience the power of play."</p>
<p>To view the tags and learn more about the Accessible Games Initiative, visit <a href="http://accessiblegames.com/">accessiblegames.com</a>.</p>
<p>In December, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rnib-introduces-toolkit-and-player-panel-to-help-devs-make-games-more-accessible-to-players-with-sight-loss">Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) established a player testing panel for the video games industry</a>, research institutions, and academia called the Design for Every Gamer Player Panel.</p>
<p>Alongside its new Devkit: Best Practice in Accessible Gaming 2024, the organisation said that by engaging with this diverse group, "developers and researchers can gather essential feedback on accessibility, helping to ensure that their games and studies are inclusive and accessible to gamers with sight loss".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An entire playthrough of the PS3 version of Until Dawn played in first-person perspective has popped up online.</p>
<p>For those who don't already know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-3-exclusive-until-dawn-exposes-its-horror-parody-roots">Until Dawn was initially conceived as a PS3 exclusive</a> that made use of PlayStation's Move controllers. While we knew it featured a first-person perspective with gameplay shifting between members of the group, this is the first time anyone's shared a full playthrough.</p>

<p>Uploaded to a channel called Digital Preservation, the game - seemingly an in-development prototype with placeholder voice work and some wonky visuals - runs for four hours and boasts some, if not quite all, of the cast we see in the PS4 version and includes sound effects, score, and many of the plot beats and environments we know from the final PS4 (and remake) version (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/03/watch-a-full-playthrough-of-the-first-person-until-dawn-that-never-released">PushSquare</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-reportedly-effectively-closed-with-all-developers-gone">Until Dawn remake studio Ballistic Moon reportedly "effectively closed"</a> earlier this month amid claims only a handful of employees "at most" remain - none of them developers.</p>
<p>Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a new report now claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> has been refused classification in Australia.</p>
<p>The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications, and the Arts' Classification Board (IARC) has not detailed why, exactly, the horror has been <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/silent-hill-f">denied release</a>, but simply invites people to contact the organisation if they want more information (so I have - I'll update as/when I hear back).</p>

<p>The Australian classification board is notoriously strict - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-banned-in-austrailia-for-implied-sexual-violence">fighting game Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact was banned back in December</a>; in a later statement, this was revealed to be due to implied sexual violence involving minors - and this isn't even the first Silent Hill game to be banned, as Homecoming's eye-watering "high impact" torture scene similarly saw it refused classification in 2008, too. A censored version was later released.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-park-the-stick-of-truth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/saints-row-4">Saints Row 4</a> are among dozens of games to have been denied an Australian release, with many thought to have been banned due to sexual violence, drug use, or "sexual activity involving a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18".</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its mysterious follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">Silent Hill f's events are unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka</a> - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture - where our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager", finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
