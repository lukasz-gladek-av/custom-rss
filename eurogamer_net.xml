<p>"This is Miyamoto," reads the post. "For production reasons, we are changing the release date of the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda to May 7, 2027. It will be some weeks later than the release timing we originally announced, and we will take the extra time to make the film as good as it can be. Thank you for your patience."</p> <div>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-revealed-by-nintendo-and-its-not-as-far-away-as-you-might-have-feared">release date for the film was first confirmed back in March</a> this year via Nintendo's newly released Nintendo Today app, after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-working-on-a-live-action-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">company confirmed a film was in the works in November 2023</a>.</p>
<p>Little else is known about the film at this point, whether it will be inspired by one game predominantly, or who has been cast as the iconic Link or titular princess.</p>
<p>Rumours have circled around Euphoria star Hunter Schafer for the role of Zelda, though reports have also emerged she is being eyed instead for a big Marvel role.</p>
<p>The Zelda film will of course follow the hugely successful The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">biggest video game film adaptation ever</a>.</p>
<p>The Mario film has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">sequel already lined up for April next year</a>. The film will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-bros-movie-2s-new-characters-will-include-old-favourites-and-really-deep-cuts">reportedly include "old favourites" and "really deep cuts"</a>.

            <p>Indie Sims-like Paralives has landed itself an early access release date.</p>
<p>It will be making its debut on 8th December, developer Alex Massé and team revealed last night.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to share the game with you all and can't wait to collect all your feedback to keep on improving the game," the Paralives crew shared along with a new trailer (see below). Here, we see some of the game's building techniques, and its world activities.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with Paralives already, it's a very promising looking Sims-like. The developer has promised a single player game which does not require an internet connection to enjoy, complete with dogs, cats, horses, cars, bikes and boats. <a href="https://www.paralives.com/faq">That includes boat houses</a>.</p>
<p>"Even if there will be bugs and some important features missing," the Paralives team explained last year, in the game's announcement post. "We think Paralives' Early Access will be quite enjoyable. Players who like to create characters and build houses will have a lot of tools and content to get creative with and the live mode will have its core features established which will allow people to create great stories for their Parafolks."</p>

<p>At this same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">the developer added that it will have no paid DLC</a>. "As a small team without any shareholders to please," it said, "we believe the money we make from selling the game alone will be enough to support us and the development of free updates in the long run."</p>
<p>Well, colour me interested!</p>
<p>Paralives follows another Sims-like release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which debuted at the end of March. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-access-life-sim-inzoi-breaks-krafton-sales-record">particular release broke records for publisher Krafton</a>. </p>
<p>Other games playing with this genre, however, have not fared as well. Last year, Paradox shut down ambitious Sims-like Life by You, before also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">closing the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
