            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>' game director has reflected on last week's announcement that the free-to-play brawler's fifth season will be its last.</p>
<p>On Friday, developer Player First Games confirmed Season 5 will end on 30th May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-fighter-multiversus-makes-a-return-in-may">roughly a year after its post-beta rerelease</a>. At this time, the studio said the game will be playable offline "for the foreseeable future", but it would be pulled from Epic Games Store, Steam, and both the PlayStation and Microsoft stores.</p>
<p>Following a few days of silence following this news - and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iew7s0/the_development_of_multiversus_was_problematic/">rumours mismanagement was a key factor in the game's shutdown</a> -  MultiVersus' director Tony Huynh has now shared his own thoughts on the situation, stating he is in "deep mourning for the game", and "nobody wanted this outcome".</p>

</figure>
<p>Writing on social media platform X, Huynh said he was "sad about the outcome", but remains "grateful for the opportunity given to us by Warner  Bros. Games and to each and every developer on the Player First Games and WB Games teams". The director additionally thanked all those who had lent their IP to the game, which included an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-characters-roster-unlock-free-rotation-9024">eclectic roster of playable characters from DC to Game of Thrones</a>.</p><p>"We hope we made the characters true to themselves and felt authentic to your fans," Huynh wrote. "I couldn't be prouder of the work the [Player First Games] team did. Their endless creativity and passion never ceased to inspire and amaze me. And of course I wanted to thank every player who has ever played or supported MultiVersus. Delighting and serving players is Player First Games' objective."</p>
<p>Huynh went on to apologise for not addressing MultiVersus' ending sooner, stating his focus has been on the game and the team. He then appeared to address claims it was his fault MultiVersus is getting shut down.</p>
<p>"I don't have the power some [of] you think I do," he wrote, adding the studio is "a highly collaborative team" and "ideas are encouraged and can come from anyone and we promote delivering value to players".</p>
<p>Huynh continued: "I also hope that the community notices that we try to listen and act. Like any developer we're limited by time and resources.</p>
<p>"I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you're entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it's crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realise that this is an extremely sad time for the team. I am in deep mourning for the game.</p>
<p>"Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn't from lack of caring or effort."</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thats-all-folks-another-warner-bros-live-service-bites-the-dust">news of MultiVersus' end</a> followed an announcement earlier in January that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">Warner Bros. Games boss David Haddid is leaving the company after 12 years</a>.

            <p>
Sony is set to hold its next PlayStation State of Play broadcast next week, according to a new report.
</p>
<p>
The tip comes from NateTheHate, a leaker with a long track record who accurately reported last month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2 reveal date</a> ahead of time. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, the leaker <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1885748440132456877">teased</a> Sony's upcoming broadcast is currently expected to arrive around Valentine's Day - which is the end of next week.

<p>
Sony has streamed a State of Play broadcast each year in February since 2021, and typically uses the show to lay out its list of big first-party and third-party exclusives for the year.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-sonys-playstation-state-of-play-2">Last year's big show</a> (held on 31st January, before a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>-specific State of Play aired in early February) highlighted <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, Foamstars, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>, Judas, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-guides-tips-tricks-9422">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, Rise of the Ronin, Until Dawn and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, among others. The biggest surprise of the show was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-fans-after-sickness-made-him-reconsider-his-priorities">Hideo Kojima popping in to announce Physint</a>, a fresh game that's set to hark back to the creator's Metal Gear Solid action-espionage roots.
</p><p>
So, what do we expect from State of Play this year? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">PlayStation is set to launch its samurai sequel Ghost of Yotei this year</a> - and could do well to announce some kind of launch window to space it out from Assassin's Creed Shadows. 
</p>
<p>
We're also expecting to hear more about Bungie's shooter reboot Marathon, and potentially Haven's live-service Fairgame$. Kojima may pop in to chat more about Death Stranding 2, which is out this year. And then there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">Marvel's Wolverine - will it make 2025?</a>
</p>
<p>PlayStation's livestream will follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-during-the-xbox-developer-direct-2025">last month's Xbox Developer Direct</a>, which gave us a look at South of Midnight, Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - the last four of which will all arrive on PS5.</p>

<p>Whilst there's been no formal word on why the critically acclaimed skating games have been pulled from sale on Steam, both games had been published on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s indie publishing label, Private Division, before it was sold to an unknown buyer, thought to be Haveli Investments, towards the end of last year.</p>

<p>Neither game shows up if you search on Steam, whilst using the direct URL informs you that the games are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294420/Rollerdrome/">"no longer available on the Steam store"</a>, despite Roll7's previous games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/olliolli">OlliOlli</a> and OlliOlli 2: Welcome to OlliWood are still listed.</p><p>Curiously, both Rollerdrome and OlliOlli World are, for now at least, still available on the PlayStation Store. Whilst they still list Private Division as the publisher on those pages, the defunct Steam pages - which were quietly amended last week - have been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1294420/history/">updated</a> to replace the publisher Private Division with 2K.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it's unclear if this is just an oversight, a licensing issue, or a signal that Roll7's portfolio did not transfer to the anonymous buyer and remains with 2K.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">announced the sale of its indie-focused publishing label Private Division in November 2024</a>. Additionally, the company also confirmed the closure of OlliOlli World developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2's Intercept Games, six months after CEO Strauss Zelnick insisted, "We didn't shutter those studios".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">Within days of launching a controversial new update that added the ability to trade cards</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> has acknowledged the community's backlash, saying it was "actively investigating" ways to improve.</p>
<p>A statement posted to social media stopped short of apologising to unhappy players, but admitted some of the new feature's restrictions were actively "preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" the card game.</p>

<p>"Since releasing the first iteration of the trading feature a few days ago, we have received a large number of comments. Thank you all for sharing your feedback," the statement from Creatures Inc began.</p>
<p>"The item requirements and restrictions implemented for the trading feature were designed to prevent abuse from bots and other prohibited actions using multiple accounts."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>As trading requires players use up valuable resources and adhere to a lengthy list of restrictions in order to acquire cards they don't already have, some players felt as though trading was actively discouraged, especially as its limited to players on your friends list, and only one trade can be conducted at a time. Currently, only cards of One, Two, Three or Four Diamond rarity can be offered for trade, alongside One Star rarity.</p>
<p>Now, however, the team says that the goal had only been to "balance" the game whilst "maintaining a fair environment for all players", adding "preserving the fun of collecting cards[...] is core to the Pokémon TCG Pocket experience".</p>
<p>"However, thanks to your feedback, we understand that some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature as intended," the team concluded.</p>
<p>"We are actively investigating ways to improve the feature to address these concerns. Going forward, we also plan to offer multiple ways to obtain trade tokens including through event distributions.</p>
<p>"As always, thank you for being part of the Pokémon TCG Pocket community."</p>
