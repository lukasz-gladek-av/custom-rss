            <p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>, has revealed he left Bandai Namco so he wouldn't "be limited to only working with [...] Japanese people".</p>
<p>Takahashi - who left Bandai Namco in 2010 after 11 years and recently announced his next project, To a T, which is set to be published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-showcase-everything-announced">Annapurna</a> - stressed the importance of sharing skills and experiences with developers from all over the world to "get ideas from different perspectives".</p>

<p>"I left [Bandai Namco] because I didn't want to be limited to only working with the people there. I wondered why I was only making games with Japanese people," Takahashi told <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/20/150569.html">GameSpark</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/katamari-damacy-creator-keita-takahashi-talks-about-his-decision-to-leave-bandai-namco-and-the-inspiration-behind-his-new-game/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"I thought if I could develop games with more people from other countries, I would be able to get ideas from different perspectives.</p>
<p>"I'm currently developing games with a range of people from all over the world."</p>
<p>Takahashi added that knowing the different customs and cultural expectations of different countries is also valuable when making games.</p>
<p>"American schools don't have the custom of changing shoes like Japanese schools do," Takahashi explained. "I was once asked by a team member about what the school space full of shoe cupboards was like. I tried to convey to them that there are loads of shoes, and there's a kind of smell... but it really is something that's unique to Japan.</p>
<p>"I don't know what school culture is like in the US, so I had no choice but to use Japanese elements."</p>
<p>Takahashi finished on saying he was committed to "mak[ing] games that I feel satisfied with, so I'd like people to play them if they want to".</p>
<p>"I guess I probably should make games while thinking about the target audience, but I'll work on that in my next life," he added.</p>
<p>To a T will release on 28th May on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC, including Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-announced-first-all-new-entry-in-eight-years">A new Katamari Damacy game was also recently revealed</a>, which will release exclusively on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy-rolling-live">Katamari Damacy Rolling Live</a> will be the first original game in the series in almost eight years and will arrive on Apple Arcade on 3rd April.
