<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> boss Neil Druckmann has cast doubt on the possibility of third The Last of Us game, telling fans, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
Fans have been dreaming of a potential third entry in the series ever since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-a-gut-wrenching-sequel">release of The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020</a>. And while Naughty Dog and Sony have managed to remaster both the original The Last of Us (for a second time) and The Last of Us Part 2 since then, there's been no concrete word of a third series instalment.
</p>
<p>
Which isn't to say Naughty Dog has been entirely quiet on the matter. Back in 2021, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">confirmed he'd penned a story outline for a potential The Last of Us Part 3</a> and admitted there'd been "quite a bit" discussion about a sequel. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">addressed a possible third series entry again</a> in 2023 - while Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">now-canned The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> was still in the works - saying he was open to it, but only if the team could come up with a "compelling story".

<p>
And if that wasn't enough, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">returned to the subject of The Last of Us Part 3 again last year</a>, explaining that while he'd struggled to come up with a worthwhile concept for the game previously, "recently that's changed". And just to hammer home the point, he added, "So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that Druckmann's left enough of a breadcrumb trail over the last few years, that The Last of Us Part 3 feels like it might be closer to happening than not. And even though Naughty Dog is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">currently full steam ahead on its single-player sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, the studio's previous confirmation it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">had "multiple single-player projects" in the works</a> still left room for hope.
</p>
<p>
In a new <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/">interview with Variety</a>, however, Druckmann has cast doubt on a possible The Last of Us Part 3. When asked about a potential third game, he replied, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't bet on there being more of Last of Us. This could be it."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear why Druckmann is suddenly less keen to fan the flames of speculation where a third The Last of Us title is concerned, but even if another game never happens, there's still new The Last of Us material on the way. HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">critically acclaimed TV show</a> returns for a second season soon, and it'll begin adapting the events of the second game. However, Druckmann and show runner Craig Mazin previously confirmed the series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">likely take two or three seasons to cover all of The Last of Us Part 2</a>, and it's already clear plenty of new material will be in there.
</p>
<p>
Recent season two casting news, for instance, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">suggested the show will be more explicitly tackling events only mentioned in passing during the second game</a>. And, of course, even if Naughty Dog never gets around to making The Last of Us Part 3, that doesn't mean Druckmann's story treatment for post-Part 2 couldn't eventually make it to the small screen.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two runs for seven episodes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">starting on 13th April in the US</a>. And as for Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, there's no hint of a release date for that yet.

            <p>Six supporting cast members have been announced for the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, giving us an idea how the show will expand upon Part 2's story.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-joe-pantoliano-cast-1236327820/">Variety</a>, Joe Pantoliano, Alanna Ubach, Ben Ahlers, Hettienne Park, Robert John Burke, and Noah Lamanna will all be joining Bella Ramsey's Ellie and Pedro Pascal's Joel when the second season airs next month.</p>
<p>Pantoliano - whose previous credits include Bad Boys for Life and The Matrix - will play Eugene, while Burke (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit) stars as Jackson resident Seth, and Lamanna (Star Trek: Strange New Worlds) is playing Kat. These three characters have all featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

<p>The remaining three actors will all portray characters who've been written specifically for the show. Ubach (Euphoria) has been cast as Hanrahan, Ahlers (The Gilded Age) is playing Burton, and Park (Hannibal) stars as Elise Park.</p>

<p>While it remains unclear how the three new characters will fit into The Last of Us Part 2's narrative, the inclusion of Eugene and Kat gives us an idea as to how the series is expanding upon the game's story.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Kat (or Cat, as she's known in the game) was Ellie's ex, but never actually appeared in person during The Last of Us Part 2 - although she was originally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/06/24/storylines-characters-levels-cut-last-us-part-ii/">supposed to feature during the Jackson dance sequence</a>. Instead, she was  only mentioned in passing, with Dina telling Ellie she didn't think Cat was right for her, among other things. This is clearly going to change in the TV series, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-teaser-gives-first-look-at-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby">previous trailer appeared to show Ellie getting her tattoo</a> (which came from Cat in the game). I wonder if we will also see Kat appear in the dance sequence, as well.</p>

<p>Next up, we have Eugene, who again is mentioned in The Last of Us Part 2 but doesn't appear in person, barring collectables. Eugene was a patrolman who lived in Jackson before dying of a stroke aged 73. He formed a close relationship with Dina (played in the show by Isabel Merced), and more of his story can be uncovered by finding a letter in-game - which reveals he had a wife and daughter, but left them to join the Fireflies, where he served with Joel's brother Tommy.</p>
<p>"The Fireflies will be fine without you. Your daughter won't," the letter from Eugene's wife Claire reads. "She keeps asking me when you're coming home. I can't lie to her anymore. I miss you. But I don't know how much more of this I can take. Come home. Please. We love you."
</p>
<p>
According to Variety, Eugene's season two appearance will be similar to season one's standalone Bill and Frank episode (and because of which I still can't look at strawberries the same way).
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://wp.me/pc8uak-1lFvkK">about the process of adapting Part 2 for the series</a>, it was revealed the idea to bring Eugene's story into the mix came from showrunner Craig Mazin, but Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann was all for it.</p>
<p>"I get excited when I see these opportunities," he told Variety.  "I'm like, 'Oh, I don’t know Eugene that well!' The story we told [in the game] was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship."</p>
<p>Given Druckmann's words here, and how Bill and Frank's relationship was expanded upon for season one of The Last of Us, I can only assume Eugene's family relationship and his move to become a Firefly will become a key element of the show's story. Oh, and Eugene is also very tech savvy and had a cannabis lab, so pretty sure that will come up.</p>

<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">set to kick off in the US on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, but Mazin has already confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">will not cover the entirety of Part 2's narrative</a>. It will, however, feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">a lot more infected than the first season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
