            <p>The team at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> studio Build A Rocket Boy is "heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended," it has said, promising more fixes throughout June.</p>
<p>MindsEye released earlier this week, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>. Build A Rocket Boy released a statement yesterday, when it said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">would be prioritising gameplay performance with an update</a>.</p>
<p>"Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak," the developer has since shared on the MindsEye Discord, adding roughly one in 10 players were impacted.</p>

<p>"We have developed a hotfix that addresses this issue (alongside other issues that our players have highlighted), which we are working hard to deploy as soon as tomorrow on PC and on consoles once it passes certification with PlayStation and Xbox," it continued, stating the team is "fully committed to ensuring all players have a great experience".</p>

<p>MindsEye has had an unusual lead up to launch, it has to be said. At the end of May, the studio's co-CEO suggested the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio"> game's negative reaction up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the developer</a>. This is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>, which serves as the game's publisher, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">doesn't believe to be the case</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">the studio's Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer left the company</a>, just one week before MindsEye released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As we suspected, but couldn't say 100 percent for sure until now, Bomberman has been confirmed for the Xbox version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Konami released an Xbox-specific trailer for its upcoming remake of the 2004 game. And, while those on PS5 and Steam versions of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be able to partake in a spot of 'Snake vs Monkey', where they have to capture the Pipo Monkeys, we now know Xbox users will instead square off with Bomberman.</p>
<p>"Snake vs Bomberman for Xbox Series X/S," reads the trailer's blurb. "Take control of Snake and face off with Bomberman in this special side mode. Blast 'em away in each stage!" You can have a watch below.</p>

<p>As well as this Bomberman confirmation, earlier today Konami also announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-taking-hide-and-go-seek-to-the-next-level-with-original-multiplayer-mode">"completely original" online multiplayer mode coming to Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, known as Fox Hunt.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-announced">initially revealed back in 2023</a>. It retains the 2004 original's story - which follows Naked Snake on an operation deep within the Soviet jungle, some 31 years before the events of Metal Gear.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-being-remade-as-konami-says-younger-generation-now-unfamiliar-with-the-series">remake has been done with future generations in mind</a>, series producer Noriaki Okamura said in an interview last year. "It was basically our mission, our duty, to kind of continue making sure that the series lives on for future generations," Okamura said. "After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say - but again, who is Solid Snake?"</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-announced-complete-with-a-butt-slapping-ape-escape-monkey">scheduled for release on 28th August</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
