            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> creator Mike Booth has announced he is working on a new four-player co-op shooter.</p>
<p>In a post shared on reddit over the weekend, Booth said the upcoming game will be "built on the foundations of what made [Left 4 Dead] special", though he stopped short of giving his new project a name or indeed any concept art.</p>
<p>However, in the words of the developer, "if you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting".</p>

<p>Booth added this shooter will expand on the co-op gameplay formula in "ways I've wanted to explore for a long time". Curious.</p>
<p>Booth currently works for Bad Robot Games, which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jj-abrams-production-company-bad-robot-now-has-a-games-division">subdivision of JJ Abrams' film and TV production company announced in 2018</a>. In his reddit post, Booth said the team is still in the "early stages" of the shooter's development. There are, however, going to be playtests for a limited number of participants.
