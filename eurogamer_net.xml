  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Seamus Blackley, one of the co-creators of the original Xbox, has interpreted Microsoft's recent Xbox leadership shuffle as a sign the business is being "sunsetted". The appointment of Asha Sharma, he thinks, is "as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night".</p>
<p>Blackley, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">speaking to GamesBeat</a>, said what we're witnessing is Microsoft reorganising everything around Copilot - around gen-AI. "Satya Nadella [Microsoft CEO] has made an incredible number of bets and invested an incredible amount of money and credibility in the transform model AI future," Blackley said. "Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren't the core AI business, is being sunsetted. They don't say that, but that's what's happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/article-45824">Blackley left Microsoft in 2002</a>, so he hasn't worked at the company for a long time, but he's sceptical about Microsoft appointing someone with no apparent love of gaming to lead the Gaming division, and questions the ulterior motives of promoting someone from the company's AI division. "Imagine asking somebody if it made sense to put a major motion picture studio into the hands of somebody who didn't like movies, or a major record label into the hands of somebody who'd never seen a live show," he said. "Why would you do that?</p>
<p>"The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI," he added. "That's what you're seeing here. Whether or not you agree with it, whether you agree with AI having the potential to do that, whether AI will be successful, is a separate matter. But that's what we're seeing. That is in no way surprising. It would have been shocking if they had somebody in there in a meaningful role who was passionate about games, passionate about the creator-driven business of games, because it would be in direct conflict with everything else Microsoft is doing."</p>
<blockquote><em>"The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI"</em></blockquote>
<p>Blackley believes Microsoft boss Satya Nadella sees everything as a gen-AI problem now, which is why he's put a former gen-AI person in charge of Xbox. He says Sharma will be trained on gaming, a bit like a large language model, until she can "bring gen-AI into a position to revolutionise games".</p>
<p>"I think younger me would be screaming about this and saying, 'What the hell? Why would you put somebody in charge of a record label who didn't like records?' Looking at it now from my perspective, I probably still feel that way. I do still feel that way, as I've been saying.</p><p>"But at the same time, I understand exactly why it is," Blackley added. "I know that, again, Satya is holding a hammer and everything is a nail. There's a nail with an Xbox logo on it. He's applying the AI person to it. He has to show shareholders and the press and the world that he is all-in on this investment. He has to show them that he believes generative AI is going to fix games and make it profitable. He has to make this move. It doesn't matter what you think about it. I don't think he had any choice."</p>
<p>Whether or not Sharma will convince game-playing people depends on whether she can muster a passion for games, Blackley believes, because one thing he's seen consistently is people coming from outside of gaming and underestimating how difficult making games will be. If she can't muster that genuine enthusiasm then his advice would be to "find a way to leave this job soon". "You shouldn't do it because it's harder than you think," he said.</p>
<p>Asha Sharma was appointed CEO of Microsoft Gaming during a chaotic weekend, during which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> retired from Microsoft after 38 years and Xbox president Sarah Bond suddenly also departed. Scrutiny remains around Sharma's appointment, but a contrary insider take is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insider-report-paints-different-picture-of-spencer-retirement-and-bond-departure">Microsoft is actually pressing reset on Xbox with a genuine desire to turn the division's fortunes around</a>, though it's an argument that will take some convincing to swallow.</p>

            <p>We've known for a while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> is in proper production, with developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-1-lead-story-designer-talks-final-cg-cutscene">CD Projekt Red</a> hoping to have it ready to go sooner rather than later. Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">a launch in 2026 has been ruled out</a>. Now, we've potentially learned about an exciting new addition to its roster of devs.</p>
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/clair-obscur-cinematic-animator-joins-the-witcher-4-studio-cd-projekt-red/">VGC</a> has revealed cinematic animator Lucie Hennet, who worked at Sandfall Interactive "from May 2023 to the end of 2024," has now joined the Polish studio as an on-site cinematic animator. Needless to say, having some of the talent that made 2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> possibly make the jump to one of the most anticipated RPGs around is exciting.</p>
<p>At least that's what we're assuming, as we know CDPR's Polish team is hard at work on the fourth Witcher game while the company's North American studios are developing the online multiplayer Witcher spinoff and the sequel to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. You can see part of Hennet's behind-the-scenes work on Expedition 33 via <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/4Nevy1">her ArtStation page</a>.</p>
<p>While we wait for a proper in-game look at The Witcher 4 and a tentative release window, there's more movement happening around the IP beyond Project Sirius (the multiplayer spinoff). Fool's Theory has reportedly <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/the-witcher-1-remake-delayed-to-2028/">paused development</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-remake">full-blown remake of The Witcher 1</a> in order to support CDPR with the new instalment, but it's still happening at some point in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, we've also been hearing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">rumblings of a new Witcher 3 DLC coming this year</a> and being handled by the same studio, so chances are we may return to the Continent soon.</p>

            <p>2025's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was a big enough stumble to push Xbox-owned Activision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">reconsider its approach to yearly CoD entries</a> moving forward. Mind you, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/january-2026-us-consumer-spending-on-video-games-was-up">the game is still topping charts</a>, but after a poor critical reception and lukewarm player sentiment, things are being re-examined. Could a standalone, fully-fledged Zombies entry spice things up? Maybe, but it appears that's not on the table... yet.</p>
<p>At least that's what a rare comment posted through <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty">Call of Duty's official X/Twitter account</a> is suggesting (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-aint-it-activision-issues-rare-denial-of-standalone-call-of-duty-zombies-report">IGN</a>):</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">The rumor factory working overtime. This ain't it.</p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>Social media accounts are typically run by community managers and dedicated social teams, but needless to say, replies to rumours about new entries <em>should</em> have to go through a few approvals first even if they're in jest. That's what makes the quick comment significant. Traditionally, the teams would just ignore and move on when being hit with these claims.</p>
<p>If we're to believe the denial, however, it's not entirely clear what the comment is referring to. The original rumour, kickstarted by alleged insider <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope">TheGhostOfHope</a> and <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/standalone-cod-zombies-game-reportedly-planned-for-next-gen-consoles-3322963/">shared by Dexerto</a>, was actually saying two things: First, that a standalone Zombies title was in dev. Secondly, it claimed there were plans to release it alongside a mainline entry just in time for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-2027-launch-reportedly-best-case-scenario-following-amd-hint-that-microsoft-may-ship-new-hardware-next-year">Microsoft's next Xbox launch</a>, which could even skip 2027 according to recent reports. Perhaps that's the play here: Shutting down the whole conversation without really specifying what they're referring to.</p><p>In any case, I'm of the opinion a standalone Call of Duty Zombies game (perhaps released with a lower price tag on it) would make <em>a ton </em>of sense. It's not uncommon to see longtime fans say they're annoyed by the franchise's current state only to pick up the latest entry to get that Zombies fix only. And in many cases, it's safe to say diehards would happily grab two separate Call of Duty releases that offered different-enough experiences.</p>
<p>For now, however, we're stuck in the loop of wondering about the series' future following a subpar entry that's performing really well regardless. Is Modern Warfare 4 next in line? It's what everyone is assuming, especially after lead developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> openly said "<a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/249223/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4-infinity-ward-shuts-down-rumours-about-the-game-being-a-copy-of-mw2">see you in 2026</a>" back in December.</p>
