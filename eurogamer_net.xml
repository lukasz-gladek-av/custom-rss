Microsoft will once again hold a Xbox Developer Direct to kick off the new year, with deep dives into a small selection of upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> titles.
</p>
<p>
Xbox's next livestream will begin at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific) on Thursday, 23rd January - that's a fortnight from today.
</p>
<p>
On the schedule will be a detailed look at Doom: The Dark Ages, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and a mystery fourth game from an unknown studio. Mysterious! 
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages has been dubbed as an origin story for the series' iconic Doom Slayer from veteran developer id Software, and is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point in 2025. Will we get a date? It seems likely.
</p><p>South of Midnight, meanwhile, is the stylish-looking action-adventure from We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games,  set in a gothic fantasy American Deep South. It looks a treat, though also currently lacks a release date beyond "2025". Here's hoping we find out when exactly it'll arrive for PC and Xbox Series X/S very soon.</p>
<p>Next up, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This is the dark fantasy RPG from French outfit Sandfall Interactive that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">we reckon has shades of Persona and Final Fantasy</a>, plus the vocal talents of Andy Serkis and Charlie Cox. Clair Obscur isn't an Xbox Game Studios title and is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point this year.</p>
<p>And then there's that fourth game. Microsoft still has plenty on its 2025 release schedule that this could be - Fable, The Outer Wilds, even Avowed - which will be just a month away. But the secretive nature here suggests something that hasn't yet publicly been confirmed. It'll be interesting to see if internet rumours of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake bear any fruit.</p>
<p>Join us in a couple of weeks for Xbox Developer Direct, right here on Eurogamer, when we'll be reporting live.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in November, relaxed garden puzzle game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/botany-manor">Botany Manor</a> was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-horticultural-puzzler-botany-manor-comes-to-playstation-in-december">announced</a> as getting a belated launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
An impressive indie 3D puzzling effort, Botany Manor had already shone on PC, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X - including Xbox Game Pass - earlier in 2024. 
</p>
<p>
But in December, publisher Whitethorn Games issued an <a href="https://x.com/WhitethornGames/status/1868687621217473001">update</a> to say Botany Manor had hit a snag, and would now launch in the new year. Well, here we are - and today brings a fresh (and hopefully final) PlayStation launch date for the game: 28th January.
</p>

<p>I can wholeheartedly recommend Botany Manor, as one of the few games I actually got around to fully completing last year. You're given the keys to a National Trust-style estate that slowly opens up over time as you uncover mysteries and grow long-lost blooms through increasingly brain-teasing ways.
</p>
<p>But things never get too taxing, the game is relentlessly chilled out, and the game's gentle story offers just enough of a glimpse at life within its Victorian-era surroundings to keep you intrigued.</p>
<p>
"Perhaps an afternoon in Botany Manor's company will inflame your own curiosity for nature," Matt wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">Eurogamer's Botany Manor review</a> last year. "Or perhaps you'll simply be content to explore its sun-dabbled corners, solve its few clever puzzles, and enjoy the timeless pleasures of an enchanting summer's day stroll."

            <p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon officially announced a Mass Effect TV show</a> is in development. Now, voice actor Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer she'd love to be part of it and believes the original cast should be involved too.</p>
<p>"You will always get a yes vote from me on Shepard coming back in any form," said Hale. "That was such a gift, and it's a gift I will always be extremely joyful to receive."</p>
<p>Of course, developing such a choice-driven narrative into a singular TV series would have consequences. For starters, would Shepard be male or female?</p>

<p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do," said Hale. "The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!"</p>
<p>Hale confirmed she'd prefer FemShep to be canon in the show (obviously!), but she's also keen for the rest of the game's cast to join in some capacity.</p>
<p>"I think they'd be really smart to pull as much of the original cast into the show in cameos and Easter eggs and recurring and regular [roles] as possible," she said. "I think that would be an absolutely genius move."</p><p>She continued: "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever met… they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p>
<p>What's more, there's a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game in development that's set to continue the story of the original trilogy, with at least <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">one fan-favourite character returning</a>. But would Hale like to see Shepard also return?</p>
<p>"I have no idea [what to expect]," she said, "except I'd love to be there. That's all I'm gonna say. Hey, team, hey, team, wherever you are in any capacity, I'd love to be there!"</p>
<p>Over the weekend, BioWare project director Michael Gamble responded to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-fans-think-this-official-image-hints-that-paragonrenegade-system-is-absolutely-returning">discussion of the Paragon/Renegade morality system</a>, with many fans speculating it will return in the next game.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine wanted developer Irrational Games to continue, and didn't expect publisher Take-Two to shut it down.</p>
<p>In 2014 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-steps-away-from-bioshock-to-create-something-new">Levine announced he was "winding down" the studio</a> to focus on a "different kind of game", meaning all but 15 Irrational employees were laid off.</p>

<p>Levine discussed his time at Irrational following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> and how this led to him parting ways with the studio.</p>
<p>"The closure of Irrational was complicated," he said. "I felt out of my depth in the role. You're this creative person, and all of a sudden, as your vision increases of what you want to do, you have to become a manager, in a way that you don't necessarily have any training or skill in. My mental health was a mess during Infinite. I was stressed out, a lot of personal things were going on in my life at the time, and then my parents both died. I just couldn't do it any more, and I didn't think I had the team's confidence."</p>
<p>That's when he left, leaving the studio in the hands of Take-Two.</p>
<p>"So my intention was to go and say, 'Look, I just need to go start a new thing, and Irrational should continue'," he said. "That's why I didn't maintain the name Irrational. I thought they were going to continue. But it wasn't my company - I sold the company, so I worked for Take-Two, and the studio was theirs.</p><p>"The decision was made at a corporate level that they didn't think they should continue with the studio as a going concern. My feeling was that it probably would have made sense. Take-Two did a BioShock remaster - that would have been a good title for Irrational to get their head around, build a new creative director structure, and then build off of that once they had the confidence to do the next BioShock game. I don't think I was in any state to be a good leader for the team."</p>
<p>Levine described trying to make the studio closure "the least painful layoff we could possibly do", but he didn't feel comfortable leading the team when his next project would have a long period of research and development. "The problem is - and you see this problem with big studios - what do you do with 300 people when you're going to have a multiple-year R&amp;D project?" he said.</p>
<p>Still, a "good chunk" of laid off developers returned to work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up">yet-to-be-revealed next BioShock game</a>.</p>
<p>Levine, meanwhile, will this year release Judas with his new studio Ghost Story Games, which he previously described as being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">built from "narrative Lego"</a>.</p>
<p>Levine also discussed with Edge the development of BioShock Infinite, which he pushed to make more action-oriented. That led to the Sky-Lines - something he would have developed further in a potential sequel.</p>
<p>"The problem was that the Sky-Lines were so expensive to build that we couldn't build enough space to support the feature," he said. "The team did a great job of bringing that feature to life - there was just not enough of it in the game for it to really land.</p><p>"If we had done a sequel to Infinite, I think I would have spent more time on that. That thing was built on Unreal Engine 3, which is not an outdoor engine. Sky-Lines were a lot of spit and chewing gum and prayers. Players would be surprised how much of games are put together with spit and chewing gum - even the best ones that have worked really well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">Judas was last seen at Sony's PlayStation State of Play this time last year</a> and is yet to receive a firm release date beyond 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Disastrous fires burning across multiple districts of Los Angeles have shut down production across Hollywood, impacting the filming of Fallout season 2 and a raft of other projects.
</p>
<p>
Five people have so far been confirmed to have died and more than 130,000 have been evacuated as the city's worst ever wildfires continue to spread.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c5y81zyp1ext">BBC News</a> reported today that the famous Sunset Boulevard now lies "in ruins", as flames approach the city's iconic Hollywood sign.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/la-fires-halt-production-fallout-greys-anatomy-1236269978/">Variety</a> reported on the impact of the fires on LA's production industry, with all major studios suspending work. 
</p>
<p>
Amazon's Fallout season 2 had been due to film within the Santa Clarita area this week.
</p>
<p>
NBCUniversal, CBS, Disney and Warner Bros. have also shut down their studios, impacting the filming of other shows such as Hacks, Ted, Suits: LA, NCIS, Grey's Anatomy and the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.
</p>
<p>
While in most cases there is no immediate threat to the studios themselves, the LA Fire Department has revoked all filming permits due to air quality being deemed dangerous to health, and the need to keep roads open for emergency vehicles. 
</p>
<p>
This week's disaster has prompted criticism of LA's mayor Karen Bass, who recent cut the city's fire department budget, and renewed calls for a greater focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-were-turning-our-attention-to-gaming-and-the-climate-crisis">impacts of climate change</a>.
</p>
<p>
Production on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">Fallout's second season began in November</a>, and was due to resume this week after a filming break over Christmas. 
</p>
<p>
Fallout's first season was a huge hit when it aired last year, with more than 65 million viewers in its first 16 days - Amazon's second-biggest launch ever, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. A week after its debut, Amazon quickly announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">the series would return for more episodes</a>.
