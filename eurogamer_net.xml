            <p>If you're booting up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> right now, you may notice the return of login queues for EA's latest AAA military shooter. The reason? Well, it's the release of Battlefield 6 Season One and the sudden release of the Redsec battle royale.</p>
<p>The moment the new season and Redsec mode went live, players took to the internet to share their place in the queue. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oibtv4/oh_lawd/">One player managed to snap a 50,000 large line to access the game</a>, not nearly as bad as the queues on launch but a significant number nonetheless.</p>
<p>The battle royale mode, which went live mere minutes ago, is a free-to-play additional game mode. It was officially announced only yesterday, making today something of a surprise shadow drop for the vast majority of the playerbase.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-is-coming-out-tomorrow-and-it-finally-has-a-proper-name">This battle royale mode</a> comes with a giant new map as you'd expect. It's called Fort Lyndon, and it can be experienced as a squad game mode, with no solo queue option as of its launch. There's also the Gauntlet mode for Redsec, which is a knockout style alternative where squads race each other to complete various objectives.</p><p>Finally, players can use Battlefield Portal to create their own custom versions of the Redsec mode, much like they can alter and innovate in Battlefield 6 proper. The Redsec launch trailer (which you can watch above) has added a golf cart that you can drive about, so one can only imagine how many cart-focused creations will flood the Portal in the coming days.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-next-patch-will-address-the-games-most-frustrating-problem-ahead-of-season-ones-release">As for Battlefield 6 Season One</a>, it's coming with a large new map, a new game mode, several new weapons, and gadgets too. So there's plenty to enjoy for those still diving deep into Battlefield 6 some time after its release.</p>
