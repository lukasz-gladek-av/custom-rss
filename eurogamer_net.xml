            <p>Roman Reigns will be the cover star for WWE 2K25, the next in the long-running wrestling series, alongside its largest-ever roster.</p>
<p>It will also include a new The Island mode to complete challenges in a bid to impress "The Original Tribal Chief" Roman Reigns.</p>
<p>The new game is set for release in March (7th or 14th, depending on edition) across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Steam, though The Island will only be available in the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.</p>

<p>The Island will be a world consisting of areas based on different WWE themes where players can complete quests, take on challenges, compete in live events, and upgrade MySuperstars characters through storyline chapters.</p>
<p>The game's roster, meanwhile, will include 300 wrestlers, including Superstars, Legends, and Hall of Famers - from John Cena and The Rock, to "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, Trish Stratus and more.</p>
<p>Other additions include a third-person camera for online matches (controlled separately by each player); the 2K Showcase: The Bloodline's Dynasty mode celebrating the iconic wrestling family dynasty; intergender wrestling makes its debut across all game modes; and the return of Promos in the Universe mode.</p>
<p>The creation suite will also be updated as per each new game, which is considered one of the most detailed and robust <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-might-the-ultimate-character-creator-look-like">character creators</a>.</p>
<p>"I am personally and professionally excited that the Original and Only Tribal Chief and the extended Anoa'i family are the focus of WWE 2K25," said Roman Reigns. "We've been building toward this moment for generations and I challenge players everywhere to show me and my Wiseman, Paul Heyman, what they've got, and prove they're worthy of the attention of their Tribal Chief."</p><p>"WWE 2K25 expands on our winning formula in nearly every aspect of the player experience," said Greg Thomas, president of developer Visual Concepts. "Our new approach to 2K Showcase and MyRISE storylines really tap into the creativity of the development team, and we're excited to see our community enjoy these updated features."</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 is available now to pre-order across three editions: Standard Edition ($69.99), Deadman Edition ($99.99), and The Bloodline Edition ($129.99), with the latter two including new cosmetics and the Season Pass to post-launch DLC character packs, as well as seven day earlier access - that's 7th March ahead of the Standard Edition on 14th March.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wwe-2k24-now-the-only-game-in-the-series-with-online-functionality-as-2k23-servers-go-dark">WWE 2K23 had its online servers shut down</a>, leaving <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</a> as the only game currently available with online functionality. It will soon be joined by 2K25 in March in a clear push towards the latest game in the series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Xbox owner Microsoft is currently in discussions to buy social media giant TikTok.
</p>
<p>
That's according to the newly-reinstalled US President Trump, who has now told reporters of Microsoft's involvement (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/trump-says-microsoft-is-talks-acquire-tiktok-2025-01-28/">Reuters</a>). Microsoft itself has declined to comment.
</p>
<p>
TikTok's current status in the US appears precarious, after it was banned by the previous US administration and the US Supreme Court due to national security concerns linked to the app's Chinese owner ByteDance.

<p>
Ahead of returning to office, Trump had signalled he would pause the ban - though TikTok still took itself offline within the US for a brief window, before returning online with a message that thanked Trump personally.
</p>
<p>
TikTok's US ban is now officially paused for 75 days, during which time the social media giant and its compulsive algorithm must either be sold or banned for good. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft is one of a few companies with deep enough pockets to make a serious bid, with various valuations of TikTok ranging around $100bn, and some even higher.
</p>
<p>
Still, as we well know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft seemed happy to shell out $67.8bn just a couple of years ago to snap up Call of Duty and World of Warcraft maker Activision Blizzard</a>. What's $30bn more for control of the hugely-influential TikTok?
</p><p>
Microsoft has been interested in TikTok previously, and got close to a bid in 2020 during Trump's first term in office. Other contenders to buy the social media firm include cloud technology company Oracle, as well as X owner Elon Musk.
</p>
<p>
TikTok would be, by far, Microsoft's biggest acquisition to date. Other than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, Microsoft previously paid $26bn for LinkedIn, $19.7bn for speech recognition company Nuance Communications, $8.5bn for Skype, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-usd7-5bn-deal-to-acquire-zenimax-approved-in-the-us-and-eu">$7.5bn for Bethesda owner ZeniMax Media</a>.
</p>
<p>Last week, popular card battler <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-team-seeking-new-publisher-as-game-returns-online-following-unexpected-us-ban-alongside-tiktok">Marvel Snap returned online with an apology to players</a>, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-snap-gets-surprise-us-suspension-as-stateside-tiktok-ban-takes-effect">it was also made briefly unavailable</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-snap">Marvel Snap</a> is published by Nuverse, another company owned by TikTok parent ByteDance. Marvel Snap's development team has now said it will seek an alternative publishing partner.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Steve Ogg, the actor behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s breakout main character Trevor, has said he wants to return in Rockstar's upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> in order to die at the very beginning. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-6-trevor-steven-ogg-interview/">ScreenRant</a>, Ogg said he believed the idea would make for a neat moment where he passed the torch to GTA 6's new protagonists - even if it meant getting his head kicked in.
</p>
<p>
"It would be fun if Trevor appeared in it just to be killed at the beginning. I think that would be cool," Ogg said.

<p>
"Because it also acknowledges the fans... like 'Hey, thank you. Pass the torch, stomp Trevor's head in, and sort of put an end to that and allow a new generation to take over'."
</p>
<p>
The moment would mirror an early moment with Trevor in GTA 5, where the character quickly offs GTA 4 character Johnny Kleibitz.
</p>
<p>
Alas, with less than a year until the game's debut, Ogg has said he's not yet been asked to return.
</p>
<p>
In the 12 years since GTA 5's release, Ogg's career has taken off, with roles in The Walking Dead, Westworld and Better Call Saul. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar, meanwhile, has spent the last decade expanding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> with new content, and building the hotly-anticipated GTA 6 - which is currently due to launch (sans Trevor) later in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Last week, speculation swirled that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">Rockstar might choose to make GTA 6 cost £80, or $100</a>, ushering in a new industry-wide raise in game prices. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">GTA 6 "parody" game looks set to launch soon on Steam, despite being kicked off the PlayStation Store</a>.

            <p>The modder behind Fallout: Nuevo Mexico has cancelled the project to prioritise their mental health and "face reality".</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a>, Fallout: Nuevo Mexico was intended to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-seen-fallout-london-heres-fallout-nuevo-mexico">rework of Fallout: New Vegas into an all-new game set in Mexico City</a>.</p>
<p>However, a statement from modder Zapshock on the mod's Discord server (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-nuevo-mexico-mod-cancelled-prioritize-mental-health/">TheGamer</a>) confirmed the project has been cancelled. "This project has been my passion, my obsession, and a huge part of my life for years," wrote Zapshock. "I've poured thousands of hours into it, late nights, early mornings, and everything in between."</p>

<p>They continued: "But as much as I love this project, I need to prioritise my mental health and face reality. The team is small (less than four), the workload enormous, and the costs ahead, both financial and personal, are too great. Continuing forward simply isn't sustainable for me and everyone involved, including voice actors."</p>
<p>Zapshock described the decision as "painful" but "necessary" and thanked the community for supporting the project until now.</p>

<p>A trailer for the ambitious project was released last October (above), which revealed the scope of this new wasteland. The ruined Mexico City would have formed a battleground for multiple factions and would include areas like "the decaying colonia of Chapultepec" and "the submerged canals of Xochimilco".</p>
<p>Comparisons were quickly made with Fallout: London, a similarly-sized mod released for free on GOG last year. It became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-is-now-the-fastest-redeemed-game-of-all-time-on-gog">"fastest-redeemed" game on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>That project, though, wasn't without its problems, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">launching as it did in a shaky condition</a> with performance issues.</p>
<p>Could Bethesda itself ever release a Fallout game outside of America? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-series-healthy-thanks-to-sneaky-popular-fallout-76-says-todd-howard">Not according to Todd Howard</a>.</p>
<p>"Part of the Fallout schtick is on the Americana naïveté," he said in an interview last year after the success of the Fallout TV show. "For us right now it's ok to acknowledge some of those other areas but our plans are to predominantly keep it in the US."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Elder Scrolls, Fallout and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> developer Bethesda has wished veteran voice actor Wes Johnson a speedy recovery, after he was hospitalised last week in a serious condition.
</p>
<p>
Johnson has regularly voiced characters in Bethesda's games for more than 20 years, and appeared in every major project from the studio since 2002's The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1884001161667346927">said</a> Johnson was "not only an incredibly talented and instrumental part of our games, but also one of our dearest friends".
</p>
<p>
Johnson is currently in intensive care after being found unresponsive in his hotel room last week. The actor had travelled to host an Alzheimer's charity event in Atlanta but failed to attend - at which point the alarm was raised. 
</p>
<p>
The actor's condition was made public via a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/unleash-the-fury-for-the-love-of-wes-johnson">GoFundMe</a> page which has currently raised $140k (£112k), and which it says will go to Johnson's family and help cover medical expenses. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Wes is not only an incredibly talented and instrumental part of our games, but also one of our dearest friends.</p><p>We wish him well and hope for an easy recovery. <a href="https://t.co/80sWYCv1ji">https://t.co/80sWYCv1ji</a></p></div>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1884001161667346927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

Johnson plays Sheogorath in The Elder Scrolls series, Fawkes in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> and Ron Hope in Starfield, among dozens of other parts.
</p>
<p>
Outside of video games, Johnson has also made appearances in TV series such as The Wire and Veep, and is the announcer for NHL team Washington Capitals.
</p>
<p>"The Washington Capitals express our heartfelt thoughts and send our best wishes to our beloved public address announcer, Wes Johnson," a statement from the team reads. "We kindly ask everyone to keep Wes in your thoughts and to respect the family's privacy as they navigate this challenging time and focus on Wes' wellbeing."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The series has not been released on PlayStation before but, as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:f6jharuhwg5szxe22rfijybf/post/3lgq2tvakj22s">Gematsu</a> spotted, a PlayStation Store page was accidentally published last night and then taken down.</p>

<p>The store listing had both PS4 and PS5 as platforms, with a release date of 23rd April.</p>
<p>Its quick removal certainly seems to back up its legitimacy, though a PlayStation release has not been officially announced.</p>

</span></p><p>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/level-5s-fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-to-unspecified-date">last year delayed to April 2025</a>, following a 10th October 2024 release date. It's unclear when a firm release date for either platform will be revealed.</p>
<p>The latest in the life sim series was first announced during a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-the-nintendo-direct-1">Nintendo Direct in February 2023</a>. No specific reason was given for its delay last year.</p>
<p>Players will take on multiple roles to rebuild their fantasy island, with a time travelling twist too - as the name suggests.</p>
<p>At the same Direct, Level 5 also announced its next Professor Layton game for the Switch, though this is currently set for a 2025 release without an exact date.</p>
<p>Could either of these games be also releasing on Nintendo's newly-revealed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> console?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of course, not everyone got an invite. Nintendo appears to have notified unsuccessful applicants, too.

The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a> World Tour will visit London between 11th and 13th April, shortly after the event series kicks off on 4th April in Paris, before visiting other European capital cities such as Berlin, Madrid and Amsterdam.
</p>
<p>Attendees are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-hands-on-registration-now-open-in-europe-and-youll-get-up-to-four-hours-play-time">expected to get around four hours with Switch 2</a> - and presumably will be able to try the new Mario Kart.</p>
<p>
A second version will simultaneously tour North America, with dates in New York, Los Angeles, Dallas and Toronto.

Nintendo is yet to say when exactly Switch 2 will be released - but could it be around then, as the tour concludes?

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> creative director Johan Pilestedt is taking a sabbatical after 11 years on the series, and will start developer Arrowhead's next game on his return.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 released early last year, but as Pilestedt noted in a social media post, he's been "living it since early 2016", while development of the first game began in 2013.</p>
<p>"11 years of working 'around the clock' on the same IP has made me set aside family, friends and my lovely wife... and myself," he wrote.</p>
<p>"I am going to take some time now to redeem what was lost from all of those that supported me for over a decade."</p>

<p>Of course, support on Helldivers 2 will continue while he's away, considering it's proven such a success - it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-performed-well-ahead-of-expectations-and-topped-more-than-8m-sales">topped 8m sales in March</a> and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-now-playstations-biggest-steam-launch-ever">PlayStation's biggest ever launch on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Arrowhead did recently come under fire, however, for the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developers-respond-to-criticism-of-killzone-2-crossover-cost"> high cost of its Killzone 2 collaboration</a>, which the studio then gifted to players for free.</p>
<p>"When I'm back - I will start working on the next Arrowhead game," Pilestedt added. That will likely be a long way off, but it's exciting to consider what could be next for the studio.</p>

<p>Until then, there's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">newly announced Helldivers film adaptation</a>. Pilestedt confirmed Arrowhead will be involved, but in a limited capacity as he acknowledged the development team are "not Hollywood people".</p>
<p>Further, Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani joked he wants as "many A-list actors as possible" to be in the film, but only if "they all get killed violently immediately".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
