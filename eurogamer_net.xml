            <p>
The ongoing deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks continues today with purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards, a report that Nintendo's new console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock, and speculation over the new handheld's mysterious optical sensor.
</p>
<p>
Let's begin with those MicroSD Express listings, which look to be have been spotted by a GameStop employee and posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">reddit</a>. These include Switch 2-branded MicroSD Express card variants in the already-existing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORwmO">256GB</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YLvk">512GB</a> sizes, which sell for around £40 and £50 respectively. 
</p>
<p>
SD Express is a newer standard for SD cards with much faster transfer speeds, enabling performance not dissimilar to SSDs. If the Switch 2 is indeed adopting this standard, it'll be interesting to see how the console performs with multiplatform games versus current gen consoles with SSD memory.
</p>
<p>
Moving on to word of compatibility with the Switch 1 dock, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-didnt-expect-this-much-media-attention-we-saw-genkis-ces-nintendo-switch-2-mockup-heres-what-they-had-to-say">IGN</a> has been told by Switch 2 accessories manufacturer Genki that Nintendo's new console won't fit the older base.
</p>
<p>
While the Switch 2 itself can physically fit within the Switch 1 dock, "indentations" in its design have been added to ensure users don't actually plug it in. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">The Verge</a> has been told by Genki CEO Eddie Tsai that the Switch 2's mysterious new optical sensor - located on its Joy-Con - could offer mouse-like functionality when paired with another attachment. The concept sounds similar to Lenovo's Legion Go handheld, which also features Joy-Con like controllers.
</p>
<p>
When paired with a base, the Legion Go controllers can stand upright and act like a vertically-aligned mouse - almost akin to a joystick.

 </a>

<p>
Nintendo has so far kept schtum on all of its Switch 2 plans, other than stating the new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games and will be fully unveiled before 31st March. 
</p>
<p>
The company has not responded to comment on the now-rampant Switch 2 leaks - many of which have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">fuelled by third-party accessory manufacturers who claim to have access to the console's final design</a>.

            <p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launches later this week and will bring significant balance changes.</p>
<p>The online hero shooter has been in Season 0 since its release last month, and despite a perceived dominance of certain characters, NetEase's analysis reveals "significant shifts in team compositions" and "a vibrant diversity of lineups".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html">patch notes</a> continue: "However, as the skill level escalates, compositions centered around double shields and ranged have displayed considerable prowess. Despite this, players have continuously honed and experimented with new compositions and strategies, further enriching the battlefield."</p>

<p>As such, Season 1 will bring various balance changes to ensure a "richer, more engaging, and diverse" experience, although there will be no extensive changes to Team-Up abilities - redesigns and adjustments will arrive in Season 2.</p>
<p>The new season brings nerfs to some particularly dominant characters: Hulk's Indestructible Guard shield value has been reduced; Hawkeye's medium-long range damage has been decreased; and Hela has had her base health reduced.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Black Widow has been buffed with increased range of her ultimate ability, Namor's egg-throwing will be more accurate, and Storm has received an overall increase to her damage capability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NetEase has released a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/">Hero Hot List</a> to show the most frequently chosen heroes across PC and console in both Quickplay and Competitive modes.</p>
<p>In Quickplay, Jeff the Land Shark tops both lists surprising nobody - he was even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-winter-celebration-features-splatoon-esque-arcade-mode-starring-jeff-the-land-shark">star of a Splatoon-style arcade mode over Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>In Competitive mode, Luna Snow is top for PC players while Cloak &amp; Dagger is top for console players. Black Widow and Storm are the least popular, hence the incoming buffs.</p>
<p>Season 1 will be released on Friday, 10th January.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-fantastic-four-arrive-in-marvel-rivals-this-week-as-part-of-vampiric-first-season">new season will bring the Fantastic Four as playable heroes</a>, although players are concerned the design of the Invisible Woman (Sue Storm) is too similar to Dagger, making them hard to tell apart in the heat of battle. Skins will likely be used to make them stand out.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> has submitted a lengthy defence in response to lawsuits filed last year in which the families of those killed in the 2022 Uvalde school shooting accused the publisher of "grooming" the 18-year-old perpetrator through Call of Dury.
</p>
<p>
19 children and two teachers were killed in the attack on Robb Elementary School in May 2022, while 17 others were injured. Families of those killed during the tragedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uvalde-school-shooting-victims-sue-activision-claiming-its-the-most-prolific-marketer-of-weapons-in-the-us">later filed lawsuits in Texas and California</a> against Activision (after it emerged the shooter had played Call of Duty), alongside Instagram owner Meta and gun manufacturer Daniel Defense.
</p>
<p>
"This three-headed monster," the lawsuit alleged, "knowingly exposed [the perpetrator] to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it." At the time of last May's filing, Activision called the shooting "horrendous and heartbreaking", but noted "millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts".
</p>
<p>
Now though, as reported by journalist Stephen Totilo in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, Activision has formally submitted its initial defence, spanning nearly 150 pages of legal documentation filed last December. In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813228593/Activision-s-direct-legal-reply-to-the-Uvalde-families-lawsuit-via-Game-File">six-page direct response to the California lawsuit</a>, the publisher has denied "each and every allegation contained in the Complaint", claiming, among other things, a lack of causation between Call of Duty and the shooting. Totilo notes the publisher has also asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of California's anti-SLAPP laws, which are designed to prevent the abuse of the legal system against a defendant's free speech.
</p><p>
"Call of Duty tells complex stories that explore the real-world combat scenarios that soldiers face in modern warfare," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813227428/Activision-s-defense-in-Call-of-Duty-Uvalde-lawsuit-via-Game-File">separate 35-page filing</a>. "There can be no doubt Call of Duty is expressive and fully protected by the First Amendment... By bringing a laundry list of causes of action against Activision premised on allegedly dangerous 'hyper-realistic content' in the Call of Duty video games played by the perpetrator who committed heinous acts of violence, the Complaint runs headfirst into this overriding constitutional principle."
</p>
<p>
Activision's submissions also include a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813230017/Declaration-of-Matthew-Thomas-Payne-in-Mata-et-al-vs-Meta-Activision-Microsoft-via-Game-File">35-page declaration from Notre Dame media studies professor Matthew Thomas Payne</a>, arguing the Call of Duty series "flows from the same military realism tradition that has been explored for decades in critically acclaimed war movies and television shows" - and is thus far from the "training camp for mass shooters" in which "teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease" described in the Uvalde families' lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
The publisher's defence is also supported by a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813229303/Call-of-Duty-s-chief-Patrick-Kelly-s-declaration-for-Mata-vs-Activision-via-Game-File">38-page submission from Call of Duty head of creative Patrick Kelly</a>, which goes into significant detail regarding the design and creation of the series. This is the same document that revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-cost-an-eye-popping-700m-to-make">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's eye-popping $700m budget</a>, and includes a wealth of information Activision's lawyers could potentially use to counter the various claims made in the Uvalde families' legal filing.
</p>
<p>
For instance, while the claimant's suit alleges the Uvalde shooter learned about the gun he used from the loading screen of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Kelly highlights two key points. Firstly, he says the generic assault rifle depicted in the image had been deliberately anonymised to ensure it did not feature identifiers that could link it to any particular firearm manufacturer. Secondly, he notes that by the time the perpetrator played the game in November 2021, the loading screen had been changed and would likely not have been seen.
</p><p>
There's plenty more detail in Activision's submitted documentation, and Totilo has a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/activision-uvalde-call-of-duty-defense">considerably expanded breakdown of the publisher's arguments</a> in his paywalled newsletter. The Uvalde families have until late February to respond to Activision's filings, and the publisher can then reply in April. As Totilo notes, if the case goes to trial, it likely won't be for a long time.
