            <p>A new trailer for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> has been released, showing off 20 mini games and 14 tech demos that'll be playable to those who pick the game up alongside their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Games shown include a timed survival game in which you pilot a little space ship and dodge spiked balls, a match-the-tile memory game, a first-person balloon popping game, as well as a driving game that allows you to lean on two tires by tilting the Joycon controller.</p>
<p>As for tech demos, we see a side-by-side comparison between 20fps and 120fps as a football soars across the screen, alongside a model viewer that allows you to quickly swap between different resolutions to see the shift in visual quality firsthand.</p>

<p>Plus, a macarena shaker demo was briefly shown, which looks to let players feel how the motors inside each Joycon feel with different settings. We don't get to see everything in store of course, but we can assume each demo will be dedicated to a specific use case for the fancy new features.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, there's also an in-game quiz that seems to test you on all the new hardware and software features on the console. Who doesn't love homework with their new video game console?</p>
<p>All in all it looks to be a fairly comprehensive overview of the console, giving eager beavers with a shiny new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> a way to familiarise themselves with its new gizmos without having to pour through a big instructions manual.</p>
<p>However, many still wonder why this game is being sold as its own release, rather than it being included alongside the Switch 2 for free like we saw with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astros-playroom">Astro's Playroom</a> on the PS5. The former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a> boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/reggie-fils-aime-wades-into-switch-2-pricing-debate-by-subtweeting-nintendo-over-pack-in-games">Reggie Fils-Aime referenced the Welcome Tour being sold for $10</a> by speaking about the past, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wii-sports">Wii Sports</a> was released for free alongside the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/wii">Nintendo Wii</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo itself has defended selling the game rather than bundling it in with the console, stating that the game is being sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-charging-for-switch-2s-tutorial-game-because-of-the-amount-of-care-and-work-put-into-it">due to the "amount of care and work" put into it</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 Welcome Tour will be released on June 5, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">alongside the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It will cost £7.99 here in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin has said this show will be his "video game swansong", but that hasn't stopped him joking about 19 seasons of something <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>-flavoured.</p>
<p>Mazin has so far been at the helm of two seasons of The Last of Us, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckmann. A third season is already confirmed to be in the pipeline, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">at least one more season after that is still expected to wrap up the games' narratives</a>.</p>
<p>But, once all that is done and dusted, Mazin won't be looking to head up another video game to TV adaptation, he has said.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.scifinow.co.uk/interviews/craig-mazin-on-the-last-of-us/">SciFiNow</a>, the showrunner was asked which other video game series he would like to adapt, to which he replied: "Well, I'm not ever going to, of course, because where can you go from here?"</p>
<p>That said, he joked that as he is a "masochist", he was tempted to reply with Grand Theft Auto 5, because "I just think that would be like 19 seasons of TV", or even something like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, which is quite the thought.</p>
<p>However, these game adaptations are all just a jokey reply, and The Last of Us will be Mazin's "video game swansong", he said. He would still happily lend a hand to those looking to adapt a video game for TV, though.</p>
<p>"Mostly, I'm excited to watch what other people do, even if I help. I have no problem being a helper. I would love to help produce some good adaptations of video games, just a couple in mind that I actually have," Mazin said.</p>
<p>"But in terms of writing and dedicating myself on a day-by-day basis… this one's my video game swansong."</p>

<p>The Last of Us' second season concluded last week, after seven episodes. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-finale-audience-significantly-lower-than-first-seasons-but-hbo-insists-it-will-grow-significantly">finale welcomed 3.7 million cross-platform viewers in the US</a>, which was significantly lower than the season's opening episode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-debut-viewing-figures-beat-season-one-premiere">which premiered with 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers</a>.</p>
<p>As for its next outing, last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-discuss-where-season-three-will-go">The Last of Us' cast and crew shared some insight into where the show will go during its third season</a>.</p>

            <p>Towards the end of last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-black-panther-cancellation-ea-still-has-at-least-three-marvel-games-in-the-works">EA cancelled its single-player Black Panther game and closed the developer behind it</a>, Cliffhanger Studios. At this time, an email seen by the media said this decision would enable the publisher to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities".</p>
<p>Since then, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a> report has revealed a few more details from Cliffhanger Studios' now-cancelled Marvel game, including that the project was looking to build upon ideas from Monolith's Shadow of Mordor game, such as its Nemesis System. The Nemesis system is a clever in-game mechanic, which in Shadow of Mordor tracks a player's actions to create enemies who remember past encounters.</p>
<p>Cliffhanger was going to expand on this mechanism, with playable heroes such as T'Challa, Killmonger and Shuri all competing to earn the title of Black Panther. According to the report, players would select one character to play as, with the others then becoming rivals they could build a relationship with.</p>
<p>Additionally, Cliffhanger's Black Panther game would feature Marvel's fictional race of extraterrestrial shapeshifters, the Skrulls. In the game, the Skrulls would be attempting to invade Wakanda, with some of the alien creatures posing as allies. Meanwhile, other members of the Skrulls "might have remembered the player's behaviour and acted accordingly, sort of like in Shadow of Mordor," the report stated, calling it an "ambitious system".</p>
<p>However, despite its vision, the Black Panther developer had a hard time showcasing the game's procedural narrative experiments, with those close to the project stating that processes were slowed due to the team building both a new game and a new studio at the same time.</p>
<p>Reportedly, the game had begun gaining more momentum prior to its shock cancellation, with many of those laid off only being hired within the last year. However, according to sources, EA executives had been left frustrated by the fact the game had not yet left the pre-production phase, despite it being in the works for nearly four years.</p>

<p>While EA may have cancelled its Black Panther Project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-iron-man-single-player-game-in-the-works">the company still has an Iron Man game in the pipeline</a>. In October 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-iron-man-part-of-three-game-marvel-deal">EA signed a multi-game deal with Marvel</a>.</p>
<p>Away from EA, Amy Hennig's own Black Panther-starring game is also still in development. Known as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">upcoming release is slated for next year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">will focus on four central characters</a>: a young Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America; Azzuri, T'Challa's grandfather and the WWII-era Black Panther; Gabriel Jones, a US soldier and member of the Howling Commandos; and Nanali, a Wakandan spy embedded in Occupied Paris.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest</a> ahead of the event this Friday. This montage of big releases - some already playable, others highly anticipated - is clearly a tone setter for the annual gaming showcase, set to kick off a weekend of new trailers and reveals.</p>
<p>Some notable titles featured in this sizzle reel include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> will also be making an appearance too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">its first since an art plagiarism scandal reportedly left morale at Bungie in "free fall"</a>.</p>
<p>As for representation from games you can just go out and buy right now, you've got titles like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>. It's unclear as of yet what sort of presence these games will have at the show, but one can assume smaller updates, post-launch content, and so on.</p>

<p>Indeed many of the games briefly shown off in this new trailer will likely be making some manner of appearance at the show. We know of course that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Death Stranding 2 is getting its own premiere</a> separate from the main Summer Game Fest stage on June 8, and <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1927754199594307658">thanks to a recent Twitter post by Summer Game Fest founder and host Geoff Keighley</a> we know 2K will be there, hopefully with Mafia in hand.</p>
<p>Of course that same tweet does point towards other big studios that surely will be dropping something exciting during the weekend. Studios like Bandai Namco, Capcom, Digital Extremes, Embark and far more have logos proudly spread across official Summer Game Fest material.</p> <div>
