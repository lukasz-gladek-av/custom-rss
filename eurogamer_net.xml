            <p>Valve has added a game recording functionality to Steam.</p>
<p>This feature was previously in beta, but is now available to the wider community. It's described as a "new built-in system for creating and sharing your gameplay footage".</p>
<p>Users will now be able to record, replay, clip and share their gameplay experience. This includes on Valve's handheld PC, the Steam Deck.</p>

<p>In a blog post detailing Steam's new feature, Valve said its 'Background Recording' mode will mean gameplay is "continuously saved to your preferred drive, never exceeding your specified duration and storage limits". It stated that an 'on demand' function is also available, so users can stop and start recording manually as the mood takes.</p>
<p>That aforementioned replay functionality, meanwhile, can be found in the Steam Overlay for each game on Valve's platform.</p>
<p>There will also be 'Timeline' and 'Event' markers. "The Steam Timeline appears whenever you’re actively recording," Valve said. "Timeline-enhanced games generate event markers as relevant game events happen. Steam achievements and screenshots automatically create markers as well."</p>
<p>Full details on Valve's new game recording feature, including how to save and share clips, can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/gamerecording">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>In related news, EA recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-drops-steam-deck-support-in-bid-to-tackle-impactful-exploits-and-cheats">blocked Steam Deck players from its cooperative shooter Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Stating "the openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers", EA determined making its game available on the Linux system is "a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> is removing the majority of its Interactive Specials from the streaming service.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, a Netflix spokesperson confirmed "almost all" of its interactive titles will come off the service on 1st December.</p>
<p>"Only four will remain: Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend, Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls, and You vs. Wild," Netflix told us.</p>

<p>Perhaps somewhat fittingly, Bandersnatch is about a young programmer who "begins to question reality" as he sets to work adapting a dark fantasy novel into a video game. Set in the 1980s, Bandersnatch is described as a "mind-bending tale", which features multiple endings depending on the viewer's decisions.</p>
<p>Word of Netflix's plans first started making the rounds earlier this week, when Battle Kitty series creator Matt Layzell shared an update on Instagram. Here, Layzell confirmed Netflix would be removing their original animated series from the service.</p>
<p>"It's not the ideal future I had hoped for Battle Kitty but I'm SO grateful for everyone who watched and enjoyed the show," <a href="https://x.com/AWorkersIgnited/status/1853261942951211155">Layzell wrote</a>. "As always, a huge thanks from the bottom of my heart to the entire crew who helped me bring it to life."</p>
<p>Here's the full list of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/2869704">Interactive Specials</a> set to be removed from Netflix in the coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headspace: Unwind your Mind</li>

<li>Cat Burglar</li>
<li>Battle Kitty</li>

<p>Last month, Netflix reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">closed its internal game studio in Southern California</a>, which was poised to release a AAA game. Known as team 'Blue', this was one of a handful of internal studios founded by Netflix as part of its expansion into games.</p><p>The particular team boasted staff from other major studios, including longtime <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a> creative lead Joseph Staten, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> executive producer Chacko Sonny and art director Rafael Grassetti from God of War's Sony Santa Monica.

            <p>Nintendo has confirmed its Switch successor will be backward compatible with Switch games.</p>
<p>Company president Shuntaro Furukawa shared the news earlier this morning. Writing on social media platform X, Furukawa said:</p>
<p>"At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch."</p>

<p>In addition, Furukawa confirmed Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the company's next console, which for now has been dubbed '<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>'. According to Nintendo, there are over 34 million Switch Online members as of 30th September, 2024. </p>
<p>While Furukawa made no mention specifically about issues such as cartridges, the exec said more information on the Switch successor will be shared at "a later date".</p>
<p>CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy Kantan Games Serkan Toto noted Nintendo's stock saw a boost following confirmation of the Switch 2's backwards compatibility. It closed up at +5.80 percent at 3:30pm Japan time on Wednesday, the industry analyst said.</p>
<p>"Investors think this is a sign Nintendo's next device will not be a risky experiment but rather a continuation," <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1854050495566061608">Toto wrote on X</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf">Corporate Management Policy Briefing</a>, Nintendo highlighted several upcoming Switch games set to release in 2025. These include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, for which we are yet to see gameplay for, leading many to assume this could also be a Switch 2 launch title. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is also listed on Nintendo's slate for next year.</p><p>The company said the Nintendo Switch is being played by over 100 million people worldwide, with that number covering every age range from children to seniors. It added "more software has been played on Nintendo Switch than on any other Nintendo hardware".</p>

<p>Following confirmation of its existence in May, Nintendo is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">officially announce its next console by the end of March, 2025</a>. However, it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">unlikely to reveal anything this calendar year</a>, analysts say.</p>
<p>Nintendo recently revised down its expectations for total Switch console and game sales. As Tom reported yesterday, Switch hardware sales were down 31 percent year-on-year for the three months ending 30th September. The company has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-cuts-switch-sales-forecast-as-the-wait-for-new-hardware-continues">cut its total Switch sales forecast for the financial year to 12.5m</a>, down from the 13.5m it expected previously.</p>
<p>Most recent figures state the Nintendo Switch stands at 146.04m total units sold.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
