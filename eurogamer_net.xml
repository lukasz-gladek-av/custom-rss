            <p>Shipments for Analogue's upcoming console - known as the Analogue 3D - have been delayed.</p>
<p>The Analogue 3D looks like a pretty smart piece of kit, and one which allows users to play original N64 cartridges in 4K. Oh, hello nostalgia, my old friend!</p>
<p>Anyway, this console was originally available for interested patrons to preorder at the end of 2024, with a scheduled shipment window of Q1 2025. However, shipping has now been delayed, and moved to the balmy summer month of July. So, if analaysts are right, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-analysts-predict-400-price-and-biggest-console-launch-ever-in-june">month after the Nintendo Switch 2 may grace our shelves</a>.  </p>

<p>But, I digress. Back to the Analogue 3D. </p>
<p>"We are working hard to get your 3D order in hands asap and appreciate your patience," a <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq">notice on Analogue's website reads</a>. The console's maker said if you currently have an open preorder, then no action is required.</p>
<p>"As always, if you’d like to cancel your pre-order at any time, Analogue has always had a no questions asked, 100 percent refund policy for pre-orders," the website continues.</p>

<p>"Analogue 3D represents a milestone in video game preservation: it's not only the world's first reimagining of an N64 - but the world's first 100 percent-compatible recreation of an N64," the company shared on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analogues-new-console-is-a-4k-n64-machine-that-uses-original-cartridges">the Analogue 3D's initial reveal last year</a>.</p>
<p>"No more incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more. For the first time, you can re-experience the N64 exactly as it was meant to be, without compromise."</p>
<p>I wonder if my <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-majoras-mask">Majora's Mask</a> cartridge still works...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Let's be honest, when it comes to The Sims, sometimes it is quite a lot of fun to kill off various members of your community, be it by letting them get devoured by a cowplant or the always classic pool ladder removal technique (although, you now also need walls to box those Sims in).</p>
<p>So, if you are like me - and don't pretend that you aren't - you will probably be wondering what methods there will be to kill off your characters in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">Inzoi</a>, the upcoming Sim-like from Krafton. And, the good news for us players who like to flex those Godly muscles, Inzoi has "16 different types of deaths" for players to discover.</p>

<p>"One of the biggest features of this game is death," game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim said during an Inzoi livestream (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/in-good-news-for-sim-murdering-sickos-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths/">PC Gamer</a>), acknowledging that "life comes with death".</p>
<p>So, what of those deaths? "In Inzoi you could go to the bathroom and if you slip you might die. Or if you eat some old food you might have to go to the bathroom and, again, die," the director shared.</p>
<p>"And when you fix broken-down electronics you might get electrocuted, so you need to be careful. I made the chance really low, but actually electronics can very often break down. We have 16 different types of deaths."</p>
<p>Now, some of those deaths sound very similar to deaths in EA's The Sims series, but Inzoi will have one rather unique death -  "dying from the need for recognition".</p>
<p>Said Kjun: "In the modern world you find a lot of people feel fulfilled from being recognised by others and this death reflects that. For example, in Inzoi let's say I fought with someone and that rumor spread and came back to me. I could get a text message about it, or a friend of mine could tell me about the rumor and if the rumor is negative then my need for acknowledgement can go down.</p>
<p>"And if that drops too drastically then you might die from that."</p>
<p>Inzoi's characters can also get hit by cars, so be sure to practice some road safety when out and about. "I reiterate, we have a simulation and death and this type of thing is a part of the game," Kjun concluded.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has launched the Xbox Adaptive Joystick, a companion controller that looks very similar to the Wii's Nunchuk accessory. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of Nintendo's retro console will spot the same shape as the Wii Nunchuk, with two trigger buttons on the back of the device and an analogue stick on top. Four face buttons are also included.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-expands-accessibility-range-with-new-xbox-adaptive-joystick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick was announced last year</a> as a further aid to accessibility, and plugs directly into any Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S console, Windows 11 PC, or the Xbox Adaptive Controller device.

<p>
For now, the controller is being <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/xbox-adaptive-joystick">sold via the Microsoft Store</a> for £25, or $30. 
</p>
<p>
"With more than 429 million players with disabilities worldwide, we know each player has unique needs and preferences for how they choose to play," Microsoft's chief accessibility officer Jenny Lay-Flurrie <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/03/18/microsoft-ability-summit-2025-accessibility-in-the-ai-era/">said in a Microsoft blog post</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The Xbox Adaptive Joystick is a singular, wired controller primarily designed to meet the needs of players with limited mobility. Its versatility helps players seamlessly incorporate it into their existing gaming setups. Built with the Gaming and Disability community who inform the development of Xbox products from the beginning. The joystick joins our family of adaptive accessories including the mouse, pen, adaptive kit and Xbox Adaptive Controller."
</p>
<p>
Buttons can be remapped via the standard Xbox Accessories app. A range of 3D-printable thumbstick topper designs are also available via the Xbox Design lab, to allow users to customise their controller further to their needs.

            <p>Hasbro has "a lot of people very interested in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>", as developer Larian moves away from the series.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> released towards the end of 2023, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-mammoth-success-drives-larian-to-bumper-207m-pre-tax-profit-for-2023">became a smashing success for Dungeons and Dragons owner Hasbro as well as Larian</a>. The game won scores of praise (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">and awards</a>) across the world, and last year Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-has-more-players-this-year-than-its-actual-launch-year">game's average daily peak concurrents were up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent in 2024 over 2023</a>.</p>
<p>However, despite this heady success, Larian is moving on from Baldur's Gate, and has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>. So, where does that leave the future of Baldur's Gate? Well, there are plenty of others who are "very interested" in Baldur's Gate, SVP of digital games at Hasbro Dan Ayoub has said.</p>

<p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," Ayoub told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says">IGN</a> during this week's GDC event in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Now, while the wording of "in pretty short order" certainly sounds promising, this doesn't mean we are about to suddenly get Baldur's Gate 4. In fact, Hasbro isn't "in a hurry" for that particular game.</p>
<p>"That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things," Ayoub explained, with the publication adding the exec said he eventually <em>wants</em> a Baldur's Gate 4, but it will take some time.</p>
<p>As for other Hasbro Dungeons and Dragons games, Ayoub said he is "never one to shy down from a challenge". After all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-dungeons-and-dragons-game-on-the-way-from-disney-dreamlight-valley-team">there are several other</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">D&amp;D-based games in the works</a>, and in November Hasbro announced following the success of Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business">yet another Dungeons &amp; Dragons game was in production</a>.</p>
<p>"I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar, and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher," Ayoub closed.</p>

    <blockquote><cite>Good Ol' Auto says:</cite> This is also regarding cosmetics, but it's more curiosity about the purely aesthetic more than anything important: how "restricted" are the looks of the characters so far when it comes to the gear they can get? Does Naoe get something more armored-looking or is she limited to ninja-like attire? Same for Yasuke (but not as much, because he's already quite armored up and it's mostly having the characters clad in armor that I'm curious/hopeful about. Having Naoe in some Tomoe Gozen-like attire would be cool, even if not necessarily a gamebreaker).</blockquote>
<p>I don't recall any big armour for Naoe - it doesn't reflect her movement or her nimbleness in battle. Her gear is mostly shinobi-themed, with some battle-ready kosodes, as well as some cool Assassin robes. Headgear includes hoods and headbands. I discovered a great Noh mask the other night, but it's a bit creepy for general wear. 
</p>
<p>Yasuke has some slightly-less chunky gear - there's a Japanese pirate set for him - but he's supposed to be dressed like a tank. All of that said, you can hide all their gear and have both of them fighting in their undies if you'd prefer.</p>

<p>Shadows' version of Japan is comparatively grounded, and also - as mentioned below - does not have you fighting creatures. None of its story threads focus on mythological elements.
</p>
<p>More as Easter eggs, there are <span tabindex="0">a couple of mythical animals you can spot and paint pictures of</span>.</p>

<p>This is Ubisoft Quebec, which previously led development on Syndicate and Odyssey. (Montreal, for reference, led Origins and Valhalla.) No sign of the story creator coming back yet, but it is early days, and that was a very late addition to Odyssey.</p>

      <p>Microtransactions and gear</p>
    <blockquote><cite>Czekolada says:</cite> What about microtransactions? Given how valhalla had more paid equipment sets in their in-game store than you could get within base game itself (+expacs!) I expect shadows to be as bad in this regard. Especially now,that the gear seems to have it's own stats instead of just perks (which was asinine for ubisoft to do in valhalla anyway)</blockquote>
<p>There are four armour sets in the premium shop at launch - none of which are tempting to me in any way, cosmetically or for their perks. (I have bought the occaisonal thing in an Assassin's Creed game before, but typically just mounts.) It is very ignorable.
</p>
<p>Valhalla definitely had a gear problem. Getting rid of being able to dismantle gear meant that game scaled the amount of gear too far back. Shadows uses the Odyssey system, where you're swapping better gear pretty regularly then dismantling older stuff for resources, which you can put towards upgrading the Legendary gear sets you keep and upgrade. And as mentioned below, transmog works like Odyssey too.</p>

<p>I was waiting for this question too - and I'm sorry I haven't played more of that list to make a proper judgement! Comparing it to how other Assassin's Creed games have treated their own time periods/source material, this is probably the most grounded/sensible take yet, while never seeming dry. And I think it's more of a looker than Tsushima.</p>

      <p>Random encounters and transmog</p>
    <blockquote><cite>Good Ol' Auto says:</cite> This is a bit silly of a question, but are there random events as you explore? How interactable is the settlement you're given? And most importantly, how is the fashion game? Is transmog as good as it was in Odyssey, or is it more like Valhalla's restrictive take on it? And do we get similar customization to the latter in the game letting us change Naoe's and Yasuke's hairstyles?</blockquote>
<p>Good questions all! Yes, there are often random events by the side of the road - people with small stories to share, problems to quickly solve, or bandits lying in wait. You're rewarded for interacting with these by gaining intel on a nearby activity/merchant/treasure you're yet to find, or with an extra scout to send out that season. Useful!</p>
<p>The settlement is fairly interactive. Every time I go back, several people want to say hello - and this definitely helps flesh out your companion characters, who otherwise only get a couple of missions of screentime. I'd encourage going back as often as you can of your own accord - the game does not force you back there after every story arc like Valhalla.</p>
<p>Transmog is the Odyssey system. It's a lot of fun, and lets you junk your old gear fast. There's some great armour options, but no hairstyles/beard styles... yet.</p></div>

      <p>Level gating and grinding</p>
    <blockquote><cite>Raziel says:</cite> How level-gated is the main game? Did you find yourself having to do side-quests (or grind even) to reach that level or does it pace well with the story?</blockquote>
<p>Several folk asked about this yesterday too - thanks for your questions <strong>November02</strong>, <strong>eze2g</strong> and <strong>MrZappa</strong>. </p>
<p>After the game's prologue, the map opens out and you can travel anywhere. Enemies have a base difficulty in each region which then syncs with yours as you level up, so you're never going anywhere that's a cakewalk. You can generally tackle areas and equip gear about five levels higher than yours.</p>
<p>There's definitely a structure to the game - you'll discover/be encouraged to go after some of the main targets before others. But there's not a strict order within that, and I never found myself having to grind in order to move on, or because I was unable to do anything else before being a higher level. </p></div>

<p>I'm guessing you mean snakes! (Could be slow worms.) I can confirm Shadows' total snake count is: zero.</p>
<p>For my fellow vegetarians, one small thing I liked about Shadows is it never forces you to hunt/kill animals. The game's world is teeming with life - but it's there to be observed and painted!</p>

- Did you find side quests and exploration worthwhile?</blockquote>
<p>New Eurogamer feature/old Assassin's Creed fan - hello :)</p>
<p>It took me 55 hours to hit the credits, completing the main story, all companion sidequests and the epilogue quests for both Naoe and Yasuke. That's the real meat of it all, though of course completionists have more to do. (Hello again.)</p>
<p>Exploration is a big part of the fun of the game. I found it far more rewarding, not least because Shadows' world is so visually stunning. Anything to do with Naoe/Yasuke's personal stories are great and very worth doing. Companion characters are a mixed bag, and not essential.</p></div>

<p>As a long-term Assassin's Creed fan, stealth is my go-to as well. As a percentage of the game's full run-time, it's not often Shadows forces you to play as one character over another - and as Yasuke much less than Naoe, who gets the game's lengthy prologue pretty much to herself. </p>

            <p>A year and a bit on from its monumental debut which saw the internet dubbed 'Pokémon with guns' game surpassing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">2m concurrent players on Steam</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> now has crossplay.</p>
<p>The update went live today across platforms, with developer Pocketpair proclaiming "the wait is over". Crossplay was included in a roadmap laid out by the developer back in January, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-adding-ending-scenario-this-year-as-game-celebrates-first-anniversary-while-under-legal-threat-from-nintendo">Palworld team outlined its plans for the game's second year</a>. At this time, however, no release date was mentioned.</p>
<p>Other new bells and whistles added with today's update include a new storage system, dedicated servers for those playing on Mac, and a photo mode.</p>

<p>You can check out the full notes for today's Palworld update below:</p>
<p><strong>New Content</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Crossplay! Cross-play is now available across all platforms.</li>
<li>Global Palbox - Store Pal data in the Global Palbox and transfer Pals between worlds!</li>
<li>Dimensional Pal Storage - A new storage system with 10 times the capacity of a regular Palbox! Guild members can access it, and it can also be used as a personal storage with private settings.</li>
<li>Cosmetic Armour System! You can now equip armour cosmetically in the Antique Dresser. Change your character’s appearance without affecting armour stats!</li>
<li>Photo Mode - Accessible from the Pal Command Wheel. Hide the UI and move the camera around to take stunning screenshots.</li>
<li>Drafting Table - Combine low-rarity blueprints to create higher-rarity ones!</li>
<li>Dedicated Servers for Mac</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Specification Adjustments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Buildings can now be placed even if they overlap with a Pal</li>
<li>When connecting foundations or roofs, the connected pieces will now automatically align in the same direction</li>

<p><strong>Balance Adjustments</strong></p>

<li>Added Water attribute to Dumud</li>

<p>In addition to the above, the Palworld studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-discusses-games-ending-says-its-been-mapped-out-for-quite-some-time">currently building an "ending scenario" for the game</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">an upcoming Terraria crossover</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, earlier this week Pocketpair discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-had-to-scale-back-a-little-bit-and-hire-security-guards-palworld-developer-reveals-nintendo-lawsuit-reaction">moment it discovered Nintendo had launched legal action against its Pokémon-style game</a>, calling it "a very depressing day".</p></div>
