            <p>Snail Games' Aquatica expansion for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>The DLC will make its debut later this month, on 15th July, via Steam. Ark: Aquatica will submerge players under the waters, tasking them with "new survival mechanics, extreme environmental hazards, a huge explorable map area, and unique gameplay elements".</p>
<p>It will additionally introduce 21 new tameable creatures, as well as 74 new Engrams (including 7 tek Engrams), and "underwater survival thanks to things like air pockets and propulsion vehicles". </p>
<p>Perhaps feeling a sense of 'once bitten, twice shy' due to those AI slop accusations from earlier this year, the developer has released a really very, <em>very</em> brief release date teaser for the upcoming expansion, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Snail Games and Ark: Aquatica made headlines back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-dlc-trailer-slammed-for-its-blatant-use-of-ai-slop">when a trailer released during GDC was clearly AI-generated</a>.</p>
<p>The video - which is no longer available to view on YouTube - featured things like a single person using three hands to hold onto a spear gun, as well as fish phasing in and out of existence, an octopus with the wrong number of tentacles and a human with flippers where there should have been feet.</p>
<p>Soon after this trailer for Ark: Aquatica went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-aquatica-developer-shifts-blame-for-disastrous-ai-trailer-onto-marketing-team">Snail Games moved to distance itself from the video</a>, blaming its marketing team. "They took our assets and then ran them through an AI to animate them. That was marketing," lead game designer Matt Kohl said in March.</p>
<p>At this time, Kohl stated: "There has been no AI use in development of Aquatica."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-accusations-of-ai-slop-ark-aquaticas-release-date-trailer-is-playing-it-very-safe]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo is ending its Switch Game Voucher service in January next year, the company announced today.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers, for those unaware, are a special offer for Nintendo Switch Online members, which can be purchased in a set of two, and are used to save on games.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/GB/en/pretickets/70020000000101">members can purchase two vouchers for £84.00</a>, and redeem them against Switch games such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which retail individually for £59.99 each. Buying these games on their own would come to £119.98, but if vouchers were used to make these purchases, users would save £35.98. (Vouchers can not be used for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> titles.)</p>
<p>However, the popular service is set to end next year, on 30th January, and after this time, vouchers will no longer be available to purchase. Any vouchers purchased prior to 30th January 2026 will remain valid for 12 months, and Nintendo has said Switch titles will continue to be added to the Game Voucher catalogue throughout 2026.</p>
<p>Nintendo has not said if it will introduce a similar offer for Switch 2 games down the line. You can find more information on Switch vouchers, and the end of the service, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Nintendo-Switch-Game-Vouchers-FAQ-1560656.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=NintendoSwitchOnline|NULL|NSOGameVoucherDiscountinuationAN|m_id_SnUV8HHzNg|1560656">via Nintendo</a>. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many are disappointed to hear of Nintendo's decision to end its Switch Game Voucher service. "Well this is sad," <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1943222381528395877/quotes">reads one of many social media posts</a> following today's announcement.</p> <div>

            <p>The infamous stapler used by GameStop that ruined <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch day for some customers has now been put up for auction.</p>
<p>As we reported previously, one retail store in New York was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-ends-in-disappointment-for-some-as-major-retailer-accidentally-staples-receipts-into-consoles-screen">stapling customers' receipts to the console's packaging</a>, damaging screens in the process.</p>
<p>Now - in an offer of goodwill, but also something of a publicity stunt - GameStop has put the stapler up for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/388688595731">auction on eBay</a>, with proceeds benefitting Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. Children's Miracle Network Hospitals is a charity founded over 40 years ago, and has raised over $9bn for 170 children's hospitals.</p>

<p>The stapler is being offered alongside a Switch 2 console and a certificate of authenticity for the bundle.</p>
<p>Reads the certificate: "The black stapler used by a GameStop associate who, in a moment of launch night excitement and misjudged enthusiasm, stapled a receipt directly to a customer's new Nintendo Switch 2 box - puncturing both cardboard and screen in one swift motion. Features authentic field-use wear throughout and retired immediately from service, the stapler now stands as a retail legend born from a half-second decision."</p>
<p>The included console is also the first to be stapled, though GameStop assures the screen has been repaired. It will arrive in the original, stapled packaging, and also include the actual staple "carefully extracted and preserved".</p>
<p>As per eBay, the item is in "used" condition: "The item may have some signs of cosmetic wear, but is fully operational and functions as intended." At the time of writing, the auction stands at almost $109K, with another six days until it ends.</p>
<p>Following the launch day incident, GameStop stated staplers "have been confiscated" and that their use was "isolated to one store".</p>

<p>Despite this stapling incident, the Switch 2 launch was a success for Nintendo. With 3.5m units sold worldwide in its first four days on sale, it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware ever</a>.</p>
<p>And if children are unable to afford a Switch 2, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-president-says-children-should-engage-with-its-characters-elsewhere-if-they-cant-afford-a-switch-2">plenty of other ways for them to engage with Nintendo characters</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-ruining-stapler-now-up-for-online-charity-auction-by-gamestop]]></content:encoded>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 12.13pm: </strong>Krafton has told Eurogamer the decision to delay <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>'s early access release into 2026 was "under discussion" prior to any leadership changes at developer Unknown Worlds.</p>
<p>"During playtests for Subnautica 2, we received valuable feedback from our community that reinforced our confidence in the game's direction. At the same time, the feedback highlighted a few areas that could benefit from further refinement before release," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. "As community voices play a central role in how we shape our games, we've made the decision to give the development team more time to implement that feedback and deliver a more complete experience. As a result, Subnautica 2's Early Access launch has been rescheduled for 2026."</p>
<p>Krafton's spokesperson stated the decision was "based solely on our commitment to quality and to delivering the best possible experience for players" and affirmed it was not "influenced by any contractual or financial considerations".</p>
<p>Additionally, "the decision had already been under discussion prior to recent leadership changes at the studio," Krafton closed.</p>
<p>The original story continues below.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL 10.07am: </strong>Krafton has delayed the release of Subnautica 2, right before the game's development team was reportedly set to receive a substantial bonus for reaching previously determined revenue targets.</p>
<p>Subnautica 2 is being developed by Unknown Worlds, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">Krafton acquired in 2021</a>. Word of the game's delay comes just a week after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">Krafton ousted key members of Unknown Worlds' development and leadership team</a>, including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>.</p>

<p>The highly anticipated underwater sequel was slated for an early access release this year, however Krafton has moved that window back to an unspecified date in 2026. According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a>, this change happened mere months before Krafton was expected to pay the development team a $250m bonus, which would have applied had the studio met certain revenue targets by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Due to the game's delayed release, Unknown Worlds is now unlikely to be able to meet these targets, sources told the publication, meaning that it will miss out on the payout. According to Bloomberg, this delay was not supported by the former leadership at Unknown Worlds, who had planned to share the bonus with all studio employees.</p>
<p>Krafton stated it had delayed the release of Subnautica 2 to improve the game's quality following feedback from playtests. "It was not influenced by any contractual or financial considerations," Krafton claimed.</p>
<p>Last week, Unknown Worlds founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as chief executive officer Ted Gill, were all "pushed out" from the studio by Krafton. Following his dismissal, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/">Cleveland shared a statement on reddit</a>, where he called the events of the week "quite a shock". In this same post, he said Subnautica 2 was ready for its early access debut.</p>
<p>"And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton's hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings," Cleveland wrote.</p>
<p>"I want you to know that whatever happens to the founders, to the team and to the game, our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world... And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p>

</span></p><p>Now that Cleveland, McGuire and Gill have been removed from the company, Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis has been put in charge of Unknown Worlds. Earlier this week, Papoutsis reportedly said Krafton did not believe that Subnautica 2 was ready to be released in early access in 2025, and more content was needed.</p>
<p>In audio listened to by Bloomberg, the new studio head was further questioned about the motives for the delay beyond this, including if the $250m bonus was a factor. "It's a good question, and I would appreciate patience on this particular topic," Papoutsis replied during the meeting, adding he was not familiar with the specifics of Krafton's acquisition of Unknown Worlds or the contract itself at the present time.</p>
<p>"The desire of Krafton is to have the very best version of Subnautica 2 available for its early access," he continued. "While yes, the software that everybody worked on is in a great spot and it felt like, 'Hey we should launch this,' that wasn't where both parties aligned around." Papoutsis added: "it's never been told to me that we're making this change specifically to impact any earnout or anything like that".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Krafton for comment on today's report.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers]]></content:encoded>
