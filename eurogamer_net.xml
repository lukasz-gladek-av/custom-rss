            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> developer Papergames earned almost $1 billion in 2024.</p>
<p>As spotted by director of research and insights at Niko Partners, Daniel Ahmad, the Chinese firm has been "credited with the rise of Chinese otome games" - that is, romance games written primarily for women - both nationally and overseas.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2025/02/14/ai-boyfriends-make-chinese-gaming-entrepreneur-yao-runhao-a-billionaire/">Forbes</a>, Papergames - which also developed dating simulator game, Love and Deepspace, which boasts over six million monthly active users and is available in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean - is so successful, it generated sales of around $850 million worldwide last year, generating a $1.3bn fortune for Papergames' 37-year-old founder, Yao Runhao.</p>
<p>Though both developed and published by Papergames in China, in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, Infinity Nikki is published by Fearless, and elsewhere - including the US and Europe - Infinity Nikki is published by Infold Games.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/">Infinity Nikki - which is the fifth instalment of the dress-up game - will soon make its debut on Steam</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Infinity Nikki developer Papergames ushered in the new year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-studio-details-upcoming-optimisations-and-improvements-for-gacha-hit">word on a range of improvements and optimisations</a> it's working on for the dress-up-themed free-to-play gacha hit.</p>
<p>The plans for the open-world action-adventure were formulated after gathering "millions of suggestions" from players. A significant chunk of these fall into the "optimisations" bucket, starting with improved game performance on mobile devices - which the developer says it recognises as a "significant challenge that must be addressed".</p>
<p>Our Jessica had good things to say about Infinity Nikki in her four-star<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review"> review</a> last year, calling it a "true step forward for open-world gacha games" that "finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
