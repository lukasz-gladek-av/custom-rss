            <p>Nintendo is collaborating with Sea Life UK to tour an interactive, live <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> experience.</p>
<p>The event will allow guests to "discover incredible marine life alongside some of the game's characters" as they explore the 'Sea Life Islands', meet Tom Nook and Isabelle, and collect character stamps.</p>
<p>There will also be a fossil dig to reveal the ancestors of marine life, as well as a search for Gulliver who washed up on the island's beaches.</p>

<p>Animal Cross: New Horizons merchandise will also be sold in aquarium stores.</p>
<p>It begins next month in Sea Life Manchester, before continuing in Sea Life Birmingham, Sea Life Brighton, Sea Life London, and Sea Life Chessington World of Adventures, with the following dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sea Life Manchester: 8th Feb – 9th March 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Birmingham: 12th April - 5th May 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Brighton: 24th May - 15th June 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life London: 30th June - 27th July 2025</li>
<li>Sea Life Chessington World of Adventures: 1st – 31st August 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>Sea Life UK is part of Merlin Entertainments, which also owns theme parks Alton Towers and Thorpe Park.</p>
<p>However, it appears other aquariums in the UK - including Scotland - aren't included.</p>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons has of course proven exceptionally popular since its release on Switch in 2020. By 2022 it had become the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-now-the-best-selling-game-ever-in-japan"> best-selling game ever in Japan</a>.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a remaster of 2010's Wii release, which was developed by Retro Studios and published by Nintendo. However, Retro Studios is not the team behind the upcoming remaster, with porting duties instead being handled by Forever Entertainment.</p>
<p>In the new game's credits, Forever Entertainment is front and centre, however Nintendo has omitted the original development team from the credits. Instead, the credits simply state the HD remaster was "based on the work of the original development staff", as you can see in the images below (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/retro-staff-credits-removed-from-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-forever-entertainment-confirmed-as-devs">Nintendo Life</a>).</p>

<p>This is not the first time an original game's staff have been left out of the credits by Nintendo. The same thing happened in 2023, when former Retro Studios engineer Zoid Kirsch said he was "let down" by the lack of individual credits in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>.</p>

            <p>Retro immersive-sim Fortune's Run has had its early access development paused due to its sole developer being sentenced to prison.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1692240/announcements/detail/532087801681805319">update on Steam</a>, developer Dizzie explained why the game's other developer left the project and admitted to being sentenced to three years in prison, meaning development is "imploding".</p>
<p>Dizzie doesn't explain the nature of the crime, though the developer "lived a very different life" prior to working on this project. The post does specify, though, that the crime was not sexual in nature and the other developer was not involved.</p>

<p>"I've been sentenced to prison for the next three years," wrote Dizzie. "It's a long story, but I've lived a very different life before I was a game developer, and I wasn't living very well. My case is about five years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I've been working on this.</p><p>"I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I'm going away next month. It's a shame, but it's the consequences of my actions. I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life."</p>
<p>The developer said the game "isn't totally dead" but "it's unclear what will happen".</p>
<p>And without the other developer, development on Fortune's Run will be "completely interrupted" until Dizzie is released. She left the project after recovering from a botched surgery, Dizzie explained. "If you want to accuse me of something, accuse me of stressing her out with my legal problems and my crazy work schedule," said Dizzie.</p>
<p>The post continues: "I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there's absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it's just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time."</p><p>Due to game sales, Dizzie will be able to afford rent once released, so there's a chance the game could be completed. "I am extremely passionate about this stuff and I'm never going to stop making games. I'd like to finish this one, but I don't know what will happen," said Dizzie.</p>
<p>The post comes alongside a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240/view/532087801681805320">new major update</a> to Fortune's Run as part of its early access.</p>

            <p>An attorney for Nintendo has discussed the company's stance on emulation and what it considers to be illegal, according to Japanese law.</p>
<p>Koji Nishiura, patent attorney and deputy general manager of Nintendo's intellectual property department, spoke on behalf of the company at a joint lecture on "The Importance of Intellectual Property Rights in the Game Industry", which was hosted by Japan's Association of Copyright for Computer Software at the Tokyo eSports Festa 2025 (<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/kikakuthetower/250112a#i-2">Denfaminicogamer</a>, via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-attorney-weighs-in-on-what-makes-emulators-illegal/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"To begin with, are emulators illegal or not?" posed Nishiura. "This is a point often debated. While you can't immediately claim that an emulator is illegal in itself, it can become illegal depending on how it's used."</p>

</div><figcaption>Everything we learned this week about Switch 2<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1BtAZoo1S0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>One example of illegal use is if an emulator copies a programme belonging to the game device it's imitating, which would be copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Another is if an emulator can disable security mechanisms like encryption (or "technical protection measures", as they're legally known), which would violate Japan's Unfair Competition Prevention Act. Nishiura added that outside of Japan this would be stipulated in copyright law.</p>
<p>Nishiura specified this point is why Nintendo has filed lawsuits and issued warnings over several Switch emulators, due to disabling Nintendo's "technical protection measures".</p>
<p>A further violation would be if an emulator contains links to sources to download pirated games, what's known as a "reach app" in Japanese law and is considered a copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Nishiura also emphasised the use of emulators is a problem for all developers making software for Nintendo devices, which is why the company is strengthening measures against such illegal tools.</p>
<p>Just last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-switch-emulator-creator-for-facilitating-piracy-at-a-colossal-scale">Nintendo sued the creators of Switch emulator Yuzu</a> as it claimed over a million copies of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> were pirated ahead of release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">Yuzu was then shut down</a> by its developers Tropical Haze and agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4m.</p><p>Also last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-emulator-pizza-emulators-pulls-its-apps-from-google-play-store">Game Boy emulator Pizza Emulators</a> was pulled from the Google Play store, though there was no mention of a Nintendo settlement. A month later, another Nintendo emulator - the Delta app - was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-game-emulator-currently-top-free-download-on-iphone-app-store">top free download on the iPhone App Store</a> and it remains available today.</p>
<p>In further Nintendo news, the company has also requested players not use "unauthorised services" to access online services. Posted the <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1879332711451795501">Japanese Nintendo account</a>: "We have confirmed the existence of unauthorised services that replace functions such as online play for the Wii U, which ended service on April 9, 2024. Please refrain from using such services as they may pose unexpected security risks."</p>
<p>After Nintendo shut down Wii U and 3DS online servers last April, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-day-after-nintendos-wii-u-server-shutdown-fans-are-using-an-unofficial-trick-to-play-multiplayer-online">players brought the functionality back online just a day later</a> thanks to fan collective Pretendo.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rocksteady has released the final piece of content for its beleaguered live-service game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>.</p>
<p>Back in December, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">studio confirmed the fourth season would be the game's last</a>, and now its final chapter has been released. Season four, chapter eight went live last night, and in the process wrapped up the story of Harley Quinn and her fellow band of misfits as they sought to stop the conniving Brainiac from causing mishap here, there and everywhere.</p>
<p>It also gave players clarification on exactly what was going on with DC's heroes, such as Batman. <strong>Please be aware of spoilers for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League season four, episode eight below</strong>.</p>

</figure>
<p>The final chapter of the game closes with a 2D animated cinematic narrated by Harley Quinn, revealing that - shocker - those members of the Justice League that were popped off earlier in the game were in fact clones. So yes, the actual Batman is still alive and well. In fact, it is the caped crusader who delivers that final blow to Brainiac. The mini bombs that were implanted in the Suicide Squad's heads at the start of the game are then disabled, and Brainiac gets delivered to Waller.</p>
<p>However, many players are, alas, pretty disappointed by how the ending of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ultimately played out.</p>
<p>"What was the point of the game if they are all alive," reads one comment on a video showcasing the final scenes. Another added: "Because of some small clues, the Justice League not actually being dead was teased since the launch of the game. However this still feels cheap as hell."</p><p>Some are more forgiving than others, though. "Honestly that's all I care about is seeing (Batman Alive)," one wrote. Another reasoned given some of the backlash Rocksteady faced early on in the game's life, bringing the Justice League back from the supposed dead was a good move.</p>

<p>While it won't be receiving any new content from here on, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League will still remain playable in both online and the recently released offline mode, Rocksteady has said.</p>
<p>"All online features will continue to be available after Season 4, so players will still be able to enjoy co-op with friends, as well as all previous seasonal/episodic content. An offline mode will also be available as part of the Season 4 update, giving players the option to experience the main campaign and all seasonal story mission content without an internet connection," reads the season's <a href="https://dcgamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/36121518094995-SEASON-4-FAQ">FAQ page</a>. The developer added any remaining LutherCoin will "continue to be available after Season 4", while also confirming the in-game store will also continue to function.</p>

<p>Soon after release, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. A report then followed, which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>
<p>Just before the end of 2024, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League developer suffered another round of layoffs</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>NetEase has confirmed Marvel Rivals will receive a new hero every month and a half, but won't be adding enforced roles.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/">Metro</a>, game director Guangyun Chen was asked about the cadence of heroes joining the game.</p>
<p>"Every season we'll be rolling out fresh seasonal stories, new maps, and new heroes," said Chen. "We'll actually be breaking down each season into two halves. The length of one season is three months. And for each half of the season, we will introduce a new hero. We just eventually want to continue to enhance the experience, and, you know, keep everyone excited in our community."</p>

<p>Chen also discussed why the team has not included enforced role lock - setting a limit on what class types can be in a team, for a balanced spread of healers, tanks, attackers - which is something the community wishes to change.</p>
<p>It appears the team won't be altering this, but will instead provide new possibilities with the team-up mechanic.</p>
<p>"At its core, it's really about the game balance," said Chen. "So, what we want to offer is more line-up or more team comp possibilities through our hero design and our team-up mechanic. So, we'll be taking a little bit more of a Marvel-inspired approach.</p><p>"It's all about giving the players the freedom to experiment and find their unique strategies, as we've seen in many games and streams. Post-launch, people have been exploring an indefinite amount of team compositions, and we're excited about what's coming, we believe no role queue will lead to a richer gaming experience for everyone."</p>
<p>Game balance will also continue to be scrutinised. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-season-1-will-nerf-some-of-the-most-dominant-characters">Season One has brought a number of balance changes</a> to nerf some of the most popular characters, as NetEase has released a Hero Hot List to show the most frequently chosen heroes.</p>
<p>"After the launch, we've been keeping a close eye on the game's environment and balance," said Chen. "Moving forward, we will be looking at hero pick rates and win rates in different scenarios. Once we have some more detailed analysis and through thoughtful consideration, we'll definitely make necessary balances and adjustments.</p>
<p>"It's all about creating a good experience for our players. It hasn't been that long since our launch, so we're going to continue to monitor everything and make sure everything feels right."</p>
<p>The hero shooter's first season also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-update-kills-mods-removing-cheats-skins-and-19-inches-of-venom">briefly put an end to mods on PC</a>, to prevent custom skins, FPS boosts and potential cheats. However, modders quickly found a way to use them once again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
