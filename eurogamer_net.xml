            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall Interactive has teased a new update to the game is on the way, as a "thank you" to fans.</p>
<p>While story details remain slim, game director Guillaume Broche told Eurogamer: "You can expect a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well". His hints suggest it'll focus on adorable mount Esquie, who's become a bit of a meme within the game's community.</p>
<p>News of the update arrives as the game reaches a new sales milestone: it's now sold over 5m copies worldwide across all formats.</p>

<p>"We are working on a big 'thank you' update for the game actively, that we will release when it's ready," said Broche. "We want to prepare an update to say a big thank you to our players, because it's thanks to our players that we are in such a comfortable situation now. They brought us so much emotion and gave us so much love in return for the game that we want to address that and make a big thank you update with new content, new enemies, new stuff to do for every type of player."</p><p>He continued: "It's not a super big DLC extension with hours of content. It's more a thank you gift from us. You will have quite a few things to do and collectâ€¦[and] some quality of life [additions] that are very highly requested by the community."</p>

            <p>Beloved 2016 Co-op platformer Pico Park: Classic Edition has accidentally been made free on Steam permanently by the developer Tecopark. This is thanks to Steam's limits to how many times developers can make games free before changing them back to premium titles.</p>
<p>Pico Park Classic Edition, which has been free on Steam for some time, recently got updated with online multiplayer support, a visual overhaul, and other quality of life features. With this update, the developer decided to charge a small fee for the game.</p>
<p>Tecopark wrote earlier this year: "I kept Classic Edition because it's Steam-exclusive and supports 10 players. Since I'm doing it anyway, I'll update it with online support. I might charge a small fee for it. I recommend installing it while it's still free." This update was implemented in September, but Tecopark decided to leave it free for one last week before charging for the new and improved title.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the 5th October, and Tecopark realised they could no longer charge money for Piko Park: Classic Edition, meaning the game would remain free forever on Steam even with this substantial update. Tecopark posted on X: "I tried updating it to make it paid again, but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, you can never go back to paid! Ugh If you play this free version and have fun, try the series too. It's weird that this one can be played with 10 people, huh? Ugh."</p><p>They urged fans to play the other Pico Park games -  Pico Park and Pico Park 2. Both games share Pico Park: Classic Edition's quality and quirky nature, and are great co-operative games to play with friends and family. So given this unfortunate situation, why not do exactly that?</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-launches-with-100-arcane-bundle-shocking-early-access-players-but-is-it-worth-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-launches-with-100-arcane-bundle-shocking-early-access-players-but-is-it-worth-it.1319494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>2XKO is out in early access, bringing with it seasonal content, two new characters in Teemo and Warwick, and a suite of cosmetics for players to unlock and buy. As a free-to-play game this isn't unusual, however the game's most expensive bundle has some players wincing.</p>
<p>The reason why comes down to the cost. 2XKO's Arcane-themed Ultra Starter Edition is available to buy for $99.99 / â‚¬99.99 / Â£84.99 / CA $139.99. Now, that's a lot of money, but for that amount you get three "Mythic" tier skins with a bunch of alternate colours, an exclusive finisher, eight champion unlock tokens, a player card, avatar cosmetic bundles, and 5,000 KO points (in-game currency). </p>
<p>It's worth noting that this is the price of the most expensive version of the bundle. The standard version of the starter bundle costs $29.99 and comes with four champion unlock tokens, a player card, and enough in-game currency to buy one legendary skin from the shop. However, if you want those Arcane skins, you'll have to fork out the full price. There is no other way to get them, you'll have to pay for the Ultra version.</p>

<p>The reaction online from fighting game players seeing this has been passionate to say the least. <a href="https://x.com/vicwingly/status/1975626557306835417">Some have expressed shock at the bundle's price</a>, others <a href="https://x.com/Spideraxe30/status/1975660887055683867">are expressing disappointment that they aren't able to buy the Arcane skins separately from the bundle itself</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TimeBombFanatic/status/1975780591242219776">while some are totally fine with spending that much money on these fancy cosmetics</a>.</p><p>It's an interesting twist on an ongoing point of discussion within the fighting game genre. Dedicated players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/jan/06/sf6-costumes-silence-displeasure/">have been begging for more consistent character skin releases to support the game</a>, rather than the onslaught of Battle Hub cosmetics that game has received since launch.</p>
<p>For many fighting game players 2XKO is their introduction to modern free-to-play microtransaction models, and as eye-watering as $99.99 is to see pop up on your screen, it's not an alien concept to Riot Games. The company has been supporting Valorant with expensive gun skins ever since that shooter's launch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> has been experimenting with gacha and super-expensive Ahri and Jhin skins.</p>
<p>The question is, is this bundle worth it? Well, an obvious point to make first is that some people will simply not be able to afford $100 for an in-game bundle regardless of its value proposition. For those who can, a lot of the value comes down to how much you like the exclusive Arcane skins. I, for example, don't care for Vi, Jinx, or Ekko, so it's not much of a prize.</p>
<p>The in-game currency you get as part of the Ultra version of the bundle comes to about 2.5 legendary skins in the shop, or you can grab the Ultra version of the current battle pass and be left with 1,500 KO points left. These skins <em>are</em> cool, and the battle pass is full of all manner of quirky customisation options, but again you're contesting with the $100 shock factor here. Also, funnily enough, your remainging 1,500 points if you choose to buy the battle pass isn't quite enough for a legendary skin, so you'll have to buy more premium currency to use up what you've got left in your 2XKO wallet, at the expense of your real-world wallet.</p><p>Ultimately there's not too much you can do to tear away the shock of a $100 price point on any in-game bundle, but those in favour of this price point will of course argue it's not meant to be bought by everyone. It's meant to be an illustrious expense for super fans (or whales). This is true of course, but with three more bundles set to release before 2026, one has to wonder how much money people will have to spend to get everything Riot is selling here.</p>
