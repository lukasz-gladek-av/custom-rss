            <p>The Metal Gear Solid series has sold over 65.5m copies worldwide, according to a new business post by Konami.</p>
<p>The post, <a href="https://www.konami.com/corporate/en/business/digitalentertainment.html">published on the official Konami corporate website</a>, breaks down a selection of milestone achievements for its various IPs. The crowning achievement of this breakdown is the Metal Gear Series, which has surpassed 65.5m total worldwide sales. However, other big series from the Japanese games company have also taken centre stage alongside the stealth action series.</p>
<p>These include the Pawafuru Puroyakyu series, which has passed 26.3m sales, YuGiOh games at 32.5m, Momotaro Dentetsu at 19.9m, and Silent Hill which has made it past 14m sales. Of of these stats run up to the end of December 2025.</p>

<p>The page also includes some pretty eye-watering download stats for various mobile and console games. eFootball has apparently surpassed 950m total sales since 1995, and YuGiOh Duel Links is no slouch either, passing 150m downloads since its release in 2016.</p><p>As a page aimed at impressing investors, there are additional interesting tidbits included in paragraphs meant to sell Konami as a forward-thinking company. This includes a descriptor of Konami as "a leading company in esports", thanks to YuGiOh, eFootball, and Pawafuru Puroyakyu.</p>
<p>The company also claims it will: "continue to take on challenges of the latest innovation by utilizing new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), fifth/sixth generation mobile communications (5G/6G), cloud technology, WEB3, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>, and VR/AR."</p>
<p><a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2026/en0129_cf84s6.pdf">Looking at Konami's latest quarterly report</a>, it certainly seems as though the company is doing well. It saw a 16.3 percent increase in income from its digital entertainment sector compared to last year, and a total revenue increase of 13.6 percent.</p>

            <p>The first script for an upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> film adaptation based on Hazelight's game of the same name has been penned.</p>
<p>It was first announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-film-in-the-works-as-bidding-war-for-rights-begins">Split Fiction, which sees two aspiring writers trapped in simulations of their own stories, was going to be getting the movie treatment</a> last year. At this time, sources said media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - was in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Soon after, it was revealed that Euphoria and Eden actor Sydney Sweeney would star in the upcoming film, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Deadpool screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick would handle the script</a>. And, handle the script, they appear to have done.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DTw4CbhDZZT/">Moviezine</a>, Hazelight studio head Josef Fares said he had seen the first finalised script for the Split Fiction film. "I got the first version of the script today but you know, there's so much talk in Hollywood. I usually say it like this 'I believe it when I see it'," Fares said (translated by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/">Dexerto</a>).</p>
<p>Fares added he had chatted with a "hyped" Sweeney about the project, as well. "I've had a meeting with her and she seems super chill," he said.</p>
<p>But, while she may be hyped, there is still no word on when we can expect filming for Split Fiction to actually kick off. It could be some time, given how busy Sweeney's schedule is. As well as Split Fiction, the actor is also attached to Colman Domingo's romantic drama Scandalous, which is set to shoot early this year, and a Gundam adaptation. On the other side of the camera, it has been reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-outrun-getting-movie-adaptation-from-michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney">Sweeney is set to produce an adaptation of OutRun</a>. </p>

<p>Split Fiction isn't the only Hazelight game getting the film treatment. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>However, little has been heard of this particular project since, and last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

            <p>According to Walton Goggins, we can all expect something "profound" to happen in the Fallout season two finale next week.</p>
<p>Goggins, who plays The Ghoul/Cooper Howard in Amazon's Fallout adaptation, has said his character's motivations have always been about finding his family. Of course, over the course of two seasons, we have seen the highs and lows of Cooper Howard's family life with his wife Barb and daughter Janey via flashbacks. Meanwhile, in the present day, a now Ghoul-ified Cooper is still searching for his family, and has been for centuries.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>So, will he find them in the final episode of Fallout season two? Well, that remains to be seen, though Goggins has teased something "profound" happening not just to The Ghoul, but to the sweeter than sweet vault dweller Lucy as well.</p>
<p>"I can tell you that in episode eight, without giving something away to your audience, something profound happens for both the Ghoul and Lucy that would also be my favourite, but we can't talk about that," he told <a href="https://ew.com/fallout-season-2-finale-cover-story-exclusive-11893674">EW</a> ahead of the Fallout finale.</p><p>Goggins added viewers will also learn more about what Cooper was doing at that birthday party, way back at the start of season one. "I mean, the whole first seven minutes of this experience in season one was about [Cooper being] a guy at a birthday party. Well, how did he get to that birthday party? What happened? It's all leading somewhere," the actor said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to Lucy MacLean actor Ella Purnell, the second season's finale will be a "conflicted, explosive and character-defining" cocktail for the naive and trusting vault dweller.</p>
<p>"You get to see Lucy be a real human with real human problems, and I think at times, because of her strength and her optimism, it doesn't always feel that way with her," Purnell explained. "But in this moment, and that maybe says a lot about what her choices and decisions are, she's flawed and she's actually just getting more and more human."</p>
<p>Ooh, curious!</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-latest-episode-delivers-another-cameo-for-fans-of-the-video-game-series">many weeks of chaos and cameos</a>, Fallout season two will wrap up on 3rd February. Meanwhile, the third season of Fallout is already being written, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">filming expected to kick off this May</a>. Ghoul blimey, and all that.</p>

            <p>Word on the internet is that Nintendo will be holding another reveals-based livestream next week, and it'll be a Partner Showcase no less.</p>
<p>According to various sources, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016969052132962528">including NatetheHate and GameXplain</a>, the showcase will be focused on third party studios publishing on Nintendo systems, with NatetheHate going one step further stating it'll be hosted on the 5th February.</p>
<p>While these are folks who have a history of calling these sorts of events right in the past, they are still rumours and should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Still, it's been some time since we had a Nintendo Partner Direct. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">Back in July of last year</a>, games like Monster Hunter Stories, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler-2">Octopath Traveler 2</a>, and more were shown off in quite the jam-packed occasion. Leading into 2026, there are plenty of games lined-up for release that we've not actually seen much of yet, including 007: First Light, and The Duskbloods. That last one being especially silent as of late.</p><p>Looking at the reactions to these rumours, there's excitement yet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qqj4qr/natethehate_next_weeks_nintendo_direct_is_a/">but also hunger for a Nintendo Direct focused on first-party releases</a>. It's clear to see why, with a new Fire Emblem on the way as well as a new Mario Tennis, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> is looking strong on that front too.</p>
<p>What do you reckon? Will we see a Partner Direct next week? If so, what do you want to see in it?</p>

            <p>A report from GDC has shed a rather sobering light on the state of things, revealing that one third of surveyed US workers within the industry were laid off in the last two years.</p>
<p>According to GDC's <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/2026-SOTI">2026 State of the Game Industry Report</a> - which included data provided by over 2300 respondents including developers, producers, marketers, executives and investors - 33 percent of respondents in the US had been laid off over the past 24 months.</p>
<p>Looking further afield to include other countries as well, 28 percent of those surveyed from within the industry reported they had been laid off in the same period, which is over a quarter of all respondents.</p>

<p>17 percent of those surveyed, meanwhile, stated they had been laid off in the past 12 months. "The total number of layoffs could be higher, though, as some may have experienced more than one layoff in the past two years," the report notes.</p><p>Almost half of the respondents - 48 percent - said they were still looking for employment after being laid off. Of those who were laid off one to two years ago, 36 percent said they still haven't found other games industry employment.</p>
<p>"Over 450 respondents reported experiencing an acquisition, closure, or merger in the past year. About 31 percent of those people also reported being laid off, though it's unclear how many were a direct result of said company changes," the report reads. "AAA and older indie respondents were more likely to report their companies were acquired, and newer indie studios were more likely to close."</p>
<p>In terms of professions within the industry, game designers reported the highest percentage of layoffs over the last 12 months, with 20 percent of those surveyed affected. This percentage includes those in narrative design.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, those working in business operations and services reported the lowest percentage of layoffs, with eight percent affected.</p>
<p>As to the reason why these layoffs happened, 43 percent cited company restructuring, while 32 percent said it was due to a project getting cancelled. Budget cuts and market conditions were also cited by 38 percent of respondents.</p>
<p>"Leadership failed to see that the Covid-era boom was not permanent, [and the] company went on an acquisition spree before being acquired," one respondent told GDC. "Now, money is a lot tighter because the goldfish with the money want returns yesterday so they can funnel it into the current fad (genAI)."</p><p>Another respondent, who was laid off less than 12 months ago, said: "Executives who have never actually worked as a dev are pulling up the boards on their ships, throwing people overboard, and expecting these scuttled ghost ships to keep making them infinite money."</p>
<p>Some respondents added their employers were working to retain their staff, "in spite of ongoing challenges".</p>

<p>Layoffs and closures remain an ongoing issue in 2026. Earlier this month, Ubisoft shocked everyone when it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">"major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, back in 2024, Chris Dring wrote an in-depth feature about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">everything going on with layoffs in the video games industry</a>.</p>

            <p>The team over at Wildlight has released an update for its live-service hero shooter, Highguard.</p>
<p>This update adds a number of "highly" requested features from its community, including a new crouch toggle option, field of view sliders on console and - importantly - improved stability. According to the studio, crashes have been reduced by 90 percent thanks to this update.</p>

<p>You can check out the full patch notes for Highguard below:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Settings Improvements</strong></p>
<p><em>Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localised in languages other than English. Properly localised settings will be prepared for a future patch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Game Input Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to set Crouch to Hold or Toggle for all platforms.</li>
<li>Added the ability to set Aim Down Sights to Hold or Toggle for PC only (for now).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Toggling into ADS then tapping Sprint (shift on PC, left stick on controller) will swap your scope. This is disorienting on controller. PC players are recommended to rebind scope swap if using Toggle ADS. We will continue to look into adding this for console players who can’t rebind buttons yet, but we will need more time.</em></p>
<p><strong>Video Settings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.</li>
<li>Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.</li>
<li>Low shadow setting now also disables volumetric fog.</li>
<li>Added a new "View Distance Quality" setting that controls skeletal mesh LODs, which can be another useful control to tune GPU and CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Players now have the ability to toggle the following features on or off, irrespective of other quality options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anisotropic Materials</li>
<li>Chromatic Aberration</li>
<li>Bloom</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Motion Blur and Depth of Field need more testing to disable safely. Look for these options very soon.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>DLSS users now have the ability to select a DLSS preset.<em> More presets and better descriptions are coming in the next patch.</em></li>
<li>Players can now select Off to disable Global Illumination entirely.</li>
<li>Resolved an engine bug which could inadvertently throttled laptop users to 60 FPS regardless of frame rate settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crash and Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>This patch resolves crashes that could occur in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leaving a match on PS5 with an unexpected input state.</li>
<li>Loading into matches on machines with slower storage devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>A number of other bugs related to online user presence and matchmaking were also resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friends now appear online correctly after accepting requests, and Xbox presence updates properly. Major crash fixes have reduced crashes by 90 percent, significantly improving stability.</li>
<li>Friend status is fixed - players now appear online correctly and Xbox presence updates reliably. Our top crash issues are gone resulting in a 90 percent crash reduction.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>And that's your lot for now.</p>

<p>Highguard was announced last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">closing out Geoff Keighley's trailer-filled The Game Awards extravaganza</a> (which did also feature some awards). Coming from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-hits-almost-100k-concurrent-pc-players-on-launch-but-struggles-with-early-negative-steam-reviews">Highguard quickly had a large influx of players on its release earlier this week</a>, however there were a few complaints as well, with many disappointed with areas such as map size and the 3v3 game format.</p>
<p>Since this slightly rocky debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-developers-defend-as-complaints-pile-up">other developers across the industry have voiced their support for Highguard</a>, with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded studio 1047 Games stating: "No game is perfect on day one."</p>

<p>Last night, it was announced that Severance actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson will portray the Norse God of Thunder, Thor. "A mountain of a man who has weathered many a battle in his time, but whose actions in a war fought long ago now haunt his waking hours," reads Thor's character description.</p>
<p>As in 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, Amazon's live-action Thor is "now but a shadow of his former self", and has turned to alcohol in an attempt to drown out his demons. "Keeping his wife and children at arm's length has only deepened his isolation, but the power (and danger) of the God of Thunder is still there just beneath the surface," the <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/">description ends</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Thor, Homeland and Princess Bride actor Mandy Patinkin has been announced as the show's "most powerful Aesir god", Odin. "Odin, the All-Father, is not physically imposing or particularly god-like: but looks can be deceiving," reads his <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/mandy-patinkin-god-of-war-odin-1236644947/">God of War character description</a>, adding that Odin is a "patriarch who leads with an iron fist, and an unrivaled seeker of knowledge".</p><p>Odin - who is the father of Thor - is "paranoid, manipulative, and dangerous", and will serve as "a formidable antagonist" to God of War's lead, Kratos. The Aesir god will do "anything to try and prevent Ragnarök, the Norse end of days".</p>

Meanwhile, behind the camera, Amazon's God of War adaptation includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer">former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D.

Through their adventures, Kratos tries to teach his son to be a better god, while Atreus tries to teach his father how to be a better human," reads the show's official logline. I wonder when we will hear who will play Atreus…?</p>
