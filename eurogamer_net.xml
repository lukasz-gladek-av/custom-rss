            <p>
Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot will appear in court in October in relation to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-on-ubisoft-reveals-more-shocking-sexual-harassment-allegations">sexual harassment allegations that emerged back in 2020</a> against a number of employees.
</p>
<p>
Back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-senior-ubisoft-staff-convicted-in-french-harassment-case-receive-fines-and-suspended-sentences">three former senior Ubisoft employees received suspended prison sentences and fines</a> after being found guilty of harassment. All three employees left the company in 2020 as part of a wave of resignations and dismissals.
</p>
<p>
However, as reported by French outlet <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/affaire-de-harcelement-chez-ubisoft-le-pdg-yves-guillemot-convoque-devant-la-justice_AN-202508220570.html">BFM TV</a>, a subpoena has been issued against Guillemot in relation to this case, meaning he'll have to appear before the Bobigny court (Seine-Saint-Denis) on 1st October.
</p>
<p>
The summons for Guillemot was filed by the Solidaires Informatiques union and four individuals, "the same civil parties" as in the previous trial resolved in June.
</p>
<p>
Following an investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office, no criminal proceedings will be held against Ubisoft or its management, which was confirmed during the closing arguments at the hearing in June.
</p>
<p>
"Our top priority is to ensure the absolute protection of the physical and moral integrity of its employees, through a policy of prevention and zero tolerance with regard to sexual or moral harassment, sexist behavior, assault, insult, or discrimination of any kind," said Cecile Russeil, executive vice president of Ubisoft.
</p><p>
A union representative from Solidaires Informatiques has confirmed the summons was sent last month, but Guillemot was absent and his family refused to take his place. HR director Marie Derain and Ubisoft as a legal entity have also been summoned.
</p>
<p>
In 2020, following reports of harassment at the studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-weeks-of-devastating-sexual-harassment-allegations-ubisoft-boss-yves-guillemot-is-asked-how-much-he-knew">Guillemot was asked how much he knew of the issues taking place</a>. "It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and did not live up to Ubisoft's shared values," he said. "I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will. I will continue to run and transform Ubisoft to face today's and tomorrow's challenges."

            <p>The next character in Riot Games' upcoming 2v2 fighting game - 2XKO - has been leaked on <a href="https://support-2xko.riotgames.com/hc/en-us">the official Riot Games support website</a>. We're going to say who they are in following paragraphs, heads up.</p>
<p>Art for the Blitzcrank was spotted by keen-eyed fans early this morning for the 2XKO, front and centre as both the the star of the banner at the top of the dedicated 2XKO page, as well as the character used on the 2XKO widget when browsing the wider Riot Games support website.</p>
<p>As of writing the art is still live on the support website. Blitzcrank would be the ninth character to come to 2XKO, though no word on when he'll be implemented has been announced, officially or otherwise.</p>

<p>2XKO is set to launch into closed beta on 9th September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/was-riot-games-fighting-game-2xko-revealed-too-early-interview">marking the end of a lengthy development journey</a>. In recent months, online sentiment around the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-interview-eight-characters-enough-launch-roster">has been tinged somewhat due to a demand for a wider variety of weirder characters</a>. Blitzcrank, a big goofy robot, certainly fits the freakier category.</p><div>

<p>There's a hint of irony here, given one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>' most legendary support champions being revealed early via the support website. As for when we'll see Blitzcrank revealed properly? Well, one would hope that with official Riot Games websites locked and loaded with official assets, it could be around the corner, but that's entirely speculation. Who knows, maybe he'll be a surprise addition to the closed beta?</p>
<p>What do you think of Blitzcrank? Let us know.</p>

            <p>
Demonschool, the forthcoming RPG Eurogamer described as "Persona meets Buffy", has been delayed once again due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">surprise release of Hollow Knight Silksong</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-inspired-demonschool-gets-release-window-following-last-years-delay">originally intended for a release last year</a>, but was delayed until 3rd September this year. Now it's moved back to 19th November thanks to "brutal" market conditions.
</p>
<p>
The decision appears to have been made by publisher Ysbryd Games. "With 11 years under our belt as an indie publisher, we at Ysbryd Games are reasonably qualified to say that any point of 2025 on balance, has been or will be as brutal as market conditions can get when it comes to releasing a game," it wrote in a statement on social media. "Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."

<p>
Visibility is of prime importance for the publisher; as such "we would not be doing our game any favours by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red". Instead, it wants to allow Silksong to have its moment, and for Demonschool to follow.
</p><p>
The publisher has also confirmed there will be no more delays after this. Until release, more time will be spent polishing and enhancing the game experience, with more endings and minigames originally planned for a post-release patch to be included at launch.

I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-is-persona-meets-buffy-and-i-love-its-90s-vibes">hands-on with a demo of Demonschool</a> last year and came away impressed by its haunted university setting, graphic style, and turn-based combat.
