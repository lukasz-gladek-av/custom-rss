            <p>On the reveal of Horizon Steel Frontiers yesterday, there was one big question on everyone's lips. Why is it not coming to PlayStation?</p>
<p>After all, Horizon is one of Sony's most prolific first party franchises, with over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">30m copies sold across PC and PlayStation consoles</a>. But, despite this, the upcoming Horizon MMO from NCSoft is currently only slated for PC and mobile. What gives?</p>

<p>In the time since Horizon Steel Frontiers' announcement, executive producer Lee Song has shed a bit more light on why NCSoft's game isn't coming to PlayStation, suggesting excluding the platform was not NCSoft's decision.</p>
<p>The Horizon Steel Frontiers developer told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/960/G096074/20251113059/">4Gamer</a> that a lack of PS5 release was the "most comment reaction" following the announcement (via machine translation). He added that NCSoft has "no reason" not to bring its game to a PlayStation console.</p>
<p>"We would like to do it," the developer continued, "but it is not something we can decide on our own, so we would like to proceed with discussions."</p>
<p>It's been speculated, therefore, it may be Sony's decision not to release the game on PlayStation. Eurogamer has asked Sony for further comment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Horizon Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system" on the game's eventual release.</p>
<p>In related news, earlier today Guerrilla's studio head celebrated Steel Frontiers' announcement with the revelation that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-horizon-series-was-always-thought-about-as-a-multiplayer-game-says-studio-head-following-mmo-announcement">team had always imagined Horizon as a multiplayer game</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> players have come together to unlock the Stella Montis map through a community donation event, which they completed in just one day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-update-opens-up-the-north-line-towards-new-stella-montis-map-in-massive-community-event">The event</a> required Arc Raiders players to donate a substantial amount of basic resources to an in-universe effort to unblock the North Line. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-first-major-community-unlock-event-has-been-made-harder-mere-hours-after-launch-as-players-were-completing-it-too-fast">It was made increasingly difficult after the community was blasting through it in a matter of hours</a>, though even this change by the developers didn't manage to hold off the Arc Raiders community for long.</p>
<p>As of writing, players are playing their first few games in Stella Montis and discovering all the secrets hidden on this new map. Not so secret are the new Arc enemies, which includes the Matriarch. This giant robot is already chewing through players with an overly aggressive onslaught of varying attacks.</p>

<p>It shouldn't come as a surprise that the event was finished so quickly, considering how many people have flocked to it over the past few weeks. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms">The game has shot past four million copies sold</a> according to Nexon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars">and continues to surpass its own Steam concurrent user peak as time goes on</a>.</p><p>This substantial update comes shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-has-secretly-had-duo-queue-for-days-will-be-fully-supported-going-forward">duo queue was suddenly added to the game</a>, following fierce demand from players who weren't happy playing either solo or as a full squad of three. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">Whether or not players will remain friendly in Stella Montis</a>, or will give into their murderous desires as new loot is up for grabs, will be determined this weekend.</p>
<p>If you're curious about Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">why not check out Eurogamer's review</a>! In it reviewer Rick Lane summarises the game as such: "Rich PvE combat and an unusually friendly community make Arc Raiders a more approachable extraction shooter than most, but Embark Studios' continued use of AI voice generation is a black mark against its reputation."</p>
