            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans are saying "no to AI slop" after some believe they've discovered AI-generated images in Epic's tentpole battle royale game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/say_no_to_ai_slop_a_billiondollar_company_should/">Reddit post</a> entitled "Say 'No' to AI slop, a billion-dollar company should have no problem supporting real artists for real art", Fortnite players have shared their thoughts on a number of alleged AI-generated images, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk1tw7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">in-game</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrkcw00/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">posters</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk6ski/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sprays</a>, with some suggesting a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk2fc9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">boycott</a>.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pahvnv/is_this_chapter_7_art_ai_generated/">Reddit post</a> shares an in-game poster showing what's thought to be a Yeti with nine toes.</p>

</span></p><p>The discoveries come just days after Epic boss Tim Sweeney suggested requiring developers to disclose whether or not generative AI has been used during the making of a game "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">makes no sense</a>".</p>
<p>Sweeney made the remarks responding to a social media post by a former Unreal Engine developer who <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1993757796723306612">uses generative AI in his motion capture work</a> and suggested "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more".</p><p>"Agreed," agreed Sweeney. "The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-whats-coming-to-fortnite-chapter-7-pacific-break">10.5 million players logged on to see Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale</a>, with another three million clocking in via livestreams. To celebrate, Epic's pulled back the covers on Chapter 7: Pacific Break, revealing new map locations, new gameplay, Simple Build, and battle pass goodies.</p>

            <p>Industry leaders have attended a memorial service for Tomonobu Itagaki, the creator of Dead or Alive and the 3D Ninja Gaiden series, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-died-age-58">died last month aged 58</a>.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90s, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Yosuke Hayashi's eulogy about Itagaki</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Royta15/">u/Royta15</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/">ninjagaiden</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Amongst the attendees, which included Tekken director <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1993986075782717449">Katsuhiro Harada</a>, executive VP of Koei Tecmo, Yosuke Hayashi, talked of meeting the developer, working for him, and getting back in touch shortly before his death.</p>
<p>"I never thought we'd meet like this," the executive said, as translated on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-were-so-cool-koei-tecmo-exec-makes-heartfelt-speech-at-tomonobu-itagaki-memorial/">VGC</a>). "My encounter with Itagaki-san dates back to 2001, when I joined the company as a new graduate. I was assigned to your department as a game planner. You told me you had no work for me. That's what you told me. Two weeks after I was assigned, I really had no work, haha. At the time, I lamented my bad luck, thinking it was the worst possible encounter.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>"My most memorable memory with Itagaki-san was the development of Xbox Ninja Gaiden from 2003 to 2004. The development team was in complete chaos, and it seemed like the game would never be completed, haha. But you were the only one who didn't give up. The two of us spent 12 hours every night checking every adjustment to the game. Those six months are a treasured part of my game-development career."</p>
<p>Itagaki left the company in 2008 shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker sued him for sexual harassment</a>. Although he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007, he ultimately lost his executive officer role. Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.</p>
<p>Before he left the company, Itagaki reportedly told Hayashi "don't change the [Koei Tecmo] logo".</p>
<p>"No other unnecessary words were exchanged. You were so pure and cool," the executive said.</p>
<p>Hayashi also shared his last message from Itagaki in which the developer wrote: "Thank you for remembering our promise [not to change the logo]. Times have changed lately, and selling a million copies doesn't earn you much recognition from the world anymore. That's the era we've entered. Please keep making great products from now on."</p>

            <p>Surprise! Chris Redfield, Excella Gionne, and an adult version of Sherry Birkin are all on their way to Resident Evil: Survival Unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced">Resident Evil Survival Unit was unveiled over the summer</a>. Co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, with Capcom working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality", the free-to-play mobile strategy game is now available. Which is why fans have already poked around in the back end of the Android version and discovered references to as-yet unreleased characters.</p>

As is usually the case, some are free and some are not, but as yet, we hadn't heard anything about series stalwart Chris Redfield at all, or been officially told of the pending arrival of Sherry and Excella.</p><p>However, as reported by Portuguese site <a href="https://residentevil.com.br/noticias/chris-redfield-sherry-birkin-e-excella-gionne-estao-nos-arquivos-de-resident-evil-survival-unit/">REvil</a>, skins of a young RE1-era Redfield, Sherry, and Excella have all been discovered in the character database of the Android version, along with images of an all-new monster created especially for this game, thought to be called Mortem.</p>

<p>According to Epic, Chapter Seven: Pacific Break "kicks off a new era" for Fortnite Battle Royale, "where some of the greatest stories are told – the Golden Coast". Expect New POIs such as Battlewood Boulevard, Sandy Strip, Wonkeeland, Classified Canyon, and more, and while the Battle Bus is out of commission, players will "Storm Surf their way to the Island instead".</p>
<p>Players can also expect new gameplay, too.</p>
<p>"In the <em>very rare occasion </em>players are downed, they can use a Self-Revive Device to revive themselves while they’re DBNO (Down But Not Out)," Epic explained of the new Stay in the Game mechanic. "Additionally, new DBNO movement options include Roll &amp; Tumble, DBNO Sprint, and Stay on the Move. Lastly, Drivable Reboot Vans have rolled onto the Island."</p><div>

<p>You'll also be able to claim loot, powers, and transformative skills when you defeat a boss, with full Health and Shield, bonus max Health and Shield, infinite Energy, and a "powerful ability". Doing so, however, will ensure you're visible to nearby opponents, so be careful.</p>
<p>There's also Simple Build, an option in Settings (Game &gt; Building) that "makes learning how to build simpler".</p>
<p>"Turn it on, look in the direction you want to build, and just… build!" Epic said.</p>
<p>Of course, with each new chapter comes a new battle pass, and this one boasts The Bride, Marty McFly, and Fortnite Originals like Miles Cross and Cat Holloway. As Epic explained: "In addition to their other unlockable Styles, the Battle Pass includes special Styles for three of the Outfits: Cat Holloway, Carter Wu, and Dark Voyager (Reality Redacted). Unlock these additional Styles by completing Quests in Blitz Royale, Reload, and Battle Royale respectively."</p><p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-narrative-sequel-to-kill-bill-is-premiering-in-fortnite">The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge will premiere in Fortnite later today</a> (30th November) at 2pm, ET / 11am PT / 7pm GMT / 8pm CET. It's an animated movie made in the Fortnite engine, directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. You can access the premiere 30 minutes before its starting time, so be sure to get there early.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after Fortnite gave the world <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">a hugely popular Simpsons crossover</a>, which brought back a record number of returning players.</p>
