            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">shared its financial earnings</a> for the third quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, and there's good news for Xbox - with gaming revenue up, despite hardware revenue continuing to fall.
</p>
<p> 
As a whole, Microsoft made $70.1bn in revenue during Q3 and saw a net income of $25.8bn, marking a 13 and 18 percent year-over-year increase respectively. That growth was predominantly driven by its Cloud and Office services, but its gaming division saw success too.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue was up five percent year-over-year, and within that, Xbox content and services - which includes Microsoft's first-party game releases and Game Pass - saw an eight percent increase. While the quarter saw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> launch for Xbox and PC, the company primarily attributed its Q3 gaming growth to Call of Duty and Minecraft. Additionally, Game Pass subscriptions are up - but it's unclear by how much, given membership figures haven't been revised since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-game-pass-now-has-34m-fully-paid-subscribers">Microsoft revealed they'd crossed 34m</a> last February.
</p>
<p>
These successes were offset, however, by a continuing decline in Xbox hardware numbers over Q3, with console sales falling by six percent year-on-year. Xbox's hardware slump has coincided with Microsoft's continuing efforts to pursue a platform agnostic approach for its releases, with its various cloud gaming partnerships meaning Game Pass titles can be streamed on everything from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Meta Quest headsets</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-stream-xbox-games-direct-to-your-lg-tv-no-console-required">TVs</a>. Even so, Microsoft has repeatedly indicated it has no intention of backing out of the console market; not only has it discussed various Xbox handheld plans, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed work on an Xbox Series X/S is well underway</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xbox president Sarah Bon previously said this new console would focus on "delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation", and recent reports have claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft is currently aiming for a 2027 release</a>.

            <p>
EA has announced the end of its partnership with the World Rally Championship, saying it's "pausing development" on all future rally games.
</p>
<p>
EA's inherited the World Rally Championship license as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-to-release-new-racing-game-every-year-after-codemasters-acquisition">acquisition of UK racing game specialist Codemasters in 2021</a>, and its first WRC title - EA Sports WRC - released two years later in 2023. But that, EA has now confirmed, is as far as the partnership will go.
</p>
<p>
"Every great journey eventually finds its finish line, and today, we announced that we've reached the end of the road working on WRC", the company wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917634912493998081">message signed by The Codemasters WRC Team</a> and shared on social media.

<p>
Despite the end of the partnership, EA Sports WRC will continue to be available; however, its previously released 2024 season will be its last expansion. Additionally, EA has announced that "for now", it's "pausing development plans on future rally titles".
</p>
<p>
"Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DIRT," it continued. "We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast... We've brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport's icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying. Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey."
</p>
<p>
EA's decision to end its WRC partnership follows its announcement last year - made as it laid off 670 employees - that it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">moving away from "future licensed IP"</a> toward its "owned IP, sports, and massive online communities".
</p>
<p>
Today's WRC news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">follows yet more layoffs at EA</a>, reportedly affecting "between 300 and 400" employees. It's unclear if the Codemasters team has been impacted as a result of EA's decision to 'pause' rally development, but we've reached out for clarity on the situation.
