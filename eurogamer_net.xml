            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> has just turned two, which doesn't make any sense because there is no way that I am two years older than I was when it first came out, so I think Larian is lying.</p>
<p>But even so, the studio has released a few surprising stats about its critically acclaimed party-based RPG to mark the occasion.</p>

<p>So, it turns out that 2.07 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players managed to defeat twenty opponents while drunk. Fair to say this will be in-game intoxication, because I am sure there have been plenty of wines and beers consumed while playing, and far more than 2.07 percent of us will have been a little tipsy while negotiating the world with Shadowheart and co (don't lie, it is not just me who does that).</p>
<p>Additionally, 3.87 percent of players managed to defeat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps. The developer noted those on Steam are a bit more canny with their footwork than those of us playing on Xbox or PlayStation, with 4.37 percent of players on Valve's platform successfully avoiding triggering traps (I am not one of them).</p>

<p>Also, 1.1 million players have completed Baldur's Gate 3 in Tactician Mode, one of the game's highest difficulty settings. Following that, almost half a million players "thought it would be fun" to complete Baldur's Gate 3 in Honour Mode, which builds on Tactician Mode by adding things like tougher bosses, stricter rules and a single save slot.</p>
<p>Of those half a mil, 4,647 players managed to beat Honour Mode with a Level 1 character. Meanwhile, 31,180 players beat Honour Mode as a Jack of All Trades.</p>

<p>Now, I play as a Barbarian in my own real world D&amp;D campaign, so I like this next stat because it speaks to my character (she's called Quinn). Larian has revealed 8.21 percent of players thought to use an enemy as an improvised weapon against another. These are my people!</p>
<p>350 players also respecced Minsc into a Death Domain Cleric, to which Larian asked: "Are you folks doing okay?"</p>
<p>Now, this stat is quite heartwarming. Apparently 598 players adopted a child with Wyll, which is cute.</p>

<p>Larian has also celebrated 265m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). Of those, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">over 250,000 of all downloads are Withers Big Naturals</a>, a mod which, yes, gives Withers breasts.</p>
<p>You can check out the full list of stats shared to celebrate Baldur's Gate 3's second anniversary, as well as some pretty cool community photos from the game's photo mode, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131">over on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>"Crazy to think it's only been two years. It's truly been life changing," <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1952106606864253253">studio founder Swen Vincke wrote on social media yesterday</a>, celebrating Baldur's Gate 3's anniversary. "Probably worth writing about one day. But I can spoil the biggest takeaway. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">BG3 was what allowed us to do our next crazy thing</a>. </p>
<p>"How that will pan out is anyone's guess but I can assure you we're working hard to ensure you'll have plenty of fun. Like really - loads of it. In a surprising way. And I can't wait to show you. But you'll need to be patient / we'll need a bit of time to make it all work. It'll be worth it though."</p>
<p>As for what that next "crazy" thing is? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">all we really know for now is it isn't Baldur's Gate 4</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-celebrates-second-anniversary-with-obscure-stats-and-the-revelation-over-250k-of-us-opted-to-see-withers-big-naturals]]></content:encoded>
