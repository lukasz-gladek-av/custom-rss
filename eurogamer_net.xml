            <p>At one point, Nintendo's famously silent lead Link was going to have lines of dialogue in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. However, the developers ultimately agreed it didn't feel right, even though in Echoes of Wisdom, Link isn't the main protagonist.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23485">Famitsu</a>, Echoes of Wisdom directors Satoshi Terada and Tomomi Sano, along with series producer Eiji Aonuma, shared more insight into this year's release. The developers noted that traditionally, the lead in a Legend of Zelda game has remained mute, and this typically means Link.</p>
<p>Please note, there are <strong>minor spoilers for Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom below</strong>.</p>

<p>In Echoes of Wisdom, the series' namesake takes the lead role, and therefore this time it is Zelda who doesn't have any lines of dialogue. This opened up the possibility that Link could finally share some words of wisdom with players, and Aonuma admitted "at first" the green-clad hero was indeed talking (translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/link-was-going-to-speak-in-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-but-nintendo-thought-it-didnt-feel-right/">VGC</a>).</p><p>Terada added he "let Link talk a little bit" when work on the Switch title began. However, it didn't stick, and Terada noted no matter what he made Link say, at the end of the day, it "just didn't feel right".</p>
<p>"Link would never speak like that," Aonuma furthered. "It felt really strange. Nobody knew what Link would say - that's only natural, because he's never spoken before."</p>
<p>To get around this, the Echoes of Wisdom team instead concocted a story which explained why Link is silent, even though he is not the player character. Early in the game, Zelda can come across a journal entry written by Impa's brother, Lueburry. Here, Lueburry explains that Link was "one of the kids" who had been "stolen away" by the strange rifts that had opened up across Hyrule, setting in motion much of the game.</p>
<p>According to this entry, "all of the kids taken by the rifts" had lost something, and in Link's case, this was his ability to speak.</p>

<p>Echoes of Wisdom is not the only Legend of Zelda game to give a reason to Link's silence. In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>, Link can read Zelda's diary when making his way through Hyrule Castle. In her writings, the princess said she had slowly managed to get Link to open up to her, but he "feels it necessary to stay strong and to silently bear any burden". This "has caused him to stop outwardly expressing his thoughts and feelings", Zelda writes.</p><p>"I always believed him to be simply a gifted person who had never faced a day of hardship. How wrong I was..." the Breath of the Wild diary reads. "Everyone has struggles that go unseen by the world... I was so absorbed with my own problems, I failed to see his. I wish to talk with him more and to see what lies beneath those calm waters, to hear him speak freely and openly... And perhaps I, too, will be able to bare my soul to him and share the demons that have plagued me all these years."</p>

<p>For more, earlier this year, Nintendo provided details on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-why-nintendo-ditched-link-as-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist">why Zelda was chosen as the protagonist for the Echoes of Wisdom</a>, rather than Link.</p>
<p>The company has additionally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-film-releases-some-time-within-this-decade-so-thats-something">narrowed down the release window for its upcoming Legend of Zelda film</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Rockstar has at last updated the PC, PlayStation and Xbox versions of its classic GTA Trilogy to receive the same improvements already found in its mobile port. 
</p>
<p>
GTA Trilogy originally launched for PC and consoles exactly three years ago to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">decidedly negative reception</a> due to its various graphical issues and glitches, prompting a sarcastic response from the port's original development studio and an apology from Rockstar itself. 
</p>
<p>
Now, three years later, improvements already found in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-tested-on-iphone">GTA Trilogy's warmly-received smartphone version</a> - launched via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> - can finally be found elsewhere. Most notably, this includes the trilogy's Classic Lighting mode, which restores the brighter and more colourful vibes of the games' original versions.

<p>
As <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/">RockstarIntel</a> notes, you can find the Classic Lighting option now in each games' pause menu - though, somewhat tellingly, the feature has been enabled by default. Other additions include character model improvements, plus visual improvements for heat haze and ambient clouds.

GTA Trilogy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">disastrous launch sparked countless refund requests</a> as the game arrived in a buggy state. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">Rockstar quickly pulled the game offline</a> for three days, albeit with different concerns - apparently to scrub the inclusion of unlicensed music within the game's files, as well as files with developer comments and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-discover-hot-coffee-code-in-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">the infamous Hot Coffee sex mini-game</a>.
</p>
<p>"There are a lot of problems here," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-grand-theft-auto-3-definitive-edition-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">Digital Foundry wrote of the GTA Trilogy</a> upon the package's original launch, "issues that are so blatant and jarring and ridiculous, it's hard to understand how the game made its way through quality control."</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-apologises-for-gta-trilogy-definitive-editions-unexpected-issues-re-lists-classic-versions-for-pc">apologised</a>, offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-remaster-can-claim-an-extra-game-for-free">free Rockstar game</a> for PC owners, and began providing patches. But problems persisted - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-released-on-steam-in-sorry-state">GTA Trilogy's Steam launch in January 2023 drew similar complaints</a> over its poor quality. Here's hoping now, finally, Rockstar has provided.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
