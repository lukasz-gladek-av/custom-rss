            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has had a bumpy start, accruing an 'Overwhelming Dislike' verdict on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Metacritic</a> on its opening weekend, making it the most unpopular Call of Duty game ever by Metacritic user score.</p>
<p>Whilst critic reviews have contributed to an aggregated score of 84 on PC (there aren't yet enough critic scores to give a verdict on console), hundreds of users have given the shooter the dubious honour of being the franchise's most disliked instalment with an aggregate score of just 1.7 at the time of writing. A whopping 85 percent of users have left a negative review.</p>
<p>It's also currently sitting on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash">'Mixed' user score</a> on Steam, with just 42 percent of player reviews leaving a positive thumbs-up.</p>

<p>Steam only represents one segment of the game's PC audience, of course, and doesn't take account of users playing through the Xbox PC app, let alone those on console. Nonetheless, complaints are varied, ranging from accusations that the "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/armbarvictim1/">franchise has lost its way</a>", "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/DarkStrikeX/">strays far from Call of Duty's identity</a>", and uses "<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc">ai slop</a>", while others call it "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993890407/recommended/3606480/">out of touch</a>", "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199636448645/recommended/3606480/">disappointing</a>", and "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/september_cs/recommended/3606480/">another under-baked title delivered on false promises and blatant lies</a>".</p><p>While not all reviews are bad - there are <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/user-reviews/?platform=pc&amp;filter=Positive%20Reviews">several</a> 10/10s posted to Metacritic - most complain that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-campaign-cannot-be-paused-by-solo-players-has-no-checkpoints-and-requires-an-online-connection-at-all-times">campaign mode cannot be paused</a> or <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/aniketvcool/recommended/3606480/">saved manually</a>, and<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards"> criticise the publisher for in-game calling cards allegedly created using generative AI,</a> all of which came to light when the game debuted on 14th November.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> wasn't perfect but it felt like COD was back again," <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/user/Stihl24/">explained</a> one player. "Zombies were great, the campaign was okay and the multiplayer felt like it used to. For the first time in 10 years, my [sic] believed that Call of Duty was on the right track again. That is until, they announced Black Ops 7.</p>
<p>"Every. Single. Thing. That the community has been super vocal about hating, they decided to bring to Black Ops 7. Everything that we said we loved about Black Ops 6 and OG Call of Duty, they took away. Now all that's left is a steaming pile of dog crap [where] a once great first person shooter empire lived. I hope this is a wake-up call, and the company decides to revert 100% back to the way that Call of Duty is supposed to be. This is what happens when you continue to put profit over passion."</p>
<p>Though Activision has properly declared AI was used during the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/">its Steam page</a>, complaints about AI are particularly evident. As Connor explained for us earlier in the week, calling cards belonging to the 'Jack of All Trades' campaign challenges, as well as two specific calling cards in the 'Embrace the Nightmare' campaign endgame challenges, raised eyebrows as players noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">similarities to the AI Studio Ghibli recreations</a> which have been circulating online for the past few months.</p><p>"If you can accept Black Ops 7's fundamental changes to the formula on their own terms, you'll have a good trip, despite the psychochemicals coursing through your veins," we said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Eurogamer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 review</a>, awarding it 3/5 stars. "I'm just not convinced those changes bode well for the health of the series."</p>

            <p>The producer of the next highly-anticipated instalment of Resident Evil, Resident Evil Requiem, has teased that the upcoming horror retains "some" elements of its prior life as an online multiplayer open-world game, but wouldn't tell us what, exactly, they are.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://press-start.com.au/features/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-interview-putting-the-horror-in-survival-horror/">Press Start Australia</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa said that Requiem - initially conceived as an open-world, multiplayer game - was reinvented when the team decided fans of the franchise "wouldn't enjoy it" given the horror aspects were "very mild".</p>

<p>Questioned about this, however, Kumazawa would only say "there are some remaining elements, but we can't disclose what it is and how it is," and laughed when pressed harder for more details.</p>
<p>"Looking at the game when it was multiplayer, the horror part was very mild," he said. "However, in that build, we made a game that was fun to play. But we looked deeply into this game and wondered if a fan of the franchise would really like this, so we thought they [...] probably wouldn't enjoy it as much.</p>
<p>"That's the reason we made it back into single-player. But because it was fun, we added elements from that build to the final game to ensure it was fun."</p>
<p>Asked what, in his opinion, Resident Evil fans wanted from a new title, the producer added: "I believe fans of the franchise want [...] survival horror and being scared. That is the number one thing that fans want. So by saying that, we can't just slap on new skins and new characters and give you the same experience. It wouldn't be that good.</p>
<p>"That's why we wanted to make sure we added new elements that ensured this feels like a new survival horror game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kumazawa also revealed that Requiem was "in development way before Village", which is why the team is keen to ensure the game "focus[es] on the horror" and avoids becoming too combat-heavy.</p>
<p>Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet">sat down with game director Koshi Nakanishi at Gamescom to talk about pacing</a>, where he explained that he would be taking the "same" approach" with Requiem as Resident Evil 7, which Nakanishi also directed.</p>
<p>Capcom also recently said it was looking to the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-wants-resident-evil-requiem-boss-battles-to-test-your-wits-rather-than-your-shooting-skill">for ideas about how to challenge players with boss battles in Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to release on 27th February, 2026.</p>

            <p>Sony has issued a number of DMCA notices against a fan project working to bring Concord back to life.</p>
<p>Concord was infamously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after its PS5 and PC release</a>, amid suggestions it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">sold less than 25,000 copies</a>. At the time, Sony said the game would remain offline indefinitely so Firewalk could "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players." Later that same month, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-director-reportedly-steps-down-as-studio-awaits-sony-decision-on-games-future">Concord game director Ryan Ellis stepped down</a>, and by the end of October 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Firewalk Studios, the Sony-owned developer behind the ill-fated shooter, was also shut down</a>.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and a team of volunteer developers have been working for months to get the game up and running again, getting the main menu, character select, and matchmaking working on private servers. "The project is still WIP," one volunteer developer wrote on the <a href="https://discord.gg/q9Q2N52agh">Concord Delta Discord</a>, but confirmed "it's playable, but buggy."</p>

<p>"Hey. After a long time of reverse engineering [and] server development, we just managed to play a match of Concord!" the team announced on Discord.</p>
<p>"The project is still WIP, it's playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we'll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience)." The announcement ended thanking a couple of volunteer developers for "helping [...] reverse engineer the game".</p>
<p>Crucially, the team only hosted players who already owned the game files themselves through a legitimate purchase, and slapped down anyone trying to share "copyrighted files".</p>
<p>"I know this sucks for people who got forcefully refunded, but lawyers are most likely already watching everything we do and I want to ensure this project stays as legal as we realistically can do," the team wrote. "We will be removing any posts containing links to copyrighted files."</p><p>Despite the team's caution, however, Sony has targeted the project, filing copyright infringement claims against videos showing the project in action on YouTube and social media. And while it's unclear if Sony has filed against the team itself, it seems they've been cowed into submission for now, with one of the devs writing on Discord: "Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being," (thanks, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post)</a>.</p>
<p>The UK's House of Commons recently debated the need for improved video game consumer protections as well as video game preservation. In this debate, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-sudden-shutdown-is-such-a-big-deal-its-been-brought-up-during-uk-government-debates-on-video-game-consumer-laws">Concord's sudden shutdown was used as an example</a>, and the requirement for strong consumer protections in such a case.</p>
<p>One MP stated: "A recent example is Concord, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn't always the case."</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has told Anno 117: Pax Romana fans that it will be replacing an AI-generated loading screen image, insisting it had "slipped through" and had only meant to be used as a placeholder.</p>
<p>The Steam page for Anno 117: Pax Romana carries an "AI Generated Content Disclosure" - the first for an Ubisoft game - but that hasn't stopped fans complaining about the image, or insisting that they expect better from a premium game from a developer like Ubisoft.</p>

<p>The image, which can be viewed in full <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-ai-background-art-is-pretty-low-quality-unfortunately-v0-yi4z7xs7o11g1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D3399%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D2d42be908c532ce0df76c17431201e223ab81955">here</a>, shows a number of tell-tale signs that it's been generated rather than drawn, including disfigured or out-of-scale facial features, missing limbs, and strange set-dressing. A touched-up version is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fthe-ai-background-art-is-pretty-low-quality-unfortunately-v0-jjptto1zr11g1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D2683%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dc930b5ce57dcbe6d89cd4b02d4dc69af9a83d85e">considerably less jarring,</a> but some fans still take issue with the fact that it was based on a prompt rather than an original piece of art.</p>
<p>"If they are going to go with cheap tools in their game, I will wait till the game is cheap," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1ow3v75/comment/nonhwqr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one unhappy fan.</p>
<p>Another, leaving a negative review on Steam, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsAnny/recommended/3274580/">wrote</a>: "I don't want to live in a future where every big studio that very well could afford paying artists instead chooses to steal from artists by using AI generated images. AI tools are bad for the environment, bad for the job market, on top of that the images look awful, genuinely an eyesore in a[n] otherwise beautiful game."</p>

<p>Responding to <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399">Kotaku</a>, Ubisoft said: "This image was a placeholder asset that unintentionally slipped through our review process. The final image is attached here and will replace the current version of this artwork with the upcoming 1.3 patch. With Anno 117: Pax Romana being our most ambitious Anno yet, we’ve assembled the largest team of artists ever for the franchise and to help meet the project’s unique scope, they use AI tools for iterations, prototyping, and exploration. Every element players will experience in the final game reflects the team’s craft, artistry, and creative vision."</p>
<p>And it's not just images that seem to have been generated by AI, either. According to some players, the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1onip56/german_text_localization_is_still_ai_generated_in/">text localisation is also allegedly "still AI-generated"</a>, too.</p>
<p>u/Taubenangriff posted a number of examples they believe were translated by machine, writing "nobody who has ever played an Anno before was let near translation work, and it is still AI generated slop to a large part. They got six million euros cultural (!) sponsorship from the German state, but the result is outright disrespectful to the German language".</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1onip56/german_text_localization_is_still_ai_generated_in/">German text localization is still AI generated in the release version</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/taubenangriff/">u/taubenangriff</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/">anno</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>These issues persist despite the same user highlighting issues with the German localisation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anno/comments/1n6nuen/text_localization_seems_to_be_ai_generated/">two months ago</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anno-117-pax-romana-is-taking-the-economic-city-builder-to-ancient-rome-next-year">Anno 117: Pax Romana back in June 2024</a>. A new entry in Ubisoft Blue Byte's long-running economic city builder series, it whisks PC and console players back to ancient Rome and the Roman Empire.</p>
