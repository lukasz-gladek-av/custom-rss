            <p>More than three years since the game's release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> remains an Elden King of the gaming world.</p>
<p>Developer FromSoftware has today announced Elden Ring has now shipped over 30m copies worldwide.</p>

<p>"Dearest Tarnished, we are profoundly thankful for your lasting devotion," the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1916855058097938564">studio wrote in celebration on social media</a>.</p>
<p>"May your path be forever guided by the Grace of Gold."</p>
<p>In December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-now-sold-286m-copies-outselling-the-dark-souls-series-combined-prior-to-release">FromSoft revealed Elden Ring has shifted 28.6m copies worldwide</a>, outselling the entire Dark Souls series prior to its release. This means in the last few months, Elden Ring has moved more than 1.4m copies, and will surely shift even more when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">the game makes its Nintendo debut on Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>Elden Ring first released in February 2022, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-review">Aoife Wilson calling it "a glorious game" in Eurogamer's review</a>. A DLC - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> - then released last year, adding a further boost to sales.</p>
<p>"Much of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is more of the same gruelling beauty - but a shift to explicit storytelling and signposting means its essence as a living, evolving shared text is lost," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Eurogamer's Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>.</p>
<p>Despite Elden Ring's undeniable success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-2-is-not-in-development-says-fromsoftwares-miyazaki">Elden Ring 2 is not in the pipeline</a>. What we do have coming, though, is co-op spinoff <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>.</p>
<p>Nightreign will be released on 30th May across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and PC.

            <p>
If you're in the mood for a bit of mayhem, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> would like a word. The publisher's just unveiled Mycopunk, a new limb-slicing, robo-leaping mission-based co-op FPS that's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/">coming to Steam</a> from developer Pigeons at Play later this year.
</p>
<p>

Mycopunk whisks players to a far-flung sci-fi future, where, as employees of space travel company Saxon, they're order to go investigate a distant moon and find out why communication has been lost. It's probably not much of a spoiler, given the title, to reveal that the answer to that "why" is a fungal catastrophe, and its up to players - as a rag tag team of robots - to clean it all up.
</p>
<p>
What you have, then, is a mission-based co-op FPS inspired by the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a>, with a focus on movement, weird guns, and an upgrade system that enables cool builds designed - as Pigeons at Play explained during a recent press showing - to break the game "in a good way". To that end, Mycopunk features four distinct characters, all with some element of movement, that can synergise when used together, but are all powerful enough that they can be used independently for anyone wanted to play solo. Additionally, there ar eno character limits, meaning all four players can play as the same on if they so desire.

<p>
There's the Wrangler - the most agile of the bunch - that has an air dash and a rocket lasso they can use to yank themselves in different directions, even grab parts or other players. The Bruiser, meanwhile, is more about up close and personal combat and comes armed with a shotgun and projector shield that can push enemies back, deflect bullets, even slam into that ground, causing everyone - including allies - to be launched into the air.
</p>
<p>
The Scrapper, meanwhile, is the most team- orientated character. They can deploy a pole all characters can grapple onto from a distance, while the Glider has a flying wing suit and a rocket salvo that can be used to terrorise enemies or health friends.
</p>
<p>
This motley crew of reprobates start each mission on the deck of their rickety space ship orbiting the moon, which serves as Mycopunk's hub and a focus of plenty of between-mission silliness too. You can visit your boss - a giant cockroach who'll provide assistance between missions - rail grind in the Recreation Sphere, or just smack each other around trying out different builds in the hangar. You can even summon vehicles - from individual race cars to four-person rides - and take them on missions. The team is also looking to install working arcade cabinets on the ship, but that might not make it in for launch.
</p>
<p>
As for the mission themselves, they'll take players to one of four different biomes and are accessed seamlessly from the ship's drop pod. As you'd expect, these come in a range of different flavours, such as planetary defense missions,  requiring players to power up a large gun and use it to take down the ship of a rival company - and additional layers of variety are introduces through random modifiers and even weekly modifiers. 
</p>
<p>
The common theme though one of chaotic combat and utter carnage as players traverse the large open biomes and face off against swarms of alien creatures and mini-bosses. The Mycopunk twist is enemies are made up different pieces you can chop of individually - something you'll need to do in order to reach the vulnerable core at their centre. However, dismembered limbs can be a liability given other enemies can pick up and use them for them themselves. And if that wasn't enough to be getting on with, there's also talk of rare weather events, such as sulphur rain that's able to turn the ground into goo.
</p>
<p>
By finishing off enemies and completing missions, players can acquire upgrades to install back on the ship. There are upgrades for guns, grenades, even individual characters' abilities, meaning there's a lot of build flexibility. The wrinkle, though, is that upgrades must be installed Tetris-style in a grid of limited size, with the ability to rotate them only becoming available later on.
</p>
<p>
You'll find upgrades - spanning standard, rare, epic, and exotic tiers - that increase grenade charging speeds, that turn them into cluster bombs, that imbue weapons with infinite ammo that'll start burning you if you hold fire down too long. You'll find upgrades that let you shoot double the bullets, or charge up ammo and then fire it all out at once, and on it goes. And given 40 upgrades can be installed for every weapon, build tinkers should have a whale of a time.
</p>
<p>
And big plans are afoot for Mycopunk post-launch, with Pigeons at Play already thinking about narrative content, new weapons, new enemies and enemy parts, and new upgrades - the studio says it'll be building the latter based on what players want to see. Publisher Devolver hasn't yet revealed when launch will be beyond a vague "2025", but if you're suitably intrigued, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3581750/Mycopunk_Demo/">Mycopunk demo is available on Steam</a> from today.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>People Can Fly, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a>, has revealed what Project Maverick actually is.</p>
<p>Project Maverick was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/outriders-studio-people-can-fly-working-on-new-project-based-on-microsoft-ip">first reported back in June 2023</a>. At this time, it was said People Can Fly's Project Maverick would be fully funded by Microsoft with a budget of $30m-50m, and based on one of the Xbox maker's existing properties.</p>
<p>While details have remained sparse since then, People Can Fly has now revealed what Project Maverick is via its "about us" section in the <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/investors-en/#o-firmie">studio's investor website</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/cars/news/pcf-s-project-maverick-xbox-game-has-been-revealed/ar-AA1DLC3n">XboxEra</a>). And, perhaps unsurprisingly, Project Maverick is actually Gears of War: E-Day. The developer was revealed to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-e-day-dev-the-coalition-drafts-in-people-can-fly-as-partner-studio">working with The Coalition on the next Gears of War game in January of this year</a>.</p>
<p>People Can Fly is "currently working on seven projects", the developer's investor website now reads. "Gemini, a new AAA game developed in partnership with global publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>; Maverick (Gears of War: E-Day), in collaboration with Microsoft; Echo, a mode to the existing game developed for Krafton; and projects Bifrost and Victoria (Lost Rift) to be released in the self-publishing model."</p>
<p>In addition, People Can Fly is "also involved in a VR technology project named Project Bison, a new title in the immersive VR action survival genre" and Incuvo - a group subsidiary - is "actively working on the further development of a separate VR project, Green Hell VR".</p>
<p>Incuvo released the rather messy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm-vr">Bulletstorm VR</a> port. Eurogamer's VR aficionado Ian Higton took Bulletstorm VR out for a spin on release, and he was left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-bulletstorm-vr-really-as-bad-as-everyone-says-it-is">pretty disappointed by the whole thing</a>, calling it sloppy.</p>
<p>As for Gears of War: E-Day, it's a prequel title for the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A selection of other humanoid characters that are smugglers are shown. The only two which appear to have specific names are Jotraaaz Kammzzzek and Travis, suggesting that they may play a bigger role in Eclipse's overall story, whenever it finally releases.</p>

<p>Star Wars Eclipse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first announced at the 2021 Game Awards</a>, where it was revealed it would have a High Republic setting. The affluent High Republic era is set around 200 years before the Skywalker Saga. (It's not to be confused the Old Republic, set thousands of years prior.) Happily, this means Jar Jar himself won't be featuring.</p>
<p>However, since that time, very little else has been heard of the game. In October 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">the studio described Star Wars Eclipse as "simmering"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumi√®re said the studio's teams had not been impacted by cuts made by its owner NetEase. At this time, the company head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">the studio was "continuing to develop our projects at full pace"</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, former lead writer for Quantic Dream's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a> and Star Wars Eclipse Adam Williams revealed he had left the studio after 10 years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">He subsequently announced his new studio, Republic Games</a>, which is working on a handcrafted "dark, mature fantasy RPG".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
