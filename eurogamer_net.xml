            <p>
Microsoft is celebrating having the best-selling game on both Xbox and PlayStation platforms over the last quarter, thanks to its new ownership of the Call of Duty franchise.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launched last October and has been a success for Microsoft, which namechecked the title during its latest financial results.
</p>
<p>
"Black Ops 6... saw more players in its launch quarter than any other paid release in franchise history," Microsoft boss Satya Nadella boasted during a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q2">call</a> with investors.

<p>
"We also continue to see strong momentum for Xbox Cloud Gaming, with a record 140m hours streamed this quarter," he continued.
</p>
<p>
Nadella also called out the brilliant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and gave our first indication of how well MachineGames' globe-trotting adventure is doing.
</p>
<p>
"We saw rave reviews of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which has already been played by more than four million people," Nadella said.
</p>
<p>
Both of these statistics will reflect players who bought either game outright, as well as those who have played via Game Pass on both PC and Xbox.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, of course, the PS5 launch of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is still to come - sometime in the first half of this year.
</p>
<p>
Revenue for Xbox's gaming and content division, which includes Game Pass, rose two percent over three months of 2024 thanks to a surge of subscribers on PC. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-sales-slump-but-game-pass-is-surging">Microsoft's wider gaming revenue was still down year-on-year overall, offset by the continued slump of Xbox hardware sales</a>.

            <p>
Microsoft has announced mixed results for its latest financial quarter, with strong growth for Game Pass offset by the continued decline in Xbox hardware sales. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, revenue for Microsoft's gaming division was down seven percent year-on-year for the three months ending 31st December 2024, with a 29 percent drop in Xbox console sales largely to blame. 
</p>
<p>
But the quarter also saw a significant boost to Game Pass, which made more money in the last three months of 2024 than in any previous quarter, and also saw a significant uptick to its subscribers on PC.

<p>
"We are focused on improving the profitability of the business, in order to position it for long-term growth, driven by higher-margin content and platform services," Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q2">call</a> with investors. "And we are delivering on this plan.
</p>
<p>
"All-up, Game Pass set a new quarterly record for revenue and grew its PC subscriber base by over 30 percent, as we focus on driving fully-paid subscribers across endpoints."
</p>
<p>
It's clear that Game Pass subscriptions will have been boosted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s launch in October. The latest launch in Activision's long-running shooter franchise was the first to arrive on Game Pass on day one - provided you had PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on consoles.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Black Ops 6 saw more players in its first couple of months than any other game in the series to date, Nadella said.
</p>
<p>
Its inclusion on Game Pass also does not appear to have dented its sales, either. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was "the top-selling game on Xbox and PlayStation" last quarter, Nadella said, before also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-the-top-selling-game-on-xbox-and-playstation-last-quarter">revealing the number of people who have played the brilliant Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.
