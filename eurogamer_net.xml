            <p>Sony is ending its PlayStation Stars loyalty programme, in its current form, after three years.</p>
<p>The programme first started in July 2022 and allowed players to earn reward points to be redeemed for PSN wallet funds and other products on the store. It became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-stars-program-now-available-in-uk">available in the UK</a> later that year.</p>
<p>However, Sony is now ending support for the programme as it evaluates "the types of activities our players respond best to", though it could return in some form in the future.</p>

<p>From today, new members to the PlayStation Stars programme will no longer be accepted and if current members cancel they won't be able to rejoin this version of the programme - all earned Points will be lost.</p>
<p>Current PlayStation Stars members can still earn points and products until 23rd July 3:59pm UK time (7:59am PDT, 11:59pm JST). No new campaigns will be available after this time.</p>
<p>This version of PlayStation Stars will fully end on 2nd November 2026. Current members can still earn points until this time. Digital Collectibles will still be accessible after these changes take place.</p>
<p>"Since launching the programme, we've learned a lot from evaluating the types of activities our players respond best to, and as a company, we are always evolving with player and industry trends," said the company on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/21/playstation-stars-coming-to-a-close-as-sie-evaluates-new-ways-to-evolve-future-loyalty-program-efforts/?sf277358162=1">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>
<p>"Through this evaluation, we have decided to refocus our efforts and will be winding down the current version of PlayStation Stars. We will continue to evaluate our key findings from this programme, and are looking into ways to build upon these learnings."</p>
<p>At the launch of PlayStation Stars, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-stars-loyalty-programme-announced">Sony confirmed its Digital Collectibles were not NFTs, were not tradable, and did not leverage blockchain technology</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear how the programme will evolve, but it would seem this isn't the last time we'll see PlayStation Stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Donkey Kong - Nintendo's mighty monkey with a penchant for bananas - received a bit of a makeover recently, and now we know why.</p>
<p>We originally got a look at DK's new in-game look back in January, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">gorilla starred in the first brief teaser for Mario Kart World</a>. At this time, fans noticed he looked much closer to his Super Mario Bros. film design than before. Since then, this look has been featured in plenty of Nintendo advertising, and of course the main monkey is set to star in his own <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> game - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> - later this year.</p>
<p>Now, Donkey Kong designer and Nintendo legend <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has shed some light as to why the company chose to redesign his iconic character for this generation.</p>

<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-shigeru-miyamoto-interview-i-see-nintendo-as-like-a-talent-agency-and-we-have-within-our-roster-a-lot-of-talented-characters">IGN</a>, Miyamoto said "when it comes to character creation and working with characters", he still has an active role in what goes on.</p>
<p>"Looking back to the first generation <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, we worked with Rare to create Donkey Kong Country," Miyamoto continued. "When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat. We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive."</p>
<p>The creator furthered that "going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated", with the team wanting to come up with something to make DK's design "more expressive" than before.</p>
<p>"And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design," Miyamoto concluded.</p>

<p>Soon after Donkey Kong's redesign was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">former Rare artist Kevin Bayliss shared his thoughts on the new look</a>, stating: "You can take the KONG out of the Country, but you can't take the Country out of the Kong! (I love it - this is really funny! - Everything changes! - Change is good!)."</p>
<p>As for the monkey's upcoming game, Eurogamer's former EIC Tom Phillips has already had some time with Donkey Kong Bananza, which is set to launch on Switch 2 on 17th July.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," he wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was originally in development for the original Switch, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> has allowed the developers to realise their vision of an inter-connected world.</p>
<p>Nintendo began prototyping for the new Mario Kart game back in 2017, even during development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. Development then began at the end of that year.</p>
<p>"I felt that in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, we were able to perfect the formula that we'd been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses," explained Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki in a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/">interview from Nintendo</a>. "That's why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this."</p>

<p>Programming director Kenta Sato continued: "When we were developing for Nintendo Switch, we often worried whether we could find the right balance between planning and performance. Of course, the Switch system's performance is sufficient for developing different kinds of games, but if we had included everything we wanted to in this game's vast world, then it wouldn't have run at 60 fps and would have suffered from constant framerate drops.</p>
<p>"I think there were a lot of people on the team who were worried about whether we could really manage it. But once we decided to release this game on Switch 2, we expected our worries to evaporate all at once. I remember being overjoyed when I discovered we could express even more than we'd originally set out to."</p>
<p>Yabuki noted that had the idea for the game just been more courses it would've been called Mario Kart 9, but the new approach led to the name Mario Kart World. In fact, that name was added to concept art in the early stages of development.</p>
<p>"In previous Mario Kart games, after finishing a course, you'd move on to the next course," said Yabuki. "However, I thought that with modern technology, being able to seamlessly transition between courses and realise a single, vast world wasn't beyond the realm of possibility. So, with this in mind, we set out to create a new kind of Mario Kart...And that's when all our troubles began."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sato had heard of difficulties in creating open world games and felt pressure to achieve this with Mario Kart, especially as Nintendo considers 60fps to be important for the series, as well as split-screen multiplayer. It seems the power of the Switch 2 allowed for this to happen.</p>
<p>The move to an open world also led to the increase of 24 players instead of 12, which was decided fairly early in development.</p>
<p>"By creating long routes in a vast world, you could end up with players spread out in various places, which could diminish the sense that they're racing against each other," said Yabuki. "So, we figured that by increasing the number of racers, you'd be sure to see some competitive action here and there."</p>
<p>Added art director Masaaki Ishikawa: "I felt like the 12 players we had previously was a lot, but as Yabuki-san said, once players spread out, the course starts to look sparse, and the visuals give off a sort of lonely feel. So, I thought that 24 players would be better because there'd be more interaction between various players. That said, it was quite challenging once we got going and the volume of design work increased. But it was worth it."</p>
<p>Speaking of art, the team wanted to recapture the "lively, bustling atmosphere" of Super Mario Kart on the SNES, with a key phrase being "playfulness". This led to the more rounded, cartoonish designs of Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>"The characters in the Super Mario series have a rounded look, so we wanted to give the vehicles a rounded design too, to match their appearance," said Ishikawa. "We also wanted to give the characters a livelier look even while they're in their vehicles, so we put everything together in a way that gives off a sense of playfulness through the combination of the characters' rounded designs, soft facial expressions, and rich movements."</p>
<p>The open world design means courses are now inter-connected across the world, but Yabuki said adding up all the possible variations would "easily exceed 100".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Lastly, the developers discussed the creation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-is-the-true-star-of-nintendos-switch-2-direct">Mario Kart World's meme-worthy new character, Cow</a>.</p>
<p>"Each new Mario Kart game features new characters to race with, but since we added so many to the previous game, we wondered where we could go from there," said Ishikawa. "And then one of the designers came up with that silly sketch of Cow cruising along, and I thought to myself, 'This is it!' So that's when we realised the course surroundings actually contained a lot of untapped resources.</p>
<p>"The character designer quickly put together a prototype of Cow that could race, and surprisingly it didn't feel out of place at all. So we thought maybe we could include other obstacle characters, and decided to add Cheep Cheep and Pokey as racers. As a result, the idea of taking obstacle characters, usually found in courses in past games, and having them participate in races made sense to me in terms of an interconnected world."</p>
<p>Mario Kart World will launch alongside Nintendo's Switch 2 on 5th June as a key game in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">launch lineup</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-suggestion-that-ai-generated-images-used-in-mario-kart-world">Nintendo responded to the suggestion it had used AI-generated images</a> in the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has announced its next wave of Game Pass titles for May and into June.</p>
<p>Day one releases with this batch include Monster Train 2, To a T, and Spray Paint Simulator. To a T is a charming looking game from the creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>. It follows the story of a teen whose body is stuck in a T-pose, as they navigate life in a small town with their cute dog companion.</p>
<p>Here are the list of Xbox Game Pass additions for late May 2025:</p>

<p>Our Ed has already had some time with To a T, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-creators-to-a-t-is-full-of-colour-and-joy-but-is-also-a-serious-and-affecting-depiction-of-living-with-disability">spoke to its creator Keita Takahashi</a>. "The concept of the character being in a T-pose came from another small game idea I had," Takahashi told Ed. "I hadn't linked the T-pose to disability until someone pointed it out in feedback. I was more focused on daily life challenges, which could be categorised as disabilities, but the inspiration was primarily drawn from game design."</p>
<p>Metaphor ReFantazio is a particular highlight from this batch of incoming Game Pass games. We awarded it five stars on its release, with our Ed saying "what it lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grandeur and heart," in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Eurogamer's Metaphor ReFantazio review</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Game Pass Ultimate members can look forward to more games coming to the Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) library on 23rd May. These are:</p>
