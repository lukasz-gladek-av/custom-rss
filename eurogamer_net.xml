            <p>
Roblox will make further changes to how its large audience of children interact with others on the platform, in response to growing safety fears. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079">latest steps</a> include a ban on users aged under 13 being able to access social hangout experiences in Roblox, beginning later this month. Additionally, though not until December, children will be blocked from seeing or playing experiences that have not been rated for their content.
</p>
<p>
Roblox says the change to kids being allowed into social hangout experiences will help "address user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk to our youngest users". 
</p>
<p>
In July, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Bloomberg report highlighted the 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a> reported on Roblox in 2023 alone, and that two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in Roblox. The following month, short-selling firm Hindenberg Research published further examples designed to highlight Roblox's failure to keep children safe, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">report which labelled the platform as an "X-rated paedophile hellscape"</a> rife with "grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech". 
</p><p>
Roblox responded to that report by calling it "simply misleading", but last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">announced plans to require parental permission for children under the age of 13 to access chat features by default</a>. Kids under nine will also need permission to play experiences rated with a maturity rating of "moderate". 
</p>
<p>
Now, children will be further restricted from accessing social hangouts - which Roblox describes as "things like vibe games, clubs, socialising and supportive spaces where the primary theme or purpose of the experience is to communicate (e.g. in text or voice chat) with other users as yourself" - as well as in "free-form user creation" where users can draw in 2D or write without this text going through Roblox moderation. 
</p>
<p>
From 3rd December, unrated experiences will become "unplayable, unsearchable, and undiscoverable by users under the age of 13", Roblox wrote, though users will still be able to access them via a direct link. 
</p>
<p>
For now, creators are being asked to rate experiences themselves, with enforcement beginning properly in 2025. In future, rating experiences will be "closely integrated" into the publishing process, Roblox said. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-hit-dress-to-impress-removes-hotdog-outfit-after-players-use-it-to-dress-up-like-male-genitalia">Roblox viral hit Dress to Impress removed a Halloween hotdog costume</a>, after players began using it to cosplay as male genitalia.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-2-remastered-art-pops-up-online-ahead-of-wow-direct<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Artwork and logos for Warcraft 2: Remastered have been spotted online, just a week away from Blizzard's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-announced">World of Warcraft Direct livestream</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Next week's event, set to celebrate 30 years of the Warcraft franchise, will be streamed online next Wednesday 13th November at 6pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
The timing of this leak, spotted by Wowhead after art turned up on Blizztracker, certainly suggests we'll hear more then. For now, the artwork shows characters aboard a piratical-looking sea vessel, under attack from fireballs. 
</p>
<p>
A remastered version of Warcraft 2 is a nice surprise, though perhaps not entirely unexpected following the launch of Warcraft 3 Reforged. 
</p>

<p>
Blizzard's revamp of the seminal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-3-reforged-houses-a-fantastic-rts-but-blizzard-has-fluffed-the-remake">Warcraft 3 improved the game's visuals</a>, added missions from an original demo and made balance changes. Overall, though, it was largely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-3-reforged-is-the-lowest-user-scored-game-on-metacritic">panned on release</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Criticisms included its reliance on the original Warcraft 3's archaic user interface and main menu, and lack of polish for most cut-scenes. Its launch also saw the original Warcraft 3 client scrubbed from Battle.net - a particular bugbear for fans. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-addresses-fan-complaints-following-controversial-warcraft-3-reforged-launch">Blizzard apologised</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-changes-refund-policy-for-warcraft-3-reforged-to-allow-refunds-upon-request">changed its refund policy</a> as a result, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-details-shambolic-leadership-decisions-behind-blizzards-disastrous-warcraft-3-remake">the damage was done</a>.
</p>
<p>
It'll be interesting to see how Blizzard plans to remaster Warcraft 2 in response to all of that.
</p>
<p>While we wait, it's worth looking back at this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modders-are-building-a-warcraft-2-remake-in-warcraft-3-reforged">fan attempt to remake Warcraft 2 within Warcraft 3 Reforged</a>, thanks to the power of mods.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Here is something I wasn't expecting to say today. The director's cut of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> is available on Xbox Series X/S now.</p>
<p>"It is my pleasure to finally announce that Death Stranding Director's Cut will be delivered to Xbox players," creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> said today. "I would like to thank all the fans who have stayed connected with us as well as everyone in the Xbox community who have been patiently waiting. Kojima Productions (Death Stranding) will continue to connect more and more players around the world, so please stay tuned."</p>

<p>In addition to Xbox, the director's cut version of the game - described as the "definitive vision" of Death Stranding - is also available on PC and PS5. </p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut "challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic 'Death Stranding' event", the official blurb reads. "This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America."</p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut on Series X/S includes support for Xbox Achievements. In addition, this version of the game also boasts features such as Photo Mode.</p>
<p>Those interested can scoop up Death Stranding Director's Cut for just £18 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p?dm_i=74N0,SXRP,1MPOSW,3X2YT,1">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">PC</a>. This deal is only available for a limited time, with the full price being £35. There is also an upgrade option for players who already own Death Stranding on PC. It remains full price on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01968_00-DEATHSTRANDINGEU">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>Along with today's Xbox news, Kojima Productions also announced it now has full ownership of the Death Stranding IP.</p>

Last year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie"> American film and TV production company A24 had partnered with Kojima Productions</a> to bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">live-action Death Stranding movie to life</a>.

</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is also in the works. Subtitled On the Beach, we got another look at the upcoming game back in September. This included its very realistic photo mode and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion</a>, Dollman.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hideo Kojima said he knew Death Stranding 2's release date already, but he refrained from sharing that news with the public. The developer said while he and his team were working "in preparation" for the release date, he could not confirm it until "some point next year".</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-release-date-wont-be-revealed-until-some-point-next-year">appears to still be on course for a 2025 release</a>, however. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has an upbeat outlook on this year's Borderlands film, and said that the  "disappointing" movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that the Borderlands film did not take off to the degree many had hoped and will not exactly go down in a Hall of Fame alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">HBO's The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">Amazon's Fallout</a>, both of which were praised by fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>Alas, for poor ol' Borderlands, this year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was instead branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. Eesh. The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>

<p>Zelnick commented on the film's performance last night during an earnings call for Take-Two. When an investor asked about the project and how it contributed to the company, Zelnick stated Take Two didn't "really need to break out the contribution from the film because while it was economically positive, it wasn't material" to the company's results.</p><p>"Even though the film was disappointing, it actually benefited our catalogue sales," he continued. "So that is a sign that making a movie or a television show based on our very high-quality IP can drive catalogue sales and that can be a good thing."</p>
<p>That's not to say Take-Two is now going to go all in on film and television adaptations for its various IPs.</p>
<p>"All that said, we're really selective. And one of the reasons we have been so selective about licensing is we would really prefer that everything that comes out with our brands in it is really, really successful," Zelnick stated. "And we can't guarantee that, especially when it's out of our hands. So we have licensed other titles, we'll continue selectively… emphasis on the word selectively."</p>
<p>I now wonder what could be next...?</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> publisher Take-Two has doubled down on the game's expected late 2025 launch window, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">following earlier rumours that Rockstar could still delay</a> the game's arrival.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's latest financial briefing last night pinned GTA6 to "fall of calendar [year] 2025", as previously expected. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming launches from the publisher include Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country - both of which simply have "fiscal 2026" launch dates. That means they'll arrive between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026.

Judas, the long-in-development next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine, is listed with no firm launch window at all, meanwhile - it's simply down as "TBA". 
</p>
<p>
Back in February 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">Take-Two had the game listed as launching by the end of March 2025</a> - something the publisher is no longer stating. We got a quick look at the game in December 2022 at The Game Awards (it looked a lot like BioShock!) and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">saw a bit more in January of this year</a>, but have heard nothing more since.
</p>
<p>
Levine's last game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, launched in 2013 - over a decade ago.

<p>For now, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - also released a decade ago - continues to "outperform" sales expectations, specifically through "sustained engagement" (and spending) in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Sales of Grand Theft Auto V outperformed our expectations and to date, the title has sold more than 205m units worldwide," Zelnick said. "Grand Theft Auto Online also exceeded our plans, driven by sustained engagement with the summer content pack Bottom Dollar Bounties and an array of updates, including the new multistage Assault on ATT-16 [ph] mode and experience improvements such as a new anti-cheat system for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto Online."</p><p>Membership of the GTA+ subscription grew by 35 percent this year, Zelnick continued, as it added Rockstar classics such as Bully. Red Dead Redemption 2 has also continued to sell, and is now up to 67m sold since launch six years ago.</p>
<p>Zelnick previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-wont-be-on-a-subscription-service-on-day-one-because-take-twos-decisions-are-rational-says-ceo">not to expect GTA 6 to launch via any kind of subscription service</a>, such as Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, because Take-Two's "decisions are rational".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
