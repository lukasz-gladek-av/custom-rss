            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> released for PC via Steam and Epic just yesterday, Thursday, 30th January, but it's already sitting on a "mixed" rating on Steam.</p>
<p>Almost half of the 2100 user reviews left on the Steam storefront cite issues with bugs, stabilisation, and crashes, with one <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/goobywooby1234/recommended/2651280/">saying</a>: "Devs that ported this should be embarrassed. Optimisation is incredibly poor".</p>

<p>The issues persist even for those with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/neodemio/recommended/2651280/">higher-end PCs running the latest drivers</a>.</p>
<p>"Hold off on buying until they get a couple of stabilisation patches out because holy hell," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047951793/recommended/2651280/">said</a> one reviewer who felt obliged to share their experience after just half an hour with the game.</p>
<p>"To say this is 'rough' is an understatement. Lighting doesn't load in some cutscenes, those same scenes run at seconds-per-frame, audio desync issues up the wazoo, freezing, stuttering, and just about every other performance issue I can think of.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna get a refund for now because frankly, there's other stuff I could use $70 for right now."</p>
<p>Even players who leave a positive thumbs-up are taking the time to caution others.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the launch is pretty bad," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ravyyyyyyy/recommended/2651280/">added</a> another player. "Crashes every 20 minutes or so if you have turned ON the Frame Generation (which, guess what, is turned ON by default). A bit of stuttering here and there. The hair on the models looks awful. OH! And the biggest issue I had, was that I tried to delete my saves so I can start a New Game (you can't do that until you get rid of the old one), and I couldn't do that, seems it wasn't working. I had to disable the Steam Cloud, manually delete the save, and only then it worked. BIG OOF.</p>
<p>"Other than that, haven't had any other problems.</p>
<p>"I am only recommending it because I believe they will solve these issues, as they have pushed a minor patch after the launch, and because I am a Spider-Man fan."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Sony confirmed it was dropping its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">formerly mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements across a select number of its predominantly single-player titles on PC</a>, but introduced in-game content "benefits" as an incentive to continue using one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> network test codes haven't even been distributed yet, but a number of scalpers are trying their luck and listing their free, currently non-existent codes for hundreds of pounds on auction sites.</p>
<p>Whilst eBay has reportedly delisted some egregious auctions, you don't have to look very hard to find listings with Buy it Now prices of £150, £200, and even £400.</p>

<p>Although those lucky enough to have been selected don't yet have their codes to hand, scalpers are sharing screenshots of their FromSoftware email as "evidence" with promises that the code will be "emailed directly" when they're distributed on 11th February.</p>

<p>It seems <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> fans aren't quite as rabid for these codes as scalpers would like, however; from what we can <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=nightreign+elden+ring&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;rt=nc&amp;LH_Sold=1&amp;LH_Complete=1">see</a>, no one has actually bought one just yet.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-beta-test-dates-times-register">Elden Ring Nightreign beta test</a> - available across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S - is scheduled for 14th to 17th February, and will run in three-hour blocks. On the 14th, the session will run between 11am and 2pm UK time, and there's two sessions on the 15th - 3am until 6am and again 7pm and 10pm. The session on the 16th will run between 11am and 2pm, with the final session on 17th running from 3am until 6am.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ridge-racer-64">Ridge Racer 64</a> is now available for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers.</p>

<p>Released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo states this "arcade classic" takes you on "fast-paced races across three different environments for a total of nine courses".</p>
<p>"Dive right in with Quick Play to race three laps around the Revolution Novice course or take on Grand Prix and choose any available track to test your skills," the blurb teases. </p>
<p>"Other modes include Car Attack, which lets you compete for better cars, and Time Attack, where the only thing you're racing against is your own best time! Challenge your friends in Multiplayer and put the pedal to the metal in three modes: Battle Mode, Stage Mode, and Team Mode."</p>
<p>Last week we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-online-adds-three-more-snes-games-promising-puzzles-brawls-and-ninjas">Nintendo added another three classic games to its SNES Switch Online collection</a>, including one not seen in the west before: Fatal Fury 2, and Super Ninja Boy.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, Nintendo Switch Online is Nintendo's answer to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus</a>. </p>
<p>It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-must-pay-to-play-nintendo-switch-online-from-next-week">launched back in 2018</a>, and marks the first time Nintendo has locked the ability to play multiplayer games online behind a paid service. To sweeten the deal, Nintendo has thrown in a wealth of additional perks like cloud saves, game trials, and exclusive money-saving offers - not to mention a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">whole library of classic Nintendo titles</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
