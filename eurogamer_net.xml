            <p>The annual cascade of Summer Game Fest broadcasts formally begins tonight with the Opening Showcase at 10pm UK time (11pm CEST/5pm EDT/2pm PDT). We'll report all of the major announcements from it here, as they happen, while also chatting with you. So grab a tea or a coffee, or something harder if you like, and join us for the show.</p>
<p>Tonight's Opening Showcase is expected to be a long one with a projected runtime of around two hours. It'll be hosted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, as ever, although he'll be joined this year by friend-of-Eurogamer Lucy James, which is nice. You'll know her from GameSpot.</p>
<p>Keighley has kept a tight lid on announcements for tonight, although a couple of <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1930630371760361955">promo reels for the show</a> have included footage from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, new James Bond game 007: First Light, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and a bunch of other games I don't immediately recognise. There's also been an uptick in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-just-got-a-sneaky-teaser-by-capcom-fans-believe">Resident Evil 9 speculation</a> ahead of the show, suggesting a possible unveiling tonight. Wouldn't that be nice?</p>

<p>This week's gaming festivities were kicked off on Wednesday by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">a PlayStation State of Play broadcast</a>, which unveiled 007: First Light to the world, resurrected Capcom's lost-in-development Pragmata, debuted Silent Hill F, revealed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lumines">Lumines</a> game, and more.</p>
<p>Tonight's Opening Showcase will be followed directly by Day of the Devs, and then by a packed weekend of broadcasts including an Xbox Showcase on Sunday at 6pm UK time. I'll return to live-report that show. We've compiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams#section-7">a full Summer Games Fest 2025 schedule</a> elsewhere on the site.</p>
<p>Join us shortly before 10pm UK time for the show. In the meantime, speculate away - what would you like to see?</p><div data-live="true">

Good afternoon! Here we go, then. This is the big one. There should at least be an announcement or two in here to get excited about. Ian Higton just made a good point while asking what the rooster or chicken was about in the headline image, to which I said "I don't know" because I didn't put it there - the Summer Games Fest Twitter/X account did. Could it be a nod to Fable 4?

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has acquired a 15.75 percent stake in Arrowhead Games - the development studio behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> - for $80m.</p>
<p>Tencent has previously founded or acquired shares in a variety of video game companies, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">including a new gaming venture with Ubisoft Games</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-acquires-riot-games-for-around-usd400-million">total ownership of Riot Games</a>, a major <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/den-of-wolves-is-an-intriguing-sci-fi-heist-fps-from-payday-veterans-gtfo-studio">ownership position for 10 Chamber</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-launches-new-publishing-division-level-infinite-dedicated-to-delivering-high-quality-games-to-a-global-audience">its own publishing arm Level Infinite</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.di.se/digital/spelsuccen-gor-729-mkr-i-vinst-tencent-koper-in-sig/">Speaking to DI</a>, founder John Pilestedt stated that bringing Tencent in as partial owners "opens up opportunities for China as a market. Gaining access to the Chinese player base is the holy grail in the gaming industry."</p>

<p>The remaining 84.25 percent of shares are owned by Arrowhead founders Johan Pilestedt, Emil Englund, Malin Hedstrom, Peter Lindgren, and Anton Stenmark.</p>
<p>A recent financial report reviewed by DI stated Arrowhead had a turnover of 959m SEK, which is around Â£73,736,551 / $99,877,484.85 / â‚¬87,516,806.33, and an operating profit of 729m SEK which is Â£56,052,445.50 / $75,911,192.99 / â‚¬66,526,965.99. That's a lot of cash!</p>
<p>Not too much of a surprise, considering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">Helldivers 2 was PlayStation's fastest selling game ever.</a> The game had recently found itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">the stage for an invasion of Super Earth itself</a> which revitalised the game's player base to its highest point since that period of intense launch hype.</p>
<p>All the while Arrowhead bosses remain supportive of the pursuit of new and interesting ideas rather than trend chasing, with Pilestadt stating at GDC that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-boss-says-industry-doomed-to-unnecessarily-brutal-layoffs-while-chasing-after-the-battle-royales">the industry is doomed to "unnecessary layoffs" by "chasing after the battle royales</a>".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
