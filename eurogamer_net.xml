            <p>Every month Xbox gives and and it takes. While we get new games added to Xbox Game Pass throughout each month, in the middle and the end of the month we also see a bunch of games leave the service.</p>
<p>At the end of August the following games will leave Game Pass according to the recently updated Xbox App:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition</li>
<li>Sea of Stars</li>
<li>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay</li>
<li>This War of Mine: Final Cut</li>
<li>Ben 10: Power Trip</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those games, there are a couple of standouts that you should try to play before they leave Game Pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> is a three-player co-op turn-based RPG that Eurogamer awarded 4 stars in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-review">Sea of Stars review</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a>: Final Cut is the game 11 bit made before going on to create <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and The Alters.</p>
<blockquote><p>In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Borderlands 3</a> Ultimate Edition has its fans (not everyone enjoyed what Gearbox did with the third game in the series), and you might want to give it a whirl ahead of Borderlands 4 releasing in September.</p>

            <p>Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have released a brand new trailer for the upcoming Pokémon Legends: Z-A, plus detailed how the new Link Battles work.</p>
<p>As the trailer below shows, the Z-A Battle Club is welcoming new entrants to take part in its four-player battles, with the goal being to defeat as many of your opponents' Pokémon as possible within the time given.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Intense four-player Link Battles in the Z-A Battle Club</strong></p>

</figure>
<p>The Z-A Battle Club is ready for its newest Link Battle entrants! Up to four players can take part in battles where they attempt to defeat as many of each other’s Pokémon as they can within the three-minute time limit.</p>
<p>When any of your Pokémon faint, you will return to your starting point and reenter the battle with all your Pokémon fully recovered. Defeating an opponent’s Pokémon earns you a point, and those points determine your ranking. Mega Power orbs, which can be collected to Mega Evolve your Pokémon, may also appear around the stage, as well as items to boost your Pokémon’s stats temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time battling gets serious</strong></p>
<p>In this title’s new battle system, some moves may work differently than in prior games in the Pokémon series. Moves have a wide range of effects—launching attacks in a fixed radius to deal damage to multiple Pokémon at once, targeting distant Pokémon by attacking in a straight line, and more. Launch attacks from places your opponents don’t expect or sweep through groups of opponents as you lead your partner Pokémon to victory by making full use of a variety of moves.</p>
<p><strong>Climb the ranks to earn rewards</strong></p>
<figure>

<p>Test your real-time battling skills against Trainers around the world in Ranked Battles. You’ll earn points based on your placement in four-player Link Battles, and may earn an additional kicker based on your performance. Similar to the main story, you’ll start off at Rank Z and can climb the ranks to the ultimate Rank A.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy real-time battles with your friends</strong></p>
<p>Looking to settle who’s the best Trainer once and for all? Challenge your friends in Private Battles! You can input a Link Code to connect with nearby players using local communication or distant players online. Once you’re all connected, you can adjust the battle rules to your liking and battle against up to three other players.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link Battles can be played between Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A with the upgrade pack applied.</li>
<li>A paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is required to participate in battles via the internet.</li>
<li>In order to enjoy online play, you will need to have downloaded the latest update data.</li>
<li>The Pokémon Video Game Championships at the 2026 Pokémon World Championships will be played on <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/">Pokémon Champions</a>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is set for rlease on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> on 16th October.</p>
