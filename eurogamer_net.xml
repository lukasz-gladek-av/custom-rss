            <p>
Dragon Age creator David Gaider has discussed taking on the writing of fan-favourite recurring character Cassandra in Dragon Age Inquisition, following the departure of a BioWare colleague. 
</p>
<p>
In Gaider's latest and seemingly last social media thread discussing the series' characters he worked on, the former franchise boss said that Cassandra's romance had been difficult to pin down.
</p>
<p>
Cassandra was originally being written in Inquisition by Jennifer Hepler, a veteran of the series who previously worked on Origins, Awakening and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>. But Hepler left BioWare during Inquisition's development "around the time a bunch of GamerGate dudes decided Jennifer was somehow responsible for ALL of BioWare's faults," Gaider wrote. "The result was a LOT of ugly harassment." 
</p>
<p>
"Is this why she left? You'd have to ask her, but it undoubtedly didn't help," he continued. "The important thing is, she left - and there was nobody as senior nor as superhumanly fast as her to take over any unfinished work."
</p><p>
Gaider ended up taking on Cassandra himself, but says he struggled with how a "pious, self-righteous character" would have romantic appeal. The solution came after he found a webcomic created by a fan which joked about Cassandra secretly being something of a fangirl for Varric's books.

This is the last of the (major) characters I wrote during my time on Dragon Age. I could go into others, and considered moving  onto Stray Gods... but I feel like fewer would be interested, and I honestly can't keep up the pace. So let's make this the last, for now.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn/post/3lbyp7wi2h225?ref_src=embed">[image or embed]</a></p></div>— David Gaider (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn?ref_src=embed">@davidgaider.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn/post/3lbyp7wi2h225?ref_src=embed">November 28, 2024 at 8:59 AM</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
This prompted Gaider to reconsider Cassandra's "idealistic and awkward passion", and the fact she had put the player character - the Inquistor - on a "messianic pedestal" for being the Herald of Andraste and leader of the Inquisition. In the final game, settling down with Cassandra essentially requires the Inquisitor to convince her they can still be a normal romantic partner in addition to all that.
</p>
<p>
Cassandra ended up being Inquisition's most-chosen romance option, Gaider confirmed, "by a good margin". The least, again "by a good margin" was Dorian. 
</p>
<p>Gaider has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-writer-probably-cried-harder-than-i-ever-have-in-my-life-writing-dorians-story">previously discussed writing Dorian's story</a> and the personal inspiration he drew from to do that, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-once-planned-to-let-you-import-your-grey-warden-hero-from-origins-into-dragon-age-inquisition">early plans to let you bring your Grey Warden character from Dragon Age Origins into Inquisition</a>.</p>

            <p>
Open world pocket monster survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> will gain a major new update in December, that adds its largest new landmass yet. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld has also announced the game's first big brand crossover, too - a tie-up with hit indie crafting game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a>. Exactly what this will entail remains to be seen, but artwork posted to social media this week shows characters from the two games interacting ahead of the crossover happening at some point in 2025.

<p>
Before that, December's content update will add a new island to Palworld, that's "the largest, harshest, and most mysterious new island" yet, according to a social media <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861922963936923656">post</a> by developer Pocketpair. </p>
<p>For scale, the area will be "about six times more than Sakurajima!!!" the company continued. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld is also currently 25 percent off, presumably in time for Black Friday, and before Nintendo's lawsuit risks the game getting shut down.

<p>
Of course, all of this is happening while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo readies its legal might to take on Palworld and developer Pocketpair</a> over claims the latter has infringed on a number of gameplay patents. These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">patents include recently-filed designs that cover the throwing of a Pokéball-like object to capture a creature</a>, something that both Pokémon (obviously) and Palworld both contain.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">seeking injunction against Palworld's sale (at least in Japan) plus a fine and damages</a>, Pocketpair itself stated earlier this month. Pocketpair has said repeatedly it will fight the case.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, we highlighted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">new Tencent open world game that looks like it has ripped off both Horizon: Forbidden West and Palworld</a>.
