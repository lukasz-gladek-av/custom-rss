</p>
<p>
In addition to this month's titles, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-february-star-wars-jedi-survivor-topspin-2k25-lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-and-more/">teased a look ahead</a> for its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium services.

<p>
On top of that, a trio of shooters from FromSoftware's beloved Armored Core mech series -  Armored Core, Armored Core Project Phantasma, and Armored Core Master of Arena - are set to hit PlayStation Premium "soon".
</p>
<p>
All this follows Sony's announcement last month that it'll be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-shifting-focus-to-ps5-games-next-year-will-only-occasionally-include-ps4-titles">shifting the focus of its PlayStation Plus monthly games and Game Catalogue updates toward PlayStation 5</a> titles starting early next year. After that, PlayStation 4 games will only "occasionally" feature.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has a PC release on the way, due in June this year with additional content.
</p>
<p>
The sci-fi action game released last year on PS5 and has proven to be a massive success for its developer Shift Up.
</p>
<p>
A PC release was expected, though not yet dated, with the company stating in its latest financial results earlier this week it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">expects the PC release to exceed sales of those on console</a>.

<p>
"We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry," it said, likely alluding to the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.
</p>
<p>
The additional content from the above trailer will probably be the various updates added to the game since release, including the Nier: Automata DLC, photo mode, and perhaps its Christmas-themed update.
</p>
<p>
What's also coming, though, is a Goddess of Victory: Nikke DLC on console, and presumably PC too. It's set to arrive in June alongside the PC release.
</p>
<p>
That's Shift Up's other big franchise - a free-to-play mobile game with gacha mechanics - so it's no surprise to see them crossover here. It looks like it will include new playable levels, as well as new costumes (of course!).
