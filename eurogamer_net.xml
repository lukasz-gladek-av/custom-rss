            <p>There's good news for those wanting to try The First Berserker: Khazan before they buy - a free demo is on the way.</p>
<p>From 16th January, a slice of Khazan will be playable on PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. With no expiry date, it'll be available for anyone looking to give it a go even after the game launches on 27th March 2025.</p>

<p>That said, developer Neople have yet to confirm if this demo will differ from that previously available, nor has it clarified if progress will carry over to the main game. (We'll let you know just as soon as the developer itself updates us).</p><div>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan demo will be available from 3pm UK time (7am PT, 10am ET). Described as "a hardcore action role-playing game", you'll play as the titular Khazan who "overcame death and sets out to reveal the incidents that led to his downfall and seek vengeance on his enemies".</p>
<p>Another "hardcore" game will be playable soon, of course - you will shortly be able to register to take part in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/network-test-registration-for-elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-starts-in-just-a-few-hours-time">network test for Elden Ring's upcoming co-op spin-off, Nightreign</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Those who are keen to participate in the test can register from this afternoon at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>The test itself is scheduled for 14th to 17th February, and will run in three hour blocks. On the 14th (so, Valentine's Day, and really, what is more romantic than Elden Ring?), the session will run between 11am and 2pm UK time. On the 15th, there will be two sessions. The first will run from 3am until 6am, the second will run between 7pm and 10pm. The session on the 16th will run between 11am and 2pm once again, and the final session on 17th will run from 3am until 6am.</p>

<p>Nightreign's test will be available across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, although the developer notes the full game will also be available to those on PC via Steam, as well as Xbox One and PS4 consoles.</p>
<p>"The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch," reads the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test">information page for Nightreign's network test</a> (where I also presume a link for registration will also be made available). </p>
<p>"Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has shared a new Group Customer Harassment Policy to protect its workers from toxic fan behaviour.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/customer_harassment_policy.html">policy</a> states there are instances where "certain customers take actions... that constitute 'customer harassment'" of employees, be that through violence, defamation, intimidation or other means.</p>
<p>"Such actions do not only prevent our employees and partners from engaging in their work with a sense of security but also causes disruptions to other customers," the policy reads. "Square Enix will not tolerate harassment and will take action as necessary."</p>

<p>Alongside a definition of what it deems to be harassment, the company said it reserves the right to cease providing support services or products, and to protect employees through legal action or criminal proceedings.</p>
<p>The policy does not specify examples of this harassment, though it's clearly been put in place as the result of such behaviour.</p>
<p>In particular, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> fandom is notorious for divided opinions on Aerith and Tifa and their relationships with Cloud.</p>
<p>"I say this with love: FF7 shippers need to touch noses," said Aerith voice actor Briana White back in December. "We're all the same family in loving these characters so relax."</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">When my sibling &amp; I would fight as kids, my mom would tell us to touch noses until we inevitably started giggling and got over it. I say this with love: FF7 shippers need to touch noses. We're all the same family in loving these characters so relax 💕</p>— Briana White (@ItsBrianaWhite) <a href="https://twitter.com/ItsBrianaWhite/status/1869877671628607729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Last January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-shippers-ruin-great-story-development-with-overt-sexualisation-says-cloud-voice-artist">Cloud voice actor Cody Christian</a> said shippers "ruin great story development" with overt sexualisation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> producer and director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has addressed abuse against the game's developers on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Back in January 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-naoki-yoshida-addresses-verbal-abuse-from-players">Yoshida addressed abuse aimed at developers</a>. "I mean, I can take it, even though it doesn't make it less bad, but staff members will feel really down after getting those words when they gave their absolute best into trying to create something where everyone can enjoy, and this may end up making them no longer create things that are fun from there on," he said.</p>
<p>Then last year, following the release of latest expansion Dawntrail, he commented on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/transphobic-abuse-sent-to-final-fantasy-14s-wuk-lamat-voice-actor-breaks-my-heart-says-naoki-yoshida">transphobic abuse sent to Wuk Lamat voice actor Sena Bryer</a>.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid one of our staff members received very negative comments and it almost felt like a personal attack, which breaks my heart, because she worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all," said Yoshida. "It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p>
<p>While Square Enix should be commended for protecting its staff, it's sad that fan behaviour makes such a policy necessary.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks.1078821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>There has been a flurry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>-related news in recent days, but not from Nintendo itself. Now, the Mario maker has broken its silence on the week's reports.</p>
<p>During this week's CES trades show in Las Vegas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">reportedly-accurate models of Nintendo's under-wraps Switch 2 were shown off</a> by accessories manufacturer Genki. Several images and videos of this model were subsequently shared across social media (as you can see below). It is worth noting that Genki has since said <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/01/10/148376.html">its model was created based only on leaked information from the industry</a>, and it has not actually seen a Switch 2 console. </p>
<p>Nintendo has now issued a statement to Japanese newspaper <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250110-XHI3U6QWZ5CZ7IFGTGUGJUVH4A/">The Sankei Shimbun</a>, telling the world that those images and videos making the rounds are "not official".</p>

</figure>
<p>Here's the very to the point, translated statement from the article: "The images and videos, they are not official."</p>
<p>While this statement is fairly innocuous in a lot of ways, and not exactly surprising given we already knew it was not Nintendo itself showcasing the hardware, this marks the first acknowledgement by the company that these leaks are even happening at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has not actually said anything about the accuracy of the third-party Switch 2 model which has been shown.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>In addition to that mock Switch 2 model, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">yesterday we had some further console leaks</a>. Purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards started showing up. Meanwhile, another report suggested Nintendo's upcoming console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock. There were also some new murmurings over the Switch 2's optical sensor.</p><p>Nintendo will be sharing something official on its Switch successor soon enough, though. It previously confirmed we would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-switch-2-still-on-course-for-announcement-before-end-of-fiscal-year">receive a proper announcement before the close of the fiscal year</a>, which ends 31st March. What we do know for sure is that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bald headed assassin simulator Hitman: World of Assassination has amassed an impressive body count of 75 million players.
</p>
<p>
World of Assassination was originally launched in 2021 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S under the name of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-3">Hitman 3</a>, and was then retitled two years later when content from the trilogy's other games was added in. 
</p>
<p>
Today, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is celebrating the game's continued success. A million players logged on in December alone, the studio said, lured in by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-next-elusive-target-is-jean-claude-the-splitter-van-damme">fresh mission starring 90s action hero Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>.

<p>
Many of those players will likely be people sampling the game via its Free Starter Pack option, which also currently lets you take down Van Damme as one of the game's limited-time Elusive Targets. 
</p>
<p>
Amusingly, IO says that only 40 percent of players who attempted to take down Van Damme have been successful at doing so. (The developer tracked the longest successful attempt at seven hours, with the shortest just 21 seconds.)
</p>
<p>
Van Damme disappears from the game as an Elusive Target at the end of this weekend, on Sunday 12th January, but you can buy permanent access to a mission featuring the star in a £4 DLC mission pack.
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, IO says it is working on more content for Hitman to release later this year - though there's no details yet on what. 
</p>
<p>
IO is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">its under-wraps James Bond 007 game</a> and a mysterious fantasy game project. Additionally, the company is now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">handling publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, the AAA game from former GTA producer Leslie Benzies.

            <p>As hundreds of thousands of people are placed under evacuation orders, the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/la-wildfires-everything-we-know-about-the-ferocious-fires-battering-california-13285835">devastating wildfires sweeping across Los Angeles</a> are not just impacting residents but developers based in the Californian city, too.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, Riot, and other video game companies have reached out to employees, with Riot telling staff to take care of themselves ahead of work.</p>
<p>"For Rioters reading this, please remember, the mission and the work will always be there. Right now, what matters most is taking care of yourselves and each other," said Riot Games CEO, A. Dylan Jadeja on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adjadeja_i-want-to-thank-everyone-who-has-reached-activity-7283170938265772034-AH0e/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>"As a leader, you feel a responsibility to say something and to do something in moments like these. But what do you say when frankly there are no words? Nothing can be said to truly acknowledge the pain and suffering that we are witnessing unfold in the communities so many of us call home. The ongoing wildfires across greater Los Angeles have upended lives, displaced families, and devastated communities. Tens of thousands of homes are at risk, and the scale of loss is heartbreaking - more than anyone should have to bear.</p><p>"It's too early for anyone to know exactly what will be needed or what can be done in the aftermath of this. The reality is… we are still in the middle of it. But when the time is right, Riot will be ready to stand up for Los Angeles and give back in every way we can to all of these communities that mean so much to who we are. After all, while our reach is global, the heart of Riot Games has always been in Los Angeles. Los Angeles raised us and we are proud to call this great city our home."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/2025-la-firestorm-palisades-games-industry/">PC Gamer</a> that it was "actively monitoring the situation" whilst providing "resources" to those impacted by the fires.</p>
<p>"Employee safety and well-being is our top priority," an Activision spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"We're actively monitoring the situation as it is quickly evolving. We've been in contact with the employees closest to the impacted areas to confirm their safety and provide resources."</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that the same disastrous fires burning across multiple districts of Los Angeles have also shut down production across Hollywood, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">impacting the filming of Fallout season 2 and a raft of other projects</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
