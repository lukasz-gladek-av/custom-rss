            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper">Citizen Sleeper</a> creator Gareth Damian Martin has said their warm-hearted series of sci-fi video games will end with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>, which releases 31st January. However, Citizen Sleeper as a series of games won't necessarily end there.</p>
<p>The intention, as Martin laid it out to me in a recent interview, is to create a full tabletop role-playing version of the game, and thereby handover future adventures in the series to the TTRPG space that has so inspired it.</p>

<p>Responding to whether that would be it for Citizen Sleeper games after the sequel, Martin replied: "I think it is for video games. I'll leave myself a backdoor somewhere that I can climb through and dig it out the grave again... But no. I think especially the ending - and I hope people feel this when they reach the ending - I really felt like, okay, this is me saying the final word on it. I really like where I'm leaving it. I'm really happy with that.</p><p>"But Citizen Sleeper has meant a lot to a lot of people and so I'm not about to leave that behind," they added. "The next big project for me will be to work on a Citizen Sleeper tabletop game in full, but I need to find the right collaborator and I need to work that out, and I need to do that alongside other stuff. So that's something that will be a more long-term project."</p>
<p>Martin has collaborated on tabletop projects before. Their game <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lonearchivist/iow-tidebreak">In Other Waters was adapted for tabletop via a collaboration by Lone Archivist</a>, and <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/cyclesoftheeye">Citizen Sleeper was adapted into a solo, tarot-based tabletop game</a> with Alfred Valley's help, so there's a strong precedent there.</p>
<p>The video game Martin will make next is actually the game they were pitching to their publisher Fellow Traveller before development on Citizen Sleeper 2 began. It was only the runaway success of Citizen Sleeper 1 - now at one million players and counting - that derailed those plans, turning Martin's head towards add-on content and, eventually, a sequel.</p>
<p>"I was actually already pitching my next game, which was not Citizen Sleeper 2, to my publisher," they said. "That's actually going to be the next game."</p>

<p>Citizen Sleeper 2 arrives to much anticipation on 31st January. Demos have already given us a glimpse of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/citizen-sleeper-2-goes-even-harder-on-its-rpg-roots-with-its-bold-new-twists-on-its-tabletop-dice-rolls">a game that's quite different from Citizen Sleeper 1</a>, with a much stronger sense of tension in it and more developed, and distinct, role-playing systems. The changes work brilliantly; this could be special.</p><p>The development cycle, however, hasn't been easy. Personal challenges, as well as the pressure of living up to expectations, have made life difficult, I discovered speaking with Martin. Success, as much as we court it, can be hard to deal with.</p>
<p>Look out for my full Citizen Sleeper interview soon.</p>

<p>As is the case with every month, the arrival of these new games means that others will be leaving Game Pass. The following games will leave the service on 15th January:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common' Hood (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Escape Academy (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Exoprimal (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Figment (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Insurgency Sandstorm (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Those Who Remain (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them. On the plus side, Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
<p>For everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, you can check out our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Xbox Game Pass guide</a> detailing the many titles available.</p></div>
