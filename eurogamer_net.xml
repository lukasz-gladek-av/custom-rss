<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> Remastered - the Unreal Engine 5 spruce-up of developer Frogwares' 2019 Lovecraft-inspired detective adventure - has slithered out of its tenebrous seclusion sooner than expected, and is available now for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
For the uninitiated, The Sinking City tells the story of troubled private investigator Charles Reed as he travels to the supernaturally flooded city of Oakmont, Massachusetts, in search of a way to quell his hellish visions. There's a bit of gunplay as the cosmic horror begins to take hold, but mostly it's a game of exploration and investigation, playing out across a series of open-ended cases and the titular open world.
</p>
<p>
All that's true of The Sinking City Remastered, of course, but Frogwares is also promising an "upgraded visual experience alongside some requested quality-of-life features". There's talk of enhanced and fully relit locations with additional levels of detail and objects, for instance, alongside 4K textures, improved reflections, "various" gameplay adjustments, and new accessibility features. There's also a photo mode and, on PC at least, support for the likes of DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling.

<p>
To mark The Sinking City Remastered's arrival, Frogwares has released a new trailer showcasing some of the differences between the 2019 original and its new Unreal Engine 5 update. And if that's got you in the mood for some eldritch adventuring, The Sinking City Remastered gets its digital release today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/750130/The_Sinking_City_Remastered/">Steam</a>, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S - and it'll be available as a free upgrade for all existing owners.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares' remaster comes ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-smashes-crowdfunding-goal-in-less-than-a-day">successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter</a> earlier this year. The sequel is again set in 1920s America, but this time sees players exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham in an survival horror-style adventure said to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor</a> in favour of combat and exploration.
</p>
<p>
All this activity follows Frogwares' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-now-sole-publisher-of-the-sinking-city-following-dispute-with-nacon">lengthy dispute with publisher Nacon</a> over the rights to the original The Sinking City. Since a resolution was last year, the studio has taken over as The Sinking City's publisher, updated the Steam build, and released new DLC. The Ukrainian studio also found time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">crowdfund and release 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened</a>, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sherlock-holmes-developer-frogwares-shares-update-on-life-in-ukraine-amid-ongoing-war-with-russia">continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion</a>.
</p>
<p>
"We plan to do big things with The Sinking City IP, starting with the sequel and then beyond," Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Oganesyan wrote in a statement accompanying today's remaster news. "So, after our rather well-known struggles with the original, it feels amazing to have this positive moment be part of the game's twisted history and for us to be the ones to fully decide it. Making it free to all our existing fans is our way of giving back to them for having supported us all this time through thick and thin."

            <p>
The Fallout TV series has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime.
</p>
<p>
That's despite the show's second season still being months away - and indeed, we now know Fallout's next batch of episodes will debut in December 2025.
</p>
<p>
More than 100 million people have watched Fallout's first season to date, Amazon has revealed (thanks, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-renewed-season-3-release-date-season-2-1236394393/">Variety</a>), making it one of the streamer's top three launches ever.
</p>
<p>
Amazon is now moving quickly to make more of the show, and begin teasing its second batch of episodes with another longing look at the Las Vegas skyline at the end of the below trailer.

This video, released for Amazon's Upfront event, sees a pre-Ghoul Walton Goggins getting pitched advertising campaigns for various products (it's a humorous nod to Upfront itself, where Amazon seeks marketing pitches from brands). And yes - that is Amy Acker, AKA Fred from Angel! More of her character please.
</p>
<p>"We are absolutely thrilled that our global Prime Video customers will be able to delve deeper into the wonderfully surreal and captivating world of Fallout," said Amazon TV boss Vernon Sanders paying tribute to the show's writing and production teams. "Together with our amazing partners at Bethesda Games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda">Bethesda Softworks</a>, we are delighted to announce a third season of Fallout, well ahead of the much-anticipated debut of season two."</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-show-could-run-for-five-six-seasons-says-actor">Fallout actor Aaron Moten revealed that he expected the show to run for "five, six" seasons</a> in total.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> will release on PC next month, according to a trailer posted too early on the PlayStation YouTube channel and since removed.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-gets-confirmed-pc-release-and-goddess-of-victory-nikke-dlc">PC version of the action game was announced back in February</a> but without a full date. Now we know it will launch on 11th June across Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>The PC version will come with a number of extras, including an unlocked framerate, higher resolution environment textures, DLSS 4 and FSR 3, ultrawide monitor support, and more.</p>

<p>Further, there will be a new boss fight against cyber warrior Mann, as well as 25 new costumes for protagonist Eve.</p>
<p>Additional content from the console release will likely be included, like the NieR: Automata DLC and photo mode.</p>
<p>More DLC based on Shift Up's other big franchise Goddess of Victory: Nikke is also set to arrive on console alongside the PC release (and presumably on PC too), though it's not part of the leaked trailer - but is in the trailer above.</p>
<p>Shift Up stated in a financial report from February it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-pc-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-says-shift-up">expects the PC version to exceed console sales</a>.</p>
<p>"In the AAA game market, PC devices have a higher market share than consoles, so we expect the performance of the PC version to exceed that of the console version," the company said. "We are particularly observing trends such as the significant expansion of the single-player action game market in the Asian gaming industry."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stellar-blade-on-ps5-pro-a-simple-but-hugely-effective-upgrade">game received a PS5 Pro patch</a> in time for the new console's release, which Digital Foundry described as a "hugely effective upgrade". Soon we'll be able to see how the PC version compares.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
