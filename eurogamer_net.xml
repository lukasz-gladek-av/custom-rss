            <p>Dungeon party game King of Meat will host an invite-only alpha this December, and you can sign up now.</p>
<p>Announced at Summer Game Fest, King of Meat is the debut game from studio Glowmade (comprising ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers), with publishing from Amazon Games. It tasks players with creating outlandish dungeons and then completing them with others in online co-op.</p>
<p>The alpha will take place from 4th December to 14th December for PC (Steam) and Xbox Series X/S players in North America and Europe (the test will be in English only).</p>

<p>The alpha will include both dungeon creation and gameplay, giving players a well-rounded look at what to expect in the full release. You can take a look at gameplay in the above brand new explainer trailer.</p>
<p>There's currently no proper release date for the game, though it's expected to launch across PS5 and Switch alongside PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>The test itself is called<a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/news/articles/king-of-meat-lights-camera-alpha"> Lights, Camera, Alpha!</a> due to the TV show framework of the game, with this essentially being the pilot episode. The game is full of irreverent and silly humour as players take part in a televised gameshow to increase their fame.</p>
<p>You'd certainly expect that sort of humour from the developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/littlebigplanet">LittleBigPlanet</a> and Fable, though. I got to go <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">hands-on with King of Meat</a> earlier in the year and had a fun time with its chaotic action.</p>
<p>You can sign-up for the alpha test on the <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/tester-sign-up">King of Meat website</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Larian has reportedly posted a €249m (£207m) pre-tax profit for 2023. This is, of course, thanks in no small part to the runaway success of the Dungeons and Dragon's-based <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/dublin-firm-behind-baldurs-gate-game-posts-249m-profit-after-runaway-success/a2033961431.html">Irish Independent</a> [paywall], this bumper figure was shared within financial records posted by the Belgium-based holding company for Larian. The publication notes Larian had previously reported a loss of €214k (£178k), before Baldur's Gate 3 took the world by storm.</p>
<p>At the time of its publication, the Irish Independent stated Larian had sold approximately 15m copies of Baldur's Gate 3, and was able to pay out a €28m (£23m) dividend this year as a result of this. While Larian itself has never shared sales figures, earlier this year it was suggested that over 10m copies had been sold since Baldur's Gate 3's debut.</p>
<p>Larian's game was released on PC in August of 2023, before arriving on additional platforms. While of course <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-already-has-one-of-steams-highest-concurrent-player-counts-ever">being a hit on launch</a>, and going on to secure itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">swathes of industry praise and awards</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 has continued to prove popular.</p><p>Earlier this month, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-has-more-players-this-year-than-its-actual-launch-year">game's average daily peak concurrents are up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent this year over last year</a>. Meanwhile, its average daily active users are up by a more substantial 20 percent over last year.</p>
<p>Larian is still supporting Baldur's Gate 3 (the studio recently secured itself a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">nomination for Best Community Support at this year's Game Awards</a>). However, it also has other irons in the fire. The studio previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before it ultimately decided to try something new instead. </p>
<p>
Larian is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance.1044357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Sony is developing a portable version of the PlayStation 5, according to a new report. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch">Bloomberg</a> states that Sony's portable PS5 project is still in the "early stages" and might not ultimately reach the market.
</p>
<p>
However, Sony is reportedly keen to re-enter the handheld gaming market and compete with Nintendo Switch. In reality, that means with Nintendo's still-under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">which is expected to launch next year</a>.
</p>
<p>
Sony already has a portable device capable of playing PS5 games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-playstation-portal-review-impressive-hardware-but-is-remote-play-itself-good-enough">the PlayStation Portal</a> - although this is limited to playing streamed games only (initially from your own PS5 console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-portal-update-adds-cloud-gaming-support-in-beta-no-ps5-required">though now also via the cloud</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, Bloomberg states that Sony's initial plans for the PlayStation Portal were for it to function as a standalone device, akin to the Steam Deck.
</p>
<p>Such a device would also help Sony bridge the gap between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, its recent mid-gen console refresh, and the inevitable PS6, which isn't expected until nearer the end of the decade.</p>
<p>
PlayStation is, of course, no stranger to handheld gaming. The PSP constituted the only serious competition Nintendo ever had in the portable console market, and sold more than 76m units. But its successor, the PlayStation Vita, fared less well - and reportedly sold around 16m units.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-all-but-confirms-plans-for-xbox-portable-console">also has plans to launch an Xbox handheld</a>. Speaking this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Xbox boss Phil Spencer said his company's device was also several years away</a>, however.
