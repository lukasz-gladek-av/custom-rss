            <p>Nintendo has announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>: Definitive Edition, a souped up version of the acclaimed 2015 sci-fi action-RPG released on Wii U, which will bring enhanced visuals and more on its release next year.</p>
<p>"The year is 2054. Humans have fled Earth amidst a destructive intergalactic war. As one of the survivors and a member of the New Los Angeles (NLA) colony, the mission is to help build a new home on the sprawling, hostile planet Mira," the official blurb reads.</p>
<p>"This seamless open world across five otherworldly continents is teeming with unknown creatures â€“ some of which are epic in scale â€“ and players will fight for the future of humanity." You can check out a trailer for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition below.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will include added story elements, as well as customisable avatars on release. Meanwhile, players will be able unlock a "powerful" Skell, but only once they have done what they need to prove themselves to the BLADE organisation. A Skell, for those unfamiliar, is a giant mech that will aid in exploration across Mira.</p>
<p>The game will also feature some multiplayer-specific missions. Nintendo notes a Switch Online membership and a Nintendo Account are required for online play.</p>
<p>The addition of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition to the Switch library now means every game in the series is playable on one console, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> 1 - 3.</p>
<p>In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-a-jrpg-masterpiece">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 received a glowing review from Eurogamer</a> in 2022, described as "a JRPG masterpiece".</p>
<p>While Xenoblade Chronicles X shares thematic references with the other games in the series, it is a standalone story and considered one of the best games on the Wii U. Now it follows plenty of other Nintendo-published games with a swanky Switch port.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition will release on 20th March next year, for Nintendo Switch. No mention of that elusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> console.</p>
<p>If you are yet to play Xenoblade Chronicles X, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review">Eurogamer's original review from 2015</a>, where we called it "majestic, vibrant, almost peerlessly handsome".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Activision quality assurance staff who worked on the just-released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> have walked out in protest at the company's return-to-work policy.
</p>
<p>
Staff at Activision's quality assurance studio in Eden Prarie, Minnesota, were told to return to the office full-time back in January, after years of remote or hybrid working. At the time, <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/1851263877230612869">the move was criticised by the company's biggest union as a "soft layoff"</a>. Nine months later, the row over this policy's effects rumbles on. 
</p>
<p>
Last Friday, Eden Prarie staff members took strike action backed by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), which claimed in a <a href="https://www.cwa7250.org/index.php/11-news/303-activision-workers-to-rally-for-wfh-accommodations">statement</a> that Call of Duty publisher Activision was "insisting workers must work in the office - even those with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home". 
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the protest, Activision workers group ABetterABK issued a <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822">statement</a> saying the "unequal policy" had "unquestionably harmed disabled employees and employees in need of work from home accomodations", who it claims have been unfairly refused exception from return-to-office work in the months since the policy's introduction. 
</p><p>
So why strike now? Well, last Friday's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launch was an attention-grabbing date, for one. ABetterABK's statement also references employees being "disrespected" by a recent company email discussing this October's National Disability Employment Awareness Month.
</p>
<p>
"[The email] depicted a disabled person working from home while our coworkers in need are not allowed this essential tool for equal accessibility," the statement claimed. "[Activison] has been championing DE&amp;I while they continually fail us."
</p>
<p>
Images of the protest show around 30 staff holding CWA signs. The walkout also attracted the attention of local media.

"We work on Call of Duty, we were part of the QA team that worked on Black Ops 6 that just released today," a striking staff member and ABetterABK union steward told Fox 9. 
</p>
<p>
"We have worked on Modern Warfare 2 which was the most profitable game the company ever released - and that was done remotely." 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This afternoon, AQAU-CWA members held a rally protesting Activision and Microsoft's refusal to allow work from home accommodations to employees who need it. Fox9 was onsite for news coverage and snagged an interview with one of our union stewards. <a href="https://t.co/so4i58EMeM">pic.twitter.com/so4i58EMeM</a></p>â€” ABetterABK ðŸ’™ ABK Workers Alliance (@ABetterABK) <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1849999772507308503?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
In a statement to Eurogamer on the protest, an Activision spokesperson told me that the company acknowledged returning to offices had been "an adjustment for some" and that discussions over specific employee's needs were still "ongoing", the best part of a year since the policy was first announced.
</p><p>
"We respect our employees' rights to express their point of view," an Activision spokesperson told Eurogamer. "We understand that returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum."
