            <p>
If you thought Nintendo was the master of re-releases, then <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> might just be gunning for its title. The studio has announced yet another release for The Last of Us - but this time it's returning in the form of a two-game Complete edition.
</p>
<p>
Hints that Sony and Naughty Dog might be preparing another The Last of Us release first surfaced back in March, when it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-reportedly-getting-mysterious-new-physical-ps5-special-edition">reported a mysterious new PlayStation 5 special edition was on the way</a>. Little was known about it at the time, beyond the fact it was supposedly getting a physical edition, but all has now been revealed.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Complete, as its name suggests, bundles together the PS5 versions of The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, which initially released in 2022 and 2024 respectively. It'll be available in two forms; a digital edition, which is live on the PlayStation Store right now, and a special physical Collector's Edition, which arrives on 10th July.

<p>
The Last of Us Complete's digital release features exactly the same content as you'd get if you brought both games separately, but it does provide a bit of saving. It's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA29488_00-0000000000000000">priced at £94.99 on the PlayStation Store</a>, making a purchase £19.99 cheaper than buying Part 1 and Part 2 individually.
</p>
<p>
As for the Collector's Edition, it's exclusive to PlayStation's online store. It comes in a steelbook case with separate discs for Part 1 and Part 2, and also includes the Left Behind prequel chapter, The Last of Us: American Dreams Comics #1-4 with new cover art, a set of four lithographic art prints, and a Thank You letter from Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann - which I'm assuming isn't going to be handwritten. It costs £109.99/$109.99 USD, and <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-games/the-last-of-us-complete-collectors-edition-ps5">pre-orders are open now</a>.
</p>
<p>
But will Naughty Dog's latest The Last of Us release <em>actually</em> end up being the "complete" edition. Druckmann has sent mixed messages about the likelihood of a third series instalment over the last few years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">telling fans "there's probably one more chapter to this story" back in 2024</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-boss-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">reversing course this March</a> and warning, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
There is, though, <em>sort of</em> new The Last of Us on the way, courtesy of HBO's live-action TV adaptation. Season 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">begins airing</a> this Sunday, 13th April (14th April in the UK), and looks like it'll be substantially expanding on the events of the second game. We already know some new characters are being introduced for Season 2 - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara's Gale</a> - and given showrunner Craig Mazin is predicting the series will run to four season, there's plenty of space to chart routes previously unseen. Especially as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">Season 3 is already confirmed</a>.
