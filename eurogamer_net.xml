            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-sells-five-million-copies-on-track-to-be-best-selling-street-fighter-ever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has sold over five million copies, just as the game has been released on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. At this pass, the game is on track to be the best-selling game in the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1932603814827180338">Celebrating the achievement on social media</a> with a lovely bit of custom art, the company wrote: "Street Fighter 6 has now sold over five million copies! What a way to celebrate our 2nd anniversary! Thanks to all our fans out there around the world and to all the prospective fans in the future!"</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6, released on 2nd June 2023, is catching up the series sales leader at a faster pace than its predecessors. According to the <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab2">Capcom Platinum Titles page</a>, which tracks the company's best-selling games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter 5</a> is holding the top spot for now. It's sitting pretty at 7.8m units sold since its release on 16th February, 2016. By comparison, Street Fighter 6 has sold five million copies in just over two years.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>, which you may have assumed was the best-selling game in the series due to its prevalence in popular culture and influence on the genre, has sold 6.3m. It is worth noting that this Capcom list only tracks console sales, we also know that over 200,000 Street Fighter 2 arcade cabinets were sold during the golden era of arcades.</p>
<p>Okay, so why is Street Fighter 6 on track to surpass Street Fighter 5 in sales? Well, it's still receiving plenty of updates and has a flourishing global community of players. <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1931118961846038736">Its third season of DLC characters was just announced at Summer Game Fest</a>, and includes plenty of returning favourites like Sagat and Alex. These, plus a recent port to the Switch 2 will help tempt older fans back into the fray.</p>
<p>The game has also had a far faster start in terms of sales than Street Fighter 5. If you don't remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-street-fighter-5-will-and-wont-have-at-launch">the launch of Street Fighter 5 was a disaster</a>. The PC version was a technical mess, online netcode was poor making it hard to play matches online. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yoshinori-ono-discusses-street-fighter-5s-launch-problems">Yoshinori Ono came forward and discussed all its issues candidly too</a>, explaining that the team underestimated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-5-review">the appetite for single player content in a barebones release</a>.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 5 rose up the ranks of Capcom's best-sellers due in large part to continuous support over the years. The game was tied heavily to the game's competitive scene, promoting FGC events and Capcom Pro Tour tournaments through in-game stage advertisements and purchasable cosmetics. The game essentially regained the love of fans over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-review-social-silly-spectacular">Street Fighter 6 never had this problem</a>. It launched in a great state, with good online infrastructure and a sizable amount of single player content with the World Tour mode. What's left is ongoing support for the game on Capcom's part. Funnily enough, here the game has the opposite problem to Street Fighter 5. While previously there was no shortage in character cosmetics to buy, Street Fighter 6's community has been frustrated at the lack of character packs released during its life cycle.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the game has a popular competitive scene that continues to encourage new players to hop in, it has been supported heavily by community efforts like the Sajam Slam and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> Rivals, and popular content creators continue to dip their toes into the waters of Street Fighter 6 to entertain their fans.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 may not be around during the height of esports like Street Fighter 5 was, largely due to many of the speculative investors running away with empty pockets upon realising esports is a burning money pyre, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-sends-fighting-game-community-into-overdrive-with-whopping-1m-first-prize-street-fighter-6-tournament">Capcom continues to offer a million dollar top prize for its annual Capcom Cup finals event</a>. This has kept top players interested, and an aura of excitement alive.</p>
<p>How long will it take for Street Fighter 6 to surpass Street Fighter 6? Who can say. If I may make a prediction, I believe it'll pass the milestone around the end of 2026. Sales will slow down due to a deluge of newer fighting games releasing and snatching interest, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. Regardless, it's safe to say the game has proven quite the success for Capcom.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Build A Rocket Boy said this fix will be the first of a series of updates for MindsEye. Future updates will be aimed at "enhancing your experience," the developer said, promising to keep us up to date with information on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Patches will need to have the internet to load, the team reminded players, asking them to "please ensure [the] game is updated regularly to enjoy the benefits of the latest improvements".</p>
<p>The studio additionally added that Build.MindsEye - that is to say, the game's creation platform designed to help creators share interactive experiences - is now "fully accessible" for those on Steam.</p>
<p>"Thank you again for your incredible support. This is just the start of a long-term vision to make MindsEye the best possible game for you," the team closed.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has announced publicly it has filed a lawsuit against an individual it alleges has developed and sold cheats for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>This latest venture in Epic Game's ongoing war against those who create, sell, and use cheats was announced via <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1932485822445666348">the company's own Twitter account</a>. There, the company posted:</p>
<p>"We filed a new lawsuit against an individual who developed and sold cheating software that helped players see through walls and auto aim. We're also going after people who helped sell this software. Creating and selling software to help others cheat is against the rules and we'll keep fighting to keep it out of Fortnite."</p>

<figcaption>A new Fortnite season was revealed recently. Check it out!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zzh-g2a4M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/606086/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker">According to Polygon</a>, the lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina where the company is headquartered. It alleges Ediz Atas, also known as  Sincey Cheats and Vanta Chearts, has been making and selling cheats since "at least January 2023".</p>
<p>Epic alleges in the lawsuit that after DMCA takedowns were issued to YouTube videos featuring these cheats, "Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to 'formally reverse [its] claim of copyright infringement'" by using fake Epic Games email addresses.
</p>
<p>Epic also claims its has issued tens of thousands of bans against Fortnite accounts that used cheats from Sincey Cheats since 2022, including over 15,000 bans on US-based Fortnite accounts.
</p>
<p>The lawsuit is also asking for compensation for damages from five unnamed individuals who distributed these cheats over platforms like Discord and Telegram. The amount is unknown.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Epic Games has proven especially litigious when it comes to Fortnite cheaters.  In 2022 Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-cheater-forced-to-pay-up-after-epic-lawsuit-damages-will-go-to-charity">forced a cheat creator to pay up in Australian court following a legal victory</a>, donating the winnings to charity.</p>
<p>Epic also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">sued a player who used cheats during a massive multi-million dollar tournament</a> to give back any prize money they won, and make a cathartic public apology to boot!</p>
<p>The company is not alone in its struggle against cheats. Activision has also been fighting against cheats, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-wins-113m-in-lawsuit-against-call-of-duty-cheat-maker">winning £11.3m in court against a Call of Duty cheat maker</a>. Bungie has been in those trenches too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-44m-lawsuit-against-destiny-cheat-seller-aimjunkies">winning a $4.4m lawsuit against Destiny cheat seller Aimjunkies</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
