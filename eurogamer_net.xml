            <p>Towards the end of last month, the co-CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">game's negative reactions up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio</a>. These bold comments from a studio exec raised a number of eyebrows, to say the least.</p>
<p>Now, the CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-to-publish-former-rockstar-and-gta-producers-mysterious-blockbuster-mindseye">helming the publishing duties for MindsEye</a>, has shared his thoughts on these claims, stating he does not believe any of those aforementioned negative comments had been paid for.</p>
<p>When asked by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">IGN </a>about the discourse surrounding MindsEye's alleged paid-for negative reactions, IO Interactive head Hakan Abrak replied: "I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p>

<p>While the exec did not elaborate on this specific point further, he did state the MindsEye team - as many developers do - are working on patches for the game.</p>
<p>MindsEye released last night, however it has not been an especially smooth launch for the team. Many social media posts have made the rounds online showing stuttering issues, as well as a number of glitches, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorted character faces and unnaturally stretching bodies</a>.</p>
<p>Build A Rocket Boy has said a patch to address performance is in the pipeline, stating its "engineering team are working around the clock"  to implement improvements. We will keep you posted when we know more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'Concerned Ape' Barone has taken a brief break from working on the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> to drop a bombshell.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter with fire at his fingertips, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458">Barone wrote</a>: "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley".</p>
<p>Outstanding. How much bigger Haunted Chocolatier will be than Stardew Valley, what will fill this vast world of hauntings and chocolate, and how players will be able to explore and interact with this world remains a sweet mystery.</p>

<p>The last major update we got for Haunted Chocolatier is from April this year, when Barone announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">no more major updates would be coming to Stardew Valley</a>. Indeed, the last year of Barone's life has assumedly been spent sitting at the grindstone, hard at work at their next game while thousands of eager fans peek through the cracks in the walls and floorboards.</p>
<p>These long periods of silence should not be a surprise, with Barone previously stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Haunted Chocolatier won't be rushed</a>, and that it was "better to have a good delayed game than a bad game on time". He's right, of course. You can only release Haunted Chocolatier once, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-has-now-sold-over-20-million-copies">given the massive community of Stardew Valley players</a>, it's likely the smart move to make sure everything is made well and with love… Just like chocolate!</p>
<p>So yeah, while making a joke or two is fun, we wish this ape the best of luck with development. It's ready when it's ready!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For comparison, Sony sold 4.5m PS5 units globally in its first quarter back in 2020, so Switch 2 has just a million less but in four days. Microsoft has not shared launch numbers of its Xbox Series X/S console.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-reportedly-nintendos-biggest-uk-launch-but-sits-behind-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs"> reported the console was Nintendo's biggest launch in the UK</a> with the Switch 2 outselling the original Switch by over two to one. However, it's behind the equivalent launches of Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Nintendo has forecast it will sell 15m units from release until the end of the financial year, meaning it's just under a quarter of the way there in four days.</p>
<p>News of these initial sales comes despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">criticism of the console's high cost</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">price of its games and accessories</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of its launch in Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Nintendo warned demand for the console "far exceeds expectations"</a> and warned of stock shortages.</p>

The company stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-considering-switch-2-post-launch-price-rise-if-tariff-situation-worsens">considering a post-launch price rise if the situation worsens</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, then, Nintendo is still celebrating a huge launch of its latest console. Have you got yourself a Switch 2? What do you think so far?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, the game quickly surpassed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within an hour of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players.</p>

So what can we infer from seeing Dune Awakening pull this off? Well, a growth of roughly 40 percent in peak players (on a Tuesday no less) indicates a sizable number of players were waiting in the wings for the cheaper version of the game. It's still possible that the game could hit another peak too this weekend, following the trend established by the early launch.

</p><p>It'll be interesting to see to what degree the end game Landsraad and deep desert map can retain players, especially those who may have grabbed it for a romp with friends or a more single player, solitary experience. When you get to the end game, Dune Awakening does a baton pass from a survival game core to more of an MMO server-wide PvP and politics experience. How many of these initial players stick around for this bit, remains a big question.</p>
<p>To celebrate the full launch yesterday, it looks as though the Funcom team were enjoying mini cupcakes at the office, <a href="https://x.com/Tascharoe/status/1932439203641717162">as shown off on social media by one Tascha Röösli on Twitter</a>. Launching a video game, especially a big online one like Dune Awakening, is a big task. Why not celebrate a little?</p>
<p>Dune Awakening had previously proved so popular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers">as to dethrone Elden RIng Nightreign from its perch atop of the Steam top sellers page</a> just before its initial release on the 5th June.</p>
<p>If you're looking to jump into the game, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Eurogamer's Dune Awakening preview</a> - it's "the perfect blend of survival, MMORPG, and house envy". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> released last night, and within a matter of hours gameplay footage was going viral online. However, this was not because players were sharing their positive experiences. Rather, it was because they were sharing a multitude of glitches and error screens which were appearing as they attempted to make their way through the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Mctannen/status/1932574418397536412">Glitches</a> have ranged from <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1932500739999330419">stuttering issues</a> to <a href="https://x.com/SlashLP89/status/1932517088280957096">stretching bodies</a> and distorted character faces (see header image above). Many posts across social media question why the game wasn't delayed, given it has been <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1932547822345126241">released in such a broken state</a>. Others <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1932498253452616032">suggest the game is overpriced for what it delivers</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MindsEye <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">reviews on Steam</a> currently sit with a "mixed" average, with many again calling out performance issues and assumed lack of prior testing, although there is also praise for its story so far. The MindsEye Discord has similar comments, with discussions about the game's "unfinished state" and inconsistent frame rates.</p>
<p>As for its player numbers, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3265250/charts/">SteamDB</a> shows MindsEye had a launch concurrent player peak of 3,302. At the time of writing, there are only 993 players in the game via Steam. </p> <div>

<p>Developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/">Build A Rocket Boy released a statement</a> on the MindsEye reddit following the game's launch, stating it was "working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles". The developer said it understood that the current minimum PC spec requirements "are very high". It will be detailing its next patch at some time today.</p>
<p>Plenty still hope that MindsEye can turn its fortunes around with the help of a patch or two. There is some good faith out there that it can redeem itself, and several players have said there does appear to be a decent enough foundation tucked beneath the game's issues.</p>

            <p>
Splitgate 2 game director Ian Proulx has apologised for causing "division in the community" following his controversial Summer Game Fest appearance, in which he wore a MAGA-style "Make FPS Great Again" hat while onstage.
</p>
<p>
Proulx's Summer Game Fest segment last Friday almost immediately drew criticism from viewers; some felt using the high-profile platform to attack another developer's game - he announced he was "tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year" - was tasteless, but it was his hat that seemed to cause most controversy.
</p>
<p>
Its "Make FPS Great Again" logo clearly invoked divisive US president Donald Trump's notorious "Make America Great Again" slogan, and now - after initially <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371">refusing to apologise</a> for wearing it - Proulx has acknowledged the choice, while 'not political', was ill-advised.
</p>
<p>
"It is really freaking hard as an independent studio to break through the noise," he explained in a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366">video posted on social media</a>. "We saw it at the TGAs; we had this great trailer and there's 50 other great trailers, and it didn't really have an impact. And so at our biggest stage, coming out of beta, we needed something to grab attention and... this is what we came up with."
</p>
<p>
"We did not intend for this to be taken in any political way whatsoever," he continued. "Obviously I knew there would be some level of controversy, but we really saw this as a meme that was stating our truth. Which is we do want to improve this genre, we are disappointed with the state of the genre. And so we took [the slogan] as a meme that we thought would not be nearly as negatively received as the way it was. And so I want to apologise."
</p>
<p>
"And the reason I am sorry is because of what this has done to the community. The most important thing to me right now is I want to have an amazing community... I hate seeing division. And that's what I’m seeing now, on both sides. There's division in the community, and for that I am truly sorry... I do stand by the [face value] intent of this, which is... we do want to improve this genre... But I also understand that it's not just about intent, it's about impact, and the platform that we have had has had a negative impact, and for that I'm truly sorry."

Proulx's Summer Game Fest appearance isn't the only controversy Splitgate 2 has faced in recent days, however. Fans lambasted the free-to-play shooter over the weekend after developer 1047 Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">released a cosmetic bundle priced $80 USD, supposedly discounted from $145</a>. In response, the studio slashed that to $40 and reduced prices across the store, pledging to "double down on being community first and listening to you guys."

        <p>Will become new executive chair of the board.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Lars Wingefors, the Embracer Group CEO who oversaw thousands of job cuts and a significant number of studio closures following a turbulent few years for the company, has announced he's stepping down from his role. Wingefors is not, however, parting ways with Embracer, and will instead become its executive chair of the board.
</p>
<p>
"While the road has not always been straight, I am incredibly proud of the achievements made possible by our talented teams, which have created some incredible experiences for gamers,"  Wingefors said in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/lars-wingefors-proposed-to-be-elected-as-executive-chair-of-the-board-of-embracer-phil-rogers-appointed-new-ceo/">statement announcing his change of role</a>. "This new phase allows me to focus on strategic initiatives, M&amp;A, and capital allocation, ensuring Embracer's continued growth and success. I am more convinced than ever that the best is still ahead of us."
</p>
<p>
With Wingefors' focus shifting elsewhere, Phil Rogers will step into the vacated CEO role from 1st August. Rogers is currently deputy CEO of Embracer and CEO of Crystal Dynamics – Eidos.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors' time as CEO has been turbulent to say the least. He oversaw a rapid period of expansion at Embracer, with the company embarking on a massive acquisition spree, snapping up the likes of Gearbox, Saber Interactive, Crystal Dynamics, and more - including the €2.75bn purchase of board game publisher Asmodee - over a number of years. However, the unsustainability of that expansion became clear after a $2bn deal with the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">collapsed dramatically in 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following the deal's collapse, Wingefors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">announced</a> a "comprehensive restructuring program" that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">ultimately resulted in thousands of employees losing their jobs</a>, while a substantial number of studios were either divested or outright closed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition shut its doors in August 2023</a>, for instance, while the revived Free Radical Design, which was working on a new TimeSplitters project, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-design-closed-today-staff-say">closed just a few months later</a>. Soon after, Gearbox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">sold to Take-Two Interactive</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">Saber Interactive went its own separate way</a>. Further layoffs, at the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Eidos-Montréal</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics</a>, have been announced since then.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-boss-admits-long-list-of-things-hed-have-done-differently-as-embattled-company-splits-into-three">later admitted</a> there was a "long list" of things he'd have done differently, but that it was "easy to look back in hindsight".
