            <p>Black Mirror may show us a variety of near-future dystopias, but at least those unfortunate to live through one of them can play Balatro.</p>
<p>The poker-themed roguelike Balatro became a smash hit on its release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">selling 1m copies in its first month</a>, and things have only gone from strength to strength for solo developer LocalThunk. Along with scooping up numerous awards, most recently including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">BAFTA for best debut game</a>, Balatro has now made an appearance on TV.</p>

<p>Yes, Balatro is in the new Black Mirror series, in the third episode of its seventh season. This episode is called Hotel Reverie, and its synopsis reads thus: "A high-tech remake of a classic film sends its A-list star into another dimension, where she must stick to the script if she ever wants to make it home."</p>
<p>Balatro is a pastime of the A-list star's agent. When the two are on the phone together early on in the episode, the card game can be seen on the agent's laptop.</p>
<p>This moment was spotted and shared on social media, with LocalThunk quickly responding. "So uh Balatro is now canonically in Black Mirror," the developer wrote. The show's creator Charlie Brooker then replied with a saluting emoji.</p>
<p>I wonder where Balatro may show up next? Hollywood, perhaps. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-developer-responds-to-ai-art-drama-stating-it-does-real-harm-to-artists-of-all-kinds">Balatro's LocalThunk shared his thoughts on the AI art debate</a>, stating "I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds". Many believed both LocalThunk and Playstack supported AI art.</p>
<p>Also this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">Balatro developer successfully appealed PEGI's decision to classify the game as PEGI 18</a> due to its poker theme.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The director of A Minecraft Movie has reacted to the chaotic scenes seen in some cinemas as viewers interrupt screenings to stand up, scream and empty buckets of popcorn over other people.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">A Minecraft Movie is a breakout success that's performed far beyond initial expectations</a>, seemingly fuelled by its viral nature among younger viewers. In particular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">videos on social media have shown crowds reacting wildly to the film's now-notorious "Chicken Jockey" scene</a>.
</p>
<p>
But while the trend may be popular, it hasn't gone down well with all cinema goers. Viewers have been removed from showings for disruptive behaviour and <a href="https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/mat-su/2025/04/08/wasilla-police-eject-rowdy-teens-from-minecraft-movie-showing/">police have been called</a> as the trend has continued - escalating now to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-are-taking-live-chickens-into-screenings-of-the-minecraft-movie-now-as-chicken-jockey-meme-gets-out-of-hand">disturbing incident where someone brought a live chicken into a screening</a>.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unusurprisingly, A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess doesn't sound too bothered about it all. 
</p>
<p>
"It's way too funny," Hess told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/movies/chicken-jockey-minecraft-movie.html">New York Times</a>. "It's been a total blast. I'm just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.
</p>
<p>
"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies  - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."
</p>
<p>
Is it okay to dump your popcorn over other people? Hess seems to think so. 
</p>
<p>
"No one's going to get hurt from popcorn," he concluded. "Look, when I go to the movies with my kids, itâ€™s like a popcorn massacre that happens and they're not throwing anything, but it ends up on the ground, regardless."
</p>
<p>
Just spare a thought for the minimum wage employee who has to come along a clear it up.
</p>
<p>
As you'd expect, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">the success of A Minecraft Movie has already sparked talk of a sequel</a>.
</p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> may have dominated any and all Nintendo news this month so far, we still have some Sega-related goodness for the here and now to break things up a bit.</p>
<p>Nintendo has today updated its Sega Genesis / Mega Drive catalogue for Switch Online members, and added three more classic games for us to enjoy. These games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streets of Rage</li>
<li>Super Thunder Blade</li>

<p>As a reminder, to access these Sega games, you will need to make sure that you have an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, which is the company's more expensive subscription tier. You can check out a little teaser trailer for April's Mega Drive update below.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news - and there has been a lot of it - last week the company announced that some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">classic GameCube games will be coming to Switch 2</a>, via Switch Online.</p>

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country - the next game in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>'s Mafia series - will seemingly be arriving as soon as August.</p>
<p>Publisher 2K appears to have accidentally revealed the release date for Mafia: The Old Country via a post on Steam: 8th August 2025.</p>

<p>While the post itself no longer has that all-important date attached, many were able to grab a screenshot of the original with those release details included. "Mafia: The Old Country will be available on August 8, 2025. Pre-orders are available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via Steam," read the text.</p>
<p>This date was likely meant to be saved for Mafia: The Old Country's newly-announced PAX East developer panel, which is scheduled for 8th May at 7pm UK time.</p>
<p>"Watch as Hangar 13 developers debut a new gameplay trailer and offer a rare behind-the-scenes look at the past, present, and future of this storied franchise," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999?l=latam">panel's announcement post</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> last year. While the developer has kept many details about the upcoming title under wraps since, it has confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
