            <p>
Minecraft movie audiences are going feral over a moment in the film where Jason Momoa fights a baby zombie riding a chicken. 
</p>
<p>
The scene, previously glimpsed in trailers, has become a viral meme - and has sparked wild responses from some cinema goers (mostly, it seems, in the US). Audiences are screaming the words "CHICKEN JOCKEY" as they are spoken by Jack Black's Steve, then standing up and throwing popcorn. 
</p>
<p>
Numerous examples of crowds (again, mostly US crowds) reacting to the Chicken Jockey scene spread on social media over the weekend, with some attendees apparently waiting for the moment with loaded popcorn buckets, ready to throw them in the air and over other guests upon the moment in question.
</p>
<p>
Look, I worked in a cinema for several years as a student job, and this sort of thing really boils my piss. Not only are you being a jerk to every other guest in the cinema, you are also creating a ton of extra work for the minimum wage employees who have to come around and sweep all your rubbish off the floor between screenings. Oh, and it's just a waste of food.
</p>
<p>Here are a couple of clips, as dug up by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-sparks-chaos-in-theaters-chicken-jockey-screams-and-even-reports-of-cops-being-called">IGN</a>:</p>

Why is this happening? Well, people are jerks. Why is a Chicken Jockey such a big deal? Well, in Minecraft itself, these enemies are pretty rare - so finding one is a big deal.
</p>
<p>Film critics gave A Minecraft Movie a critical mauling, but audiences don't seem to care. The film has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">already earned a whopping $301m (£233m) worldwide over its opening weekend</a>, meaning the project has already doubled its $150m budget and is the biggest video game film ever to launch in the US. </p>
<p>A sequel - and probably more chicken jockeying - now seems assured. </p>
<p>"Lovely performances elevate a movie that captures Minecraft's many bits and pieces but not its creative spirit," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-review">Eurogamer's A Minecraft Movie review</a>.</p>
<p>And in other Minecraft movie news, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unfinished-version-of-a-minecraft-movie-leaks-spreads-online">unfinished version of the film with effects that actually look closer to the original Minecraft game has leaked online</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has created a playable demo "inspired" by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a> using its new AI tool, but it's practically unplayable.</p>
<p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-generative-ai-model-muse-isnt-creating-games-and-its-certainly-not-going-to-solve-game-preservation-expert-says">Microsoft unveiled its Muse tool</a> that uses generative AI to aid "gameplay ideation". Now we can see it in action with something that looks like Quake 2, in a tech demo to show how Microsoft's AI tools can "simulate interactive gameplay".</p>
<p>Hosted in Copilot Labs and <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/wham">playable in a web browser</a>, the demo "dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake 2", <a href="https://copilotlabs.microsoft.com/experiment/copilot-gaming-experiences/">according to a Q&amp;A</a>. "Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake 2 running on a traditional game engine."</p>

<p>To be clear, then, this is not running the game using id's engine. Instead, Microsoft's <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3#Sec7">Human Action Model</a> (WHAM) uses generative AI to dynamically predict the next action in the game based on analysing player data.</p>
<p>The results, though, are pretty appalling. It may resemble Quake 2, but the visuals (and enemies in particular) are blurry, the controls lag, and the frame-by-frame gameplay is enough to give you a headache.</p>
<p>Some of these limitations have been <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/whamm-real-time-world-modelling-of-interactive-environments/">acknowledged by Microsoft</a>, but worse of all is the context length at just 0.9 seconds of gameplay (which amounts to 9 frames at 10fps). Practically, that means the AI doesn't remember objects or level layouts, meaning if you look to the floor or ceiling and back again the view will have completely changed.</p>
<p>Is it interesting as an example of what AI can do now? Sure. Is it a playable demo? Barely.</p>

<p>"You can play Quake on a calculator bro why are you doing this in the most resource intensive way possible," reads one response. </p>
<p>"I don't know what this shit is but it ain't Quake," reads another.</p>
<p>Other responses have criticised Keighley himself for sharing the video, following his words at last year's The Game Awards responding to layoffs across the industry.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development</a>, it's clear, but even in the past year more of these supposed advancements have been released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Japanese game stocks have dropped following the announcement of major tariffs on trade to the US.</p>
<p>US president Donald Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs last week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing.</p>

<p>We are now seeing some of the impact these tariffs will have on companies. As shared by industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto">Dr Serkan Toto</a>, on Monday morning at 10am Japan time, Nintendo's stock was down by 7.35 percent. Meanwhile, Sony has seen a drop of 10.16 percent, Bandai Namco -7.03 percent, Konami -3.93 percent, Sega -6.57 percent, Koei Tecmo -5.83 percent, Capcom -7.13 percent, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> -5.23 percent.</p>
<p>"The mobile game companies do even worse," Toto wrote on social media.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Entertainment Software Association (ESA) senior vice president Aubrey Quinn said these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a>. Quinn's comment follows on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">industry analyst Daniel Ahmad's own</a>, where the Niko Partners director of research and insights said:</p>
<p>"While the company has shifted some of its manufacturing to Vietnam to offset US tariffs on China, the looming threat of reciprocal tariffs prior to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> showcase will have also forced Nintendo to consider a higher price for the rest of the world. The reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Japan have come in higher than expected, and Nintendo will feel the impact of this if the tariffs go into full effect."</p>

<p>Back in February, Sony took some preventative measures to protect itself from the then impending tariffs, which included stockpiling PlayStation 5's in the US. This will provide the PS5 maker a "temporary buffer against the impact of tariffs," Ahmad wrote over the weekend. However, as Ahmad notes, Sony's business is wider reaching than just its PlayStation consoles.</p>
<p>As for the PS5, "Sony would need to assess how quickly it can move production of US units to Japan (lower tariff rate: 24 percent) and how many would be produced in China (higher tariff rate: 54 percent), and how quickly it can start producing in Vietnam (Est 2026)," <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1908641169795674564">Ahmad wrote on X</a>.</p>
<p>"The firm would then need to evaluate how these tariffs impact current profit margins and how much they would need to increase hardware prices for the consumer. There could also be a potential impact on accessories and game pricing depending on how Sony wants to pass on costs."</p>
<p>Ahmad continued: "The good news is that the initial stockpiling + Japan manufacturing + PS5 being mid to late gen at this point (profitable on per unit basis) + <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> likely priced at $700 in anticipation of some potential tariff impact, means that even with a price increase, the increase may not be as significant as it would be for new tech products.</p>
<p>"However, there is still so much uncertainty around tariffs at this point, which won't actually go into effect until April 9, that no one knows if tariffs will end up higher, lower or removed entirely at some point."</p>

            <p>Bungie will finally reveal details of its next game, Marathon, later this week.</p>
<p>The Destiny maker released a teaser video for a Marathon Gameplay Reveal, which will take place on <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/MARATHONTHEGAME">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarathonTheGame">YouTube</a> on 12th April at 6pm UK time (10am PDT).</p>
<p>The teaser itself shows a character running through a bright jungle chased by some sort of robot or mech, though we don't see a full shot of either. We do, however, see an adorable pink cat curl up next to the (presumably dying) figure.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">Bungie first announced it was reviving Marathon back in May 2023</a>, but very little has been heard about it since.</p>
<p>The original Marathon first-person shooter was released in 1994 and received two sequels. Now, Bungie is reviving the series as a "sci-fi PvP extraction shooter" featuring "evolving, persistent zones" that's set in the same universe as the original games.</p>
<p>Marathon will be the first new project from Bungie since Halo and Destiny, set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV where players will take on the role of cybernetic mercenaries Runners.</p>
<p>It's aiming for release across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>In May 2024, the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">Marathon game was released on Steam for free</a>.</p>
<p>Then in October last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">Marathon game director Joe Ziegler gave an update to explain the gameplay loop</a> but stated it was too early to show gameplay and more would be shown next year.</p>
<p>Now it's next year and, true to its word, Bungie is finally set to show off the game in action.</p>
<p>News of the game has been tainted by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">dismissal of former project lead Chris Barrett</a> following alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A number of Switch 2 listings have popped up on the likes of eBay, as retailers run out of stock following pre-orders going live.</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo gave us all a much closer look at its upcoming Switch successor. Along with an overview of games and such, it also gave us a release date and retail price - Switch 2 will be released on Thursday 5th June, with a retail price of £395.99 for the console, or £429.99 should you opt for the Switch 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle.</p>
<p>However, once pre-orders went live, stock soon ran out, with places such as Argos already out of stock. "Sorry, this item is just too popular! But we may get more stock, so do check back at a later date," reads a <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7550333?clickPR=plp:1:9">notice on Argos' website</a>.</p>

<p>And, as to be expected, given this high demand, listings for the Switch 2 are now popping up on eBay, above that recommended retail price. At the time of writing, there are multiple Switch 2 listings via the online auction site in excess of £600.</p>
<p>On the completed sales side of things, one Switch 2 and Mario Kart World bundle was sold for £634.02, which is £204.03 more than the recommended retail price. A Switch 2 console without Mario Kart World included, meanwhile, has sold for £554.45.</p>
<p>While retailers such as Argos and Smyths have opened pre-orders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo itself is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own store in a bid to reduce scalping by implementing an invite-only system. Emails have started going out for those fortunate to be selected.</p>
