            <p>
June is here, which means Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings for another month, and - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-members-get-22-more-games-in-may">bumper-packed May</a> - it's a comparatively quiet one this time around. In total, June brings nine new games for subscribers to download, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thief-deadly-shadows">Thief: Deadly Shadows</a>.
</p>
<p>
As usual, Prime Gaming's June additions arrive across four scheduled content drops, and the first of these is available to claim right now. Point yourself in the <a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">direction of Amazon's website</a> and you're able to grab tactical turn-based Games Workshop adaptation Mordheim: City of the Damned, as well as retro-inspired point-and-click sci-fi adventure The Abandoned Planet.
</p>
<p>
Then, as June trundles onwards and summer vaguely threatens to emerge, members can look forward to the likes of Thief: Deadly Shadows, the third game in the classic stealth series, and minimalist railway puzzler Station to Station. That's alongside the acclaimed Jupiter Hell, a grimy top-down turn-based sci-fi shooter, plus guns-and-sorcery cRPG Dark Envoy.
</p>
<p>
You'll find the full list of Junes's titles (plus the digital stores they can be grabbed from) below.
