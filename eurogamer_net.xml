            <p>Capcom has released a PC benchmarking tool for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> so players can test out their machines ahead of release.</p>
<p>Performance has been a big concern for players since the game's last beta, with erratic framerates and visual glitches across both PC and console. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">Capcom released the PC specs</a> last September, but has since stated it plans to lower GPU requirements.</p>
<p>Now, following last night's Capcom Spotlight, the company has released a benchmark tool on PC you can download <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">via Steam</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/benchmark/">free tool</a> provides a score of your computer's performance, from Excellent down to Difficulty Playing, along with an average frame rate.</p>
<p>The benchmark comes ahead of a second beta, <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/obt/">operating across two weekends in February</a> before the game's launch on 28th February.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">various improvements made to the game won't be included in this beta</a>, including performance, weapon changes, Hitstop, and quality of life tweaks. As such, the benchmark tool is the best way for PC players to truly see if their machine is up to scratch.</p>
<p>Last night, Capcom confirmed this beta will give players a chance to go up against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-next-open-betas-will-let-players-fight-flagship-monster-arkveld-for-the-first-time">flagship monster Arkveld for the first time</a>. A new trailer (above) provides a look at the Iceshard Cliffs biome and new monster Hirabami.</p>
<p>For console players, director Yuya Tokuda previously confirmed performance targets across PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. There will also be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-director-confirms-ps5-pro-patch-coming-day-one">day one PS5 Pro patch</a>, for which further details have been revealed.</p>
<p>On <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, PSSR will be used to upscale the resolution with added ray-tracing effects. Unlike on base consoles where two settings will be available to prioritise resolution or framerate, the PS5 Pro will have an additional Balanced mode for a 40fps frame rate with ray-tracing enabled.</p>
<p>The three modes are as follows:</p>
<table data-mobile-mode="scroll">
<tbody><tr>
<th>Performance Settings</th>
<th>Ray Tracing</th>
<th>Output Resolution (Rendering Resolution)</th>
<th>Frame Rate</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prioritise Resolution</td>
<td>Enabled</td>
<td>3840 x 2160 (3072 x 1728)</td>
<td>30fps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Balanced</td>
<td>Enabled</td>
<td>3840 x 2160 (1920 x 1404)</td>
<td>40 fps</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prioritise Frame rate</td>
<td>Disabled</td>
<td>3840 x 2160 (1920 x 1080)</td>
<td>60fps</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 28th February. I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">hands-on at Gamescom last year</a> and was impressed by its more streamlined approach.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Bloodborne PSX demake fan-project from tech artist and engineer Lilith Walther has become the latest legal takedown victim.</p>
<p>The Bloodborne PSX demake, you may recall, took the PS4 classic back to its roots, with a PS1 makeover that yielded some rather excellent results. Our Ian gave it a go on release, delighting in the demake's ability to combine two of his favourite things - retro games and spanking werewolves (see below).</p>
<p>But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-demake-out-today">three years after it made its pixel perfect debut</a>, the Bloodborne PSX demake project has been hit by a copyright claim by MarkScan Entertainment. This claim comes soon after a fellow Bloodborne fan project from modder Lance McDonald, which enabled Bloodborne to run at 60fps, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-takes-aim-at-bloodborne-60fps-mod-released-in-2021">also hit with the legal take down notice hammer</a>. Eurogamer has contacted Sony for comment, but is yet to receive a response.</p>

<p>But, why is Sony suddenly so interested in Bloodborne-related fan projects that have been around for, let's be honest, quite some time now? Well, McDonald has a "copium" theory that Sony could well be working on an official 60fps Bloodborne remake of its own, and the company doesn't want any fan-related projects getting in the way of Google searches and such when the time comes for an announcement.</p>
<p>"Like if they plan on trademarking 'Bloodborne 60fps' and 'Bloodborne remake' they need to actually clean up in order to actually file a trademark request. Right??" the noted modder mused on social media platform X.</p>
<p>Gosh, I may now have my hopes up again...</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>My copium theory is that Sony DMCAed the 60fps patch and the video about the Bloodborne demake so that when they announce a 60fps remake, google searching for “bloodborne 60fps” and “Bloodborne remake” won’t have collisions with our fan projects.</p><p>Let me cope.</p></div>— Lance McDonald (@manfightdragon) <a href="https://twitter.com/manfightdragon/status/1886240572660457506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Bloodborne will celebrate its 10th anniversary next month, which suddenly makes me feel old. In the time since, many have shared their hopes that Sony may give the game a remake, remaster, PC port or sequel of some description. After all, Sony has done all this for many of its other IPs, such as The Last of Us, Uncharted and God of War to name just three. However, Bloodborne has remained untouched.</p><p>Last month, former Sony Interactive Entertainment exec and PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida shared his thoughts on why Bloodborne hasn't had the same attention as other PlayStation releases. Speaking following his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement">retirement from Sony after more than 30 years at the company</a>, Yoshida said he thinks a key factor in Bloodborne's lack of a remaster or similar comes down to one quite simple thing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-hasnt-playstation-done-anything-new-with-bloodborne-shuhei-yoshida-has-a-theory">the game's creator Hidetaka Miyazaki is "so busy"</a>, it has just not been possible.</p>
<p>"Miyazaki-san really, really loved Bloodborne, what he created. So I think he is interested but he's so successful and he's so busy, so he cannot do it himself, and he doesn't want anyone else to touch it," Yoshida reasoned.</p>
<p>As for the demake's creator, Walther released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloodborne-kart-back-without-bloodborne-and-with-a-new-release-date">Bloodborne-inspired racer known as Nightmare Kart last year</a>. This project initially had Bloodborne in its branding, but this was changed following a request from Sony.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
We might not have seen a whole lot of EA's next Battlefield game beyond the few seconds of pre-alpha footage shared this week, but it turns out it's probably not all that far away. The publisher has confirmed it expect the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year.
</p>
<p>
EA shared the news as part of its third-quarter financial earnings report, saying its new Battlefield is "expected fiscal year 2026 release". That means the game should - all being well - arrive sometime between 1st April this year and 31st of March 2026.
</p>
<p>
Specifics remain limited, but EA last year confirmed the long-running multiplayer shooter series would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">returning to the modern era</a> for its next outing, and that it'd feature traditional classes and more focused maps - a clear indication it would be revisiting a tried-and-tested formula after shaking things up in 2021's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">poorly received Battlefield 2042</a>.

<p>
Last year's announcement also revealed EA was planning a series of playtests for Battlefield's next instalment, in order to "get the community back on [its] side" - and that initiative, now known as Battlefield Labs, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">officially unveiled this week</a> alongside brief early gameplay.
</p><p>
The next Battlefield game is being developed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">huge group spread across four major EA teams</a>, now working under the umbrella name of Battlefield Studios. That includes series creator DICE, splinter studio Ripple Effect, Dead Space Remake developer Motive, and Criterion - the veteran UK studio, which, as Eurogamer reported earlier this week, has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">paused work on its next Need for Speed game</a> in order to pitch in with the new Battlefield.
</p>
<p>
EA will be wanting to hit the ground running with the next Battlefield entry after it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">forced to admit 2042 "did not meet expectations"</a>. The publisher also had a difficult 2024, and last month said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA Sports FC 25 and Dragon Age: The Veilguard "underperformed"</a> as it lowered its financial forecast for the year.

It's been a bit of a busy one for Capcom, what with the publisher airing not one but two showcases to demo its latest wares this week. One half of that dealt with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> ahead of its release this month, but Capcom also had a few things to share about its other titles. So if you missed its latest Spotlight, you'll find everything announced and featured below.
</p>
<h3>Mai Shiranui's fighting pass for Street Fighter 6</h3>

We already knew Fatal Fury's Mai Shiranui was making the jump to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> this week, and we got a further look at her "agile movements, tricky projectiles, and quick attacks" in Capcom's latest showcase. Mai comes to Street Fighter 6 on 5th February PST, arriving alongside the Say Hello to Mai fighting pass - which includes customisation items relating to Mai and Fatal Fury. And as for what's next, Elena is set to complete the character roster for Year 2.

<p>
After a pause to highlight this year's Capcom Cup 11 - which will be determining the Street Fighter 6 world champion between 5th-9th March - it was time to move onto Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics. This seven-game compilation has been out on PlayStation, Switch, and PC since last year, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-now-coming-to-xbox-following-technical-discussions-with-microsoft">technical issues held back its Xbox release</a>.
</p><p>
Those have finally been resolved, however, and it's now available digitally on Microsoft's console - gathering together X-Men Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 New Age of Heroes, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/punisher">The Punisher</a>.

Capcom's other fighting collection, the economically titled Capcom Fighting Collection 2, also has a release date. As well as a whole bunch of artwork and previously unseen development documents, this compilation features eight titles: Capcom vs SNK, Capcom vs SNK 2, Project Justice, Capcom Fighting Evolution, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-alpha-3-upper">Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper</a>, Plasma Sword, Power Stone, and Power Stone 2. It comes to PlayStation, Switch, PC, and, yes, Xbox on 16th May - and pre-orders unlock two additional songs for gallery mode.

It doesn't have a name, and it's still probably years off, but that didn't stop Capcom re-airing the same <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">Okami sequel announcement trailer it debuted during December's The Game Awards</a>. The publisher paired this segment with a spotlight on its demo for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review">excellent Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, plus the news that Path of the Goddess and the original Okami are both now available in a two-game bundle.

This all-new entry in Capcom's fondly remembered Onimusha series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">another Game Awards debutante</a>. For its latest airing, though, Capcom highlighted some of the key areas it's focusing on to make Way of the Sword "as captivating as possible". These include its new protagonist (plus enemies that are interesting "more than just visually"), its setting, and its combat.
</p><p>
Set in a "beautifully eerie depiction" of Edo-period Kyoto, Onimusha: Way of the Sword tells the heroic tale of a samurai who wields an Oni gauntlet, feeding it the souls of monsters roaming the land of the living. Doing so involves swordplay with a particular emphasis on the satisfaction of slicing through enemies, and players can use the souls they collect to restore health and trigger special moves. Capcom says combat will be intense when Way of the Sword arrives in 2026, but stresses it's not trying to make an "impossibly difficult" game.

If 2026 is just too long to wait for your Onimusha fix, Capcom has you covered. The publisher also used its latest Spotlight to announce a remaster of 
Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, which  originally launched back in 2002. There's not a whole lot to report on this just yet, but it's coming to Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC sometime this year.
</p>
<p>
And with that, we're pretty much done with the first part of Capcom's showcase. The publisher's having a digital sale across various platforms right now if you're in the mood to sample its wares at a discount, and if you missed it, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-next-open-betas-will-let-players-fight-flagship-monster-arkveld-for-the-first-time">round-up of Capcom's latest Monster Hunter Wilds' showcase elsewhere on Eurogamer</a>.

We already knew <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">two more Monster Hunter Wilds open betas were on the way</a> ahead of this month's launch, but Capcom has now shared a few more details - confirming they'll give players a chance to go up against flagship monster Arkveld for the first time.
</p>
<p>
That announcement came courtesy of Capcom's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFcgWM-D-oo">latest Monster Hunter Wilds Showcase</a>, which kicked things off with a brand-new trailer. Notably, this offered a first look at the Iceshard Cliffs biome, which join Wilds' previously revealed Windward Plains, Scarlet Forest, and Oilwell Basin. It also unveiled new monster Hirabami - an ice-dwelling leviathan with the ability to float and a pincer-style tail - alongside confirmation of two more returning monsters: the spider-like Nerscylla and the Gore Magala, first seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> 4.
</p>
<p>
Capcom also took a few moments to hightlight some of Wilds' customisation features. It will, for instance, be possible to customise your pop-up camp, adjusting its layout, adding furniture, changing tent patterns and colours, selecting background music, and more. That's alongside the ability to alter your Seikret's colours and decorations as the story progresses.

Elsewhere, fashion fans can delight in the news layered armour is now automatically registered whenever players craft its original High Rank counterpart, rather than having to unlock it through other means. Show-offs won't be using Guild Cards to display their style choices this time around, however; they've been replaced with Hunter Profiles, promising "more features than ever". Capcom also confirmed a photo mode - with settings including camera view and depth of field - that'll pause the game when used in online single-player mode.
</p><p>
That single-player online mode - designed for people who want to play without joining a lobby, and which can temporarily be turned to multiplayer by firing off an SOS flare - is one of the features that'll debut in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/obt/">two upcoming open betas</a>, alongside private lobbies and a new base camp training area for solo play.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, open beta players can confront Monster Hunter Wilds' new flagship monster Arkveld, AKA the White Wraith. This fearsome beast features "chain-like appendages extending from its wings", and will be available as part of a "special advanced quest" that's described as being "rather dangerous". February's open beta also includes a new Gypceros hunt, and that's alongside the character creation, story trial, and Doshaguma hunt seen in last year's beta.
</p>
<p>
February's first open beta runs for four days beginning on 6th February at 7pm PT (that's 3am on 7th February in the UK) and its second runs from 13th-16th February, with timings remaining the same. Cross-platform multiplayer is enabled for both tests, and players can transfer their characters (but not their progress) to the full game. Participants also get a bonus pendant and an item pass that'll unlock in the full release. Additionally, Monster Hunter World and Iceborne owners will receive Palico equipment and a Hunter Profile name plate if they pick up Wilds.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 28th February, and Capcom has confirmed it'll start introducing limited-time event quests - featuring "special looks" as rewards - one week after its release. More updates will follow.
