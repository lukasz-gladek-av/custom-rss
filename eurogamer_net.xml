            <p>Independent studio Longdue has shed more light on its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successor, now officially known as Hopetown.</p>
<p>Londue comprises former staff from Disco Elysium, as well as industry veterans with credits on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a> and The Witcher universe. The studio's debut project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">first teased towards the end of last year</a>, although details remained scant.</p>
<p>Now, Longdue has announced the crowdfunding pre-launch for Hopetown, a game it says will redefine "the psychological RPG genre with groundbreaking mechanics and a world shaped by your words".</p>

<p>Want to know more? Well, words are your "deadliest weapon" in Hopetown, and the choices you make will leave their mark.</p>
<p>"Set in a mining town caught between decay and transformation, shaped by ambition, exploitation, and the fragile systems that bind society together, you step into the role of a rogue journalist - a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel," reads the official blurb. "Unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged, you thrive on poking at bruises, pulling at loose threads, and watching what unravels."</p>
<p>As far as those aforementioned and groundbreaking mechanics, these have been built on those from Disco Elysium and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planescape-torment">Planescape: Torment</a>. In Hopetown, there will be systems that the developer stated will "redefine player agency".</p>
<p>"The psychogeography system transforms how players interact with the game world: emotions, memories, and conversations replace traditional mechanics like keys and levers, becoming the tools that unlock doors, alter landscapes, and reshape relationships," Longdue explained. "Progress isn't just about solving puzzles or finding items - it's about navigating the protagonist's fractured psyche and the ripples it creates in the environment."</p>
<p>Hopetown will also have a new journalism-based RPG system in place. This system will give you the "tools to craft stories that shape the world - and yourself".</p>
<p>As shared by Longdue, there are currently a limited number of registrations for the pre-launch available at <a href="http://www.longduegames.com/">www.longduegames.com</a>. Those that register early will be able to get first access to a limited set of backer rewards when the campaign goes live.</p>

<p>Hopetown is not the only Disco Elysium spiritual successor in the works. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">XXX Nightshift will be the first project from Dark Math Games</a>, a studio describing itself as a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium".</p>
<p>A report from November last year took <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/messy-drama-behind-disco-elysiums-multiple-spiritual-successors-detailed-in-new-report">a closer look at the various Disco Elysium spiritual successor games</a>, and outlined a convoluted web of connections, fallouts, and legal action, suggesting the beloved RPG's legacy remains as messy as ever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ubisoft has detailed the various steps it took to improve <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> during the game's high-profile four-month delay from last October to (after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">further date change</a>) its now-final release on 20th March. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer's Katharine Castle in Quebec, members of Shadows' development team confirmed the game's narrative had not seen any adjustments, with improvements focused on systems and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
"There's a lot of things across the board," game director Charles Benoit told Eurogamer, "the progression, how we tweak the systems, tutorials, the feeling of hitting with the sword, FX camera. So a lot of small details, but overall makes the experience better."

<p>
Benoit went on to give a clear example of one such change, which involved parkour atop the game's Japanese roof architecture. 
</p>
<p>
"The roofs [have] so much detail with a lot of different parts here and there," Benoit said. "Before the push [into 2025] the parkour worked, but going on a beam stance and then transition[ing], it didn't feel fluid enough. So we did a lot of tweaking on how we create the collision and everything. The parkour is a lot more fluid, the transition is faster."
</p>
<p>
Asked if any story elements in Shadows had changed based on feedback to the game's early marketing, associate narrative director Brooke Davies confirmed they had not.
</p>
<p>
"No, we did not [change anything]," Davies said. "The extra time was used for polish on gameplay."

Eurogamer has a raft of Assassin's Creed Shadows preview coverage now live after an extended hands-on play session with the game. Read on for our thoughts of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">how Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping up to be the series' biggest shake-up in years</a>, plus deeper dives into its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-turned-my-assassins-creed-shadows-hideout-into-a-personal-cat-and-tanuki-sanctuary-human-allies-be-damned">all-new base-building gameplay</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animus-hub-revealed-ubisofts-new-assassins-creed-start-screen-and-modern-day-story-wrapper-thats-definitely-not-just-another-launcher">mysterious Animus Hub</a>.
</p><p>Last year, Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">the delay to Shadows had been necessary to  change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality"</a>. Speaking at an event attended by Eurogamer, Coté acknowledged his team had "only... one shot" at ensuring the game was successful from launch.</p>
